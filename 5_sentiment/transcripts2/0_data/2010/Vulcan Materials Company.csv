Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results and our outlook for 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan, and",2593,"Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results and our outlook for 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan, and we hope our remarks and dialogue will be helpful to you. A replay of this conference call will be available later today at our website. With me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our Senior Vice Presidents in our Construction Materials Group.Before I begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.I'd like to begin my remarks by discussing our fourth quarter and full-year results, and then give some comments about how we think 2010 could be another year of solid cash generation. The fourth quarter of 2009 presented a very tough operating environment due to a combination of the weak construction economy and significantly adverse weather in most of our markets. As a result, sales volumes in the fourth quarter were sharply lower than the prior year. Nevertheless, we achieved EBITDA of $99 million and cash earnings of $67 million in the quarter.Fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $13 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Aggregate shipments declined 23% compared to the prior year fourth quarter, which reduced our EBITDA approximately $69 million from last year. Extremely wet weather in the quarter contributed to lower shipments in key markets in the mid-Atlantic states, in the Southeast, in the Midwest and in the Southwest. 10 of the 12 major metropolitan areas served by Vulcan experienced more than twice the number of wet workdays of a year ago. The most notable effects were in Charlotte, Washington DC, Chicago, Atlanta, Birmingham and San Antonio.Additionally, aggregate shipments were negatively affected by the uncertainty regarding the timing and duration of an extension of the federal highway program, which expired September 30, 2009. Construction activity on stimulus-funded highway projects varied widely in 2009 across the country. And in certain key Vulcan states, stimulus spending lagged the rest of the country.The average unit sales price for aggregates increased 5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting price improvement in most of the Vulcan-served markets. Markets on the lower end of the range of price increases was California, where the average selling price improved 1%, and Texas and Florida where pricing declined 1% and 3% respectively. Price improvement from the prior year's fourth quarter benefited somewhat from a more favorable product mix, reflecting proportionally greater levels of aggregates used for highway construction, particularly pavement improvement.Our managers continue to mitigate some of the cost pressures caused by these significantly lower volumes. They maintained production efficiency and reduced cash fixed cost, an additional 8% below last year's fourth quarter. Shipments in asphalt and ready-mix concrete declined 12% and 31% respectively from the prior year's fourth quarter due to the same economic factors affecting aggregates. Fourth quarter segment earnings were lower than the prior year due to lower volumes and to lower material margins in both products.Selling, administrative and general expenses in the fourth quarter declined $6 million from the prior year. This year-over-year decline in overhead cost is due primarily to reductions in employee-related expenses, which more than offset a year-over-year increase in project cost of $2.6 million related to the replacement of our legacy IT systems. Additionally, the current year's fourth quarter included expenses of $8.5 million for the fair market value of donated real estate. The prior year's fourth quarter result included $5.1 million for similar transactions. Excluding the effects of donated real estate, SAG expenses declined 11% versus the prior year's fourth quarter.The difference between the fair value of the donated real estate and the carrying value, which was $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, are recorded as a gain on sale of property plant and equipment. Employment levels across the company at the end of the fourth quarter are down 11% from the prior year. This reduction in employment across the company is a result of a continued focus on adjusting our production levels and our cost structure to match the weak demand environment, as well as to the early effects associated with the rollout of our new shared services IT platform.Before making some comments on our outlook for 2010, let me highlight some aspects of our full-year results that may be of interest. In 2009, our efforts to tightly manage cost and to maintain price discipline offset some of the earnings effect from lower sales volumes. Full year net earnings were $30 million, while cash earnings were $369 million from continuing operations, and an additional $12 million from discontinued operations. The decrease in aggregate shipments reduced full-year earnings by $334 million. Aggregates pricing increased 3% in 2009, reflecting the attractive fundamentals of our businesses in most of our markets even in this difficult economic environment. Finally, let me highlight our cash generation during 2009. Free cash flow in 2009 was $343 million, a significant increase from the $82 million realized last year. This increase in cash was due to our sharp focus on effectively managing those aspects of cash flow that we can control or influence. Additionally, we reduced total debt in 2009 by $810 million, reflecting cash generation from operations augmented by proceeds from the June equity offering.Overall, the factors contributing to a challenging outlook for construction activity are principally the continued weakness in private nonresidential construction activity, and the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of continued funding for the federal multi-year highway program. Highway funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act were portioned in the first week of March 2009. Since May, stimulus-related funding has increased highway construction awards significantly. For the 12 months ending December 2009, awards for new highway projects in the U.S. were up 7% versus the prior year. Record-setting awards from May to August when contract awards exceeded $6 billion each month reflected good initial progress by the state transportation agencies and starting shovel-ready projects intended to stimulate construction activity and create jobs.As a result, during the second half of 2009, aggregate shipments in some Vulcan-served states such as Illinois and Tennessee, were relatively stronger than in other states due in part to more rapid spending of stimulus-related funding. Other key Vulcan-served states such as Florida, Virginia, California and Georgia lagged other states in awarding in starting stimulus-related highway construction in 2009. And as a result, aggregate shipments in these states have yet to benefit as much from stimulus funding.The varied spending patterns for stimulus projects in individual states depend on several factors, including the number of projects each state had that were shovel-ready soon after the funds were appropriated. The types of construction projects that each state has elected to pursue, and whether the projects are in large urban areas involving Metropolitan Planning Organizations, where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time-consuming.In the fourth quarter, however, contract awards for highway construction in Vulcan-served states increased 13% from the prior year compared to a 2% increase in other states. We are optimistic by the increased award activity and are encouraged that stimulus-related highway projects in Vulcan-served states after a slow start are now moving forward and will benefit demand for our products in 2010. As a result, we continue to believe that 2010 will be the biggest year for stimulus-related highway construction followed by another solid year in 2011.Overall, our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipments reflects a 10% to 15% increase in aggregates going into highway and other infrastructure related construction activity due primarily to stimulus-related funding. And assuming that the FY '10 budgeted levels for the regular highway spending are approved by Congress within the next few weeks.While we have assumed that regular highway funding for highways will remain at an annualized level consistent with FY 2009 under SAFETEA-LU, Congress will need to act quickly to restore fiscal year 2010 funding levels and contract authority prior to the start of the construction season this spring. Then if leadership is working to introduce its first jobs bill of this session, which in its most recent draft includes restoration of FY '10 authorized highway funding at $42 billion as previously budgeted, and which provides for an extension of that funding until December 31, 2010.As part of the package, Senate leadership is working with key Republicans on the Finance and the Environmental and Public Works committees to also return some $20 billion to the Highway Trust Fund in the form of interest previously owed to the fund. We are cautiously optimistic that this bill can pass the Senate. This would be a very important step to put the nation on the path to long-term highway funding stability, will occur with the ultimate passage of a multi-year highway bill. The Senate has already passed the jobs bill in December containing similar provisions as they relate to the Highway Trust Fund.Residential construction activity should increase year-over-year in 2010, albeit from very low levels. Starting in November, single-family housing starts broke a string of 43 consecutive months of year-over-year declines. While this is only two months of data, it is encouraging and coupled with improving affordability numbers which we see across all of our markets, declining inventory levels and attractive interest rate levels, we believe there is room for some optimism in single-family housing construction in 2010 and beyond. For 2010, we expect aggregate shipments in the residential construction to increase 15% to 20% from 2009 levels. For non-residential buildings, we expect construction activity to remain weak in 2010. Less [ph] contract awards for stores and office buildings declined 62% and 63% respectively in 2009, while public buildings declined more modestly, down only 16% reflecting some impact from stimulus funding.In Vulcan-served states, the declining contract awards in 2009 was similar to the U.S. as a whole. As a result, the year-over-year percentage decline in Vulcan-aggregate shipments from nonresidential construction including both privately-financed and publicly-financed sources is expected to be down 15% to 20% in 2010. As a result, Vulcan's total aggregate shipments are expected to be flat to up 5% from 2009 levels, due mostly to an increase in aggregates used in highway construction and some improvement in housing. For the full year 2010, we expect aggregate pricing to improve 2% to 3%. Higher aggregate volumes and pricing in 2010 should more than offset a projected 20% increase in cost for diesel fuel. In 2009, our average cost for diesel fuel was $1.94 per gallon. In 2010, we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of diesel fuel consumption, a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by $4 million per year.In our Asphalt business, we expect sales volumes to increase approximately 5% from 2009 levels. Pricing for asphalt mix is expected to increase from 2009 levels, but not enough to offset projected higher prices for liquid asphalt and aggregates. As a result, we expect lower materials margins in asphalt when compared with 2009.In Concrete, we expect sales volumes to remain flat with the prior year and pricing to decline modestly, reflecting continued weakness in private nonresidential construction. We expect full-year SAG expense in 2010 to be slightly lower than 2009 due to continuing cost reduction efforts, as well as lower costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems. As discussed previously, we have a major project underway to implement new integrated systems and processes to replace our legacy IT systems. Along with legacy system replacement, we are also redesigning related administrative support functions to reduce cost and improve service. The project is proceeding as planned. To date, we have successfully installed our new financial systems at the corporate office and in three of our non-operating divisions. Total cost for this project peaked in 2009 as most of the design and development work was completed. Implementation will continue into 2010.We expect 2010 to be the final year of significant spending with net expense reductions occurring thereafter. We expect SAG costs related to the ERP project to be approximately $3 million less in 2010 than they were in 2009. Cash interest expense for the full year is expected to be approximately $175 million based on the current level of interest rates, and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We will continue to tightly manage capital spending and as a result, expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010, up slightly from the $110 million we spent in 2009, but down sharply from the $353 million in 2008. Discontinued operations earnings will benefit from a projected $10 million of cash proceeds in 2010 as part of the 5CP earn-out. This earn-out was included as part of the divestiture of our Chemicals business several years ago and will end in 2012.Finally, I'd like to provide an update regarding recent permitting activity in the Lake Belt in South Florida. Last week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued its record of decision in support of mining in the Lake Belt region. Simultaneously, the Corps of Engineers began moving ahead with issuing permits [ph]. Vulcan should receive its new permit within the next two weeks. Based on the record of decision, the company expects that its permits will be for a period of 20 years, will cover 940 acres and will allow mining in excess of $80 million tons of limestone.In closing, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our aggregates focus business, which has a compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future. The current construction economy is weak. But the economic stimulus plan will help our earnings growth at Vulcan over the next two to three years. Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion of stimulus-related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27 billion for highways and bridges in Vulcan-served states.The key determinant of highway construction spending for years to come is of course the multi-year federal highway program which represents a substantial growth opportunity for Vulcan. We, along with many business, industry and labor groups, are urging Congress to act promptly to sustain the momentum from the $27.5 billion provided for highways and bridges by the economic stimulus plan. In order to add and save construction jobs in 2010, this broad coalition is currently urging Congress for a formal extension of baseline highway funding at the FY '10 budgeted level of $42 billion. We're also urging Congress to do this in time to impact the 2010 construction season. Such legislation will then set the stage later in the year for the development and enactment of the next multi-year surface transportation program.We're the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well-positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. Now, the operator will give the required instructions. We'll be happy to respond to your questions."

And certainly, the flow of bid lettings and contract awards has been severely impacted by the expiration of the regular multi-year highway program on September 30, 2009 and the, shall I say, distraction of Congress over other matters, including in particular healthcare. They've just not gotten to it. The result is, and this period has been worse than prior periods, the funding extensions are only at a level of about $2 billion a month whereas the regular, the budget is for something like $3.6 billion a month spread equally across year. So there are two big impacts: Number one, the amount of money being appropriated has been substantially reduced and there are a lot of technical reasons for that, all of which would be fixed by the bill now pending in the Senate and the one that has been passed in the house; and secondly, the DOT just said, we're going to build an award stimulus project. But until there's some clarity in Washington about whether the U.S. is going to have a highway program, a regular multiyear program, it makes absolutely no sense for us to have bid lettings and award new contracts. And that's been going on since midyear 2009. That's why it's so important that Congress address that issue now before we lose the 2010 construction season."

So that part's okay. I think to actually get a fully-funded new six-year federal highway bill, there will need to be some revenue streams, the existing revenue streams will have to grow as a result of economic recovery. And then all likelihood, there will need to be some incremental revenue streams dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund. I think that the practical reality isn't until the economy begins to recover, it is very unlikely that Congress or the administration is going to advocate any higher fuel tax or other incremental revenue streams on the Highway Trust Fund. But that's why we think getting the extension through the end of 2010 is the important first step. And then hopefully, beginning later this year, perhaps in the fourth quarter, the conversation about the next six-year bill and funding that bill will become a key topic."

And secondly, the amount of money currently available for reimbursement to the states is reduced as a result of the -- even though it's in the budget for 2010, because of the technical problems that need to be solved by Congress, that 2010 budgeted number is simply not available to the state DOTs except in a substantially-reduced level. So it is a legislative problem that normally gets fixed. I think healthcare, as I said earlier has diverted the attention and has obviously polarized Congress. And so we're hopeful that this Senate portion of the jobs bill which they are breaking into individual pieces, we think. The piece that will contain the restoration and the correction of the Highway Trust Fund, hopefully will be the first significant piece of bipartisan legislation that gets passed. But the snowstorms in Washington have slowed that activity somewhat but it's on the agenda. And hopefully, stay tuned over the next two to three weeks and see how that moves."

But that doesn't mean that there won't be some further judicial proceedings there. One of the other aspects, one of the things the core did to address some of the concerns raised in the prior litigation was to take a larger setbacks between the areas to be mined in the Lake Belt and the Everglades. And that has taken some slice of the reserve from the long-term Lake Belt mining out of the picture. That will all become clearer, I think, once the remaining permits get issued. But at this point, mining will be able to resume under the new permits and the Lake Belt, as you know, it's been shut down for most of 2009. And we'll go from there. Demand, of course, remains very weak so there's not a huge incentive to crank production up to high levels by any of the producers we don't believe. But we'll monitor that. But at this point, I would expect as the construction season moves forward, we will all see a resumption of production in the Lake Belt quarries."

We were very happy to see our pricing in California be up 1%, which was good news after some periods of declining pricing. California has very good, in absolute terms, pricing for aggregates and that helped. I think as we indicated, the mix going into stimulus projects and shovel-ready projects is highly focused on bedroll [ph] specked of asphalt stone as opposed to a lot of base material, and also relatively lower specked material that would be going into housing and things like that. So there was a mixed shift in 2009 compared to our historical. There will be a mixed shift in 2010 compared to 2009 and our historical. And I think the mixed shift is moving toward highway construction, which is our sweet spot. And for companies that are more focused on concrete, it's a tougher environment for pricing as I've tried to indicate in our earlier -- we have to keep our concrete customers competitive. So it's a market-by-market, product-by-product, customer-by-customer challenge. And our guys have done a really good job looking for places where we can still get modest price increases and I think that's reflected in our numbers in the quarter and for the full year."

And the ability to do that from quarry to quarry depends in part on the geologic formation and depends in part on the plant design and construction and depends in part on the operating expertise of the plant folks, the plant manager and the area manager and the people who work in the plants. So it is clear to us that we need to focus our efforts on managing our production processes to maximize the production of what's currently in demand and minimize the production of what's not. And at this point, we don't see any material impact on our financial results from the shift in demand, but that just hadn't happened automatically. That's been a result of a hell of a lot of focus of people who know how to run plants different ways. And I can assure you, I'm not very helpful in that regard. But thank goodness, there are a lot of people in our organization who are. And Kathryn, the overwriting inventory guidance throughout the company has been, if in doubt, managed the facility for cash generation. So we have at every turn opted to wherever possible, not spend the cash to keep the dollars invested and inventory low, even though to put some inventory on the ground would boost short-term GAAP reported earnings. And that's a real focus. I want to reiterate what Dan said and that's an excellent point. Building excess inventories doesn't generate cash, it consumes cash. It does help your GAAP earnings, so we're really focused on cash and we do that historically but we have really focused on that issue in this downturn."

So those will likely, we will hopefully see the results of those beginning in Q2 when a lot of the stimulus work that was slow coming out of the box in a lot of our key states begins to happen. It's really interesting to look at the level of stimulus spending state-by-state as a percentage of the total and look at what happen to our aggregates volumes in those states. And two of our strongest markets in the second half of 2009 were Tennessee and Illinois. And when you look at the stimulus spending as a percent of the total in those two states, they were among the highest in the country. There were some other Northern states like in New England and the upper Midwest that also had high spend out numbers. But the warm weather states, who were for various and sundry reasons, doing different counts of work or doing more work in cities rather than rural areas, Florida and California, in particular, but also as we've pointed out, Georgia and Virginia. The vast majority of their spending is in front of them. The different spend out patterns is certainly showing up in our markets, both plus and minus."

The issue with asphalt is what liquid asphalt prices are going to do. It's very much the same as with diesel fuel, and that's affected so much by the global economy and by demand for co-products. So at this point, we're projecting, at least in our outlook, we're projecting much higher or significantly higher liquid asphalt cost in 2010. Hopefully, that is somehow mitigated during the course of the year. But at this point, we're looking to higher numbers. But demand for asphalt is expected to be up. The relationship between the cost of liquid asphalt and our ability to pass that through in pricing and the timing differential between those two areas, basically, we have to buy liquid asphalt now almost on a spot basis and we price our material on a contract basis. And so, there's often a lag between our ability to pass through increases. And when liquid asphalt falls, it improves our margins because we have priced at higher numbers and the actual spot price goes down. So that's really the story on asphalt. Concrete and cement is a function of demand. And demand for both of those products are low because private non-res construction is down. Hopefully, some strength in housing will, in 2010, will help demand retreat and therefore, cement. But until we start seeing significant recovery in housing and see a bottoming of private non-res construction, concrete markets are tough and there's no way around that."

The tail end of your question asked whether or not we would be shutting some of those operations down because of low margins. Let me remind you that virtually, every asphalt and concrete operation that we have is tied to a Vulcan aggregate plant and we're selling Vulcan aggregates through those operations. So the decisions to operate or shut down one of those downstream facilities have to include the impact it has back on our Aggregates business. And just to put it in perspective, in 2009, the Asphalt and Concrete segment numbers had an EBITDA margin of around 14%. But embedded in that is the aggregates that are used to produce that product that we also produced, and our Aggregates segment had an EBITDA margin of around 38% or 39%. So there's a significant pull through of aggregates profitability tied to those operations. So the decision to operate or shut down the plant is not solely based on the reported margin for asphalt or concrete."

Because when you get down to the relatively small numbers that we're reporting right now and you consider some of the permanent differences that this industry enjoys, specifically statutory depletion, thinking about a tax rate in percentage terms is pretty difficult. The way I would advise you to think about it is more in dollar terms and let me just try to give you a little color. 2009 and I'll talk here about the full-year numbers, not the fourth quarter. But we reported a pretax loss of $19 million for the full year and we reported tax benefit of $38 million. The reason for that is that our Aggregates business is still profitable and still handsomely, profitable and still generates a significant statutory depletion benefit, which is a permanent difference. It's essentially a tax credit that can be applied back against previous tax payments or carried forward against future tax payments. So we still record that. That was the $20 million benefit that we enjoyed in 2009. And then in 2009, there was about another $5 million of tax benefit that's ongoing, if you will, referable to accounting for our foreign operations. And another $5 million or $6 million of a couple of other items that again are generally ongoing. So what will happen in the future is assuming our Aggregates business rebounds, we'll get some incremental margin from that obviously. We'll generate some incremental tax on that at the normal 38%, 39% kind of a rate. But we will also get a sizable amount of additional depletion benefit to offset some of that regular tax. So I think the way to model it is this kind of roll forward from where we were in 2009 and almost do a line-by-line kind of an estimate of the big components. And the really big components that are going to drive the tax provision in dollars year-over-year will be depletion benefit and tax at the marginal rate, kind of offsetting each other. When volume comes back a little bit, we'll get back into a more steady state world where the tax rate and percentage terms is more meaningful. But right now, in percentage terms, it doesn't tell you much."

If you look at what we call our variable margin, which is the difference between average selling price and our variable costs. And again, the variable costs in our definition is all cash costs. Whether you're looking at the fourth quarter or the full year in comparisons to the same period in 2008, what you see is our variable margin is basically flat. If you go a little deeper into the income statement and look at our cash margin, this for aggregates, look at our cash margin for aggregates, and the difference there is the selling price, less our total cash cost. So you're factoring in now the effect of what we would characterize as cash fixed costs. You see that for the full year, we have at 1.5 to 2 percentage point margin shrink. And I mentioned earlier, the phenomenon is, that for the year, our unit shipments were down 26% and our cash fixed costs were down about 14%. So you have that leverage, that adverse leverage effect of that's really volume driven that's offsetting the full effect of the average pricing increase. And then of course if you go down to the gross profit as we reported it just now, the big effect on margin change there is going to be just much less absorption of the non-cash depreciation expense."

I think the message in the fourth quarter and for the full year is markets are weak, Vulcan's management team is focused on doing what we can to generate cash and manage our business effectively and position ourselves to be able to respond very positively when there is some increase in overall demand as we look forward to 2010, that is most likely to come from public infrastructure projects, particularly stimulus projects, with some kicker for hopefully improvement in housing construction. Private non-res continues to be weak. Overall, I think we are well-positioned to benefit significantly once we start to see some overall volume growth. Hopefully, we will see that by the end of -- when we report earnings at the end of 2010. But that's the real key to earnings recovery and earnings growth for Vulcan is some recovery in volumes in our markets. We are working hard to both manage our production operations, our sales and marketing strategy and in this climate, our government relations efforts to try to get some stability in the federal highway funding. So thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan and your attendance today in this conference call. Have a good day."

Thank you for joining this conference to discuss Vulcan's first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior V",1883,"Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference to discuss Vulcan's first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our two Senior Vice Presidents in our Construction Materials Group.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
To start our conference call, I will make some brief comments related to the general economy and the effects of the economy on our business prospects, as well as our first quarter results and outlook. And then, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Economic measures that broadly track U.S. economy indicate that economy is stabilizing and beginning to grow. GDP and industrial production had been improving since the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, every Vulcan-served state but one reported growth in gross state product in the third quarter of 2009, a marked improvement from the first quarter of 2009 when each of these states reported declines from the previous quarter. In the most recent data for the fourth quarter of 2009, every Vulcan-served state reported growth in gross state product. Virginia and California, both important states for Vulcan, reported some of the largest percentage improvements in gross state product. 
In past economic cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of economic recovery. As a result of these historical trends and current measures showing economic improvement, our confidence is growing that many of our markets have stabilized, and that aggregate shipments will improve for the remainder of 2010. Having said this, our first quarter results masked this economic improvement because of the extremely wet weather and record snowfall in January and February across many of our markets. 
Overall, first quarter aggregate shipments declined 14% from the prior year. However, the monthly trends within the quarter were quite different. In January and February, construction activity and demand for our products were slowed by extremely cold and wet weather and record snowfall. In those two months, shipments of aggregates declined 25% as compared to the first two months of 2009. 11 of the 23 major metropolitan areas served by Vulcan experienced at least twice the number of wet weather days compared to a year ago. The most notable effects were in Charlotte, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Orlando, Houston and San Antonio. However, measuring less weather days alone does not fully capture the effects of the record cold and snowfall experienced in several key markets. Accumulation of snow can have a lingering effect on construction activity, if temperatures remain cold delaying the return of dry conditions.
In March, we experienced more normal weather patterns and demand for our products recovered. Aggregate shipments in March increased 4% compared to March of last year, the first year-over-year monthly increase we have seen in four years. This pattern continued in April, as total aggregate shipments were 9% higher than the prior year's level, reflecting increased shipments in most markets. 
The average unit sales price for aggregates increased 1% in the first quarter, reflecting wide variations across Vulcan-served markets. Segment earnings in asphalt were lower than the prior year due mostly to lower selling prices, and a 27% increase in the unit cost for liquid asphalt. Last year's first quarter average unit cost of liquid asphalt was a cyclical low point following the sharp spike up in the fall of 2008 driven by higher energy prices. Our selling prices for asphalt mix were 10% lower than the prior year. Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lag, increasing liquid asphalt costs and further were held in check due to competitive pressures. Segment earnings in concrete declined due to lower selling prices and lower volumes. Cement earnings were higher than the prior year's first quarter due to lower production costs and a 4% increase in sales volumes. 
Our employees have effectively managed the business during this downturn to maximize cash flows. These efforts have not only included minimizing costs, but have also included aggressive management of working capital. 
Total inventory of aggregates at the end of the first quarter was reduced $32 million, or 9% below the prior year's levels. While this action negatively affected GAAP earnings and margins because of the reduced production levels, it increased cash generation and better positions us to benefit from increased production and earnings as demand increases.
My opening remarks included some comments about the macroeconomic indicators that point toward general improvement in the economy, and more importantly, in the states where we operate. Now turning to our outlook, I want to build on that general trend of economic improvement by reviewing contract award data, a leading indicator of demand for our products. 
Contract awards for highway construction have been strongest among the four major end markets. In the three months ending March 31, 2010, contract awards for highways in Vulcan-served states were up 37% from the prior year. The momentum of stimulus-related funding for highways help support this sharp growth in contract awards for highways in our states. We expect that momentum to continue through the remainder of 2010 and all of 2011.
As of the end of March 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately 74% of the total stimulus funds obligated for highways remains unspent. Regular federal funding for highways and contract authorities was restored through the HIRE Act signed into law in March. This law extends authorized funding for Federal Highway programs through the end of 2010 to an annualized level consistent with fiscal year 2009. The combination of stimulus funding and authorized highway funding puts funds available for key highway projects around the country at record levels, and helps set the stage for a healthy baseline of ongoing highway funding when the highway bill is ultimately reauthorized.
The large backlog of highway constructions that is building whether measured broadly by total contract awards for highways or more narrowly by the percent of stimulus-related work yet to be completed, bodes well for aggregates demand from highways in 2010 and 2011. Contract awards for residential construction have also increased sharply in recent months, albeit from a low base. 
In the three months ending March 31, 2010, contract awards for single-family housing increased 41% from the prior year. In Florida and California, where residential construction experienced some of the steepest declines, single-family starts were up 65% and 35%, respectively in the three months ending March 31. 
For non-residential buildings, we expect construction activity to remain weak in 2010. U.S. contract awards for stores and office buildings declined 62% and 63%, respectively in 2009. While public buildings declined more modestly only 16%, reflecting some impact from stimulus funding.
In the three months ending March 31, 2010, the rate of decline in contract awards slowed. This end market remains weak, however, and will continue to be a drag on the full year aggregate shipments. Due mostly to the level of contract awards for highway construction in our states, we expect aggregate shipments in the remaining three quarters of 2010 to be 4% to 10% higher than the prior year. Overall, Vulcan's total aggregate shipments are expected to be flat to up 5% from 2009 levels. 
Our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipments reflects a 10% to 15% increase in aggregate shipments going into highway and other infrastructure-related construction activity, due primarily to stimulus-related funding. We expect aggregate shipments in the residential construction to increase 10% to 15% from 2009 levels.
For the full year of 2010, we now expect aggregate pricing to be flat to up 2%, reflecting pressure on pricing in certain markets. Higher aggregate volumes in pricing in 2010 should offset the earnings impact of a projected increase in cost for diesel fuel. In 2009, our average cost for diesel fuel were $1.94 per gallon. For the full year, we now expect the unit cost for diesel fuel to increase approximately 36%. In 2010, we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of consumption, a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by about $4 million per year. 
In our Asphalt business, we expect sales volumes in the remaining nine months of 2010 to increase from the prior year, offsetting the 9% decline reported in the first quarter. As a result, full year asphalt volumes in 2010 are expected to be flat with the prior year. Pricing for asphalt mix is expected to be flat compared with 2009 levels, while unit costs for liquid asphalt are projected to continue to increase from current levels. As a result, we expect lower material margins for the full year in asphalt when compared with the prior year. 
In concrete, we expect sales volume to remain flat with the prior year and pricing to decline modestly, reflecting continued weakness in private non-residential construction. In our Cement business, we expect earnings to improve modestly from the prior year on slightly higher shipments. We expect full year SAG expenses in 2010 to be slightly lower than 2009, due to continuing cost reduction efforts, as well as lower cost related to the replacement of our legacy IT systems.
Cash interest expense for the full year is expected to be approximately $175 million based on current level of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We will continue to tightly manage capital spending and as a result, expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010, up slightly from the 2010 we spent in 2009 and down sharply from the $353 million in 2008.
Finally, I'd like to provide an update regarding permitting activity in the Lake Belt in Florida. In late January, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued its record of decision in support of mining in the Lake Belt region. Simultaneously, the Corps of Engineers began moving ahead with issuing new permits. Vulcan received its new permit in March of this year. Our permit is for a period of 20 years. It covers 940 acres, and allows us to mine in excess of 80 million tons of limestone.
In closing, I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our aggregates-focused business, which has a compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future. 
Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion in stimulus-related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. 
We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well-positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. 
Now the operator will give us the required instruction, and we'll be happy to respond to your questions."

And certainly, there's pressure on both construction contracts, which backs up into asphalt mixed prices. I think the wildcard is the timing of liquid asphalt costs compared it to the ability to pass those through. In the first quarter of 2009, we had a period of declining liquid asphalt costs, but contract pricing that reflected much higher cost. So we were in a sweet spot on the asphalt margin. We're not in such a sweet spot now because we've got business contracted at basically fixed rates, and we're receiving rising liquid asphalt costs. That will flip, it's just a matter of time. But we're in a probably a trough in terms of asphalt margins compared to being at a relatively high peak in the quarter a year ago."

I think one of the really important things for analysts to understand about Q1 is that we cut way back on production in Q1, partly because weather made production terribly difficult and expensive. But secondly, we made a conscious decision to reduce production and ship out of inventories and if you file accounting, that hurts GAAP earnings. But it certainly positions us as we move forward to get the benefit of the GAAP earnings benefit of increased production, along with increased shipments. So if you look at our inventory numbers, particularly in aggregates, you see we have reduced our inventory of aggregates. We will get to replace that by production in the second quarter, in the third quarter, which will greatly improve our earnings. So shipping out of inventory hurts GAAP earnings, but as you produce and ship at comparable rates, it really does improve earnings. So hopefully, you all understand that, but that's a real factor in the quarter as we pulled inventories down."

I don't envision there being any movement in Congress until perhaps the lame duck session after the November elections to address a funding source for the next multi-year highway bill. There has been some discussion, I think it's -- maybe off the table now about a carbon tax, which would be collected as a motor fuel tax, but I think that's all dead at this point. So anyway, the discussion continues. We don't see a near-term resolution. And again, we will continue to work hard with our industry associations to try to make the case after the elections that -- by that time, hopefully, the economy will continue to be improving, unemployment rates will be falling and maybe there'll be a case at that point to fund the highway program."

But we think, for example, if you're tracking railcar shipments, much of the material that moves by rail goes into our distribution yards, and then it's sold off those yards to our customers. So there is a lead time or lag time, depending on which way you look at it, between the time a railcar is loaded and the shipment is reported by the railroads and when it shows up into aggregate sales for us. So that is a great leading indicator, but you know it's not an overnight conversion from railcar shipment into aggregate sales. But within a quarter, it ought to show up. So you have to look at the timing of those rail shipments compared to when the quarter ends and when the sales are actually reported. And another factor, of course, will be the regular federal highway program got reinstated in March, and there was no benefit of that in the first quarter in terms of new contract awards because there was no time. Hopefully, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, we'll see the benefit of the re-establishment, if you will, of the regular federal highway program at a $42 billion annual funding level and that will be on top of the stimulus. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, for the next couple of years at least, we're going to see record highway funding in the United States. The downside, of course, is in non-res construction where we're seeing significant continued difficulty, and housing winds up sharply as coming off very low base. So the real story here is highway funding on the upside versus non-res on the downside."

A lot of those houses are being built on already developed lots. If the homebuilders start developing new lots in advance of construction, projections at the latter part of 2010 and '11, we've been very conservative in projecting volume going into housing because of this developed lot phenomenon. But there is an upside, if housing continues to strengthen, particularly in our markets and there's new infrastructure development around lots, I believe that's an upside. The second upside is how quickly the state DOTs get the $42 billion that was reinstated in mid-March in the regular Federal Highway Program out to bid in construction. And if that moves faster than we have projected, then it could show up in 2010 volumes. Certainly, it will show up in 2011 volume, probably carrying over well into '12 given the normal spinned-out level of the regular Federal Highway Program. But I think one telling anecdotal piece that was on the front page of Birmingham News about a week ago, which is consistent with everything we tell our friends in Congress, the Alabama DOT announced that it was moving forward with the contract award for the interchange of new Interstate I22, otherwise called Corridor X, that connects Birmingham and Memphis with I65, which connects Birmingham and Nashville. And the Director of the state DOT said with this month-to-month funding extension from Congress, we couldn't award the contract for that interchange. Now that the $42 billion has been reinstated, we're going to award the contract to build the interchange. And it's tens of millions of dollars of construction. And that's one small example of what we hope we will see with the reauthorization, at least through the end of 2010 on the Federal Highway bill. And as projects like that get bid and let and constructions starts, then there's an upside we think to volume in 2010."

So from September through March, we virtually had almost no regular Federal program. We had a tremendously reduced program in terms of dollars, but the real impact was the DOT sitting on their hands because they didn't have any visibility of funding out of a regular program. So 2010 and '11, when you add up the stimulus spending and the formal extension of the regular Federal Highway Program will be record years in terms of the Federal contribution to spending. We're seeing that in contract awards. What we expect, what will have to happen at the end of 2010 will be some reauthorization of the regular Federal Highway Program, one way or the other. Either through additional appropriations out of the general fund or some other funding mechanism. And as you say, there will be about a third of the stimulus dollars in 2011, with a little bit in 2012. As we look forward, if the numbers that are being talked about from the need side for the Federal Highway Program kicked in, it will be large enough to offset the expiration of the stimulus spending. We're also cautiously optimistic that at some point, banks will actually start lending to real estate developers and we'll see private non-res construction coming out of the trough maybe by 2011, certainly by 2012. So that's how we're sort of seeing the longer-term demand trends. We're not concerned that the world is going to come to an end when the stimulus dollars are finally spent because it's going to be 2012 before we see that drop off. And by that time, hopefully we'll have a regular Federal Highway Program, as well as a recovery in the private sector."

We won't get back, we shouldn't get back to 2 million starts. And it was from a reasonably normalized private non-res level. So as we go forward, we think longer term, housing will not get back to the '05 levels. But Federal highway spending ought to be better than '05 levels, if we get a multiyear program as the kind of numbers all the people say we need. And we can certainly get back, we believe longer term to the level of private non-res spending that we saw in the '04, '05, '06 timeframe. So the down would be from the peak would be housing, the up from the peak would be public infrastructure and highways, and that would include recovery in private non-res. So that's how we sort of see the future. The other side of it is the supply of aggregates in most markets is very hard to expand beyond the levels that people were producing in 2005 simply because everybody was pretty much running at capacity, and there have been not any real capacity expansion. In fact, I expect we'll see more reserve depletion as we move forward. So that's in a very general sense how we see the future, Chris."

Thank you for joining this conference to discuss Vulcan's first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior V",1883,"Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference to discuss Vulcan's first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our two Senior Vice Presidents in our Construction Materials Group.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
To start our conference call, I will make some brief comments related to the general economy and the effects of the economy on our business prospects, as well as our first quarter results and outlook. And then, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Economic measures that broadly track U.S. economy indicate that economy is stabilizing and beginning to grow. GDP and industrial production had been improving since the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, every Vulcan-served state but one reported growth in gross state product in the third quarter of 2009, a marked improvement from the first quarter of 2009 when each of these states reported declines from the previous quarter. In the most recent data for the fourth quarter of 2009, every Vulcan-served state reported growth in gross state product. Virginia and California, both important states for Vulcan, reported some of the largest percentage improvements in gross state product. 
In past economic cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of economic recovery. As a result of these historical trends and current measures showing economic improvement, our confidence is growing that many of our markets have stabilized, and that aggregate shipments will improve for the remainder of 2010. Having said this, our first quarter results masked this economic improvement because of the extremely wet weather and record snowfall in January and February across many of our markets. 
Overall, first quarter aggregate shipments declined 14% from the prior year. However, the monthly trends within the quarter were quite different. In January and February, construction activity and demand for our products were slowed by extremely cold and wet weather and record snowfall. In those two months, shipments of aggregates declined 25% as compared to the first two months of 2009. 11 of the 23 major metropolitan areas served by Vulcan experienced at least twice the number of wet weather days compared to a year ago. The most notable effects were in Charlotte, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Orlando, Houston and San Antonio. However, measuring less weather days alone does not fully capture the effects of the record cold and snowfall experienced in several key markets. Accumulation of snow can have a lingering effect on construction activity, if temperatures remain cold delaying the return of dry conditions.
In March, we experienced more normal weather patterns and demand for our products recovered. Aggregate shipments in March increased 4% compared to March of last year, the first year-over-year monthly increase we have seen in four years. This pattern continued in April, as total aggregate shipments were 9% higher than the prior year's level, reflecting increased shipments in most markets. 
The average unit sales price for aggregates increased 1% in the first quarter, reflecting wide variations across Vulcan-served markets. Segment earnings in asphalt were lower than the prior year due mostly to lower selling prices, and a 27% increase in the unit cost for liquid asphalt. Last year's first quarter average unit cost of liquid asphalt was a cyclical low point following the sharp spike up in the fall of 2008 driven by higher energy prices. Our selling prices for asphalt mix were 10% lower than the prior year. Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lag, increasing liquid asphalt costs and further were held in check due to competitive pressures. Segment earnings in concrete declined due to lower selling prices and lower volumes. Cement earnings were higher than the prior year's first quarter due to lower production costs and a 4% increase in sales volumes. 
Our employees have effectively managed the business during this downturn to maximize cash flows. These efforts have not only included minimizing costs, but have also included aggressive management of working capital. 
Total inventory of aggregates at the end of the first quarter was reduced $32 million, or 9% below the prior year's levels. While this action negatively affected GAAP earnings and margins because of the reduced production levels, it increased cash generation and better positions us to benefit from increased production and earnings as demand increases.
My opening remarks included some comments about the macroeconomic indicators that point toward general improvement in the economy, and more importantly, in the states where we operate. Now turning to our outlook, I want to build on that general trend of economic improvement by reviewing contract award data, a leading indicator of demand for our products. 
Contract awards for highway construction have been strongest among the four major end markets. In the three months ending March 31, 2010, contract awards for highways in Vulcan-served states were up 37% from the prior year. The momentum of stimulus-related funding for highways help support this sharp growth in contract awards for highways in our states. We expect that momentum to continue through the remainder of 2010 and all of 2011.
As of the end of March 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately 74% of the total stimulus funds obligated for highways remains unspent. Regular federal funding for highways and contract authorities was restored through the HIRE Act signed into law in March. This law extends authorized funding for Federal Highway programs through the end of 2010 to an annualized level consistent with fiscal year 2009. The combination of stimulus funding and authorized highway funding puts funds available for key highway projects around the country at record levels, and helps set the stage for a healthy baseline of ongoing highway funding when the highway bill is ultimately reauthorized.
The large backlog of highway constructions that is building whether measured broadly by total contract awards for highways or more narrowly by the percent of stimulus-related work yet to be completed, bodes well for aggregates demand from highways in 2010 and 2011. Contract awards for residential construction have also increased sharply in recent months, albeit from a low base. 
In the three months ending March 31, 2010, contract awards for single-family housing increased 41% from the prior year. In Florida and California, where residential construction experienced some of the steepest declines, single-family starts were up 65% and 35%, respectively in the three months ending March 31. 
For non-residential buildings, we expect construction activity to remain weak in 2010. U.S. contract awards for stores and office buildings declined 62% and 63%, respectively in 2009. While public buildings declined more modestly only 16%, reflecting some impact from stimulus funding.
In the three months ending March 31, 2010, the rate of decline in contract awards slowed. This end market remains weak, however, and will continue to be a drag on the full year aggregate shipments. Due mostly to the level of contract awards for highway construction in our states, we expect aggregate shipments in the remaining three quarters of 2010 to be 4% to 10% higher than the prior year. Overall, Vulcan's total aggregate shipments are expected to be flat to up 5% from 2009 levels. 
Our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipments reflects a 10% to 15% increase in aggregate shipments going into highway and other infrastructure-related construction activity, due primarily to stimulus-related funding. We expect aggregate shipments in the residential construction to increase 10% to 15% from 2009 levels.
For the full year of 2010, we now expect aggregate pricing to be flat to up 2%, reflecting pressure on pricing in certain markets. Higher aggregate volumes in pricing in 2010 should offset the earnings impact of a projected increase in cost for diesel fuel. In 2009, our average cost for diesel fuel were $1.94 per gallon. For the full year, we now expect the unit cost for diesel fuel to increase approximately 36%. In 2010, we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of consumption, a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by about $4 million per year. 
In our Asphalt business, we expect sales volumes in the remaining nine months of 2010 to increase from the prior year, offsetting the 9% decline reported in the first quarter. As a result, full year asphalt volumes in 2010 are expected to be flat with the prior year. Pricing for asphalt mix is expected to be flat compared with 2009 levels, while unit costs for liquid asphalt are projected to continue to increase from current levels. As a result, we expect lower material margins for the full year in asphalt when compared with the prior year. 
In concrete, we expect sales volume to remain flat with the prior year and pricing to decline modestly, reflecting continued weakness in private non-residential construction. In our Cement business, we expect earnings to improve modestly from the prior year on slightly higher shipments. We expect full year SAG expenses in 2010 to be slightly lower than 2009, due to continuing cost reduction efforts, as well as lower cost related to the replacement of our legacy IT systems.
Cash interest expense for the full year is expected to be approximately $175 million based on current level of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We will continue to tightly manage capital spending and as a result, expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010, up slightly from the 2010 we spent in 2009 and down sharply from the $353 million in 2008.
Finally, I'd like to provide an update regarding permitting activity in the Lake Belt in Florida. In late January, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued its record of decision in support of mining in the Lake Belt region. Simultaneously, the Corps of Engineers began moving ahead with issuing new permits. Vulcan received its new permit in March of this year. Our permit is for a period of 20 years. It covers 940 acres, and allows us to mine in excess of 80 million tons of limestone.
In closing, I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our aggregates-focused business, which has a compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future. 
Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion in stimulus-related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. 
We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well-positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. 
Now the operator will give us the required instruction, and we'll be happy to respond to your questions.

I think the wildcard is the timing of liquid asphalt costs compared it to the ability to pass those through. In the first quarter of 2009, we had a period of declining liquid asphalt costs, but contract pricing that reflected much higher cost. So we were in a sweet spot on the asphalt margin. We're not in such a sweet spot now because we've got business contracted at basically fixed rates, and we're receiving rising liquid asphalt costs. That will flip, it's just a matter of time. But we're in a probably a trough in terms of asphalt margins compared to being at a relatively high peak in the quarter a year ago.

I think one of the really important things for analysts to understand about Q1 is that we cut way back on production in Q1, partly because weather made production terribly difficult and expensive. But secondly, we made a conscious decision to reduce production and ship out of inventories and if you file accounting, that hurts GAAP earnings. But it certainly positions us as we move forward to get the benefit of the GAAP earnings benefit of increased production, along with increased shipments. So if you look at our inventory numbers, particularly in aggregates, you see we have reduced our inventory of aggregates. We will get to replace that by production in the second quarter, in the third quarter, which will greatly improve our earnings. So shipping out of inventory hurts GAAP earnings, but as you produce and ship at comparable rates, it really does improve earnings. So hopefully, you all understand that, but that's a real factor in the quarter as we pulled inventories down.

I don't envision there being any movement in Congress until perhaps the lame duck session after the November elections to address a funding source for the next multi-year highway bill. There has been some discussion, I think it's -- maybe off the table now about a carbon tax, which would be collected as a motor fuel tax, but I think that's all dead at this point. So anyway, the discussion continues. We don't see a near-term resolution. And again, we will continue to work hard with our industry associations to try to make the case after the elections that -- by that time, hopefully, the economy will continue to be improving, unemployment rates will be falling and maybe there'll be a case at that point to fund the highway program.

But we think, for example, if you're tracking railcar shipments, much of the material that moves by rail goes into our distribution yards, and then it's sold off those yards to our customers. So there is a lead time or lag time, depending on which way you look at it, between the time a railcar is loaded and the shipment is reported by the railroads and when it shows up into aggregate sales for us. So that is a great leading indicator, but you know it's not an overnight conversion from railcar shipment into aggregate sales. But within a quarter, it ought to show up. So you have to look at the timing of those rail shipments compared to when the quarter ends and when the sales are actually reported. And another factor, of course, will be the regular federal highway program got reinstated in March, and there was no benefit of that in the first quarter in terms of new contract awards because there was no time. Hopefully, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, we'll see the benefit of the re-establishment, if you will, of the regular federal highway program at a $42 billion annual funding level and that will be on top of the stimulus. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, for the next couple of years at least, we're going to see record highway funding in the United States. The downside, of course, is in non-res construction where we're seeing significant continued difficulty, and housing winds up sharply as coming off very low base. So the real story here is highway funding on the upside versus non-res on the downside.

It's easier to estimate on the highway piece and on the other infrastructure piece, which are water and sewer projects, and there's less data available and there's less aggregate intensity on many of those projects than on highway projects. The good news about the highway projects and the stimulus is because of the time frame in which contracts had to be awarded and projects completed. It's very aggregate intensive and we've given some metrics on that in the past. I don't have them in front of me, but it is relatively more aggregate intensive than general highway dollars because less of this money is going to write away acquisition and earth moving and much more to resurfacing and lane additions. We have given that data, and I just don't have it in front of me.

So that's the most efficient time to cut back production and ship out of inventories. So that's what we've done. Q2, Q3, we typically have better weather, better conditions. We're more efficient. So we have shipped out of inventory for two reasons. One is because of production efficiency, and the other is to conserve cash and not have cash tied up in piles of inventory. Now that we expect shipments to improve for the remainder of the year, we can then run our plants at efficient levels in decent weather. So this is what we have been planning for over the last six months. And fortunately, we're well positioned now to get the benefit of improving GAAP earnings and margins from both increased shipments, but also higher production levels.

A lot of those houses are being built on already developed lots. If the homebuilders start developing new lots in advance of construction, projections at the latter part of 2010 and '11, we've been very conservative in projecting volume going into housing because of this developed lot phenomenon. But there is an upside, if housing continues to strengthen, particularly in our markets and there's new infrastructure development around lots, I believe that's an upside. The second upside is how quickly the state DOTs get the $42 billion that was reinstated in mid-March in the regular Federal Highway Program out to bid in construction. And if that moves faster than we have projected, then it could show up in 2010 volumes. Certainly, it will show up in 2011 volume, probably carrying over well into '12 given the normal spinned-out level of the regular Federal Highway Program. But I think one telling anecdotal piece that was on the front page of Birmingham News about a week ago, which is consistent with everything we tell our friends in Congress, the Alabama DOT announced that it was moving forward with the contract award for the interchange of new Interstate I22, otherwise called Corridor X, that connects Birmingham and Memphis with I65, which connects Birmingham and Nashville. And the Director of the state DOT said with this month-to-month funding extension from Congress, we couldn't award the contract for that interchange. Now that the $42 billion has been reinstated, we're going to award the contract to build the interchange. And it's tens of millions of dollars of construction. And that's one small example of what we hope we will see with the reauthorization, at least through the end of 2010 on the Federal Highway bill. And as projects like that get bid and let and constructions starts, then there's an upside we think to volume in 2010.

So from September through March, we virtually had almost no regular Federal program. We had a tremendously reduced program in terms of dollars, but the real impact was the DOT sitting on their hands because they didn't have any visibility of funding out of a regular program. So 2010 and '11, when you add up the stimulus spending and the formal extension of the regular Federal Highway Program will be record years in terms of the Federal contribution to spending. We're seeing that in contract awards. What we expect, what will have to happen at the end of 2010 will be some reauthorization of the regular Federal Highway Program, one way or the other. Either through additional appropriations out of the general fund or some other funding mechanism. And as you say, there will be about a third of the stimulus dollars in 2011, with a little bit in 2012. As we look forward, if the numbers that are being talked about from the need side for the Federal Highway Program kicked in, it will be large enough to offset the expiration of the stimulus spending. We're also cautiously optimistic that at some point, banks will actually start lending to real estate developers and we'll see private non-res construction coming out of the trough maybe by 2011, certainly by 2012. So that's how we're sort of seeing the longer-term demand trends. We're not concerned that the world is going to come to an end when the stimulus dollars are finally spent because it's going to be 2012 before we see that drop off. And by that time, hopefully we'll have a regular Federal Highway Program, as well as a recovery in the private sector.

We won't get back, we shouldn't get back to 2 million starts. And it was from a reasonably normalized private non-res level. So as we go forward, we think longer term, housing will not get back to the '05 levels. But Federal highway spending ought to be better than '05 levels, if we get a multiyear program as the kind of numbers all the people say we need. And we can certainly get back, we believe longer term to the level of private non-res spending that we saw in the '04, '05, '06 timeframe. So the down would be from the peak would be housing, the up from the peak would be public infrastructure and highways, and that would include recovery in private non-res. So that's how we sort of see the future. The other side of it is the supply of aggregates in most markets is very hard to expand beyond the levels that people were producing in 2005 simply because everybody was pretty much running at capacity, and there have been not any real capacity expansion.

Thank you for joining the conference call to discuss our second quarter results and our outlook for the second half of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior",1867,"Good morning. Thank you for joining the conference call to discuss our second quarter results and our outlook for the second half of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
Our second quarter volume growth is encouraging as we look ahead to the second half of 2010 and continuing recovery in demand. The upward trend in aggregate shipments that started in March and continued through the second quarter led to the first year-over-year quarterly increase in shipments in four years. Improvement in the overall economy as well as higher level for contract awards for highway construction and for single-family housing starts provided the catalyst for growth and demand for our products in the second quarter.
The earnings effect of higher volumes in each major product line was more than offset by the settlement of the lawsuit in Illinois, the flooding in Nashville as well as higher energy-related costs and lower pricing. In May, we reached the final settlement in a lawsuit filed in 2001 against Vulcan by the Illinois Department of Transportation. As a result, a $41 million charge was recorded in the second quarter. The suit alleged damage to a 0.9-mile section of the road that bisects our large quarry in McCook, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. 
Excluding this charge and related legal expenses in the second quarter, EBITDA in the second quarter was approximately $138 million versus $168 million in the prior year's quarter. Second quarter segment earnings in aggregates were $122 million compared to $127 million in the prior year. The earnings effects from higher aggregates shipments was more than offset by the effects of a 2% decline in aggregate pricing, a 38% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel and charges associated with record rainfall and flooding in the Nashville area. Over a three-day period in early May, more than 12 inches of rainfall was recorded, most of that total occurring in the first 12-hour period. Aggregate pricing continues to reflect wide variations across Vulcan-served markets.
Some major markets realized price improvement from the prior year's second quarter. Other markets, such as Florida and, to some extent, the Far West, have remained challenging due to reduced demand as well as continued competitive pressures. In a number of long-haul markets served by rail, barge and ship, increased transportation costs due to higher energy costs resulted in lower freight-adjusted selling prices, as these costs were not recovered in second quarter selling prices to customers. 
Aggregate shipments increased 6% from the prior year's second quarter, due primarily to stronger demand from public highway projects and improvement in single-family housing starts. Many Vulcan-served markets realized solid increase in shipments versus the prior year's second quarter. In markets where increased competitive pressures have persisted due to weak demand, such as Florida and, to some extent, the Far West, and in long-haul markets, where competitive pressures have inhibited our ability to recover recent increases in transportation costs due to higher fuel prices, aggregate net sales approximated the prior year's second quarter, while gross profit declined. As a result, the earnings leverage to higher volumes was not realized in these markets. However, in all other Vulcan-served markets representing about 73% of our aggregates volume in the quarter, the higher sales volume resulted in incremental margins of 65% on the incremental sales dollars.
Across most markets, key operating measurements of labor productivity improved from the prior year. In the Nashville, Tennessee area, severe flooding in May closed several of our quarrying operations, reducing Aggregate segment earnings by $3 million. We expect to recover a portion of this from our insurance carriers. 
The average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 38% in the quarter, reducing pretax earnings $8 million. Excluding the impact of higher fuel costs, unit variable production costs for Aggregates declined slightly from the prior year, demonstrating the continued focus of our employees in running our plants efficiently. 
Segment earnings in asphalt were $14 million lower than the prior year, due mostly to lower selling prices and a 26% increase in the unit cost for liquid asphalt. The year-over-year increase in liquid asphalt cost reduced asphalt earnings $9 million. Asphalt volumes increased 2% from the prior-year second quarter. 
Our selling prices for asphalt mix were 5% lower than the prior year. Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lagged increasing asphalt costs and further were held in check due to competitive pressures. 
Segment earnings in concrete declined $3 million from the prior year due to an 11% decline in selling prices. Cement earnings in the second quarter declined $1 million from the prior year as lower average unit selling prices offset higher sales volumes.
Our forecast for aggregates demand in the second half of 2010 continues to reflect an increase in public construction, driven by stimulus-related funding, as well as the formal extension of the Federal Highway bill, which occurred in March of 2010, along with an increase in residential construction, albeit from low levels. Single-family housing starts in the second quarter increased 6% from the prior year in Vulcan-served states. This year-over-year increase follows a 41% increase in Vulcan-served states in the second quarter. As a result, most key states for Vulcan now reflect positive growth in trailing 12-month single-family housing starts.
In private, non-residential construction, the rate of decline in contract awards has slowed in recent months. The start of a recovery in this end market will be influenced by employment growth, business investment and lending activity. The flow of contract awards for highway construction, a leading indicator of future construction activity, has been improving since March of 2009, when stimulus-related funds became available to each state. 
In March of this year, the stimulus-driven improvement in contract awards for highways was accentuated with the passage of the HIRE Act. This legislation formally extended the regular federal highway funding through the end of 2010 and transferred $19.5 billion into the Highway Trust Fund, a balance sufficient, along with projected tax receipts into the trust fund, to maintain current levels of federal funding of $41 billion for highways through 2012, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. As a result, monthly contract awards for highways in the U.S. have remained at high levels, greater than $5 billion per month since January. 
Through the first six months of 2010, contract awards have increased 6% from the prior year. This increase follows last year's first half increase of 7%. In Vulcan-served states, that increase has been more dramatic. During the first six months of 2010, total contract awards for highway construction in Vulcan-served states, including awards for our federal, state and local projects, increased 11% from the prior year. Through 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that only 38% of the $27 billion of total stimulus funds obligated for highways has been spent, which bode well for increased construction activity from federal stimulus spending for the remainder of 2010 and throughout 2011. 
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Fiscal Year 2011 Transportation Housing Appropriations Bill. The House bill provides $45 billion in federal funding for highways, a 10% increase from the FY 2010 level. The Senate will consider its version of the FY '11 appropriations bill after the August recess. This continuation of stimulus-related highway construction activity as well as the prospect for regular federal highway funding through 2012 from a solvent Highway Trust Fund provides the cornerstone of our demand outlook. 
In the second half of 2010, we expect aggregate volumes to be flat to up 5% from the prior year's second half levels on a same-store basis. Overall, pricing for aggregates remains solid, despite the year-over-year decline reported in the second quarter. A number of Vulcan-served markets are still realizing year-over-year price growth, while other markets where pricing has been under competitive pressures or affected by recent increases in transportation costs remain challenging. As a result, we expect aggregate pricing in the second half of 2010 to approximate the prior year. 
Our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipments reflects a 10% to 15% increase in aggregate shipments going into highway and other infrastructure-related construction activity, due primarily to stimulus-related funding. We expect aggregate shipments into residential construction to increase 10% to 15% from 2009 levels and private, non-residential shipments to decrease 15% to 20%.
In the second half of 2010, we expect the average unit cost for diesel fuel to increase slightly from actual year-to-date unit costs. In 2010, we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of diesel fuel consumption, a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by $4 million per year.
In our Asphalt business, we expect sales volumes and segment earnings in the second half of 2010 to approximate the prior year. In Concrete, we expect sales volumes in the second half of 2010 to increase from the prior year and pricing to decline, reflecting continued weakness in private, non-residential construction and competitive pressures. In our Cement business, we expect second half earnings to be a slight loss versus the break-even results recorded in the prior year. 
We expect SAG expense in the second half of 2010 to be flat with the prior year due to continuing cost-reduction efforts as well as lower costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems. Interest expense for full year 2010 is expected to be approximately $175 million, based on the current level of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest capital projects.
After the close of the quarter in early July, we raised $450 million through a syndicated bank term loan at attractive interest rates of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Proceeds of this transaction were used to further improve the company's liquidity position. We will continue to tightly manage capital spending, and as a result, expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010, up slightly from the $110 million spent in 2009 but down sharply from $353 million in 2008.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our Aggregates-focused business, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years in the future. Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion of stimulus-related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27 billion for highways and bridges. We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well-positioned for significant participation in economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. 
We thank you for your continued interest in Vulcan. Now if our Operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions."

A lot of it is stimulus work, and it was priced in the period in the second half of 2009, largely, when stimulus work was about all that was out there, because the regular Federal Highway Program was in limbo. As you know, it expired September 30, and for several months prior to that and all the way up through mid-March of 2010, there was very little in our regular Federal Highway Program. So competition for asphalt as well as aggregates was about as intense as it's been in a long time in the public sector. So I believe the situation is improving from the standpoint of visibility of future demand. But liquid asphalt pricing remains a challenge."

The offsetting factor is the continued decline in non-res construction, primarily private non-res construction. Housing is continuing to pick up in our markets, but it's a relative small portion of total demand. So the balance, here, is the relationship between the improving demand in the highway sector and the continuing decline in the private non-res sector.

But the long-haul, our reported freight-adjusted selling price in long-haul markets was down about $1 a ton. Our actual price to our customers was only down about $0.30 a ton. The other $0.70 is the incremental freight cost that we absorbed as we freight-adjust our reported pricing. So the long-haul markets were significant. And the reality is that there is a lot more capital tied up per ton of aggregate in long-haul markets. You've got to have loading facilities at the quarry. You've got to have a distribution yard and unloading facilities and either investment in transportation assets or hiring those transportation assets. And then you've got more money tied up in working capital in both inventory and receivables. So in a rational world, margins ought to be higher in the long-haul business than in the truck-served markets. Unfortunately, in this market, there's a lot of competitive pressures along the Gulf Coast. And that's resulted in a reduction in our reported pricing. That accounts for about 27% of our volume, that is, the long-haul markets plus Florida and the Far West, being California and Arizona. The other portion of our business, our largely truck-served markets, which was about 73% of our volume in the quarter, did very well. We got, as I said, 65% of contribution margin from the volume growth there. So the challenge for us is to get our pricing caught up in the long-haul markets. And ultimately, California is in reasonably good shape to try to improve our margins in Florida."

Where demand is weak, pricing is weak. Supply and demand in pricing are very alive and well in this industry."

We have certainly been cautious until A) we had the need for it, which, when we are producing roughly people we were at the peak, we don't consume capital at the same rate we do at the peak. So it's natural that our CapEx would be down. I think there are, as you well know, several hurdles yet on the highway side. We've talked about the 2011 Appropriations Bill, which we were pleased with the passage last week in the House of Representatives, it's got to pass the Senate.  As you know, the authorization now runs through the end of this year.  And I think, most importantly is that the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that the balance in the Highway Trust Fund, given the current balance plus the projected receipts are sufficient to maintain a $41 billion regular highway program through 2012. And I think that's a very positive number that gives us optimism that highways will be strong. When you overlay that with the stimulus spending in the remainder of '10 and throughout 2011, highway spending is going to be robust. The real question, then, becomes, when does private non-res bottom so that it's no longer falling? And how quickly will residential begin to recover?

I do expect that they will take it up. We have been told by the Chair of the Environmental and Public Works Committee that they're working hard and will have hearings and try to get something done right after they come back after the August recess. I think the good news is that the Congress can appropriate the $45 billion, which is what the House appropriated, out of the balances in the Highway Trust Fund without having to increase revenue in the near term. That would likely result in the balance in the Highway Trust Fund not being sufficient to take it all the way through the end of 2012. Basically, it would accelerate some spending out of the Highway Trust Fund from 2012 into 2011. But at some point, Congress will have to take up a multi-year highway bill. The reality is that's probably going to be after the November elections. We have had several senior people in both houses indicate that they expect to get it done in 2011, that it would be a multi-year highway bill. But at this point, the thing that is, I think, tangible is that the balance in the Highway Trust Fund is sufficient to maintain a significant federal program through 2012 without any incremental tax receipts. And I think whether Congress decides to accelerate the spending or maintain level spending x the stimulus is the real question."

And I am less certain about private non-res, just simply because we don't see the catalyst in the near term for a change there. But on the highway side, the combination of the reauthorization of the regular Federal Highway Bill in March, the additional money going into the Highway Trust Fund, plus the overlay of the stimulus projects in 2010 and 2011, I think, are the place there's upside. Housing, if you look at housing incrementally month-to-month, you get one picture. If you we look at it this year versus last year, you get a different picture. So we're looking at it this year versus last year, and housing is up. Whether the loss of the tax credit for housing is going to cause a double dip in housing once could speculate, but we don't have that view. We think housing will be stronger in 2010 than it was in 2009, and that will continue well into the future. Housing starts are just so low relative to the amount necessary to replace obsolete housing and to deal with new household formations that we think that's got to move. Plus interest rates are at historic lows, and affordability is at historic high. So we have some optimism with housing, but it's a small part of our business relative to highways."

I think overall, the fact that for the last six months, total highway contract awards including federal, state and local in our markets are up 11%. So without regard to construction-put-in-place numbers, which are backward-looking, the contract awards are forward-looking. And they are positive. Now perhaps a greater portion of that 11% contract awards is coming from federal money contrasted to state and local than we have seen historically, but the net result for us is that total highway contract awards funded from all three sources, state, local and federal are up significantly year-over-year. And that gives us the basis for our optimism of future demand for that sector. Some states have struggled with getting state highway budgets funded and contract awards out the door. Others have done a very significant job. Some states are viewing highway construction as a state-level stimulus. I think Texas has among the largest state highway program in history. Illinois has a large program that, hopefully, will begin to roll out soon. And California's still got a very large state highway program. Notwithstanding all of the budget issues California's got, the state highway program still appears to be very robust going forward."

Put another way, there's very little price elasticity to demand in our markets for our products because our products are a relatively small portion of the total cost of a construction project. That being said, in markets where volumes are down and there is stress on pricing, we have to focus on cost. We have to focus on serving our customers and keeping them competitive. And basically, volume recovery from improvements in the overall demand is really the thing that will allow us to improve price and margin. So our strategy is to keep our customers competitive, be very diligent on cost and be well positioned to take advantage of volume recovery when it occurs. The only place we can affect demand for our product is through public infrastructure funding. And that's an industry effort. But we work very hard in that regard. And we have virtually no impact on demand for our products in the housing and private non-res. But the public infrastructure side is hugely important for us. And we spend a lot of time and energy as a company and as a participant in the larger industry, in trying to build the public policy case for improved infrastructure spending. You may have seen, I believe, there's an article in this week's Time magazine, in fact, talking about how much sense does it make to continue to allow the U.S. infrastructure to decline. And the question is which is more dangerous for the future of the U.S., higher deficits or declining quality of infrastructure? So there's a significant public-policy case to be made. There's got to be an election in November before there's a real opportunity to get anybody to listen to that case."

Part of the issue in the second quarter, and I can't quantify this, but if you think about what's been going on in the Gulf of Mexico throughout the significant portion of the second quarter, the whole oil spill has not enhanced private construction in the Gulf coast markets. That's a big tourism area. And while I don't think we can attribute the totality of weakness in the Gulf to the economic impacts of the oil spill, it nevertheless is there. And I can't quantify it. But if you're somebody thinking about building something on the Texas Gulf coast or the Louisiana or Mississippi or Alabama or Florida Gulf coast, you aren't terribly enthusiastic with this oil spill going on and with the huge drop in tourism and economic activity from fishing and everything else.

Number one, in none of the periods you have looked at historically has the construction economy in the U.S. been as stressed as it has been recently. But I think perhaps more importantly is that the reported pricing in Q2, for us and perhaps everyone else in our industry, is based on price quotes made in the second half of 2009. And if you remember what was happening to volume in the second half of 2009 and, more importantly, what the future prospects for volume were in the second half of 2009, it was a pretty grim situation. Private non-res was falling. Housing was beginning to bottom, but hadn't quite yet bottomed. And there was no Federal Highway bill. All we had was some stimulus work. Hopefully, what you're seeing in Q2 pricing is a result of the economic stresses in the marketplace in the second half of '09. Those aren't behind us fully yet, because private non-res contract awards are still falling, albeit at a lower rate. But the thing that's going to pull us out of this, both volume and price, is the highway programs, to a much lesser extent, housing. And then the real kicker's going to be when private non-res finally bottoms and has some upside. So I don't think this quarter's pricing, and we've tried to indicate this in our press release and in our comments, is it is not a step change or a functional change. It is the result of really tough markets back in the second half of 2009."

Thank you for joining the conference call to discuss our second quarter results and our outlook for the second half of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior",1868,"Good morning. Thank you for joining the conference call to discuss our second quarter results and our outlook for the second half of 2010. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today is Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
Our second quarter volume growth is encouraging as we look ahead to the second half of 2010 and continuing recovery in demand. The upward trend in aggregate shipments that started in March and continued through the second quarter led to the first year-over-year quarterly increase in shipments in four years. Improvement in the overall economy as well as higher level for contract awards for highway construction and for single-family housing starts provided the catalyst for growth and demand for our products in the second quarter.
The earnings effect of higher volumes in each major product line was more than offset by the settlement of the lawsuit in Illinois, the flooding in Nashville as well as higher energy-related costs and lower pricing. In May, we reached the final settlement in a lawsuit filed in 2001 against Vulcan by the Illinois Department of Transportation. As a result, a $41 million charge was recorded in the second quarter. The suit alleged damage to a 0.9 mile section of the road that bisects our large quarry in McCook, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. 
Excluding this charge and related legal expenses in the second quarter, EBITDA in the second quarter was approximately $138 million versus $168 million in the prior year's quarter. Second quarter segment earnings in aggregates were $122 million compared to $127 million in the prior year. The earnings effects from higher aggregates shipments was more than offset by the effects of a 2% decline in aggregate pricing, a 38% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel and charges associated with record rainfall and flooding in the Nashville area. Over a three-day period in early May, more than 12 inches of rainfall was recorded, most of that total occurring in the first 12-hour period. Aggregate pricing continues to reflect wide variations across Vulcan-served markets.
Some major markets realized price improvement from the prior year's second quarter. Other markets, such as Florida and, to some extent, the Far West, have remained challenging due to reduced demand as well as continued competitive pressures. In a number of long-haul markets served by rail, barge and ship, increased transportation costs due to higher energy costs resulted in lower freight-adjusted selling prices, as these costs were not recovered in second quarter selling prices to customers. 
Aggregate shipments increased 6% from the prior year's second quarter, due primarily to stronger demand from public highway projects and improvement in single-family housing starts. Many Vulcan-served markets realized solid increase in shipments versus the prior year's second quarter. In markets where increased competitive pressures have persisted due to weak demand, such as Florida and, to some extent, the Far West, and in long-haul markets, where competitive pressures have inhibited our ability to recover recent increases in transportation costs due to higher fuel prices, aggregate net sales approximated the prior year's second quarter, while gross profit declined. As a result, the earnings leverage to higher volumes was not realized in these markets. However, in all other Vulcan-served markets representing about 73% of our aggregates volume in the quarter, the higher sales volume resulted in incremental margins of 65% on the incremental sales dollars.
Across most markets, key operating measurements of labor productivity improved from the prior year. In the Nashville, Tennessee area, severe flooding in May closed several of our quarrying operations, reducing Aggregate segment earnings by $3 million. We expect to recover a portion of this from our insurance carriers. 
The average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 38% in the quarter, reducing pretax earnings $8 million. Excluding the impact of higher fuel costs, unit variable production costs for Aggregates declined slightly from the prior year, demonstrating the continued focus of our employees in running our plants efficiently. 
Segment earnings in asphalt were $14 million lower than the prior year, due mostly to lower selling prices and a 26% increase in the unit cost for liquid asphalt. The year-over-year increase in liquid asphalt cost reduced asphalt earnings $9 million. Asphalt volumes increased 2% from the prior-year second quarter. 
Our selling prices for asphalt mix were 5% lower than the prior year. Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lagged increasing asphalt costs and further were held in check due to competitive pressures. 
Segment earnings in concrete declined $3 million from the prior year due to an 11% decline in selling prices. Cement earnings in the second quarter declined $1 million from the prior year as lower average unit selling prices offset higher sales volumes.
Our forecast for aggregates demand in the second half of 2010 continues to reflect an increase in public construction, driven by stimulus-related funding, as well as the formal extension of the Federal Highway bill, which occurred in March of 2010, along with an increase in residential construction, albeit from low levels. Single-family housing starts in the second quarter increased 6% from the prior year in Vulcan-served states. This year-over-year increase follows a 41% increase in Vulcan-served states in the second quarter. As a result, most key states for Vulcan now reflect positive growth in trailing 12-month single-family housing starts.
In private, non-residential construction, the rate of decline in contract awards has slowed in recent months. The start of a recovery in this end market will be influenced by employment growth, business investment and lending activity. The flow of contract awards for highway construction, a leading indicator of future construction activity, has been improving since March of 2009, when stimulus-related funds became available to each state. 
In March of this year, the stimulus-driven improvement in contract awards for highways was accentuated with the passage of the HIRE Act. This legislation formally extended the regular federal highway funding through the end of 2010 and transferred $19.5 billion into the Highway Trust Fund, a balance sufficient, along with projected tax receipts into the trust fund, to maintain current levels of federal funding of $41 billion for highways through 2012, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. As a result, monthly contract awards for highways in the U.S. have remained at high levels, greater than $5 billion per month since January. 
Through the first six months of 2010, contract awards have increased 6% from the prior year. This increase follows last year's first half increase of 7%. In Vulcan-served states, that increase has been more dramatic. During the first six months of 2010, total contract awards for highway construction in Vulcan-served states, including awards for our federal, state and local projects, increased 11% from the prior year. Through 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that only 38% of the $27 billion of total stimulus funds obligated for highways has been spent, which bode well for increased construction activity from federal stimulus spending for the remainder of 2010 and throughout 2011. 
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Fiscal Year 2011 Transportation Housing Appropriations Bill. The House bill provides $45 billion in federal funding for highways, a 10% increase from the FY 2010 level. The Senate will consider its version of the FY '11 appropriations bill after the August recess. This continuation of stimulus-related highway construction activity as well as the prospect for regular federal highway funding through 2012 from a solvent Highway Trust Fund provides the cornerstone of our demand outlook. 
In the second half of 2010, we expect aggregate volumes to be flat to up 5% from the prior year's second half levels on a same-store basis. Overall, pricing for aggregates remains solid, despite the year-over-year decline reported in the second quarter. A number of Vulcan-served markets are still realizing year-over-year price growth, while other markets where pricing has been under competitive pressures or affected by recent increases in transportation costs remain challenging. As a result, we expect aggregate pricing in the second half of 2010 to approximate the prior year. 
Our 2010 outlook for aggregate shipments reflects a 10% to 15% increase in aggregate shipments going into highway and other infrastructure-related construction activity, due primarily to stimulus-related funding. We expect aggregate shipments into residential construction to increase 10% to 15% from 2009 levels and private, non-residential shipments to decrease 15% to 20%.
In the second half of 2010, we expect the average unit cost for diesel fuel to increase slightly from actual year-to-date unit costs. In 2010, we expect to consume approximately 40 million gallons of diesel fuel. At this level of diesel fuel consumption, a $0.10 per gallon change in the average cost of diesel fuel impacts operating earnings by $4 million per year.
In our Asphalt business, we expect sales volumes and segment earnings in the second half of 2010 to approximate the prior year. In Concrete, we expect sales volumes in the second half of 2010 to increase from the prior year and pricing to decline, reflecting continued weakness in private, non-residential construction and competitive pressures. In our Cement business, we expect second half earnings to be a slight loss versus the break-even results recorded in the prior year. 
We expect SAG expense in the second half of 2010 to be flat with the prior year due to continuing cost-reduction efforts as well as lower costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems. Interest expense for full year 2010 is expected to be approximately $175 million, based on the current level of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest capital projects.
After the close of the quarter in early July, we raised $450 million through a syndicated bank term loan at attractive interest rates of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Proceeds of this transaction were used to further improve the company's liquidity position. We will continue to tightly manage capital spending, and as a result, expect to spend approximately $125 million in 2010, up slightly from the $110 million spent in 2009 but down sharply from $353 million in 2008.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our Aggregates-focused business, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years in the future. Our available production capacity and ongoing efforts to improve cash margins position Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in the $50 billion to $60 billion of stimulus-related construction, including significant remaining portions of the $27 billion for highways and bridges. We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well-positioned for significant participation in economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. 
We thank you for your continued interest in Vulcan. Now if our Operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions."

A lot of it is stimulus work, and it was priced in the period in the second half of 2009, largely, when stimulus work was about all that was out there, because the regular Federal Highway Program was in limbo. As you know, it expired September 30, and for several months prior to that and all the way up through mid-March of 2010, there was very little in our regular Federal Highway Program. So competition for asphalt as well as aggregates was about as intense as it's been in a long time in the public sector. So I believe the situation is improving from the standpoint of visibility of future demand. But liquid asphalt pricing remains a challenge."

But the long-haul, our reported freight-adjusted selling price in long-haul markets was down about $1 a ton. Our actual price to our customers was only down about $0.30 a ton. The other $0.70 is the incremental freight cost that we absorbed as we freight-adjust our reported pricing. So the long-haul markets were significant. And the reality is that there is a lot more capital tied up per ton of aggregate in long-haul markets. You've got to have loading facilities at the quarry. You've got to have a distribution yard and unloading facilities and either investment in transportation assets or hiring those transportation assets. And then you've got more money tied up in working capital in both inventory and receivables. So in a rational world, margins ought to be higher in the long-haul business than in the truck-served markets. Unfortunately, in this market, there's a lot of competitive pressures along the Gulf Coast. And that's resulted in a reduction in our reported pricing. That accounts for about 27% of our volume, that is, the long-haul markets plus Florida and the Far West, being California and Arizona. The other portion of our business, our largely truck-served markets, which was about 73% of our volume in the quarter, did very well. We got, as I said, 65% of contribution margin from the volume growth there. So the challenge for us is to get our pricing caught up in the long-haul markets.

We've talked about the 2011 Appropriations Bill, which we were pleased with the passage last week in the House of Representatives, it's got to pass the Senate.  As you know, the authorization now runs through the end of this year.  And I think, most importantly is that the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that the balance in the Highway Trust Fund, given the current balance plus the projected receipts are sufficient to maintain a $41 billion regular highway program through 2012. And I think that's a very positive number that gives us optimism that highways will be strong. When you overlay that with the stimulus spending in the remainder of '10 and throughout 2011, highway spending is going to be robust.

We have been told by the Chair of the Environmental and Public Works Committee that they're working hard and will have hearings and try to get something done right after they come back after the August recess. I think the good news is that the Congress can appropriate the $45 billion, which is what the House appropriated, out of the balances in the Highway Trust Fund without having to increase revenue in the near term. That would likely result in the balance in the Highway Trust Fund not being sufficient to take it all the way through the end of 2012. Basically, it would accelerate some spending out of the Highway Trust Fund from 2012 into 2011. But at some point, Congress will have to take up a multi-year highway bill. The reality is that's probably going to be after the November elections. We have had several senior people in both houses indicate that they expect to get it done in 2011, that it would be a multi-year highway bill. But at this point, the thing that is, I think, tangible is that the balance in the Highway Trust Fund is sufficient to maintain a significant federal program through 2012 without any incremental tax receipts.

Some of the other projects, water and sewer projects, go through a far less efficient contracting and bidding and awarding process than highways. And some of that's got relatively long lead times. Our sense is the $30 billion or $32 billion of non-highway stimulus-funded heavy construction is lagging the highway side. But I can't give you a precise metric. We're pretty confident that the 38% of spending through the end of the second quarter on the highway stimulus is a very good number. That comes from the government. But on the other side, we think it's probably materially lower than that, but we don't know exactly what it is."

I guess as we think about total call it road and highway demand, about 40% of total aggregates go to that channel. And as we think about it, about half of that funding comes from the federal government, and about half comes from states. And if you look at the spending trends to date, and it's really every month this year and it even goes back into last year, the numbers have been kind of flat to up on a total reported basis if you look at road and highway construction as the Census Bureau reports it. If you back out the spending from stimulus, it would suggest that the underlying spending is down substantially. Year-to-date, call it the underlying spend, is probably down 15%. Now we know that the federal dollars have been constant because of the extension. And so one read on this is that states are under a lot more pressure than the market may be aware, and it's something that the industry hasn't really addressed. So my first question is could you speak to your view on the state situation as opposed to the federal highway situation because it's actually a huge component of overall road and highway demand for aggregates and how you're thinking about where we are now, how that trends in the second half of this year and given the budgetary pressures they're under, how that looks for 2011?"

And within the states, the local situation is different. I think overall, the fact that for the last six months, total highway contract awards including federal, state and local in our markets are up 11%. So without regard to construction-put-in-place numbers, which are backward-looking, the contract awards are forward-looking. And they are positive. Now perhaps a greater portion of that 11% contract awards is coming from federal money contrasted to state and local than we have seen historically, but the net result for us is that total highway contract awards funded from all three sources, state, local and federal, are up significantly year-over-year. And that gives us the basis for our optimism of future demand for that sector. Some states have struggled with getting state highway budgets funded and contract awards out the door. Others have done a very significant job. Some states are viewing highway construction as a state-level stimulus. I think Texas has among the largest state highway program in history. Illinois has a large program that, hopefully, will begin to roll out soon. And California's still got a very large state highway program. Notwithstanding all of the budget issues California's got, the state highway program still appears to be very robust going forward."

The difference, there's a fundamental difference in the truck-served markets and the long-haul markets. And that is there's a big chunk of cost, ultimate cost over which you have almost no control, and that is the railroad. And so long-haul markets are tougher and riskier in that respect."

Put another way, there's very little price elasticity to demand in our markets for our products because our products are a relatively small portion of the total cost of a construction project. That being said, in markets where volumes are down and there is stress on pricing, we have to focus on cost. We have to focus on serving our customers and keeping them competitive. And basically, volume recovery from improvements in the overall demand is really the thing that will allow us to improve price and margin. So our strategy is to keep our customers competitive, be very diligent on cost and be well positioned to take advantage of volume recovery when it occurs. The only place we can affect demand for our product is through public infrastructure funding. And that's an industry effort. But we work very hard in that regard. And we have virtually no impact on demand for our products in the housing and private non-res. But the public infrastructure side is hugely important for us. And we spend a lot of time and energy as a company and as a participant in the larger industry, in trying to build the public policy case for improved infrastructure spending. You may have seen, I believe, there's an article in this week's Time magazine, in fact, talking about how much sense does it make to continue to allow the U.S. infrastructure to decline. And the question is which is more dangerous for the future of the U.S., higher deficits or declining quality of infrastructure? So there's a significant public-policy case to be made. There's got to be an election in November before there's a real opportunity to get anybody to listen to that case."

Part of the issue in the second quarter, and I can't quantify this, but if you think about what's been going on in the Gulf of Mexico throughout the significant portion of the second quarter, the whole oil spill has not enhanced private construction in the Gulf coast markets. That's a big tourism area. And while I don't think we can attribute the totality of weakness in the Gulf to the economic impacts of the oil spill, it nevertheless is there. And I can't quantify it. But if you're somebody thinking about building something on the Texas Gulf coast or the Louisiana or Mississippi or Alabama or Florida Gulf coast, you aren't terribly enthusiastic with this oil spill going on and with the huge drop in tourism and economic activity from fishing and everything else.

Number one, in none of the periods you have looked at historically has the construction economy in the U.S. been as stressed as it has been recently. But I think perhaps more importantly is that the reported pricing in Q2, for us and perhaps everyone else in our industry, is based on price quotes made in the second half of 2009. And if you remember what was happening to volume in the second half of 2009 and, more importantly, what the future prospects for volume were in the second half of 2009, it was a pretty grim situation. Private non-res was falling. Housing was beginning to bottom but hadn't quite yet bottomed. And there was no Federal Highway bill. All we had was some stimulus work. Hopefully, what you're seeing in Q2 pricing is a result of the economic stresses in the marketplace in the second half of '09. Those aren't behind us fully yet, because private non-res contract awards are still falling, albeit at a lower rate. But the thing that's going to pull us out of this, both volume and price, is the highway programs, to a much lesser extent, housing. And then the real kicker's going to be when private non-res finally bottoms and has some upside. So I don't think this quarter's pricing, and we've tried to indicate this in our press release and in our comments, is it is not a step change or a functional change. It is the result of really tough markets back in the second half of 2009."

I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our Senior Vice Presidents for Construction Materials.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
As you know, last night, after the market closed, we released our third quarter earnings. In the third quarter, our EBITDA was $150 million, and our net earnings were $13 million. Cash earnings were $116 million, up slightly from the prior year's third quarter and approximately $103 million more than our reported net earnings. This continuing contrast between our cash earnings and reported net earnings is primarily attributable to relatively high levels of non-cash DD&A charges contrasted with lower levels of production. The higher levels of DD&A come from two sources: first, almost $101.3 billion in CapEx over the years just prior to the recession from 2006 through 2008, which added reserves, increased production capacity, replaced equipment and improved cost; and second, from the wind-up of the Florida Rock assets through purchase accounting. 
One of the benefits of this higher CapEx in prior years is that we will be able to produce substantially higher tonnages of aggregates with relatively little additional CapEx above current levels. And one of the benefits of higher production levels going forward will be to spread this DD&A over more tons, which will leverage our GAAP earnings. Dan Sansone will give you more details on our CapEx spending toward the end of our remarks today.
Before I discuss segment results supporting these third quarter earnings, let me start by highlighting several underlying trends we are following that could benefit our earnings opportunities going forward. Shipping trends and aggregates continue to improve in the third quarter. Trailing 12-month aggregate shipments have been increasing since February, and asphalt and concrete trailing 12-month shipments have been relatively stable since May and February, respectively.
Our continued focus on controlling costs and managing production levels to current demand contributed to lower cost of sales and aggregates excluding energy cost, through sequential improvement in material margins for asphalt, and to a reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Some aspects of our cost structure are outside our control in the short term, such as energy and the impact of lower demand levels on production costs. However, we believe there's always room for improvement and controllable cost. Overall, we're pleased with our continuing progress in managing our costs, our inventory levels and our cash earnings.
Third quarter segment earnings in aggregates were $125 million compared to $133 million in the prior year. Aggregate shipments declined 2.6% from the prior year's third quarter, accounting for most of the year-over-year decline in segment earnings. All of the decline in shipments can be attributed to a strike in July in Chicago, affecting our customers' employees for most of that month.
Aggregates pricing in the third quarter was in line with the prior year, reflecting mild variations across Vulcan-served markets. Many major market realized price improvement from the prior year's third quarter. Other markets have remained challenging due to competitive pressures arising from reduced demand, higher transportation cost and in some cases, from mix shifts.
Excluding the impact of higher energy cost, unit cost of sales for aggregates declined 2% from the prior year, demonstrating continued focus by our employees in running our plants in the most efficient manner possible and the cost benefit of production levels that are now matching sales volume levels.
The cumulative effect of reducing aggregates inventory levels over the past two years allowed us to match production levels with sales levels in the third quarter, which contributed to the reduction in aggregates cost of sales. The average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 17% in the quarter reducing pretax earnings $4 million. Segment earnings in asphalt were $8 million lower than the prior year, due in part to a 14% increase in unit cost for liquid asphalt and lower selling prices. The year-over-year increase in liquid asphalt cost reduced asphalt earnings $6 million. Selling prices decreased 3% from the prior year, reducing segment earnings approximately $4 million.
Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lagged increasing liquid asphalt costs that were held in check due to competitive pressures. On a sequential basis, unit material margins for asphalt had been improving since the first quarter due to some improvement in pricing and a relatively stable liquid asphalt cost.
In the third quarter, unit material margins increased 10% on a sequential basis from the second quarter. Segment earnings in Concrete declined $9 million from the prior year, due principally to a decline in selling prices. Cement earnings in the third quarter were a loss of $2 million, due primarily to lower selling prices.
Turning to our outlook, let me start by saying that while the current construction environment remains challenging, our optimism that the worst is behind us continues to grow. Most GDP forecast take further growth in the overall U.S. economy. In past cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of recovery. Additionally, the growth state product of all Vulcan-served states has shown positive growth since the second quarter of 2009, an indication economic recovery is underway. As the general economy continues to recover, public construction, particularly highways, continues to provide solid support for our aggregates demand.
During September 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately half of the $27 billion of total stimulus funds obligated for highways is yet to be spent. In August, the Congressional Budget Office forecast total outlays for highway construction for the current fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, increased 7% from the year just ended. This projected increase includes a 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund as well as a continuation of stimulus funds. This projected increase in outlays for the regular highway funding program reflects a catch-up in obligating awarding and spending following a decline that occurred during the months just before and following the expiration of the six-year Highway Bill last September 30 when state departments of transportation were operating with limited funding visibility and limited contract authority, both resolved with the passing of the HIRE Act in March of this year. The 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund from the regular highway funding program this fiscal year as well as the projected increases in regular highway funding from a Highway Trust Fund through 2012 should continue to provide solid support for aggregates demand.
In Washington, we have been very pleased to see that the administration has now come out strongly in favor of sustained transportation infrastructure spending, calling for a multiyear Highway Bill as a key way to help lead the country out of recession and create jobs. 
In a significant and very positive report issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury on October 11 of this year, the administration has made a compelling case for major infrastructure investment now and going forward. The report points to the long-term economic benefits of the infrastructure investment, the disproportionate benefits received by the middle class and the strong pent-up demand from the public and private sectors. It also emphasizes the high level of unemployment in the construction sector, which has been at almost twice the national unemployment level and points to infrastructure investment as a key to creating and sustaining jobs.
The Treasury Department report entitled ""An Economic Analysis of Infrastructure Investment"" is available on the Department of Treasury's website. It also notes that 19 out of 20 Americans are concerned about America's infrastructure and that 84% support greater investment to address infrastructure problems.
Our company and the entire infrastructure community must make this case to a new Congress. In particular, this quote from the Treasury report is a key, and I'm quoting: ""Americans have voted repeatedly for increased investment in transportation infrastructure. In 2008 alone, over 80% of the 59 transportation infrastructure projects proposed in local referenda were approved by the public. Even more striking is that over 98% of the funds requested for these projects were approved by the voting public.""
In addition, major business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking Association support higher fuel taxes for highways to relieve congestion, improve transportation efficiencies and create jobs.
Private construction, particularly private non-residential construction, remains the most challenging sector overall. On the positive side, trailing 12-month single-family housing starts through September have increased 10% from the prior year. The rate of decline in private non-residential construction contract awards has slowed. The rate of decline in trailing 12-month contract awards has slowed in each of the last three quarters. The start of a recovery in this end market will be influenced by employment growth, business investment and lending activity.
Overall, pricing for our aggregates remain stable. A number of Vulcan-served markets were realizing meaningful year-over-year price growth, while pricing in certain other markets has declined due to competitive pressures from weak demand and the shifts in product mix. As a result, we expect pricing in the fourth quarter to approximate the prior year.
In our Asphalt business, material margins on each ton of asphalt mix sold have trended higher since the first quarter this year due to a relatively more stable cost environment for liquid asphalt. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. 
In our Concrete business, we expect sales volumes in the fourth quarter to increase from the prior year's fourth quarter, due mostly to the timing of some large projects in Florida. We expect pricing to decline due to competitive pressures. In our Cement businesses, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to approximate the prior year's results.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dan Sansone, our Chief Financial Officer, who will make a few comments related to our outlook for SAG, debt reduction and liquidity. Afterwards, I'll conclude our prepared remarks with a closing comment before taking your questions."

There are, however, a number of unusual items in the SAG category that I'd like to highlight. In the fourth quarter of last year, SAG costs included a non-cash charge of $8.5 million representing the fair market value of donated real estate. We do not anticipate a similar item in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Additionally, we recorded a non-cash charge of $9.2 million for donated real estate in the first quarter of this year, and we currently do not anticipate any similar charges or transactions in 2011.
The second  significant item affecting SAG expenses, is our major ERP project, which began in 2008 soon after the acquisition of Florida Rock. This multiyear project is replacing Legacy systems and processes throughout the company, consolidating back-office activities and standardizing common processes and procedures. As of today, all of the Legacy Vulcan business units are operating on the new financial systems platform.
The Legacy Florida Rock division will transition onto the new platform in the first quarter of 2011. We will begin to implement the major non-accounting modules of the project early in 2011, with project completion anticipated in 2012. This initiative has had a material impact on our SAG expenses over the last couple of years.
Annual project cost peaked at 2009 at approximately $13 million. Project costs in 2010 should be approximately $2 million lower than last year, reflecting lower design and implementation costs and the beginning of the realization of cost reduction benefits. We expect a further reduction in net costs of approximately $6 million in 2011.
Interest expense for the full year 2010 is expected to be approximately $175 million based on current levels of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We expect to reduce total debt by $120 million by the end of 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for 2010 will be approximately $385 million. 
We have carefully reviewed our capital spending requirements relative to current demand levels. We now expect capital spending in 2010 to be approximately $100 million, down slightly from the $110 million spent in 2009 and down sharply from the $353 million spent in 2008. The sharp decrease in capital spending in the last two years results from lower production levels as well as the higher levels of capital spending during 2006 through 2008 that Don mentioned in his opening remarks. During that three-year period, cumulative capital spending totaled approximately $1.3 billion. These projects added reserves, increased production capacity, upgraded mobile equipment fleets and lowered production costs. 
Our aggregates plans and rolling stock were in very good condition going into this economic downturn. As a result, our capital spending needs have remained relatively modest. We have maintained the production capacity necessary to respond quickly and efficiently as demand recovers. 
And Don will now pick up with some closing remarks."

We will remain diligent in our efforts to look for every opportunity to cut costs, and we look forward to the opportunity of getting the great leverage in earnings that volume recovery will provide us. 
The underlying trends in trailing 12-month shipments have increased our optimism that the worst of this severe downturn may be behind us. We are in the process of reviewing our specific projections for next year, and we'll provide an outlook in February when we report our fourth quarter results. 
Our available production capacity which, as Dan pointed out, is in very good condition, positions Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in an increase in Federal Highway spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. By the second half of 2011, we expect a continued growth in the overall economy and an improving job market will begin driving an increase in private construction activity, accelerating the earnings leverage of the company. We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. 
I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our Aggregates-focused business, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future.

That's a yes. It could be shorter, it could be a little longer. I think the real action, though, is assuming that the Republicans take control of the House, which seems to be most people's projection, we'll have a new Chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, probably John Michael from Florida. We believe, as I tried to indicate in my prepared remarks, that the administration, particularly the Treasury Department, is a very strong advocate for increased spending for infrastructure, and in particular highways for all the reasons I outlined and all the reasons stated in the report. This is really the first time the administration has come out strongly and said, ""we need a new multiyear surface transportation bill, and we need to get on with it because it is a key way to address unemployment and end up with an economically efficient system when we get through with it"". And their treasury in particular and Secretary Geithner, in particular, seem to be approaching this from a purely economic view and not such a political view. Now roll over to Congress. The political issue is going to be whether the Republican majority in the House feels it now has a joint responsibility for the economy. And I point it and I try to emphasize this, one of the points that we have to be able to make, and we is not just our company, but the entire transportation industry, is that voters support what I'll call user fees that are directly related to transportation improvements in their communities. Over and over and over again, that spending and that increased revenue is supported by voters. The point is, is that not all federal spending is bad and that there is public support as manifested through any number of activities for increased revenues and increased spending to relieve traffic congestion. The projections from the congressional commission that studied highway funding was $0.10 a gallon, fuel tax will raise an incremental $20 billion a year, and it will cost the average American family about $100 a year. And for that, they get all sorts of benefits including being able to get home and to work faster, having much lower repairs to their automobiles caused by poor surface conditions. So there's a tremendous amount of really good study and reports supporting it. We just got to make the case that voters will support it, and that's our challenge in this new Congress."

And as a result of that, assuming the wildcard here is what happens to liquid asphalt cost. But assuming stability in liquid asphalt cost, then we would expect material margins would continue to improve as we're able to get somewhat higher prices for the mix. But the wildcard is the liquid asphalt input cost that we have very little influence and control over, we are seeing liquid asphalt producers for the first time in several years being willing to commit to pricing for longer than a 30-day period, which gives us some more stability in getting work with a firm liquid asphalt pricing.

Our big Midwestern markets are Tecumseh and Milwaukee, and they don't participate in those markets there and Indianapolis and Ohio where we're not. Northern Virginia is a huge market for us. They really don't participate in that market. Florida, we have local production in Florida, and part Marietta has virtually none. So there's really a very small sort of overlap when you get to where we both participate. That being said, a lot of their volume growth seems to have come from shale gas and energy projects and markets, and we're not in the same markets they're in, but we are in some markets where that is a demand sector, and that has been significant. Remarkably, in North Carolina, there are big highway programs in the Raleigh market and in Eastern North Carolina and Western North Carolina is just sort of out-of-cycle highway projects right now. So there's probably a big difference in our North Carolina shipments even though we compete in relatively limited number of markets in North Carolina. So I don't think you can conclude from the disparity in price volume between the two companies that there's a market share shift going on in volume as a result of pricing. That's just not the case at least from our view. So I can't tell you specifically why their prices are down whatever it was, 3% or 4% and their volume was up 6% compared to ours.

But we're happy with our market position and our distribution capabilities in Florida. We are able to serve that market from forays in the state, as well as by ship from our big quarry on the Yucatán as well as by rail from Georgia and Alabama. So we have a great supply network and distribution network to serve Florida. At some point, when demand there begins to recover, we're going to be in great shape. But it's a tough market today. But in the long term, there are very limited reserves in Florida and there's a huge amount of growth potential, but it's going to take another time period. I guess we are pleased that housing starts in Florida are up in high double sort of 18%, 19%, 20%, 21% on a trailing 12-month basis. So there is some life in Florida after all, and of course, the highway projects and stimulus projects in Florida are finally getting underway. They were among the slower states to get that rolled out. So it's really when non-res construction begins to resume is going to be the key in Florida as it is in most other markets. But residential, what we think if it turn to corner in Florida, really more so than in the rest of the country."

We don't need that because we can supply Florida with high-quality limestone from our core on the Yucatán Yucatán Peninsula by ship very efficiently. We expect that to close any time. We did sell three quarries up in rural Virginia, in markets that had been supported by textile and furniture manufacturing. And as you are aware, I'm sure, those industries are in great distress, and it just didn't make a lot of sense for us to continue to keep those in our portfolio. We continue to look at opportunities where we may have some quarries that are not end markets that are key to us or strategic to us where they may be more valuable to someone else than they are to us. That's not anything unusual. We'll continue to pursue those, but it's difficult for us to sell operations, pay taxes on it and make a lot of sense on an after-tax cash basis. So that's one of the impediments to continue to prune our portfolio. But we do continue to look at that and we'll continue, and we'll report them as they occur."

Running plants at off-peak hours from the standpoint of energy costs, particularly electrical energy cost, in many markets if we run our plants at all peak hours, we get much lower electric utility rates than if we run in the middle of the day and at summer time. SAG costs is an area in which we are continuing to focus then since we only gave you some input on that. Going to our new ERP system has allowed us to begin to reduce some overhead cost, and that project will continue to move forward in that area. The principle it's not one single place, it's really across-the-board from -- as I mentioned, about diesel fuel consumption, we monitor all sorts of labor productivity. That is tons per variable man-hour, tons per total man-hour. It's done on a plant-by-plant, month-by-month basis, so there aren't any secrets out there.

There's no secrets. They know our plans. They know our priorities. And they do a very good job of tracking the industry and the company's performance. The issue with the agencies at the moment is frankly that our one single metric, debt to EBITDA has crept higher as our EBITDA has drifted lower in this cyclical downturn. And that metric, more than any is the one that's under the greatest pressure with the agencies. And it's the one that probably contributes the most to the current rating and to the threat of a downgrade. I certainly I'm not in a position to speak for what the agencies will choose to do when they see these numbers and when they see our numbers at the end of the year. But I think psychologically, we have a tendency to think of a movement from -- and I'll use the S&P rating just for simplicity, BBB- to a BB+ rating from investment grade to a non-investment grade as some sort of a huge step function it is. In terms of the financial markets, it's not nearly as dramatic a change. Certainly, a downgrade is not something we're hoping for, and we're trying to do the reasonable things we can do to manage for the current rating. But if we were to get downgraded, the incremental effect on our borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things is not very significant. Put differently, I don't think you should expect us to go to draconian measures to try to protect the current investment grade rating at the expense of -- at some extreme expense. In the current term loan that we put in place in July of this year I believe that if we were to get downgraded one notch, it would add 25 basis points to the borrowing spread over LIBOR. It's not the end of the world. If you look at indicative bond pricing in today's market, if we were a full notch lower by both agencies, it would add less than 100 basis points to the indicative coupon rates, and in today's market, that would bring in coupon rates that are still lower than the coupon rates the we have with the debt that was issued in 2007 and 2008. So yes, we worry about it. Yes, we communicate extensively with the agencies. Yes, we're very sensitive to it, but you won't see us turn the table upside down to protect it at all costs."

Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss Vulcan's third quarter results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Of",1721,"Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss Vulcan's third quarter results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our Senior Vice Presidents for Construction Materials.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
As you know, last night, after the market closed, we released our third quarter earnings. In the third quarter, our EBITDA was $150 million, and our net earnings were $13 million. Cash earnings were $116 million, up slightly from the prior year's third quarter and approximately $103 million more than our reported net earnings. This continuing contrast between our cash earnings and reported net earnings is primarily attributable to relatively high levels of non-cash DD&A charges contrasted with lower levels of production. The higher levels of DD&A come from two sources: first, almost $101.3 billion in CapEx over the years just prior to the recession from 2006 through 2008, which added reserves, increased production capacity, replaced equipment and improved cost; and second, from the wind-up of the Florida Rock assets through purchase accounting. 
One of the benefits of this higher CapEx in prior years is that we will be able to produce substantially higher tonnages of aggregates with relatively little additional CapEx above current levels. And one of the benefits of higher production levels going forward will be to spread this DD&A over more tons, which will leverage our GAAP earnings. Dan Sansone will give you more details on our CapEx spending toward the end of our remarks today.
Before I discuss segment results supporting these third quarter earnings, let me start by highlighting several underlying trends we are following that could benefit our earnings opportunities going forward. Shipping trends and aggregates continue to improve in the third quarter. Trailing 12-month aggregate shipments have been increasing since February, and asphalt and concrete trailing 12-month shipments have been relatively stable since May and February, respectively.
Our continued focus on controlling costs and managing production levels to current demand contributed to lower cost of sales and aggregates excluding energy cost, through sequential improvement in material margins for asphalt, and to a reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Some aspects of our cost structure are outside our control in the short term, such as energy and the impact of lower demand levels on production costs. However, we believe there's always room for improvement and controllable cost. Overall, we're pleased with our continuing progress in managing our costs, our inventory levels and our cash earnings.
Third quarter segment earnings in aggregates were $125 million compared to $133 million in the prior year. Aggregate shipments declined 2.6% from the prior year's third quarter, accounting for most of the year-over-year decline in segment earnings. All of the decline in shipments can be attributed to a strike in July in Chicago, affecting our customers' employees for most of that month.
Aggregates pricing in the third quarter was in line with the prior year, reflecting mild variations across Vulcan-served markets. Many major market realized price improvement from the prior year's third quarter. Other markets have remained challenging due to competitive pressures arising from reduced demand, higher transportation cost and in some cases, from mix shifts.
Excluding the impact of higher energy cost, unit cost of sales for aggregates declined 2% from the prior year, demonstrating continued focus by our employees in running our plants in the most efficient manner possible and the cost benefit of production levels that are now matching sales volume levels.
The cumulative effect of reducing aggregates inventory levels over the past two years allowed us to match production levels with sales levels in the third quarter, which contributed to the reduction in aggregates cost of sales. The average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 17% in the quarter reducing pretax earnings $4 million. Segment earnings in asphalt were $8 million lower than the prior year, due in part to a 14% increase in unit cost for liquid asphalt and lower selling prices. The year-over-year increase in liquid asphalt cost reduced asphalt earnings $6 million. Selling prices decreased 3% from the prior year, reducing segment earnings approximately $4 million.
Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lagged increasing liquid asphalt costs that were held in check due to competitive pressures. On a sequential basis, unit material margins for asphalt had been improving since the first quarter due to some improvement in pricing and a relatively stable liquid asphalt cost.
In the third quarter, unit material margins increased 10% on a sequential basis from the second quarter. Segment earnings in Concrete declined $9 million from the prior year, due principally to a decline in selling prices. Cement earnings in the third quarter were a loss of $2 million, due primarily to lower selling prices.
Turning to our outlook, let me start by saying that while the current construction environment remains challenging, our optimism that the worst is behind us continues to grow. Most GDP forecast take further growth in the overall U.S. economy. In past cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of recovery. Additionally, the growth state product of all Vulcan-served states has shown positive growth since the second quarter of 2009, an indication economic recovery is underway. As the general economy continues to recover, public construction, particularly highways, continues to provide solid support for our aggregates demand.
During September 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately half of the $27 billion of total stimulus funds obligated for highways is yet to be spent. In August, the Congressional Budget Office forecast total outlays for highway construction for the current fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, increased 7% from the year just ended. This projected increase includes a 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund as well as a continuation of stimulus funds. This projected increase in outlays for the regular highway funding program reflects a catch-up in obligating awarding and spending following a decline that occurred during the months just before and following the expiration of the six-year Highway Bill last September 30 when state departments of transportation were operating with limited funding visibility and limited contract authority, both resolved with the passing of the HIRE Act in March of this year. The 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund from the regular highway funding program this fiscal year as well as the projected increases in regular highway funding from a Highway Trust Fund through 2012 should continue to provide solid support for aggregates demand.
In Washington, we have been very pleased to see that the administration has now come out strongly in favor of sustained transportation infrastructure spending, calling for a multiyear Highway Bill as a key way to help lead the country out of recession and create jobs. 
In a significant and very positive report issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury on October 11 of this year, the administration has made a compelling case for major infrastructure investment now and going forward. The report points to the long-term economic benefits of the infrastructure investment, the disproportionate benefits received by the middle class and the strong pent-up demand from the public and private sectors. It also emphasizes the high level of unemployment in the construction sector, which has been at almost twice the national unemployment level and points to infrastructure investment as a key to creating and sustaining jobs.
The Treasury Department report entitled ""An Economic Analysis of Infrastructure Investment"" is available on the Department of Treasury's website. It also notes that 19 out of 20 Americans are concerned about America's infrastructure and that 84% support greater investment to address infrastructure problems.
Our company and the entire infrastructure community must make this case to a new Congress. In particular, this quote from the Treasury report is a key, and I'm quoting: ""Americans have voted repeatedly for increased investment in transportation infrastructure. In 2008 alone, over 80% of the 59 transportation infrastructure projects proposed in local referenda were approved by the public. Even more striking is that over 98% of the funds requested for these projects were approved by the voting public.""
In addition, major business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking Association support higher fuel taxes for highways to relieve congestion, improve transportation efficiencies and create jobs.
Private construction, particularly private non-residential construction, remains the most challenging sector overall. On the positive side, trailing 12-month single-family housing starts through September have increased 10% from the prior year. The rate of decline in private non-residential construction contract awards has slowed. The rate of decline in trailing 12-month contract awards has slowed in each of the last three quarters. The start of a recovery in this end market will be influenced by employment growth, business investment and lending activity.
Overall, pricing for our aggregates remain stable. A number of Vulcan-served markets were realizing meaningful year-over-year price growth, while pricing in certain other markets has declined due to competitive pressures from weak demand and the shifts in product mix. As a result, we expect pricing in the fourth quarter to approximate the prior year.
In our Asphalt business, material margins on each ton of asphalt mix sold have trended higher since the first quarter this year due to a relatively more stable cost environment for liquid asphalt. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. 
In our Concrete business, we expect sales volumes in the fourth quarter to increase from the prior year's fourth quarter, due mostly to the timing of some large projects in Florida. We expect pricing to decline due to competitive pressures. In our Cement businesses, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to approximate the prior year's results.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dan Sansone, our Chief Financial Officer, who will make a few comments related to our outlook for SAG, debt reduction and liquidity. Afterwards, I'll conclude our prepared remarks with a closing comment before taking your questions.

There are, however, a number of unusual items in the SAG category that I'd like to highlight. In the fourth quarter of last year, SAG costs included a non-cash charge of $8.5 million representing the fair market value of donated real estate. We do not anticipate a similar item in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Additionally, we recorded a non-cash charge of $9.2 million for donated real estate in the first quarter of this year, and we currently do not anticipate any similar charges or transactions in 2011.
The second  significant item affecting SAG expenses, is our major ERP project, which began in 2008 soon after the acquisition of Florida Rock. This multiyear project is replacing Legacy systems and processes throughout the company, consolidating back-office activities and standardizing common processes and procedures. As of today, all of the Legacy Vulcan business units are operating on the new financial systems platform.
The Legacy Florida Rock division will transition onto the new platform in the first quarter of 2011. We will begin to implement the major non-accounting modules of the project early in 2011, with project completion anticipated in 2012. This initiative has had a material impact on our SAG expenses over the last couple of years.
Annual project cost peaked at 2009 at approximately $13 million. Project costs in 2010 should be approximately $2 million lower than last year, reflecting lower design and implementation costs and the beginning of the realization of cost reduction benefits. We expect a further reduction in net costs of approximately $6 million in 2011.
Interest expense for the full year 2010 is expected to be approximately $175 million based on current levels of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We expect to reduce total debt by $120 million by the end of 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for 2010 will be approximately $385 million. 
We have carefully reviewed our capital spending requirements relative to current demand levels. We now expect capital spending in 2010 to be approximately $100 million, down slightly from the $110 million spent in 2009 and down sharply from the $353 million spent in 2008. The sharp decrease in capital spending in the last two years results from lower production levels as well as the higher levels of capital spending during 2006 through 2008 that Don mentioned in his opening remarks. During that three-year period, cumulative capital spending totaled approximately $1.3 billion. These projects added reserves, increased production capacity, upgraded mobile equipment fleets and lowered production costs. 
Our aggregates plans and rolling stock were in very good condition going into this economic downturn. As a result, our capital spending needs have remained relatively modest. We have maintained the production capacity necessary to respond quickly and efficiently as demand recovers. 
And Don will now pick up with some closing remarks.

We will remain diligent in our efforts to look for every opportunity to cut costs, and we look forward to the opportunity of getting the great leverage in earnings that volume recovery will provide us. 
The underlying trends in trailing 12-month shipments have increased our optimism that the worst of this severe downturn may be behind us. We are in the process of reviewing our specific projections for next year, and we'll provide an outlook in February when we report our fourth quarter results. 
Our available production capacity which, as Dan pointed out, is in very good condition, positions Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in an increase in Federal Highway spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. By the second half of 2011, we expect a continued growth in the overall economy and an improving job market will begin driving an increase in private construction activity, accelerating the earnings leverage of the company. We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. 
I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our Aggregates-focused business, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future. 
We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. Now if our operator will give the required instruction, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.

I wouldn't bet on it. I think that's going to be short, and I would expect the current extension of contract authority and funding levels for highways will be further extended in the lame-duck session, probably for six months. That's a yes. It could be shorter, it could be a little longer. I think the real action, though, is assuming that the Republicans take control of the House, which seems to be most people's projection, we'll have a new Chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, probably John Michael from Florida. We believe, as I tried to indicate in my prepared remarks, that the administration, particularly the Treasury Department, is a very strong advocate for increased spending for infrastructure, and in particular highways for all the reasons I outlined and all the reasons stated in the report. This is really the first time the administration has come out strongly and said, ""we need a new multiyear surface transportation bill, and we need to get on with it because it is a key way to address unemployment and end up with an economically efficient system when we get through with it"". And their treasury in particular and Secretary Geithner, in particular, seem to be approaching this from a purely economic view and not such a political view. Now roll over to Congress. The political issue is going to be whether the Republican majority in the House feels it now has a joint responsibility for the economy. And I point it and I try to emphasize this, one of the points that we have to be able to make, and we is not just our company, but the entire transportation industry, is that voters support what I'll call user fees that are directly related to transportation improvements in their communities. Over and over and over again, that spending and that increased revenue is supported by voters. The point is, is that not all federal spending is bad and that there is public support as manifested through any number of activities for increased revenues and increased spending to relieve traffic congestion. The projections from the congressional commission that studied highway funding was $0.10 a gallon, fuel tax will raise an incremental $20 billion a year, and it will cost the average American family about $100 a year. And for that, they get all sorts of benefits including being able to get home and to work faster, having much lower repairs to their automobiles caused by poor surface conditions. So there's a tremendous amount of really good study and reports supporting it. We just got to make the case that voters will support it, and that's our challenge in this new Congress.

And obviously, public infrastructure is a very large end market for asphalt, much more so than for concrete. And that's the one place that we're seeing relatively strong growth in funding and demand. And as a result of that, assuming the wildcard here is what happens to liquid asphalt cost. But assuming stability in liquid asphalt cost, then we would expect material margins would continue to improve as we're able to get somewhat higher prices for the mix. But the wildcard is the liquid asphalt input cost that we have very little influence and control over, we are seeing liquid asphalt producers for the first time in several years being willing to commit to pricing for longer than a 30-day period, which gives us some more stability in getting work with a firm liquid asphalt pricing. And that's a phenomenon that we haven't seen since probably three or four years ago.

And once cold weather hits, we expect a lot of our customers will close up for the year and go home and then crank back up next spring when the weather improves. So how much of that gets caught up this year really depends upon how long the construction season lasts in Chicago.

Our big Midwestern markets are Tecumseh and Milwaukee, and they don't participate in those markets there and Indianapolis and Ohio where we're not. Northern Virginia is a huge market for us. They really don't participate in that market. Florida, we have local production in Florida, and part Marietta has virtually none. So there's really a very small sort of overlap when you get to where we both participate. That being said, a lot of their volume growth seems to have come from shale gas and energy projects and markets, and we're not in the same markets they're in, but we are in some markets where that is a demand sector, and that has been significant. Remarkably, in North Carolina, there are big highway programs in the Raleigh market and in Eastern North Carolina and Western North Carolina is just sort of out-of-cycle highway projects right now. So there's probably a big difference in our North Carolina shipments even though we compete in relatively limited number of markets in North Carolina. So I don't think you can conclude from the disparity in price volume between the two companies that there's a market share shift going on in volume as a result of pricing. That's just not the case at least from our view. So I can't tell you specifically why their prices are down whatever it was, 3% or 4% and their volume was up 6% compared to ours. We've got enough to worry about with our business and not worry about theirs.

But we're happy with our market position and our distribution capabilities in Florida. We are able to serve that market from forays in the state, as well as by ship from our big quarry on the Yucatán as well as by rail from Georgia and Alabama. So we have a great supply network and distribution network to serve Florida. At some point, when demand there begins to recover, we're going to be in great shape. But it's a tough market today. But in the long term, there are very limited reserves in Florida and there's a huge amount of growth potential, but it's going to take another time period. I guess we are pleased that housing starts in Florida are up in high double sort of 18%, 19%, 20%, 21% on a trailing 12-month basis. So there is some life in Florida after all, and of course, the highway projects and stimulus projects in Florida are finally getting underway. They were among the slower states to get that rolled out. So it's really when non-res construction begins to resume is going to be the key in Florida as it is in most other markets. But residential, what we think if it turn to corner in Florida, really more so than in the rest of the country.

We don't need that because we can supply Florida with high-quality limestone from our core on the Yucatán Yucatán Peninsula by ship very efficiently. We expect that to close any time. We did sell three quarries up in rural Virginia, in markets that had been supported by textile and furniture manufacturing. And as you are aware, I'm sure, those industries are in great distress, and it just didn't make a lot of sense for us to continue to keep those in our portfolio. We continue to look at opportunities where we may have some quarries that are not end markets that are key to us or strategic to us where they may be more valuable to someone else than they are to us. That's not anything unusual. We'll continue to pursue those, but it's difficult for us to sell operations, pay taxes on it and make a lot of sense on an after-tax cash basis. So that's one of the impediments to continue to prune our portfolio. But we do continue to look at that and we'll continue, and we'll report them as they occur.

Running plants at off-peak hours from the standpoint of energy costs, particularly electrical energy cost, in many markets if we run our plants at all peak hours, we get much lower electric utility rates than if we run in the middle of the day and at summer time. SAG costs is an area in which we are continuing to focus then since we only gave you some input on that. Going to our new ERP system has allowed us to begin to reduce some overhead cost, and that project will continue to move forward in that area. The principle it's not one single place, it's really across-the-board from -- as I mentioned, about diesel fuel consumption, we monitor all sorts of labor productivity. That is tons per variable man-hour, tons per total man-hour. It's done on a plant-by-plant, month-by-month basis, so there aren't any secrets out there. The plants that are doing great jobs show up, and the plants that need some work are also showing up. And so that's an emphasis for us, and it's small. It's pennies a ton, in 250 quarries.

There's no secrets. They know our plans. They know our priorities. And they do a very good job of tracking the industry and the company's performance. The issue with the agencies at the moment is frankly that our one single metric, debt to EBITDA has crept higher as our EBITDA has drifted lower in this cyclical downturn. And that metric, more than any is the one that's under the greatest pressure with the agencies. And it's the one that probably contributes the most to the current rating and to the threat of a downgrade. I certainly I'm not in a position to speak for what the agencies will choose to do when they see these numbers and when they see our numbers at the end of the year. But I think psychologically, we have a tendency to think of a movement from -- and I'll use the S&P rating just for simplicity, BBB- to a BB+ rating from investment grade to a non-investment grade as some sort of a huge step function it is. In terms of the financial markets, it's not nearly as dramatic a change. Certainly, a downgrade is not something we're hoping for, and we're trying to do the reasonable things we can do to manage for the current rating. But if we were to get downgraded, the incremental effect on our borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things is not very significant. Put differently, I don't think you should expect us to go to draconian measures to try to protect the current investment grade rating at the expense of -- at some extreme expense. In the current term loan that we put in place in July of this year I believe that if we were to get downgraded one notch, it would add 25 basis points to the borrowing spread over LIBOR. It's not the end of the world. If you look at indicative bond pricing in today's market, if we were a full notch lower by both agencies, it would add less than 100 basis points to the indicative coupon rates, and in today's market, that would bring in coupon rates that are still lower than the coupon rates the we have with the debt that was issued in 2007 and 2008. So yes, we worry about it. Yes, we communicate extensively with the agencies. Yes, we're very sensitive to it, but you won't see us turn the table upside down to protect it at all costs.

Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss Vulcan's third quarter results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Of",1722,"Good morning. Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss Vulcan's third quarter results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our Senior Vice Presidents for Construction Materials.
Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
As you know, last night, after the market closed, we released our third quarter earnings. In the third quarter, our EBITDA was $150 million, and our net earnings were $13 million. Cash earnings were $116 million, up slightly from the prior year's third quarter and approximately $103 million more than our reported net earnings. This continuing contrast between our cash earnings and reported net earnings is primarily attributable to relatively high levels of non-cash DD&A charges contrasted with lower levels of production. The higher levels of DD&A come from two sources: first, almost $101.3 billion in CapEx over the years just prior to the recession from 2006 through 2008, which added reserves, increased production capacity, replaced equipment and improved cost; and second, from the write-up of the Florida Rock assets through purchase accounting. 
One of the benefits of this higher CapEx in prior years is that we will be able to produce substantially higher tonnages of aggregates with relatively little additional CapEx above current levels. And one of the benefits of higher production levels going forward will be to spread this DD&A over more tons, which will leverage our GAAP earnings. Dan Sansone will give you more details on our CapEx spending toward the end of our remarks today.
Before I discuss segment results supporting these third quarter earnings, let me start by highlighting several underlying trends we are following that could benefit our earnings opportunities going forward. Shipping trends and aggregates continue to improve in the third quarter. Trailing 12-month aggregate shipments have been increasing since February, and asphalt and concrete trailing 12-month shipments have been relatively stable since May and February, respectively.
Our continued focus on controlling costs and managing production levels to current demand contributed to lower cost of sales and aggregates excluding energy cost, through sequential improvement in material margins for asphalt, and to a reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Some aspects of our cost structure are outside of our control in the short term, such as energy and the impact of lower demand levels on production costs. However, we believe there's always room for improvement in controllable cost. Overall, we're pleased with our continuing progress in managing our costs, our inventory levels and our cash earnings.
Third quarter segment earnings in aggregates were $125 million compared to $133 million in the prior year. Aggregate shipments declined 2.6% from the prior year's third quarter, accounting for most of the year-over-year decline in segment earnings. All of the decline in shipments can be attributed to a strike in July in Chicago, affecting our customers' employees for most of that month.
Aggregates pricing in the third quarter was in line with the prior year, reflecting wide variations across Vulcan-served markets. Many major market realized price improvement from the prior year's third quarter. Other markets have remained challenging due to competitive pressures arising from reduced demand, higher transportation cost and in some cases, from mix shifts.
Excluding the impact of higher energy cost, unit cost of sales for aggregates declined 2% from the prior year, demonstrating continued focus by our employees in running our plants in the most efficient manner possible and the cost benefit of production levels that are now matching sales volume levels.
The cumulative effect of reducing aggregates inventory levels over the past two years allowed us to match production levels with sales levels in the third quarter, which contributed to the reduction in aggregates cost of sales. The average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 17% in the quarter reducing pretax earnings $4 million. Segment earnings in asphalt were $8 million lower than the prior year, due in part to a 14% increase in unit cost for liquid asphalt and lower selling prices. The year-over-year increase in liquid asphalt cost reduced asphalt earnings $6 million. Selling prices decreased 3% from the prior year, reducing segment earnings approximately $4 million.
Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lagged increasing liquid asphalt costs and were held in check due to competitive pressures. On a sequential basis, unit material margins for asphalt had been improving since the first quarter due to some improvement in pricing and a relatively stable liquid asphalt cost.
In the third quarter, unit material margins increased 10% on a sequential basis from the second quarter. Segment earnings in Concrete declined $9 million from the prior year, due principally to a decline in selling prices. Cement earnings in the third quarter were a loss of $2 million, due primarily to lower selling prices.
Turning to our outlook, let me start by saying that while the current construction environment remains challenging, our optimism that the worst is behind us continues to grow. Most GDP forecast take further growth in the overall U.S. economy. In past cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of recovery. Additionally, the growth state product of all Vulcan-served states has shown positive growth since the second quarter of 2009, an indication economic recovery is underway. As the general economy continues to recover, public construction, particularly highways, continues to provide solid support for our aggregates demand.
During September 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately half of the $27 billion of total stimulus funds obligated for highways is yet to be spent. In August, the Congressional Budget Office forecast total outlays for highway construction for the current fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, increased 7% from the year just ended. This projected increase includes a 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund as well as a continuation of stimulus funds. This projected increase in outlays for the regular highway funding program reflects a catch-up in obligating awarding and spending following a decline that occurred during the months just before and following the expiration of the six-year Highway Bill last September 30 when state departments of transportation were operating with limited funding visibility and limited contract authority, both resolved with the passing of the HIRE Act in March of this year. The 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund from the regular highway funding program this fiscal year as well as the projected increases in regular highway funding from a Highway Trust Fund through 2012 should continue to provide solid support for aggregates demand.
In Washington, we have been very pleased to see that the administration has now come out strongly in favor of sustained transportation infrastructure spending, calling for a multiyear Highway Bill as a key way to help lead the country out of recession and create jobs. 
In a significant and very positive report issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury on October 11 of this year, the administration has made a compelling case for major infrastructure investment now and going forward. The report points to the long-term economic benefits of the infrastructure investment, the disproportionate benefits received by the middle class and the strong pent-up demand from the public and private sectors. It also emphasizes the high level of unemployment in the construction sector, which has been at almost twice the national unemployment level and points to infrastructure investment as a key to creating and sustaining jobs.
The Treasury Department report entitled ""An Economic Analysis of Infrastructure Investment"" is available on the Department of Treasury's website. It also notes that 19 out of 20 Americans are concerned about America's infrastructure and that 84% support greater investment to address infrastructure problems.
Our company and the entire infrastructure community must make this case to a new Congress. In particular, this quote from the Treasury report is a key, and I'm quoting: ""Americans have voted repeatedly for increased investment in transportation infrastructure. In 2008 alone, over 80% of the 59 transportation infrastructure projects proposed in local referenda were approved by the public. Even more striking is that over 98% of the funds requested for these projects were approved by the voting public.""
In addition, major business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking Association support higher fuel taxes for highways to relieve congestion, improve transportation efficiencies and create jobs.
Private construction, particularly private non-residential construction, remains the most challenging sector overall. On the positive side, trailing 12-month single-family housing starts through September have increased 10% from the prior year. The rate of decline in private non-residential construction contract awards has slowed. The rate of decline in trailing 12-month contract awards has slowed in each of the last three quarters. The start of a recovery in this end market will be influenced by employment growth, business investment and lending activity.
Overall, pricing for our aggregates remain stable. A number of Vulcan-served markets were realizing meaningful year-over-year price growth, while pricing in certain other markets has declined due to competitive pressures from weak demand and the shifts in product mix. As a result, we expect pricing in the fourth quarter to approximate the prior year.
In our Asphalt business, material margins on each ton of asphalt mix sold have trended higher since the first quarter this year due to a relatively more stable cost environment for liquid asphalt. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. 
In our Concrete business, we expect sales volumes in the fourth quarter to increase from the prior year's fourth quarter, due mostly to the timing of some large projects in Florida. We expect pricing to decline due to competitive pressures. In our Cement businesses, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to approximate the prior year's results.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dan Sansone, our Chief Financial Officer, who will make a few comments related to our outlook for SAG, debt reduction and liquidity. Afterwards, I'll conclude our prepared remarks with a closing comment before taking your questions."

There are, however, a number of unusual items in the SAG category that I'd like to highlight. In the fourth quarter of last year, SAG costs included a non-cash charge of $8.5 million representing the fair market value of donated real estate. We do not anticipate a similar item in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Additionally, we recorded a non-cash charge of $9.2 million for donated real estate in the first quarter of this year, and we currently do not anticipate any similar charges or transactions in 2011.
The second significant item affecting SAG expenses, is our major ERP project, which began in 2008 soon after the acquisition of Florida Rock. This multiyear project is replacing Legacy systems and processes throughout the company, consolidating back-office activities and standardizing common processes and procedures. As of today, all of the Legacy Vulcan business units are operating on the new financial systems platform.
The Legacy Florida Rock division will transition onto the new platform in the first quarter of 2011. We will begin to implement the major non-accounting modules of the project early in 2011, with project completion anticipated in 2012. This initiative has had a material impact on our SAG expenses over the last couple of years.
Annual project cost peaked at 2009 at approximately $13 million. Project costs in 2010 should be approximately $2 million lower than last year, reflecting lower design and implementation costs and the beginning of the realization of cost reduction benefits. We expect a further reduction in net costs of approximately $6 million in 2011.
Interest expense for the full year 2010 is expected to be approximately $175 million based on current levels of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We expect to reduce total debt by $120 million by the end of 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for 2010 will be approximately $385 million. 
We have carefully reviewed our capital spending requirements relative to current demand levels. We now expect capital spending in 2010 to be approximately $100 million, down slightly from the $110 million spent in 2009 and down sharply from the $353 million spent in 2008. The sharp decrease in capital spending in the last two years results from lower production levels as well as the higher levels of capital spending during 2006 through 2008 that Don mentioned in his opening remarks. During that three-year period, cumulative capital spending totaled approximately $1.3 billion. These projects added reserves, increased production capacity, upgraded mobile equipment fleets and lowered production costs. 
Our aggregate plans and rolling stock were in very good condition going into this economic downturn. As a result, our capital spending needs have remained relatively modest. We have maintained the production capacity necessary to respond quickly and efficiently as demand recovers. 
And Don will now pick up with some closing remarks."

We will remain diligent in our efforts to look for every opportunity to cut costs, and we look forward to the opportunity of getting the great leverage in earnings that volume recovery will provide us. 
The underlying trends in trailing 12-month shipments have increased our optimism that the worst of this severe downturn may be behind us. We are in the process of reviewing our specific projections for next year, and we'll provide an outlook in February when we report our fourth quarter results. 
Our available production capacity which, as Dan pointed out, is in very good condition, positions Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in an increase in Federal Highway spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. By the second half of 2011, we expect a continued growth in the overall economy and an improving job market will begin driving an increase in private construction activity, accelerating the earnings leverage of the company. We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs. 
I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our Aggregates-focused business, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future.

That's a yes. It could be shorter, it could be a little longer. I think the real action, though, is assuming that the Republicans take control of the House, which seems to be most people's projection, we'll have a new Chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, probably John Michael from Florida. We believe, as I tried to indicate in my prepared remarks, that the administration, particularly the Treasury Department, is a very strong advocate for increased spending for infrastructure, and in particular highways for all the reasons I outlined and all the reasons stated in the report. This is really the first time the administration has come out strongly and said, ""We need a new multiyear surface transportation bill, and we need to get on with it because it is a key way to address unemployment and end up with an economically efficient system when we get through with it"". And their treasury in particular and Secretary Geithner, in particular, seem to be approaching this from a purely economic view and not such a political view. Now roll over to Congress. The political issue is going to be whether the Republican majority in the House feels it now has a joint responsibility for the economy. And I point it and I try to emphasize this, one of the points that we have to be able to make, and we is not just our company, but the entire transportation industry, is that voters support what I'll call user fees that are directly related to transportation improvements in their communities. Over and over and over again, that spending and that increased revenue is supported by voters. The point is, is that not all federal spending is bad and that there is public support as manifested through any number of activities for increased revenues and increased spending to relieve traffic congestion. The projections from the congressional commission that studied highway funding was $0.10 a gallon, fuel tax will raise an incremental $20 billion a year, and it will cost the average American family about $100 a year. And for that, they get all sorts of benefits including being able to get home and to work faster, having much lower repairs to their automobiles caused by poor surface conditions. So there's a tremendous amount of really good study and reports supporting it. We just got to make the case that voters will support it, and that's our challenge in this new Congress."

But assuming stability in liquid asphalt cost, then we would expect material margins would continue to improve as we're able to get somewhat higher prices for the mix. But the wildcard is the liquid asphalt input cost that we have very little influence and control over, we are seeing liquid asphalt producers for the first time in several years being willing to commit to pricing for longer than a 30-day period, which gives us some more stability in getting work with a firm liquid asphalt pricing.

Our big Midwestern markets are Tecumseh and Milwaukee, and they don't participate in those markets. They’re in Indianapolis and Ohio where we're not. Northern Virginia is a huge market for us. They really don't participate in that market. Florida, we have local production in Florida, and Martin Marietta has virtually none. So there's really a very small sort of overlap when you get to where we both participate. That being said, a lot of their volume growth seems to have come from shale gas and energy projects and markets, and we're not in the same markets they're in, but we are in some markets where that is a demand sector, and that has been significant. Remarkably, in North Carolina, there are big highway programs in the Raleigh market and in Eastern North Carolina and Western North Carolina is just sort of out-of-cycle highway projects right now. So there's probably a big difference in our North Carolina shipments even though we compete in relatively limited number of markets in North Carolina. So I don't think you can conclude from the disparity in price volume between the two companies that there's a market share shift going on in volume as a result of pricing. That's just not the case at least from our view. So I can't tell you specifically why their prices are down whatever it was, 3% or 4% and their volume was up 6% compared to ours.

We don't need that because we can supply Florida with high-quality limestone from our quarry on the Yucatán Peninsula by ship very efficiently. We expect that to close any time. We did sell three quarries up in rural Virginia, in markets that had been supported by textile and furniture manufacturing. And as you are aware, I'm sure, those industries are in great distress, and it just didn't make a lot of sense for us to continue to keep those in our portfolio. We continue to look at opportunities where we may have some quarries that are not end markets that are key to us or strategic to us where they may be more valuable to someone else than they are to us. That's not anything unusual. We'll continue to pursue those, but it's difficult for us to sell operations, pay taxes on it and make a lot of sense on an after-tax cash basis. So that's one of the impediments to continue to prune our portfolio. But we do continue to look at that and we'll continue, and we'll report them as they occur."

Running plants at off-peak hours from the standpoint of energy costs, particularly electrical energy cost, in many markets if we run our plants at off peak hours, we get much lower electric utility rates than if we run in the middle of the day and at summer time. SAG costs is an area in which we are continuing to focus. Dan Sansone gave you some input on that. Going to our new ERP system has allowed us to begin to reduce some overhead cost, and that project will continue to move forward in that area. Those are the principle. It's not one single place, it's really across-the-board from -- as I mentioned, about diesel fuel consumption, we monitor all sorts of labor productivity. That is tons per variable man-hour, tons per total man-hour. It's done on a plant-by-plant, month-by-month basis, so there aren't any secrets out there.

There's no secrets. They know our plans. They know our priorities. And they do a very good job of tracking the industry and the company's performance. The issue with the agencies at the moment is frankly that our one single metric, debt to EBITDA has crept higher as our EBITDA has drifted lower in this cyclical downturn. And that metric, more than any is the one that's under the greatest pressure with the agencies. And it's the one that probably contributes the most to the current rating and to the threat of a downgrade. I certainly am not in a position to speak for what the agencies will choose to do when they see these numbers and when they see our numbers at the end of the year. But I think psychologically, we have a tendency to think of a movement from -- and I'll use the S&P rating just for simplicity, BBB- to a BB+ rating from investment grade to a non-investment grade as some sort of a huge step function it is. In terms of the financial markets, it's not nearly as dramatic a change. Certainly, a downgrade is not something we're hoping for, and we're trying to do the reasonable things we can do to manage for the current rating. But if we were to get downgraded, the incremental effect on our borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things is not very significant. Put differently, I don't think you should expect us to go to draconian measures to try to protect the current investment grade rating at the expense of -- at some extreme expense. In the current term loan that we put in place in July of this year I believe that if we were to get downgraded one notch, it would add 25 basis points to the borrowing spread over LIBOR. It's not the end of the world. If you look at indicative bond pricing in today's market, if we were a full notch lower by both agencies, it would add less than 100 basis points to the indicative coupon rates, and in today's market, that would bring in coupon rates that are still lower than the coupon rates the we have with the debt that was issued in 2007 and 2008. So yes, we worry about it. Yes, we communicate extensively with the agencies. Yes, we're very sensitive to it, but you won't see us turn the table upside down to protect it at all costs."

Thank you for joining this conference call to discuss Vulcan's third quarter results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials.

I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as Ron McAbee and Danny Shepherd, our Senior Vice Presidents for Construction Materials.
 Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
 As you know, last night, after the market closed, we released our third quarter earnings. In the third quarter, our EBITDA was $150 million, and our net earnings were $13 million. Cash earnings were $116 million, up slightly from the prior year's third quarter and approximately $103 million more than our reported net earnings. This continuing contrast between our cash earnings and reported net earnings is primarily attributable to relatively high levels of non-cash DD&A charges contrasted with lower levels of production. The higher levels of DD&A come from two sources: first, almost $101.3 billion in CapEx over the years just prior to the recession from 2006 through 2008, which added reserves, increased production capacity, replaced equipment and improved cost; and second, from the wind-up of the Florida Rock assets through purchase accounting.
 One of the benefits of this higher CapEx in prior years is that we will be able to produce substantially higher tonnages of aggregates with relatively little additional CapEx above current levels. And one of the benefits of higher production levels going forward will be to spread this DD&A over more tons, which will leverage our GAAP earnings. Dan Sansone will give you more details on our CapEx spending toward the end of our remarks today.
 Before I discuss segment results supporting these third quarter earnings, let me start by highlighting several underlying trends we are following that could benefit our earnings opportunities going forward. Shipping trends and aggregates continue to improve in the third quarter. Trailing 12-month aggregate shipments have been increasing since February, and asphalt and concrete trailing 12-month shipments have been relatively stable since May and February, respectively.
 Our continued focus on controlling costs and managing production levels to current demand contributed to lower cost of sales and aggregates excluding energy cost, through sequential improvement in material margins for asphalt, and to a reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Some aspects of our cost structure are outside our control in the short term, such as energy and the impact of lower demand levels on production costs. However, we believe there's always room for improvement and controllable cost. Overall, we're pleased with our continuing progress in managing our costs, our inventory levels and our cash earnings.
 Third quarter segment earnings in aggregates were $125 million compared to $133 million in the prior year. Aggregate shipments declined 2.6% from the prior year's third quarter, accounting for most of the year-over-year decline in segment earnings. All of the decline in shipments can be attributed to a strike in July in Chicago, affecting our customers' employees for most of that month.
 Aggregates pricing in the third quarter was in line with the prior year, reflecting mild variations across Vulcan-served markets. Many major market realized price improvement from the prior year's third quarter. Other markets have remained challenging due to competitive pressures arising from reduced demand, higher transportation cost and in some cases, from mix shifts.
 Excluding the impact of higher energy cost, unit cost of sales for aggregates declined 2% from the prior year, demonstrating continued focus by our employees in running our plants in the most efficient manner possible and the cost benefit of production levels that are now matching sales volume levels.
 The cumulative effect of reducing aggregates inventory levels over the past two years allowed us to match production levels with sales levels in the third quarter, which contributed to the reduction in aggregates cost of sales. The average unit cost for diesel fuel increased 17% in the quarter reducing pretax earnings $4 million. Segment earnings in asphalt were $8 million lower than the prior year, due in part to a 14% increase in unit cost for liquid asphalt and lower selling prices. The year-over-year increase in liquid asphalt cost reduced asphalt earnings $6 million. Selling prices decreased 3% from the prior year, reducing segment earnings approximately $4 million.
 Selling prices for asphalt mix generally lagged increasing liquid asphalt costs that were held in check due to competitive pressures. On a sequential basis, unit material margins for asphalt had been improving since the first quarter due to some improvement in pricing and a relatively stable liquid asphalt cost.
 In the third quarter, unit material margins increased 10% on a sequential basis from the second quarter. Segment earnings in Concrete declined $9 million from the prior year, due principally to a decline in selling prices. Cement earnings in the third quarter were a loss of $2 million, due primarily to lower selling prices.
 Turning to our outlook, let me start by saying that while the current construction environment remains challenging, our optimism that the worst is behind us continues to grow. Most GDP forecast take further growth in the overall U.S. economy. In past cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of recovery. Additionally, the growth state product of all Vulcan-served states has shown positive growth since the second quarter of 2009, an indication economic recovery is underway. As the general economy continues to recover, public construction, particularly highways, continues to provide solid support for our aggregates demand.
 During September 2010, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately half of the $27 billion of total stimulus funds obligated for highways is yet to be spent. In August, the Congressional Budget Office forecast total outlays for highway construction for the current fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, increased 7% from the year just ended. This projected increase includes a 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund as well as a continuation of stimulus funds. This projected increase in outlays for the regular highway funding program reflects a catch-up in obligating awarding and spending following a decline that occurred during the months just before and following the expiration of the six-year Highway Bill last September 30 when state departments of transportation were operating with limited funding visibility and limited contract authority, both resolved with the passing of the HIRE Act in March of this year. The 14% increase in outlays from the Highway Trust Fund from the regular highway funding program this fiscal year as well as the projected increases in regular highway funding from a Highway Trust Fund through 2012 should continue to provide solid support for aggregates demand.
 In Washington, we have been very pleased to see that the administration has now come out strongly in favor of sustained transportation infrastructure spending, calling for a multiyear Highway Bill as a key way to help lead the country out of recession and create jobs.
 In a significant and very positive report issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury on October 11 of this year, the administration has made a compelling case for major infrastructure investment now and going forward. The report points to the long-term economic benefits of the infrastructure investment, the disproportionate benefits received by the middle class and the strong pent-up demand from the public and private sectors. It also emphasizes the high level of unemployment in the construction sector, which has been at almost twice the national unemployment level and points to infrastructure investment as a key to creating and sustaining jobs.
 The Treasury Department report entitled ""An Economic Analysis of Infrastructure Investment"" is available on the Department of Treasury's website. It also notes that 19 out of 20 Americans are concerned about America's infrastructure and that 84% support greater investment to address infrastructure problems.
 Our company and the entire infrastructure community must make this case to a new Congress. In particular, this quote from the Treasury report is a key, and I'm quoting: ""Americans have voted repeatedly for increased investment in transportation infrastructure. In 2008 alone, over 80% of the 59 transportation infrastructure projects proposed in local referenda were approved by the public. Even more striking is that over 98% of the funds requested for these projects were approved by the voting public.""
 In addition, major business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking Association support higher fuel taxes for highways to relieve congestion, improve transportation efficiencies and create jobs.
 Private construction, particularly private non-residential construction, remains the most challenging sector overall. On the positive side, trailing 12-month single-family housing starts through September have increased 10% from the prior year. The rate of decline in private non-residential construction contract awards has slowed. The rate of decline in trailing 12-month contract awards has slowed in each of the last three quarters. The start of a recovery in this end market will be influenced by employment growth, business investment and lending activity.
 Overall, pricing for our aggregates remain stable. A number of Vulcan-served markets were realizing meaningful year-over-year price growth, while pricing in certain other markets has declined due to competitive pressures from weak demand and the shifts in product mix. As a result, we expect pricing in the fourth quarter to approximate the prior year.
 In our Asphalt business, material margins on each ton of asphalt mix sold have trended higher since the first quarter this year due to a relatively more stable cost environment for liquid asphalt. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter.
 In our Concrete business, we expect sales volumes in the fourth quarter to increase from the prior year's fourth quarter, due mostly to the timing of some large projects in Florida. We expect pricing to decline due to competitive pressures. In our Cement businesses, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to approximate the prior year's results.
 Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dan Sansone, our Chief Financial Officer, who will make a few comments related to our outlook for SAG, debt reduction and liquidity. Afterwards, I'll conclude our prepared remarks with a closing comment before taking your questions.

There are, however, a number of unusual items in the SAG category that I'd like to highlight. In the fourth quarter of last year, SAG costs included a non-cash charge of $8.5 million representing the fair market value of donated real estate. We do not anticipate a similar item in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 Additionally, we recorded a non-cash charge of $9.2 million for donated real estate in the first quarter of this year, and we currently do not anticipate any similar charges or transactions in 2011.
 The second  significant item affecting SAG expenses, is our major ERP project, which began in 2008 soon after the acquisition of Florida Rock. This multiyear project is replacing Legacy systems and processes throughout the company, consolidating back-office activities and standardizing common processes and procedures. As of today, all of the Legacy Vulcan business units are operating on the new financial systems platform.
 The Legacy Florida Rock division will transition onto the new platform in the first quarter of 2011. We will begin to implement the major non-accounting modules of the project early in 2011, with project completion anticipated in 2012. This initiative has had a material impact on our SAG expenses over the last couple of years.
 Annual project cost peaked at 2009 at approximately $13 million. Project costs in 2010 should be approximately $2 million lower than last year, reflecting lower design and implementation costs and the beginning of the realization of cost reduction benefits. We expect a further reduction in net costs of approximately $6 million in 2011.
 Interest expense for the full year 2010 is expected to be approximately $175 million based on current levels of interest rates and a reduced level of capitalized interest on capital projects. We expect to reduce total debt by $120 million by the end of 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for 2010 will be approximately $385 million.
 We have carefully reviewed our capital spending requirements relative to current demand levels. We now expect capital spending in 2010 to be approximately $100 million, down slightly from the $110 million spent in 2009 and down sharply from the $353 million spent in 2008. The sharp decrease in capital spending in the last two years results from lower production levels as well as the higher levels of capital spending during 2006 through 2008 that Don mentioned in his opening remarks. During that three-year period, cumulative capital spending totaled approximately $1.3 billion. These projects added reserves, increased production capacity, upgraded mobile equipment fleets and lowered production costs.
 Our aggregates plans and rolling stock were in very good condition going into this economic downturn. As a result, our capital spending needs have remained relatively modest. We have maintained the production capacity necessary to respond quickly and efficiently as demand recovers.
 And Don will now pick up with some closing remarks.

We will remain diligent in our efforts to look for every opportunity to cut costs, and we look forward to the opportunity of getting the great leverage in earnings that volume recovery will provide us.
 The underlying trends in trailing 12-month shipments have increased our optimism that the worst of this severe downturn may be behind us. We are in the process of reviewing our specific projections for next year, and we'll provide an outlook in February when we report our fourth quarter results.
 Our available production capacity which, as Dan pointed out, is in very good condition, positions Vulcan to participate efficiently and effectively in an increase in Federal Highway spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. By the second half of 2011, we expect a continued growth in the overall economy and an improving job market will begin driving an increase in private construction activity, accelerating the earnings leverage of the company. We are the clear leader in the U.S. aggregates industry and are well positioned for significant participation in the economic recovery and in public infrastructure programs.
 I would like to reiterate our confidence in future sales and earnings growth for Vulcan. This confidence comes from our successful strategy to continue strengthening our Aggregates-focused business, which has the compelling advantage of great locations in major U.S. markets that are expected to experience above-average growth in aggregates demand for many years into the future.
 We thank you for your interest in Vulcan. Now if our operator will give the required instruction, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.

We're pleased to see that we expect our volume to be up, particularly in Florida, but it's related to some large projects that we've booked earlier. Ready Mix is much more heavily dependent on private construction than aggregates and asphalt are, and I think Ready Mix will continue to have some pressure on pricing.

So we look at that business differently than a pure Ready Mix producer might.

I wouldn't bet on it. I think that's going to be short, and I would expect the current extension of contract authority and funding levels for highways will be further extended in the lame-duck session, probably for six months. That's a yes. It could be shorter, it could be a little longer. I think the real action, though, is assuming that the Republicans take control of the House, which seems to be most people's projection, we'll have a new Chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, probably John Michael from Florida. We believe, as I tried to indicate in my prepared remarks, that the administration, particularly the Treasury Department, is a very strong advocate for increased spending for infrastructure, and in particular highways for all the reasons I outlined and all the reasons stated in the report. This is really the first time the administration has come out strongly and said, ""we need a new multiyear surface transportation bill, and we need to get on with it because it is a key way to address unemployment and end up with an economically efficient system when we get through with it"". And their treasury in particular and Secretary Geithner, in particular, seem to be approaching this from a purely economic view and not such a political view. Now roll over to Congress. The political issue is going to be whether the Republican majority in the House feels it now has a joint responsibility for the economy. And I point it and I try to emphasize this, one of the points that we have to be able to make, and we is not just our company, but the entire transportation industry, is that voters support what I'll call user fees that are directly related to transportation improvements in their communities. Over and over and over again, that spending and that increased revenue is supported by voters. The point is, is that not all federal spending is bad and that there is public support as manifested through any number of activities for increased revenues and increased spending to relieve traffic congestion. The projections from the congressional commission that studied highway funding was $0.10 a gallon, fuel tax will raise an incremental $20 billion a year, and it will cost the average American family about $100 a year. And for that, they get all sorts of benefits including being able to get home and to work faster, having much lower repairs to their automobiles caused by poor surface conditions. So there's a tremendous amount of really good study and reports supporting it. We just got to make the case that voters will support it, and that's our challenge in this new Congress.

And obviously, public infrastructure is a very large end market for asphalt, much more so than for concrete. And that's the one place that we're seeing relatively strong growth in funding and demand. And as a result of that, assuming the wildcard here is what happens to liquid asphalt cost. But assuming stability in liquid asphalt cost, then we would expect material margins would continue to improve as we're able to get somewhat higher prices for the mix. But the wildcard is the liquid asphalt input cost that we have very little influence and control over, we are seeing liquid asphalt producers for the first time in several years being willing to commit to pricing for longer than a 30-day period, which gives us some more stability in getting work with a firm liquid asphalt pricing. And that's a phenomenon that we haven't seen since probably three or four years ago.

And once cold weather hits, we expect a lot of our customers will close up for the year and go home and then crank back up next spring when the weather improves. So how much of that gets caught up this year really depends upon how long the construction season lasts in Chicago.

And then once again, the $120 million in debt reduction or total debt reduction, I'm struggling with that a bit as well, Dan, because the way I would calculate that would to use the short-term borrowings and the long-term debt and that seemed to be up about $80 million in the nine months.

Our California, Arizona, New Mexico markets, they don't participate in. We don't participate in their Mountain West markets and their upper Midwest markets like Nebraska and Iowa. Our big Midwestern markets are Tecumseh and Milwaukee, and they don't participate in those markets there and Indianapolis and Ohio where we're not. Northern Virginia is a huge market for us. They really don't participate in that market. Florida, we have local production in Florida, and part Marietta has virtually none. So there's really a very small sort of overlap when you get to where we both participate. That being said, a lot of their volume growth seems to have come from shale gas and energy projects and markets, and we're not in the same markets they're in, but we are in some markets where that is a demand sector, and that has been significant. Remarkably, in North Carolina, there are big highway programs in the Raleigh market and in Eastern North Carolina and Western North Carolina is just sort of out-of-cycle highway projects right now. So there's probably a big difference in our North Carolina shipments even though we compete in relatively limited number of markets in North Carolina. So I don't think you can conclude from the disparity in price volume between the two companies that there's a market share shift going on in volume as a result of pricing. That's just not the case at least from our view. So I can't tell you specifically why their prices are down whatever it was, 3% or 4% and their volume was up 6% compared to ours. We've got enough to worry about with our business and not worry about theirs.

Even though it's a slow period for shipments, we're pulling working capital down from the seasonally strong second and third quarters, particularly receivables. Secondly, the fourth quarter of this year will generate some additional cash for less exciting reasons. As a byproduct of the weak operating results we had, we're generating tax credits and not paying income tax. And we're actually able to apply those credits against prior year taxes paid. So we'll be bringing approximately $35 million from the treasury back to the company in the fourth quarter of this year for refunds from prior tax periods as well.

We don't need that because we can supply Florida with high-quality limestone from our core on the Yucatán Yucatán Peninsula by ship very efficiently. We expect that to close any time. We did sell three quarries up in rural Virginia, in markets that had been supported by textile and furniture manufacturing. And as you are aware, I'm sure, those industries are in great distress, and it just didn't make a lot of sense for us to continue to keep those in our portfolio. We continue to look at opportunities where we may have some quarries that are not end markets that are key to us or strategic to us where they may be more valuable to someone else than they are to us. That's not anything unusual. We'll continue to pursue those, but it's difficult for us to sell operations, pay taxes on it and make a lot of sense on an after-tax cash basis. So that's one of the impediments to continue to prune our portfolio. But we do continue to look at that and we'll continue, and we'll report them as they occur.

It's just it's very difficult to get in this market to be able to go into our customer and justify a price increase when they're having great difficulty maintaining the price of their product, i.e. concrete or asphalt mix.

And with volume recovery, I think we'll be able to resume some price improvement, hopefully well in excess of cost escalation in our production side.

Running plants at off-peak hours from the standpoint of energy costs, particularly electrical energy cost, in many markets if we run our plants at all peak hours, we get much lower electric utility rates than if we run in the middle of the day and at summer time. SAG costs is an area in which we are continuing to focus then since we only gave you some input on that. Going to our new ERP system has allowed us to begin to reduce some overhead cost, and that project will continue to move forward in that area. The principle it's not one single place, it's really across-the-board from -- as I mentioned, about diesel fuel consumption, we monitor all sorts of labor productivity. That is tons per variable man-hour, tons per total man-hour. It's done on a plant-by-plant, month-by-month basis, so there aren't any secrets out there. The plants that are doing great jobs show up, and the plants that need some work are also showing up. And so that's an emphasis for us, and it's small. It's pennies a ton, in 250 quarries. That's what the focus is.

There's no secrets. They know our plans. They know our priorities. And they do a very good job of tracking the industry and the company's performance. The issue with the agencies at the moment is frankly that our one single metric, debt to EBITDA has crept higher as our EBITDA has drifted lower in this cyclical downturn. And that metric, more than any is the one that's under the greatest pressure with the agencies. And it's the one that probably contributes the most to the current rating and to the threat of a downgrade. I certainly I'm not in a position to speak for what the agencies will choose to do when they see these numbers and when they see our numbers at the end of the year. But I think psychologically, we have a tendency to think of a movement from -- and I'll use the S&P rating just for simplicity, BBB- to a BB+ rating from investment grade to a non-investment grade as some sort of a huge step function it is. In terms of the financial markets, it's not nearly as dramatic a change. Certainly, a downgrade is not something we're hoping for, and we're trying to do the reasonable things we can do to manage for the current rating. But if we were to get downgraded, the incremental effect on our borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things is not very significant. Put differently, I don't think you should expect us to go to draconian measures to try to protect the current investment grade rating at the expense of -- at some extreme expense. In the current term loan that we put in place in July of this year I believe that if we were to get downgraded one notch, it would add 25 basis points to the borrowing spread over LIBOR. It's not the end of the world. If you look at indicative bond pricing in today's market, if we were a full notch lower by both agencies, it would add less than 100 basis points to the indicative coupon rates, and in today's market, that would bring in coupon rates that are still lower than the coupon rates the we have with the debt that was issued in 2007 and 2008. So yes, we worry about it. Yes, we communicate extensively with the agencies. Yes, we're very sensitive to it, but you won't see us turn the table upside down to protect it at all costs.
