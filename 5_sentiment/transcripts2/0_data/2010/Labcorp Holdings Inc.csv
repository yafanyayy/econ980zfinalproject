By now you should have had a chance to review our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. On today’s call I’ll discuss four key measures of our financial performance, cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity.
First, cash flow. Our cash flow trends remain excellent. Free cash flow for the year increased 19.8% to $747.7 million compared to $624.2 million in 2008, net of transition payments to United Healthcare.
We’re also pleased with our strong cash collection efforts in the quarter and throughout 2009 as evidenced by significant improvement in DSO. DSO at the end of December was 44 days, an improvement of seven days year-over-year and down four days sequentially. Our bad debt rate was stable at 5.3%.
Second, revenue growth, excluding the special charge in 2008, revenue increased 3.4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we achieved strong growth in revenue per requisition which increased 4.3% year-over-year. The growth of revenue per requisition is attributable to both rate increases and mix shift.
Total Company volume decreased 0.9% year-over-year. Excluding the consolidation of the Company’s Ontario, Canada joint venture, volume decreased 1.5% year-over-year.
As we have previously discussed, the termination of two large government contracts at the end of the second quarter reduced volume by 1.5%. Declines in our drugs of abuse testing business reduced volume by 40 basis points. Also, weather accounted for a 30 basis point reduction in our volume. Excluding these items, volume increased by 0.7% in the quarter. Esoteric volume increased 6.8% in the quarter.
Third, margin, for the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 19%. This margin decreased 50 basis points year-over-year due primarily to our acquisition of Monogram Biosciences.
Fourth, liquidity, we remain well-capitalized. At the end of December we had cash of $148.5 million and approximately $386 million available under our revolving line of credit. At the end of December, total debt was $1.4 billion, including $75 million drawn down on our revolving credit facility.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $108.4 million of stock representing approximately 1.5 million shares. At the end of December, approximately $71.8 million of repurchased authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program.
Today, the company announced that its board of directors has authorized a new stock repurchase program under which LabCorp may purchase up to an aggregate of an additional $250 million of its common stock.
This morning we announced 2010 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Adjusted EPS in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after December 31, 2009.
Operating cash flow of approximately $870 million, excluding any transition payments made to United Healthcare and capital expenditures of approximately $135 million. We expect volume growth to remain challenging during the year, given the headwinds from previously mentioned contract losses and the economic environment.
Our pricing outlook is positive, despite the 1.9% reduction in the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule. We will receive price increases from several large payers in 2010.
I’ll now turn the call over to Dave.

We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2009 results and I would like to highlight our accomplishments over the last year. During 2009, we grew our revenue by 4% despite the challenging economic environment. Importantly, we also grew our esoteric revenue by approximately 9%. We accelerated our cash collections and kept our bad debt rate at 5.3%. Our DSO improved 7 days from the fourth quarter of 2008.
We continued to invest strategically, purchasing Monogram Biosciences in August to enhance our industry leadership in companion diagnostics, infectious disease -and oncology testing. The integration of Monogram remains on track.
We strengthened our capital structure by redeeming half of our zero coupon notes, eliminating uncertainty related to potential future conversion of these securities. We repurchased nearly 4 million shares of our stock for $237.5 million. And we kept a tight lid on expenses and implemented important steps in automation that yielded improvement in our gross margin.
I will now address our volume growth. Consistent with our commentary throughout the year, we saw volume growth slow in the second half of the year. Job losses leading to declines in the number of commercially insured lives, fewer physician visits and the timing of cobra and severance expirations had a negative impact on our fourth quarter volumes.
Also, as Brad mentioned, our fourth quarter volumes were negatively impacted by lost contracts, declines in our drugs of abuse testing and weather. After adjusting for all of these factors, volume increased by 0.7% in the fourth quarter.
I would now like to highlight our priorities for 2010. First, we will continue to focus on generating profitable revenue growth with a continued emphasis on growing our esoteric testing.
Second, we will continue to enhance our IT platforms with a focus on online services, client connectivity and analytic tools. We will also continue to improve the patient experience through such initiatives as online appointment scheduling and automating the work flow in our patient service centers. We will introduce a number of additional IT enhancements throughout 2010.
Third, we will maintain scientific leadership. We will continue to introduce new tests to respond to scientific discoveries, improve patient care and outcomes and satisfy unmet medical needs.
Fourth, we will maintain pricing discipline. Finally, we will continue our aggressive management of costs. In summary, we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities that lie ahead and we are well-positioned to capitalize on them.
Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.

In the fourth quarter approximately 37% of our revenues were in the genomics, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. Our goal over the next three years to five years is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 40% of revenue.
What are your plans for uses of free cash flow during 2010? We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders. First, by using our free cash flow to grow our business through strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements. And second, through continuing our approved share repurchase programs.
The acquisition market remains attractive with a number of opportunities to strengthen our scientific capabilities, grow our esoteric testing franchise and increase our presence in key geographic areas.
Historically, we have been a consistent buyer of our own shares. Since the beginning of 2006, the company has repurchased approximately $2 billion worth of its stock.
Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse volume trended during the year? In the quarter, our drugs of abuse volume declined 6.5% year-over-year. That compares to year-over-year decreases of 15% in Q3 of this year, 19% in Q2 of this year, 20.1% in Q1 of this year and 15.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008.
What is the status of your transition payments to United Healthcare? In the quarter, the company was billed $6.7 million in transition payments and paid $3.9 million in transition payments. To-date, LabCorp has been billed a total of $108.7 million and paid $102.8 million in transition payments to United Healthcare.
As a reminder, the end of the fourth quarter marked the end of our obligation to reimburse United Healthcare for transition payments outlined within the United Healthcare contract. We expect the final invoices for these payments to be processed over the next two quarters and we continue to expect the final amount to be in the range of $125 million. We will update you on these final payments going forward.
Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Dave.

Yes, as you see in the improvement in gross margin in the year-over-year numbers, the impact of the 2010 initiatives is starting to take hold. And what I think is significant there is that in spite of the one-time items that we previously mentioned, we still demonstrated an increase in gross margins. So the things we’re doing around laboratory automation and the work flow improvement are starting to show up in the numbers. I don’t think it’s particularly helpful to talk about where exactly the dollars are coming from because I think what you see is the aggregate dollars that are reflected from the 2010 programs in the cost run rate.
I will say, obviously, we haven’t reduced bad debt. That was part of the 2010 initiatives. It is still our goal to be able to reduce bad debt and we’d like to do that in 2010, but that will depend on how we see the payment side of the equation developing over the year, because we had a terrific year from a cash collection standpoint and a terrific year in terms of reducing DSO, but we want to make sure that’s going to be sustainable as we continue in this pretty tough economic environment.

You’ve talked about the Monogram deal closing in the August timeframe, you had centrics at the end of 2009, you had consolidation in JV, so, if I run the numbers back of the envelope it would appear that if you exclude all of that and normalize for organic growth, if you will, the guidance calls for a 2% growth number. So just trying to understand exactly what you’re seeing, are you baking in greater deterioration in terms of volume and/or pricing or does it speak to maybe some level of conservatism on your part in terms of the guidance?

So to me, the guidance includes Monogram, but Monogram is part of our company and the guidance includes centrics, but centrics is part of our company.
So, I always hesitate to put labels like conservative or liberal on anything, whether it’s politicians or financial guidance, but the guidance is intended and that’s why we give a range to encompass what we see as the potential range of outcomes and it’s going to be dependent on what happens from an economic perspective, what happens from jobs perspective, what happens from the how many commercially insured managed care lives are growing or decreasing in 2010. And I think all of those things will have a good deal of impact in determining where we end up in the guidance range.

I think we said throughout the year that that was something that we expected, partly because of annualizing of acquisitions, partly because of the overall economic environment.
I think any numbers that you look at, Ralph, support the proposition that the economic environment is having a significant effect on health care in general. Physician office visits down, according to IMS pretty significantly in the fourth quarter year over year, especially among specialty physicians and just looking at managed care commercial membership as reported by the managed care companies, Sigma down 5.5%, United down 6%, WellPoint down 3.8%, Humana down 5.8%. So that’s 44% of our revenue comes from managed care and four of our largest payers have significantly negative experience during the year on commercial lives. You have to have the expectation that that’s going to have an impact on overall volumes.

Once we closed the acquisition, one of the first steps that we took was to obviously compare the list of accounts that we’re sending to Monogram with a list of accounts sent to LabCorp, so, our first targeted approach has been approach accounts that are sending infectious disease testing to Monogram, but are not sending the peripheral blood testing or other types of testing to LabCorp and, likewise, customers that are sending testing to LabCorp and including infectious disease testing, but are sending their high end esoteric testing elsewhere.
So that is already in process and has been part of our sales initiative since the point that we closed. For the rest of the year, as I mentioned, the naive indication for sales entry, the launch of the Vive [ph] partnership for the selling of sales entry will be catalysts for growing the selling and the utilization of the Trofile test.
Other major initiative is the incorporation of the HERmark test into our oncology sales force so that now representatives who are selling HER2 testing will also have the ability from that same tissue, same specimen from the physician to sell the HERmark testing. So those are probably the three key initiatives. What we need to achieve with Monogram this year is not only expense reduction, but top-line revenue growth.

By now, you should've had a chance to review our first quarter results. On today's call, I will discuss four key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. 
First, cash flow. Our cash flow trends remain excellent. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2010 increased 17% to $777 million compared to $663.9 million in 2009, net of transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. 
We're also pleased with our strong cash collection efforts in the quarter as evidenced by a significant improvement in DSO. DSO at the end of March was 46 days, an improvement of six days year-over-year. Although DSO increased two days sequentially, this increase is typical from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. As a result of our success in cash collections, we reduced our bad debt rate by 25 basis points. 
Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 3.3% year-over-year in the first quarter. During the quarter, we achieved strong growth in revenue per requisition, which increased 6.4% year-over-year. The growth in revenue per requisition is attributable to mix shift, increases in tests per requisition and rate increases. The revenue growth per requisition was also impacted by the Canadian exchange rate, Monogram and the lost government contracts, which together improved the revenue per requisition by 3.5%.
Total company volume decreased 3% year-over-year. Excluding Canada, volume decreased 3.3% year-over-year. Inclement weather had significant impact on the first quarter, resulting in an estimated 1.3% reduction in our volumes. Also, the termination of two large government contracts at the end of the second quarter of 2009 reduced volume by 2.4%. Excluding these items, domestic volume increased 0.4% in the quarter. Esoteric volume increased by 5.3% in the quarter. We estimate that bad weather lowered revenue by $23 million and EPS by $0.08 in the quarter
Third, margin. For the first quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 20.4%. This margin decreased 40 basis points year-over-year due primarily to the impact of weather.
Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of March, we had cash of $172.2 million and approximately $440 million available under our revolving line of credit. 
At the end of March, total debt was $1.3 billion, including $20 million drawn down on our revolving credit facility. During the first quarter, we repurchased $105.7 million of stock representing approximately 1.4 million shares. At the end of March, approximately $216.1 million of repurchased authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program.
This morning, we reaffirmed our 2010 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5%; adjusted EPS in the range of $5.35 to $5.55 excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after March 31, 2010; operating cash flow of approximately $870 million excluding any transition payments made to UnitedHealthcare; and capital expenditures of approximately $135 million.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

Despite severe weather, we grew revenue by 3.3%. We also grew esoteric revenue by approximately 5.2%. Taking into account weather and the previously lost contracts, total company volume increased by 0.5%. Revenue per requisition remains strong, increasing 6.4%.
Our continuing focus on optimizing our business would have resulted in operating margin expansion but for the impact of weather. In addition, gross profit margin expanded year-over-year by 20 basis points in the quarter and would've expanded further, but for the weather impact. This is a good indicator of the success of our key initiatives to optimize our business. I will briefly discuss these initiatives, which are focused on enhancing the patient and physician experience.
First, we continue to improve the patient experience through online appointment scheduling and automating the workflow in our Patient Service Centers. More than 80% of the patients that visit our Patient Service Centers now have access to our online appointment scheduling, and they have responded favorably to it. 
Patients can now schedule appointment times that are convenient for them and typically get in and out of our facilities within approximately 10 minutes. Later this year, we will introduce second-generation online appointment scheduling, which will provide further improvements for our patients. 
We have also automated the workflow system in our Patient Service Centers to guide our phlebotomist through the specimen collection process via a pictorial, touch screen interface. The system provides standardized processes across our Patient Service Centers, helping to eliminate unnecessary steps and improving speed and accuracy in the collection process.
Second, we continue to make significant strides in our lab automation through our Protedyne subsidiary. This automation improves throughput, speed and accuracy of testing and improves turnaround time, giving physicians and patients faster access to even more reliable results.
Third, we continue to enhance our IT capabilities with a focus on online services, client connectivity and analytic tools. As part of our ""open platform"" strategy, we interface with thousands of the EMR and EHR systems enabling physicians to easily order testing and receive results. Later this year, we will roll out IT improvements that will make it easier for physicians to order testing and receive actionable diagnostic information from LabCorp.
As we've said, our strategy is to be the leader in personalized diagnostic medicine. The realization of the potential of personalized medicine will be heavily dependent on the identification of markers and genetic characteristics of disease. 
Yesterday, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Duke University Medical Center to commercialize such biomarkers. The Biomarker Factory is designed to discover, validate and translate new biomarkers into widely available clinical tools that can measure individual therapeutic responses, predict disease progression and evaluate biologic or disease-causing processes. Biomarkers are currently being used in developing treatments for many forms of cancer as well as for many diseases such as Alzheimer's, cardiovascular, and hepatitis C. 
The Biomarker Factory will position LabCorp squarely on the pathway from the research bench to the physician office. This venture will contribute to the realization of the promise of individualized medicine and will assist physicians in understanding how to use newly-developed biomarkers to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs. 
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and remain very excited about our future growth opportunities and the strategic initiatives that will help us to capitalize on them. Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions."

Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing?  In the first quarter approximately 36% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. Our goal over the next three to five year",323,"Thank you, Dave. Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing?  In the first quarter approximately 36% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. Our goal over the next three to five years is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 40% of revenue. 
What are your plans for uses of free cash flow during 2010? We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders first, by using our free cash flow to grow our business through strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements; and second, through continuing our approved share repurchase programs. The acquisition market remains attractive with a number of opportunities to strengthen our scientific capabilities, grow our esoteric testing franchise and increase our presence in key geographic areas. Historically, we have been a consistent buyer of our own shares. Since the beginning of 2006, the company has repurchased approximately $2 billion worth of its stock. 
Can you remind us of how drugs-of-abuse volume trended during the year? In the quarter, our drugs-of-abuse volume increased 6.8% year-over-year. That compares to year-over-year decreases of 6.5% in Q4 of 2009. 15% in Q3 of 2009, 19% in Q2 of 2009 and 20.1% in Q1 of 2009. 
What is the status of your transition payments to UnitedHealthcare? In the quarter, the company was billed $10.1 million in transition payments and paid $14.5 million in transition payments. To date, LabCorp has been billed a total of $118.8 million and paid $117.3 million in transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. As a reminder, our obligation to reimburse UnitedHealthcare for transition payments ended on December 31, 2009. We expect the final invoices for these payments to be processed over the next quarter, and we continue to expect the final amount to be in the range of $125 million. We will update you on these final payments next quarter. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave."

Typically, after a severe weather event, we do see a small increase in volume in the next several days. But clearly, it doesn't all come back. And the reason I say that is if you think about who's getting testing -- first of all, on days when doctors' offices are closed, people are just not going to the doctor. And whether those patients all come back or don't come back, we have no way of knowing. Second of all, you have the person who goes to the doctor's office and gets a slip for a blood drawn. And then there's weather, and then they can't get to the Patient Service Center for two or three days, and they feel better. So they just don't go, and that volume doesn't entirely come back. So you can't look at weather and say we lost this much, but we gained this much back. I think the way we quantify it is we look at what is the typical experience given the day of the week, the month, the strength of the day, how much did we see a decline. Offset that by if we saw anything unusual immediately following, and that's how we reach the quantification."

And there are some contributors to that, that will more than likely annualize during the year, the Monogram acquisition we mentioned. The Canadian exchange rate would be one that's hard to call. The lost contracts, we will annualize for certain. So I would expect to see that number moderate over the course of the year, and then volume would need to be there to offset it.

I think in the competitive -- and I should say there, you know I'm optimistic that as part of overall health care reform, there will be a hard look in Washington at what does insourcing and these types of activities do to utilization? And from regulatory perspective, what should be permitted? So I don't think the insourcing trend is going to continue forever. We go back to the history of the shell labs and the pod labs. These are not trends that I think go on indefinitely. On the competitive environment, the landscape is difficult. There are a lot of strong competitors in the marketplace. And my answer to that would be we just have to pick up our game competitively, have to pick up our game in terms of menu offering. We have to pick our game in terms of customer service.

For example, this year, in the first quarter, we had a very light flu season. So physician office visits may be down year-over-year because of flu comparables. And yet we know historically, flu has very little impact on our Reference Lab business one way or the other. So we certainly see the same things both anecdotally and otherwise. We see physician practices that are closing. We see physicians reporting fewer patients. We see hospitals buying physician practices because the physicians financially would rather not continue in their current state.

I think there's still opportunity in vitamin D. Obviously, we've seen very significant growth in this test. At the same time, if you look at some of the recent publications about vitamin D, originally, it was a test that was thought to be very highly correlated to vitamin D deficiency. It was thought to be very highly correlated with bone disease and osteoporosis. But the papers that have been coming out show correlation with development of certain types of cancer. And one of the most recent papers showed a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and overall morbidity and mortality. There was also a recent paper that showed that even within the first two years of life, there's a substantial portion of the infant population that's vitamin D deficient. So I think there's still opportunity for growth in vitamin D. Obviously, it's not going to continue to grow at the rate that it has. In terms of what else is in the pipeline, I would just go back to the history of clinical laboratory testing, which is part of the reason that we offer over 4,000 tests is that as scientific discoveries are made, as clinical practice advances, there is uptake in testing that may have been underappreciated for substantial periods of time. So cystic fibrosis, several years ago, when ACOG made the recommendation for cystic fibrosis screening, that test had been around for a long time without a lot of utilization. Vitamin D, around for a long time without a lot of utilization. We continue to bring new tests to market. But we also continue to offer the broadest menus so that as clinical and medical practice and science advances, we have the ability to capitalize. And I think one of the nice things about the collaboration with Duke on The Biomarker Factory is exactly that, that we will be involved with a first-rate academic medical center in discovery and commercialization of new tests that will be focused on two things: better treatment of disease and lowering the cost of our health care system."

Labor, there's always upward pressure on labor expense because of cost of living and wage rate adjustments. So again, our optimization programs are designed to offset some of those costs.

The HERmark test, which is the oncology test, it's actually being moved into being sold by our oncology sales force. And overtime, we probably will move the performance of that test into one of the laboratories that performs our oncology testing. Just note we don't have specimen transportation and other issues with it.

By now, you should've had a chance to review our second quarter financial results. On today's call, I will discuss four key measures of our financial performance: Cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. 
First, cash flow. Our cash flow trends remain excellent. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2010 increased 19.6% to $800 million compared to $668.8 million in 2009, in each case, net of transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. We were extremely pleased with our cash collections. DSO improved five days year-over-year to 45 days at the end of June. As a result of our continued success in cash collections, we reduced our bad debt rate by 25 basis points to 4.8%. We're very proud of the LabCorp employees who have made this success possible through their diligent focus on getting paid for the services we provide.
Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 4.2% year-over-year in the second quarter. During the quarter, we achieved strong growth in revenue per requisition, which increased 6.3% of year-over-year. The growth in revenue per requisition is attributable to mix shift, increases in test per requisition and rate increases. The revenue growth per requisition was also impacted by the Canadian exchange rate, Monogram and the lost government contracts, which together, improved revenue per requisition by 3.3%. Total company volume decreased 2% year-over-year. Excluding Canada, volume decreased 2.1% year-over-year. The termination of two large government contracts at the end of the second quarter of 2009 reduced volume by 2.4%. Excluding the lost contracts, volume increased by approximately 0.3% in the quarter. Esoteric volume increased 4.9% in the quarter. 
Third, margin. For the second quarter, our operating income margin was 21.8%. This margin increased 40 basis points year-over-year due to reductions in bad debt expense and operational improvements. Margin expansion was hindered by costs associated with recent transactions and acquired assets that are not yet integrated.
Fourth, liquidity. We remain well-capitalized. At the end of June, we had cash of $103.8 million and approximately $430 million available under our revolving line of credit. At the end of June, total debt was $1.3 billion, including $30 million drawn down on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased $116 million of stock, representing approximately 1.5 million shares. At the end of June, approximately $100.1 million of repurchase authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program. 
This morning, we updated our 2010 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% compared to previous guidance of 2.5% to 4.5%, adjusted EPS in the range of $5.40 to $5.55 compared to prior guidance of $5.35 to $5.55, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after June 30, 2010, operating cash flow of approximately $870 million, excluding any transition payments made to UnitedHealthcare and capital expenditures of approximately $135 million. 
Finally, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, we want to remind you that the fourth quarter is always our softest quarter from a top line and earnings perspective due to the impact of the holiday season on volumes. I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

Revenue per requisition remains strong,",861,"Thank you, Brad. We were very pleased with our second quarter results. Despite continued challenging economic conditions, we grew revenue by 4.2% in the quarter. 
We also grew Esoteric revenue by approximately 5%. Revenue per requisition remains strong, increasing 6.3%. Taking into account the previously lost contracts, volume increased by approximately 0.3%. And we generated operating margin expansion of 40 basis points due to our continued improvement in bad debt expense and our focus on automating and optimizing our labs and patient service centers. Margins would have been higher, but for the factors Brad Hayes mentioned.
I would like to mention the performance of the many LabCorp employees working in our billing operations and patient service centers. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, over 6,000 people have maintained a disciplined focus on getting paid for the valuable services we provide. They have performed exceptionally during a very tough economic environment, and our declining DSO and bad debt expense reflected this. We are very proud and appreciative of their efforts. I would now like to update you on a few of our strategic initiatives.
First, we continue to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities. On June 14, we acquired the assets of DCL, a full-service clinical laboratory located in Indianapolis, with a strong specialized women's health offering. This acquisition furthers our strategy of growing in large metropolitan markets and enhancing our disease state-focused offerings.
On June 16, LabCorp acquired certain assets of Westcliff Medical Laboratories, a clinical lab in California pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and an order of the Bankruptcy Court administering the bankruptcy Of Westcliff. This acquisition furthers our strategy of growing in the California market, where we have historically been underrepresented. LabCorp was notified by the Federal Trade Commission that it intended to review the acquisition. And on June 24, we entered into an agreement with the FTC to hold the Westcliff business as an independent laboratory separate from LabCorp, while the FTC conducts its review of the transaction. LabCorp is working with the agency to complete the review as quickly as possible. We are unable to provide further color on the impact of the transaction until the conclusion of the FTC's review.
Second, effective August 1, 2010, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, New York's largest insurer by medical membership is expanding its reference laboratory network to include LabCorp in all of its markets and products. This expansion provides broader choice for Empire's members and physicians, reduces member costs associated with out of network laboratories and creates a more competitive environment among labs. We were excited about the opportunity to work closely with Empire and its members and to provide them with greater choice and exceptional lab service.
Third, we recently launched our new online gateway for client lab connectivity called LabCorp Beacon, accessible anywhere and at any time, LabCorp Beacon is an end-to-end solution that allows physicians to view, share, manage and analyze lab results. Beacon was developed with significant customer research and input and offers a user-friendly interface and sophisticated tools that will help our customers streamline office workflow and information sharing. LabCorp Beacon will enhance our connectivity portfolio as the solution of choice for direct client connectivity. We will continue to offer physicians a choice of tailored solutions, including robust integration with EMRs, EHRs and PHR applications. These options allow our customers to choose the right solution based on their needs for decision support, interoperability and their meaningful use objectives. LabCorp Beacon represents our ongoing commitment to innovate and invest strategically in our IT capabilities while maintaining our open platform approach. We have rolled out Beacon to a select group of our customers and they have received it enthusiastically. We will continue to roll out Beacon throughout the year.
Fourth, we continue to execute on our 2010 initiatives that have now driven year-over-year gross margin improvement for three consecutive quarters. These initiatives are even more important in light of the passage of the healthcare reform legislation, which we believe will drive business in all sectors of healthcare to the most efficient and lowest cost providers. Our Protedyne subsidiary continues to provide innovative solutions for automating and streamlining our operations. We are rolling out next-generation appointment scheduling and we continue to optimize the workflow at our patient service centers to improve the customer experience, as well as the overall efficiency of our business. 
As a result of our agreement with Sysmex America, Inc., we have fully automated hematology operations in our regional core laboratories throughout the United States. The Sysmex partnership allows us to increase throughput with less labor and to improve turnaround time for our customers.
It is one of the largest laboratory automation projects ever undertaken. This is just a sampling of the many initiatives we have underway to increase efficiency and improve service. They will remain an important strategic focus for us in the months and years ahead.
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and remain very excited about our future growth opportunities and the strategic initiatives that will help us capitalize on them. Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions."

In the second quarter, approximately 36% of our revenue was in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. Our goal over the next three to five years is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 40% of revenue. 
What are your plans for uses of free cash flow during 2010? We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders: First, by using our free cash flow to grow our business through strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements; and second, through continuing our approved share repurchase programs. The acquisition market remains attractive, with a number of opportunities to strengthen our scientific capabilities, grow our esoteric testing franchise and increase our presence in key geographic areas. Historically, we have been a consistent buyer of our own shares. Since the beginning of 2006, the company has repurchased approximately $2 billion worth of its stock. 
Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse volume trended during the year? In the quarter, our drugs of abuse volume increased 15.4% year-over-year. That compares to a year-over-year increase of 6.8% in Q1 of 2010 and year-over-year decreases of 6.5% in Q4 of 2009, 15% in Q3 of 2009 and 19% in Q2 of 2009.
What is the status of your transition payments to UnitedHealthcare? In the quarter, the company was billed $1.1 million in transition payments and paid $2.1 million in transition payments. As a reminder, our obligation to reimburse UnitedHealthcare for transition payments ended on December 31, 2009. We have received the final invoices for these payments and the final amount is approximately $120 million.
What impact would the proposed 2011 Medicare physician fee schedule rule have on your business? Assuming the Congress acts to prevent the conversion factor reduction within the proposed Medicare physician fee schedule rule, we would expect to receive a modest increase to our revenue tied to the physician fee schedule. As a reminder, approximately 2% of our revenue is tied to the physician fee schedule.

So labs that are getting a substantial amount of their revenue from Medicare are facing five years of payment cuts, pretty much regardless of what the CPI does. And there certainly is pricing pressure from other fronts as well. And the inflationary side of the cost factor with wage inflation and other things doesn't go away. So I think we're having good discussions with a number of owners of quality assets. And again, it's going to come down to how do we feel about valuation? Is it accretive or dilutive? How does it fit with our strategy? As I mentioned, both DCL and Westcliff, with important strategic initiatives, greater size in major metropolitan areas, greater strength and disease-state focused and particularly, we've been so small in California for so long that the opportunity to make a modest acquisition there was very attractive to us."

And everybody who does business with healthcare providers of any kind, whether it's labs, doctors, hospitals, always wants more services for less money. That's inevitable. So I don't think the pricing environment has changed particularly in the last 12 to 18 months. We said last year that we had gone out and made some important contractor renewals with WellPoint, with CIGNA, with some of our regional plans. And we also have pointed out that with UnitedHealthcare, we have a ten-year contract and they have been a terrific partner and we continue to grow that business. So our strategy is not to lead with price. Our strategy is to be disciplined on pricing. Our strategy is to compliment organic volume growth with acquisitions, and our strategy is to continue with innovations like our LabCorp Beacon platform and other IT innovations that are coming is to continue to differentiate ourselves by making it easier for the doctors and their patients to do business with us. So I know that was a long answer, but the short answer to the question is there will be pricing pressure, there will be impacts on price. For the reasons Brad mentioned, you will not see the kind of pricing the rest of the year that you're seeing this quarter simply because we're going to annualize Monogram. We're going to annualize the lost contracts as drugs of abuse testing grows. That has a downward pull on price. But we feel good about where we are on pricing and we feel good about the contractual relationships that underpin our pricing."

However, the rate of decline has slowed and so as I mentioned on the call last quarter, Gary, I think we've seen the big impact from this in the end of last year and the beginning of this year. The major areas where we're seeing insourcing are in the urology. And I guess particularly in the urology and now in the dermatopathology, where physicians are setting up their own internal laboratories and are making arrangements with pathologists to do their reads. And from a competitive perspective, what we've done is focused on the fact that when you send your specimens to LabCorp, you get specialized pathologists. You don't get general pathologists reading these specimens, so that's very important for patient care that you have a uropathologist or a dermatopathologist reading these specimens, not just a general pathologist. We focus on the full menu of services that are available from LabCorp, special stains and other more sophisticated techniques that are not necessarily available at an internalized physician labs. And we focused on the IT solutions and capabilities that we can offer that are not available in the internalized labs and the ability to perform other tests on the specimens. We also have continued to point out to regulators that there is a high potential for abuse in physician insourcing, that the number of, for example, the number of biopsies on a prostate, typically increase and increase fairly significantly after physicians insource, and that adds expense to our healthcare system in a time when we're trying to make healthcare expenses go the other way. There are also concerns about physicians' self-interest and conflict of interest and there are concerns about the quality of patient care, so we continue to point those things out to the regulatory authorities. And we have had support in that from our own trade association, from the College of American Pathologists and from other influential trade associations that have interest in the lab industry. So I said in the first quarter and I continue to say in the second quarter, we need to pick up the level of competition. We need to pick up our game here, but at the same time, I'm pleased to see that the trend has ebbed a little bit in terms of the pathology volumes going down."

Their view is also that they do not want to do anything abrupt or without thorough deliberation. So my sense is that there is going to be greater oversight in some form or another of lab developed testing. I think there'll probably be greater oversight in some form or another of direct-to-consumer testing, particularly direct-to-consumer genetic testing. And our goal is to work collaboratively with FDA to make sure that whatever regulatory activity they undertake takes into account the importance of laboratory developed testing, the importance of the laboratory's ability to innovate and bring tests to market rapidly that people need without having to go through the whole process of a kit or of a lengthy regulatory review.

So if we adjusted bad debt to the inverse of the collection rate every quarter, you would see a much broader fluctuation and it would go up and down depending on what top line revenue in the quarter was and the collection experience. I think from the standpoint of the predictability of earnings and the predictability of our business model, the way that we do it is more desirable, which is we try to figure out what we think bad debt will be for the next four quarters, if not beyond, and that's where we set it. So when we started the year, we thought that bad debt would continue in that 5% range. And as a result of collection experience and as a result of the initiatives that we have had in place, now we think that for the next four quarters, it's going to be sustainable at the 50 basis points lower."

Do we have international aspirations? Obviously, we have. The Canadian business, and as Brad has mentioned, that's an attractive business and it's a business we'd like to continue to grow. We've said for a considerable period of time, there are clinical trials business which is doing very well this year after a tough year last year, when the whole CRO industry was under a lot of pressure. We've said that we have broader international aspirations for our clinical trials business and being able to provide services, clinical, central lab services, central lab services I should emphasize, in some countries where we don't have a presence now or where our presence is through some collaborative arrangement. Beyond that, in terms of broad international aspirations, I'll reiterate what we've said for a long time, which is that we think there is a great opportunity in the U.S. and that's where we're going to continue to focus. In terms of overall thoughts on healthcare reform, with my thoughts on healthcare reform, in a couple of bucks, you can buy a cup of coffee. But my thoughts on healthcare reform are, there's going to be a great deal of pressure to bring down costs. And there's going to be a great deal of pressure on providers to become more and more efficient. And the good news from LabCorp's perspective is the 2010 initiatives, the IT investments, which will be extremely important to physicians. I read over the Meaningful Use Regulation that came out, there are I think 20 criteria that physicians have to meet for meaningful use and then there's a menu of another 15, and I think they get to pick five of those. So the automation and efficiency, the IT investments, the continued innovation in improving customer service, are all going to be to our benefit. And I think, if you saw the newspaper this past weekend on Sunday, there was a front page article about how insurers are offering narrower networks as a way of reducing or holding down or not increasing premium costs to employers. And those narrower networks are going to be focused on the lower cost providers and we are the lowest cost provider in our industry. So as long as we continue to remain -- as long as we continue to improve efficiency and we continue to improve our overall interoperability, IT capability, service levels, efficiency of our business, I think we're going to be in good shape."

They've already integrated very nicely into our Clinical Trials business, with helping with the development of companion diagnostics. We're looking to expand their capabilities, particularly into Hepatitis C. And the revenue, the utilization uptake on HERmark, now that physicians can order it without having to send their specimens to two different places, has been a positive. And we've had a number of significant inquiries from clinical trials partners about the use of the Virotech assays to develop targeted oncology therapy. So Monogram has been exactly what we thought it would be in terms of a very important strategic acquisition for us, and we've done a good job in reducing the cost structure there."

First of all, obviously, price growth has a positive impact on gross margin, because if you're doing the same volumes at a higher price, with the same number of people, that helps your gross margin. So we shouldn't overlook that. However, in my mind, the big drivers of gross margin are in the 2010 initiatives. So the automation, which is fully completed now of our HPV preparation in our major laboratories, the hematology automation which is a very substantial project but is going to lead to very substantial savings and improved turnaround times for our customers, the improvement in Patient Service Center workflow through appointment scheduling, the improvement in Patient Service Center workflow through the IT improvements that basically allow the phlebotomist to accession the specimens in Patient Service Centers, which means that they don't have to be re-accessioned when they get to the laboratories. So these are all major contributors to the gross margin improvement, and the gross margin improvement is three consecutive quarters year-over-year. So obviously, it's not all from pricing. It's considerably contributed to by the efficiency initiatives that we've undertaken. And I would also comment on that, in undertaking these efficiency initiatives, one of our major areas of focus has been to move our personnel out of the ""back office"" and into customer facing position. So we've been able to increase the number of phlebotomists, increase the number of couriers, increase the number of service personnel without -- and still have gross margin improvement. And then the last thing I should mention is just, very aggressive optimization of the supply chain in terms of vendor relationships, inventory management. I mean, all of those things have been material as well."

But the big declines, and this is not a surprise to anybody, OB/GYN, primary care and my thesis is you're seeing a lot of people who are not getting their annual physical. They're not going in for their annual checkups. They're deferring or postponing non-acute visits. And I'm not going to talk about -- I don't know what the answer is for the first two weeks of 3Q. I wouldn't tell you if I did know because we don't talk about our quarters while we're in them. But I don't see anything that's changing materially. I don't see anything that's changed significantly in the office visit environments since the beginning of this year and even the 4Q of last year."

The driver of our improvements are the initiatives that we first laid out back in the middle of 2008 that haven't changed in terms of what they are, but have changed in terms of how we're executing against them. We continue to make progress in all of those initiatives. I won't say that we haven't added any, but those foundational initiatives are still alive and well. And as I look at what's in front of us, I think, again, we still have opportunity to do better. There is process improvement in the area. There is performance by individuals improvement in the area and it's completely our results or a result of all that heavy lifting as opposed to anything that's fundamentally going on. We look at credit card default rates and consumer information and I don't think the environment has gotten any easier. It may have plateaued, so it's not continuing to get worse.

It has gotten worse from the beginning of the year when you look at the year-over-year perspective. But in my mind, there are a couple of things going on and they tie together. One is, we're not seeing job creation in the private sector. So unemployment remains high and most job creation is not coming from private sector jobs. What that translates into is that managed care enrollment, commercial managed care enrollment is down. And with commercial managed care enrollment down, that translates into people are not insured. And as a consequence, they're choosing -- it isn't that they are going to the doctor as uninsured patients, it's that they're staying home. And if you just look at our percentage of uninsured, one would have thought in the abstract that with the number of uninsured in the U.S. going up and the number of people losing their jobs, you would have thought our uninsured patient count would have gone up, it went down. And again, I think it's because people without insurance are staying home and that's why doctor visits are down, and even people with insurance who feel that they can skip that annual checkup, that wellness checkup, are staying home as well. So in my mind, the answer is, I don't know whether we're at the bottom and I don't think we're going to see a lot of change until we start to see job creation in the private sector which leads to increased managed care enrollment."

By now, you should've had a chance to review our second quarter financial results. On today's call, I will discuss four key measures of our financial performance: Cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. 
First, cash flow. Our cash flow trends remain excellent. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2010 increased 19.6% to $800 million compared to $668.8 million in 2009, in each case, net of transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. We were extremely pleased with our cash collections. DSO improved five days year-over-year to 45 days at the end of June. As a result of our continued success in cash collections, we reduced our bad debt rate by 25 basis points to 4.8%. We're very proud of the LabCorp employees who have made this success possible through their diligent focus on getting paid for the services we provide.
Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 4.2% year-over-year in the second quarter. During the quarter, we achieved strong growth in revenue per requisition, which increased 6.3% of year-over-year. The growth in revenue per requisition is attributable to mix shift, increases in test per requisition and rate increases. The revenue growth per requisition was also impacted by the Canadian exchange rate, Monogram and the lost government contracts, which together, improved revenue per requisition by 3.3%. Total company volume decreased 2% year-over-year. Excluding Canada, volume decreased 2.1% year-over-year. The termination of two large government contracts at the end of the second quarter of 2009 reduced volume by 2.4%. Excluding the lost contracts, volume increased by approximately 0.3% in the quarter. Esoteric volume increased 4.9% in the quarter. 
Third, margin. For the second quarter, our operating income margin was 21.8%. This margin increased 40 basis points year-over-year due to reductions in bad debt expense and operational improvements. Margin expansion was hindered by costs associated with recent transactions and acquired assets that are not yet integrated.
Fourth, liquidity. We remain well-capitalized. At the end of June, we had cash of $103.8 million and approximately $430 million available under our revolving line of credit. At the end of June, total debt was $1.3 billion, including $30 million drawn down on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased $116 million of stock, representing approximately 1.5 million shares. At the end of June, approximately $100.1 million of repurchase authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program. 
This morning, we updated our 2010 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% compared to previous guidance of 2.5% to 4.5%, adjusted EPS in the range of $5.40 to $5.55 compared to prior guidance of $5.35 to $5.55, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after June 30, 2010, operating cash flow of approximately $870 million, excluding any transition payments made to UnitedHealthcare and capital expenditures of approximately $135 million. 
Finally, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, we want to remind you that the fourth quarter is always our softest quarter from a top line and earnings perspective due to the impact of the holiday season on volumes. I'll now turn the call over to Dave.

Despite continued challenging economic conditions, we grew revenue by 4.2% in the quarter. 
We also grew Esoteric revenue by approximately 5%. Revenue per requisition remains strong, increasing 6.3%. Taking into account the previously lost contracts, volume increased by approximately 0.3%. And we generated operating margin expansion of 40 basis points due to our continued improvement in bad debt expense and our focus on automating and optimizing our labs and patient service centers. Margins would have been higher, but for the factors Brad Hayes mentioned.
I would like to mention the performance of the many LabCorp employees working in our billing operations and patient service centers. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, over 6,000 people have maintained a disciplined focus on getting paid for the valuable services we provide. They have performed exceptionally during a very tough economic environment, and our declining DSO and bad debt expense reflected this. We are very proud and appreciative of their efforts. I would now like to update you on a few of our strategic initiatives.
First, we continue to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities. On June 14, we acquired the assets of DCL, a full-service clinical laboratory located in Indianapolis, with a strong specialized women's health offering. This acquisition furthers our strategy of growing in large metropolitan markets and enhancing our disease state-focused offerings.
On June 16, LabCorp acquired certain assets of Westcliff Medical Laboratories, a clinical lab in California pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and an order of the Bankruptcy Court administering the bankruptcy Of Westcliff. This acquisition furthers our strategy of growing in the California market, where we have historically been underrepresented. LabCorp was notified by the Federal Trade Commission that it intended to review the acquisition. And on June 24, we entered into an agreement with the FTC to hold the Westcliff business as an independent laboratory separate from LabCorp, while the FTC conducts its review of the transaction. LabCorp is working with the agency to complete the review as quickly as possible. We are unable to provide further color on the impact of the transaction until the conclusion of the FTC's review.
Second, effective August 1, 2010, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, New York's largest insurer by medical membership is expanding its reference laboratory network to include LabCorp in all of its markets and products. This expansion provides broader choice for Empire's members and physicians, reduces member costs associated with out of network laboratories and creates a more competitive environment among labs. We were excited about the opportunity to work closely with Empire and its members and to provide them with greater choice and exceptional lab service.
Third, we recently launched our new online gateway for client lab connectivity called LabCorp Beacon, accessible anywhere and at any time, LabCorp Beacon is an end-to-end solution that allows physicians to view, share, manage and analyze lab results. Beacon was developed with significant customer research and input and offers a user-friendly interface and sophisticated tools that will help our customers streamline office workflow and information sharing. LabCorp Beacon will enhance our connectivity portfolio as the solution of choice for direct client connectivity. We will continue to offer physicians a choice of tailored solutions, including robust integration with EMRs, EHRs and PHR applications. These options allow our customers to choose the right solution based on their needs for decision support, interoperability and their meaningful use objectives. LabCorp Beacon represents our ongoing commitment to innovate and invest strategically in our IT capabilities while maintaining our open platform approach. We have rolled out Beacon to a select group of our customers and they have received it enthusiastically. We will continue to roll out Beacon throughout the year.
Fourth, we continue to execute on our 2010 initiatives that have now driven year-over-year gross margin improvement for three consecutive quarters. These initiatives are even more important in light of the passage of the healthcare reform legislation, which we believe will drive business in all sectors of healthcare to the most efficient and lowest cost providers. Our Protedyne subsidiary continues to provide innovative solutions for automating and streamlining our operations. We are rolling out next-generation appointment scheduling and we continue to optimize the workflow at our patient service centers to improve the customer experience, as well as the overall efficiency of our business. 
As a result of our agreement with Sysmex America, Inc., we have fully automated hematology operations in our regional core laboratories throughout the United States. The Sysmex partnership allows us to increase throughput with less labor and to improve turnaround time for our customers.
It is one of the largest laboratory automation projects ever undertaken. This is just a sampling of the many initiatives we have underway to increase efficiency and improve service. They will remain an important strategic focus for us in the months and years ahead.
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and remain very excited about our future growth opportunities and the strategic initiatives that will help us capitalize on them. Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.

Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing? In the second quarter, approximately 36% of our revenue was in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. Our goal over the next three to five years",353,"Thank you, Dave. Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing? In the second quarter, approximately 36% of our revenue was in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. Our goal over the next three to five years is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 40% of revenue. 
What are your plans for uses of free cash flow during 2010? We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders: First, by using our free cash flow to grow our business through strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements; and second, through continuing our approved share repurchase programs. The acquisition market remains attractive, with a number of opportunities to strengthen our scientific capabilities, grow our esoteric testing franchise and increase our presence in key geographic areas. Historically, we have been a consistent buyer of our own shares. Since the beginning of 2006, the company has repurchased approximately $2 billion worth of its stock. 
Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse volume trended during the year? In the quarter, our drugs of abuse volume increased 15.4% year-over-year. That compares to a year-over-year increase of 6.8% in Q1 of 2010 and year-over-year decreases of 6.5% in Q4 of 2009, 15% in Q3 of 2009 and 19% in Q2 of 2009.
What is the status of your transition payments to UnitedHealthcare? In the quarter, the company was billed $1.1 million in transition payments and paid $2.1 million in transition payments. As a reminder, our obligation to reimburse UnitedHealthcare for transition payments ended on December 31, 2009. We have received the final invoices for these payments and the final amount is approximately $120 million.
What impact would the proposed 2011 Medicare physician fee schedule rule have on your business? Assuming the Congress acts to prevent the conversion factor reduction within the proposed Medicare physician fee schedule rule, we would expect to receive a modest increase to our revenue tied to the physician fee schedule. As a reminder, approximately 2% of our revenue is tied to the physician fee schedule. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.

So labs that are getting a substantial amount of their revenue from Medicare are facing five years of payment cuts, pretty much regardless of what the CPI does. And there certainly is pricing pressure from other fronts as well. And the inflationary side of the cost factor with wage inflation and other things doesn't go away. So I think we're having good discussions with a number of owners of quality assets. And again, it's going to come down to how do we feel about valuation? Is it accretive or dilutive? How does it fit with our strategy? As I mentioned, both DCL and Westcliff, with important strategic initiatives, greater size in major metropolitan areas, greater strength and disease-state focused and particularly, we've been so small in California for so long that the opportunity to make a modest acquisition there was very attractive to us.

And everybody who does business with healthcare providers of any kind, whether it's labs, doctors, hospitals, always wants more services for less money. That's inevitable. So I don't think the pricing environment has changed particularly in the last 12 to 18 months. We said last year that we had gone out and made some important contractor renewals with WellPoint, with CIGNA, with some of our regional plans. And we also have pointed out that with UnitedHealthcare, we have a ten-year contract and they have been a terrific partner and we continue to grow that business. So our strategy is not to lead with price. Our strategy is to be disciplined on pricing. Our strategy is to compliment organic volume growth with acquisitions, and our strategy is to continue with innovations like our LabCorp Beacon platform and other IT innovations that are coming is to continue to differentiate ourselves by making it easier for the doctors and their patients to do business with us. So I know that was a long answer, but the short answer to the question is there will be pricing pressure, there will be impacts on price. For the reasons Brad mentioned, you will not see the kind of pricing the rest of the year that you're seeing this quarter simply because we're going to annualize Monogram. We're going to annualize the lost contracts as drugs of abuse testing grows. That has a downward pull on price. But we feel good about where we are on pricing and we feel good about the contractual relationships that underpin our pricing.

You don't get general pathologists reading these specimens, so that's very important for patient care that you have a uropathologist or a dermatopathologist reading these specimens, not just a general pathologist. We focus on the full menu of services that are available from LabCorp, special stains and other more sophisticated techniques that are not necessarily available at an internalized physician labs. And we focused on the IT solutions and capabilities that we can offer that are not available in the internalized labs and the ability to perform other tests on the specimens. We also have continued to point out to regulators that there is a high potential for abuse in physician insourcing, that the number of, for example, the number of biopsies on a prostate, typically increase and increase fairly significantly after physicians insource, and that adds expense to our healthcare system in a time when we're trying to make healthcare expenses go the other way. There are also concerns about physicians' self-interest and conflict of interest and there are concerns about the quality of patient care, so we continue to point those things out to the regulatory authorities. And we have had support in that from our own trade association, from the College of American Pathologists and from other influential trade associations that have interest in the lab industry. So I said in the first quarter and I continue to say in the second quarter, we need to pick up the level of competition. We need to pick up our game here, but at the same time, I'm pleased to see that the trend has ebbed a little bit in terms of the pathology volumes going down.

And we always want to get paid more for the value that we provide. And that's the way the dynamic is going to be probably as long as I'm around here.

And there's also a hearing this morning, the Energy and Commerce committee is having a hearing on direct-to-consumer genetic testing. I think this is an area in which there's increasing regulatory focus. And I think that in various discussions with the FDA, their view is there is a need for some greater oversight of laboratory developed testing. Their view is also that they do not want to do anything abrupt or without thorough deliberation. So my sense is that there is going to be greater oversight in some form or another of lab developed testing. I think there'll probably be greater oversight in some form or another of direct-to-consumer testing, particularly direct-to-consumer genetic testing. And our goal is to work collaboratively with FDA to make sure that whatever regulatory activity they undertake takes into account the importance of laboratory developed testing, the importance of the laboratory's ability to innovate and bring tests to market rapidly that people need without having to go through the whole process of a kit or of a lengthy regulatory review. So I think this is an evolutionary process and we're very much committed. Both LabCorp and the American Clinical Laboratory Association are very much committed to working collaboratively with the FDA to coming out with the right answer.

So when we started the year, we thought that bad debt would continue in that 5% range.

We've said that we have broader international aspirations for our clinical trials business and being able to provide services, clinical, central lab services, central lab services I should emphasize, in some countries where we don't have a presence now or where our presence is through some collaborative arrangement. Beyond that, in terms of broad international aspirations, I'll reiterate what we've said for a long time, which is that we think there is a great opportunity in the U.S. and that's where we're going to continue to focus. In terms of overall thoughts on healthcare reform, with my thoughts on healthcare reform, in a couple of bucks, you can buy a cup of coffee. But my thoughts on healthcare reform are, there's going to be a great deal of pressure to bring down costs. And there's going to be a great deal of pressure on providers to become more and more efficient. And the good news from LabCorp's perspective is the 2010 initiatives, the IT investments, which will be extremely important to physicians. I read over the Meaningful Use Regulation that came out, there are I think 20 criteria that physicians have to meet for meaningful use and then there's a menu of another 15, and I think they get to pick five of those. So the automation and efficiency, the IT investments, the continued innovation in improving customer service, are all going to be to our benefit. And I think, if you saw the newspaper this past weekend on Sunday, there was a front page article about how insurers are offering narrower networks as a way of reducing or holding down or not increasing premium costs to employers. And those narrower networks are going to be focused on the lower cost providers and we are the lowest cost provider in our industry. So as long as we continue to remain -- as long as we continue to improve efficiency and we continue to improve our overall interoperability, IT capability, service levels, efficiency of our business, I think we're going to be in good shape.

First of all, obviously, price growth has a positive impact on gross margin, because if you're doing the same volumes at a higher price, with the same number of people, that helps your gross margin. So we shouldn't overlook that. However, in my mind, the big drivers of gross margin are in the 2010 initiatives. So the automation, which is fully completed now of our HPV preparation in our major laboratories, the hematology automation which is a very substantial project but is going to lead to very substantial savings and improved turnaround times for our customers, the improvement in Patient Service Center workflow through appointment scheduling, the improvement in Patient Service Center workflow through the IT improvements that basically allow the phlebotomist to accession the specimens in Patient Service Centers, which means that they don't have to be re-accessioned when they get to the laboratories. So these are all major contributors to the gross margin improvement, and the gross margin improvement is three consecutive quarters year-over-year. So obviously, it's not all from pricing. It's considerably contributed to by the efficiency initiatives that we've undertaken. And I would also comment on that, in undertaking these efficiency initiatives, one of our major areas of focus has been to move our personnel out of the ""back office"" and into customer facing position. So we've been able to increase the number of phlebotomists, increase the number of couriers, increase the number of service personnel without -- and still have gross margin improvement. And then the last thing I should mention is just, very aggressive optimization of the supply chain in terms of vendor relationships, inventory management. I mean, all of those things have been material as well.

It has gotten worse from the beginning of the year when you look at the year-over-year perspective. But in my mind, there are a couple of things going on and they tie together. One is, we're not seeing job creation in the private sector. So unemployment remains high and most job creation is not coming from private sector jobs. What that translates into is that managed care enrollment, commercial managed care enrollment is down. And with commercial managed care enrollment down, that translates into people are not insured. And as a consequence, they're choosing -- it isn't that they are going to the doctor as uninsured patients, it's that they're staying home. And if you just look at our percentage of uninsured, one would have thought in the abstract that with the number of uninsured in the U.S. going up and the number of people losing their jobs, you would have thought our uninsured patient count would have gone up, it went down. And again, I think it's because people without insurance are staying home and that's why doctor visits are down, and even people with insurance who feel that they can skip that annual checkup, that wellness checkup, are staying home as well. So in my mind, the answer is, I don't know whether we're at the bottom and I don't think we're going to see a lot of change until we start to see job creation in the private sector which leads to increased managed care enrollment.

By now you should've had a chance to review our third quarter financial results. On today's call, I'll discuss four key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. 
First, cash flow. Our cash flow remained strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2010 was $718.2 million compared to $739.6 million in 2009, both net of transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. This decrease of 2.9% is attributable to higher capital expenditures, which were anticipated in our cash flow guidance. Also, third quarter cash flow was impacted by timing-related issues and accounts receivable, primarily related to acquisitions and higher tax payments. Importantly, our full year guidance related to operating cash flow remains $870 million.
We're extremely pleased with our cash collections despite the timing-related issues previously mentioned. DSO improved four days year-over-year to 44 days at the end of September and declined sequentially by one day from the second quarter. As a result of our continued success in cash collections, we're maintaining our bad debt rate of 4.8%.
Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. During the quarter we achieved strong growth in revenue per requisition which increased 5.7% year-over-year. The growth in revenue per requisition is attributable to test mix shift and increases in test per requisition. The revenue per requisition growth was also impacted by loss contracts and the recognition of deferred revenue resulting from an amendment to a customer contract, which together improved revenue per requisition by 2.5%. 
Total company volume increased 1.9% year-over-year. The contract losses in 2009 that we've previously discussed reduced volume by 1.4%. Excluding the loss contracts, volume increased by approximately 3.3% in the quarter. Esoteric volume increased 6.9% in the quarter. 
Third, margin. For the third quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 19.6%. Recent acquisitions that we have not yet fully integrated caused the 50 basis point drag on margin. 
Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of September, we had cash of $96.9 million and approximately $395 million available under our revolving line of credit. At the end of September, total debt was $1.3 billion, including $65 million drawn down on our revolving credit facility.
During the quarter, we repurchased $115.8 million of stock, representing 1.5 million shares. At the end of September, approximately $234.2 million of repurchase authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program. 
I would also like to point out that earnings per share benefited in the quarter as a result of a reduced tax rate, primarily due to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions. 
This morning, we updated our 2010 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 5%; adjusted EPS in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after September 30, 2010, compared to prior guidance of $5.40 to $5.55; operating cash flow of approximately $870 million excluding any transition payments made to UnitedHealthcare; and capital expenditures of approximately $135 million. This updated guidance does not include any impact from the Genzyme Genetics acquisition. 
I will now turn the call over to Dave."

We grew revenues 7.7% in the third quarter. We grew esoteric revenue by approximately 10.1%. Taking into account the impact of loss contracts, volume increased year-over-year by 3.3%. We are encouraged that we have achieved volume growth in a difficult economic environment and believe this reflects the effectiveness of our growth strategies. Revenue per requisition growth remained strong at 3.2% after adjusting for the impact on revenue per requisition from the loss contracts in deferred revenue. Thus, the pricing environment remains stable.
I would now like to update you on our recent progress on four of our strategic initiatives: acquisitions, expanding our managed care relationships, growing our clinical trials business and enhancing our IT capabilities.
First, we have consistently stated that the primary use of our free cash is to grow our business through strategic acquisitions. This quarter, we made a significant strategic acquisition when we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Genzyme Genetics, a business unit of Genzyme Corporation and one of the premier specialized medical testing laboratories in the United States in an all cash transaction valued at $925 million. Net of expected income tax benefits less acquisition-related expenses, the acquisition is expected to have a net cash cost to LabCorp of approximately $795 million.
We are very excited about the opportunity that the combination of Genzyme Genetics and LabCorp presents for future growth. The acquisition fits squarely into our key strategies, expanding esoteric testing capabilities and enhancing our leadership in personalized medicine. Combining Genzyme with our businesses will allow us to capitalize on two emerging trends: the increasing importance of diagnostics to healthcare and the evolution of personalized medicine into the mainstream of patient care. The acquisition will expand our capabilities in reproductive, genetic, hematology/oncology and clinical trial central laboratory testing and provides us with an attractive opportunity for future esoteric revenue growth.
As we have previously stated, we expect the transaction to be diluted to LabCorp's adjusted EPS for the first year after closing by $0.25 to $0.35, primarily attributable to financing costs and amortization. However, we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to operating cash flow at year one, excluding transaction costs such as bridge financing, legal and advisory fees and restructuring costs. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive to LabCorp's adjusted EPS beginning in the second year after closing. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customer and closing conditions set forth in the agreement, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 as amended. Our goal is to close the acquisition by the end of this year and we look forward to welcoming the employees of Genzyme Genetics to our LabCorp family upon completing the transaction.
On June 16, LabCorp acquired certain assets of Westcliff Medical Laboratories, a clinical lab in California, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement and an order of the bankruptcy court administering the bankruptcy of Westcliff. The acquisition furthers our strategy to grow our footprint in the California market where we have historically been underrepresented. LabCorp was notified by the Federal Trade Commission that it intended to review the acquisition. And on June 24, we entered into an agreement with the FDC to run the Westcliff business as an independent company separate from LabCorp, while the FDC conducts its review of the transaction. The Westcliff business continues to lose money as a separate entity and accounted for the bulk of the margin contraction we experienced in the third quarter. We hope that the FDC will expeditiously conclude its review and allow us to integrate the businesses. At this time, we are unable to provide further information on the transaction.
Second, expanding managed care relationships has long been a key growth strategy for LabCorp. As we have said since gaining access to the New York market through the UnitedHealthcare contract, we are focused on growing our business in this important region. To that end, on August 1, 2010, we gained access to all of the Empire BlueCross BlueShield markets and products as an in-network provider. Empire is New York's largest insurer by medical membership. This expansion of the network provides broader choice for Empire's members and physicians and reduce its member cost associated with out-of-network laboratories. We are working diligently to build relationships with Empire and their physicians and look forward to providing Empire members with greater choice and exceptional lab service.
Third, we have consistently discussed our desire to expand the international footprint of our clinical trials central laboratory. After carefully reviewing many opportunities, we took a significant step in doing so by partnering with Clearstone Central Laboratories, a global central laboratory specializing in drug development and pharmaceutical services. The collaboration combines the complementary strengths of two leading central laboratories to support growth development and enhances our clinical trials to central lab offerings in key international geographies, including China, France, Singapore and Canada. Our collaboration is proceeding as anticipated and we remain pleased with the growth opportunities this relationship will provide.
Fourth, we have recently discussed enhancements of our IT products and improvements in client connectivity. This summer, we began the rollout of our new online gateway for client lab connectivity, LabCorp Beacon. Accessible anywhere and at any time, LabCorp Beacon is an end-to-end solution that allows physicians to view, share, manage and analyze lab results. Beacon also gives physicians a choice of tailored solutions, including robust integration with EMRs, EHRs and personal health record applications. These options allow our customers to choose the right solution based on their needs for decision support, interoperability and use objectives. We will complete our launch of Beacon on a national scale by the end of the year. Additional ordering functionality will also be added to Beacon by year end, providing our customers with enhanced analytic capabilities and intuitive interface and a superior customer experience. As with all of our customer facing IT systems, Beacon is built on an open platform strategy that allows seamless integration with hundreds of VHRs and physician practice management systems.
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and we are proud of our progress on our key strategic initiatives. Though the economic climate remains uncertain, we are confident about the long-term growth opportunities in the clinical laboratory space and about the strategies we are employing to capitalize on them.
Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions."

Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing? In the third quarter, approximately 37% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. We have previously stated that our goal",342,"Thank you, Dave. Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing? 
In the third quarter, approximately 37% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. We have previously stated that our goal over the next three to five years was to increase our esoteric tests mix to approximately 40% of revenue. Once we received regulatory clearance, the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics will achieve this goal. We will provide you with updated growth goals for our Esoteric business after we have closed the acquisition.
Does acquiring Genzyme Genetics limit your ability to repurchase shares or act upon other acquisition opportunities?
While we do not comment specifically on share repurchase, we have historically been a consistent purchaser of our shares. Also, we believe that we can still be active with acquisitions. Obviously, adjusted for the need for Genzyme Genetics' funding. Thus, we do not believe we are precluded from conducting our business as usual or from pursuing our strategic goal.
Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse trended during the year?
In the quarter, our drugs of abuse volume increased 13.9% year-over-year. That compares to a year-over-year increase of 15.4% in Q2 of 2010, a year-over-year increase of 6.8% in Q1 of 2010, a year-over-year decrease of 6.5% in Q4 of 2009 and a year-over-year decrease of 15% in Q3 of 2009.
What is the status of your transition payments to UnitedHealthcare?
Our obligation to reimburse UnitedHealthcare for transition payments ended on December 31, 2009. We have received and paid the final invoices for these payments. The final amount was approximately $120 million.
What impact would the proposed 2011 Medicare physician fee schedule rule have on your business? 
Assuming the Congress acts to prevent the reduction in the physician fee schedule, we would expect to receive a modest increase to our revenue tied to that schedule. As a reminder, approximately 2% of our revenue is tied to the physician fee schedule. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave."

As I think we've said before and as you see in the IMS data, the biggest detractor is the OB/GYN market continues to be soft for everybody, but I think the reason you're seeing good esoteric growth and as we've mentioned, the return to organic volume growth is, we are focused on the specialty positions, we're focused on the specialty markets, we're focused on the comprehensive LabCorp offering, which we enhanced last year with Monogram and obviously we feel we strongly enhanced once we receive regulatory approval and we're able to close the Genzyme Genetics transaction.

We've worked extensively through the American Clinical Laboratory Association, our trade association, which by the way the collaboration of I believe 13 other or 14 other affiliated industry groups, including the College of American Pathologists, the hospital lab trade association.

So it's been an excellent source of growth for us, it's also been an excellent source of innovation and it's positioned us in terms of our ability to license and capitalize on assays like IL28B because the pharmaceutical sponsors recognize our superior esoteric capabilities and all the other advantages we have, including our infrastructure and service centers that can help them with patient collection. So the business has been a very good business. What it has lacked and what we've talked about probably for at least the last year if not more is we have lacked a central lab network that went beyond the United States, our central lab in Belgium, and some loose affiliations that we had with labs in other countries. And the reality is that the naive patients, so when I say that patients who are not being treated and therefore the patients that are most desirable for trial sponsors. The naive patients largely these days are in the developing markets. So that's India, it's China, Singapore, Malaysia and our lack of central lab capabilities in those areas has been a detriment, particularly in China because under Chinese regulations, we're not allowed -- no one is allowed to move blood out of the country to do testing elsewhere. So the Clearstone -- what Clearstone offers us is a collaboration that makes our services and also our esoteric testing capabilities available in places that we previously have not had those capabilities and I think it'll be a significant opportunity to grow the Clinical Trials business going forward."

So right now, they get a set of CPT codes and particularly with genetic testing, that set of CPT codes could be any number of a wide variety of tests. And the concern is that whether it's by design or otherwise, the coding is not consistent among providers for the test, and so that adds further opaqueness to of what are they actually paying for. We have always been supportive of greater transparency in CPT coding and people knowing and payers knowing what they're paying for. That's absolutely appropriate. And I think the concern that we've expressed the Palmetto is make sure that when you implement guidelines such as these, that you don't run into the law unintended consequences as CMS did a couple of years ago with their medically, whatever they were called, the medically unbelievable edits where there was some significant potential consequences to provide that they have not foreseen. So I know that recently, the Monogram business people and the clinicians met with the Medical Director Palmetto. They provided a very detailed data package on why Palmetto should reimburse appropriately for the profile testing, Palmetto was very pleased with the package that we provided. And I think what it says is, if you provide the appropriate data and you provide transparency, which is what we try to do, it's not a big issue. And so again, I think we'll be fine with this. I think the initiative for greater transparency in coding is something that we, at LabCorp, welcome. And I think the key is to make sure that in doing these things, they are not unintended consequences that are not foreseen at the time that we lose or implement."

I understand it's possible you could have another quarter where tax rates benefit from some issues and could be lower than what we've seen in the first part of the year.

But this is a complex transaction involving complex businesses that do very complex testing. There are three lines of business within Genzyme Genetics: the Genetics business, the Hematology/Oncology business and the Clinical Trials business. We're not going to rush through an integration process to improve the margin profile at the expense of losing the revenue and the value of the brand that we're paying for. So this is a very important strategic acquisition. On both sides, we're committed to improving the operational performance from a financial perspective, but we're going to do it in a deliberate way that's not going to jeopardize the rationale for why we're acquiring the business."

With regards to the commentary as I don't make a habit of listening to our competitor's call, I don't know what commentary they gave. But the commentary I can give you is we started to see the economic impact on volumes as early and we started to make reference to it as early, I believe, as the second quarter of 2008. When we did that when others were expressing the view that they were not seeing that impact. We did that. We undertook a strategic initiative to redirect our sales force and to redirect our sales efforts to areas where we felt there was the greatest opportunity to continue to grow the business despite of the economic challenge. And so we put a lot of sales resources into infectious disease, we put a lot of sales resources into endocrinology, we put a lot of resources into the, particularly, the obstetrics market for prenatal and preconception genetic testing. And I think our results since we undertook those initiatives speak for themselves, which is they have been positive, not only by comparison to the industry but generally, in terms of just the profile of our business and the continued growth of the esoteric testing line. We also have said that acquisitions are part of our growth strategy and we continue to make strategic. And in our view, very sensible acquisitions and then deliver what we say we do, which is we said Monogram would be accretive post the annualization, and Monogram is accretive post the annualization. And it's driving top line revenue growth because of the pricing and because of the unique test offering. So we're going to continue with a strategy that has been successful for us. We're, of course, always going to continue to refine that strategy, to improve it as we take account of what's going on in the marketplace. And the long-term opportunity in the business, when we receive regulatory clearance and Genzyme Genetics and have a new window into large hospital systems, academic medical centers, more prenatal and preconception genetic testing, more hematology/oncology business in an area that is not subject to in-sourcing which is the very sophisticated treatment of blood and bone cancers, we feel great about the way the future looks for us."

Thank you, Steve. By now, you should've had a chance to review our third quarter financial results. On today's call, I will discuss four key measures of our financial performance: Cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity.
First, cash flow. Our cash flow remains strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2010 was $718.2 million compared to $739.6 million in 2009, both net of transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. This decrease of 2.9% is attributable to higher capital expenditures, which were anticipated in our cash flow guidance.
Also, third quarter cash flow was impacted by timing-related issues and account receivables, primarily related to acquisitions and higher tax payments. Importantly our full year guidance related to operating cash flow remains at $870 million.
We were extremely pleased with our cash collections. Despite the timing-related issues, previously mentioned, DSO improved four days year-over-year to 44 days at the end of September and declined sequentially by one day from the second quarter. As a result of our continued success in cash collections we are maintaining our bad debt rate of 4.8%.
Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. During the quarter we achieved strong growth and revenue per requisition, which increased to 5.7% year-over-year. The growth in revenue per requisition is attributable to test mix shift and increases in test per requisition. The revenue per requisition growth was also impacted by lost contracts and the recognition of deferred revenue resulting from an amendment to a customer contract, which together improved revenue per requisition by 2.5%.
Total company volume increased 1.9% year-over-year. The contract losses in 2009 that we previously discussed reduced volume by 1.4%. Excluding the loss contracts volume increased by approximately 3.3% in the quarter. Esoterix volume increased 6.9% in the quarter.
Third margins; for the third quarter our adjusted operating income margin was 19.6%. Recent acquisitions that we’ve not yet fully integrated caused the 50 basis point drag on margin.
Fourth, liquidity; we remained well capitalized. At the end of September we had cash of $96.9 million and approximately $395 million available under our revolving line of credit. At the end of September total debt was $1.3 billion including $65 million drawn down on our revolving credit facility.
During the quarter, we repurchased a $115.8 million of stock representing 1.5 million shares. At the end of September, approximately $234.2 million of repurchase authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program.
I would also like to point out that earnings per share benefited in the quarter as a result of a reduced tax rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions.
This morning we updated our 2010 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 5%, adjusted EPS in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after September 30th, 2010, compared to prior guidance of $5.40 to $5.55; operating cash flow of approximately $870 million excluding any transition payments made to UnitedHealthcare and capital expenditures of approximately $135 million. This updated guidance does not include any impact from the Genzyme Genetics acquisition.
I would now turn the call over to Dave.

We grew Esoterix revenue by approximately 10.1%.Taking into account, the impact of lost contracts, volume increased year-over-year by 3.3%.",1086,"Thank you, Brad. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. We grew revenues 7.7% in the third quarter. We grew Esoterix revenue by approximately 10.1%.
Taking into account, the impact of lost contracts, volume increased year-over-year by 3.3%. We are encouraged that we have achieved volume growth in a difficult economic environment and believe this reflects the effectiveness of our growth strategies.
Revenue per acquisition growth remains strong at 3.2% after adjusting for the impact on revenue per requisition from the lost contracts and differed revenue. Thus, the pricing environment remains stable.
I will now like to update you on our recent progress on four of our strategic initiatives; acquisitions, expanding our managed care relationships, growing our clinical trials business and enhancing our IT capabilities.
First, we’ve consistently stated that the primary use of our free cash is to grow our business with strategic acquisitions. This quarter we made a significant strategic acquisition when we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Genzyme Genetics, a business unit of Genzyme Corporation and one of the premier specialized medical testing laboratories in the United States, in an all cash transactions valued at $925 million, net of expected income tax benefits less acquisition-related expenses. The acquisition is expected to have a net cash cost to LabCorp of approximately $795 million.
We are very excited about the opportunities that the combination of Genzyme Genetics and LabCorp presents for future growth. The acquisition fit squarely in to our key strategies, expanding Esoteric Testing capabilities and enhancing our leadership in personalized medicine.
Combining Genzyme with our businesses will allow us to capitalize on two emerging trends; increasing importance of diagnostics to healthcare and the evolution of personalized medicine in to the mainstream of patient care. The acquisition will expand our capabilities in reproductive, genetic, hematology, oncology and clinical trial, central laboratory testing and provides us with an attractive opportunity for future Esoterix revenue growth.
As we have previously stated, we expect the transaction to be diluted to LabCorps adjusted EPS for the first year after closing by $0.25 to $0.35 primarily attributable to financing cost and amortization. However, we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to operating cash flow with year one, excluding transaction cost such as bridge financing, legal and advisory fees and restructuring costs. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive to LabCorp’s adjusted EPS, beginning in the second year after closing.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions set forth in the agreement, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 as amended.
Our goal is to close the acquisition by the end of this year and we look forward to welcoming the employees of Genzyme Genetics to our LabCorp family upon completing the transaction.
On June 16, LabCorp acquired certain assets of Westcliff Medical Laboratories, a clinical lab in California, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement and an order of the bankruptcy court administering the bankruptcy in Westcliff.
The acquisition furthers our strategy to grow our footprint in the California market where we have historically been under-represented. LabCorp was notified by the Federal Trade Commission that it intended to review the acquisition and on June 24th, we entered into an agreement would be FTC to run the Westcliff business as an independent company separate from LabCorp while the FTC conducts its review of the transaction.
The Westcliff business continues to loose money as a separate entity and accounted for the bulk of the margin contraction we experienced in the third quarter. We hope that the FTC will expeditiously conclude its review and allow us to integrate the businesses. At this time, we are unable to provide further information on the transaction.
Second, expanding managed care relationships has long been a key growth strategy for LabCorp. As we have said in gaining access to the New York market to the United Healthcare contract, we are focused on growing our business in this important region.
To that end, on August 1, 2010 we gained access to all of the Empire BlueCross BlueShield crucial markets and products as an in-network provider. Empire is New York’s largest insurer by medical membership. This expansion of the network provides broader choice for Empires members and physicians and reduces member cost associated with out-of-networks laboratories.
We are working diligently to build relationships with Empire and their physicians and look forward to providing Empire members with greater choice and exceptional lab service.
Third, we have consistently discussed our desire to expand the international footprints of our clinical trials central laboratory. After carefully reviewing many opportunities, we took a significant step in doing so by partnering with Clearstone Central Laboratories, a global central laboratories specializing in drug development and pharmaceutical services. 
The collaboration combines the complementary strengths of two leading central laboratories to support drug development and enhances our clinical trials and Central Lab offerings in key international geographies, including China, France, Singapore and Canada.
Our collaboration is proceeding as anticipated and we remain pleased with the growth opportunities this relationship will provide.
Fourth: We have regionally discussed enhancements of out IT products and improvements in client connectivity .This summer we began the rollout of our new online gateway for client lab connectivity LabCorp Beacon, accessible anywhere and at any time. LabCorp Beacon is an end-to-end solution that allows physicians to view, share, manage and analyze lab results.
Beacon also gives positions a choice of tailored solutions including robust integration with EMRs, EHRs and Personal Health Record applications. These options allow our customers to choose the right solutions based on their needs for decisions support interoperability, end use objectives. We will complete our launch of Beacon on a national scale by end of the year. Additional ordering functionality will also be added to Beacon by year end, providing our customers with enhanced analytic capabilities an intuitive interface and a superior customer experience.
As with all of our customers facing IT systems, Beacon is built on an open platform strategy that allows seamless integration with hundreds of EHRs and physician practice management systems.
In summary we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and we are proud of our progress on our key strategy initiatives. Though the economic climate remains uncertain we are confident about the long-term growth opportunities in the clinical laboratories base and about the strategies we are employing to capitalize on.
Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.

In the third quarter, approximately 37% of our revenue was in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. We have previously stated that our goal over the next three to five years was to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 40% of revenue. Once we receive regulatory clearance the acquisitions of Genzyme Genetics will achieve this goal .We will provide you with updated growth goals for our Esoterix business after we have closed the acquisition.
Does acquiring Genzyme Genetics limit you ability to repurchase shares or act upon other acquisition opportunity?
While we do not comment specifically on share repurchase, we have historically been a consistent purchaser of our shares. Also we believe that we can be active with acquisitions, obviously adjusted for the need for Genzyme Genetics funding. Thus we do not believe we are precluded from conducting our business as usual or prompt for ceiling our strategic goals.
Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse trended during the year?
In the quarter, our drugs of abuse volume increased 13.9% year-over-year. That compares to a year-over-year increase of 15.4% in Q2 of 2010, a year-over-year increase of 6.8% in Q1 of 2010, a year-over-year decrease of 6.5% in Q4 of 2009 and a year-over-year decrease of 15% Q3 of 2009.
What gives the status of your transition payments to UnitedHealthcare?
Our obligations to reimburse UnitedHealthcare for transition payments ended on December 31, 2009. We have received and paid the final invoices for these payments. The final amount was approximately $120 million.
What impact was the proposed 2011 Medicare physician fee schedule rule have on your business.
Assuming the Congress acts to prevent the reduction in the physician schedule, we would expect to receive a modest increase to our revenue tied to that schedule. As a reminder, approximately 2% of our revenue is tied to the physician fee schedule.
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Dave.

Yes, we had some help from acquisitions but both on the core side and the esoteric side, we saw the business grow.
In terms of anatomic pathology, our histology volumes actually increased year-over-year in the third quarter. There was some help from acquisitions there but again, the organic trend in anatomic pathology improved. So to be clear on that, we lost a little volume organically but the trend has improved substantially from what we’re seeing through last year and the first two quarters of this year.

That Genzyme Genetics transaction really opens up a whole new area of opportunity for us, which is the large hospitals and academic medical centers that are sending reference work to Genzyme Genetics that historically have been very difficult for LabCorp to reach.

It’s my understanding that the FDA continues to review the input they have received at that session and also continues to evaluate what the right regulatory approach would be for lab developed testing. We have worked extensively through the American Clinical Laboratories Association or trade association to, which by the way the collaboration of I believe 13 other or 14 other affiliated industry groups including the College of American Pathologists, the hospital lab trade association, a lot of a good thinking has gone on in the industry about trying to help FDA find the right course.
So at this point I think its private sure to try to hypothesize what FDA might do, but I do you think there they are taking a measured approach which we appreciate.

It’s about $120 million of revenue and for a reference, in about 2005, that business was a $40 million business. So, in the space of less than five years, it’s triple from a revenue perspective. Also, I would point out that, last year was a very tough year. So we actually went backward a little bit. This year we’re getting back to where we were really in the 2008 time.
So its been an excellent source of growth for us its also been an excellent source of innovation and it positioned us in terms of out ability to license and capitalize on assays like IL-28D because the pharmaceutical sponsors recognize our superior esoteric capabilities and all the other advantages we have, including our infrastructure and the service centers that can help them with patient collections.
So the business had been a very good business. What it has lacked and what we have talked about probably for at least the last year if not more is, we have lacked a central lab network that went beyond the United States.
Our central lab in Belgium and some affiliates, some loose affiliations that with labs in other countries and the reality is that, the naive patients, and when I say that, its patients who are not being treated and therefore the patients that are most desirable for trial sponsors. The naïve patients largely these days are in the developing markets, so that’s India, its China Singapore, and Malaysia.
Our central lab capabilities in those areas has been a detriment, particularly in China because under Chinese regulations no one is allowed to move blood out of the country to do testing elsewhere. So what Clearstone offers us is a collaboration that makes our services and also our esoteric testing capabilities available in places that we previously have not had those capabilities. So I think it will be a significant opportunity to grow the clinical trials business going forward.

How are trends? The OB/GYN market continue to be better than the IMS data so if the IMS data is down by X, we are down by less than X, but we are still down and I would say the biggest thing we noticed on a year-over-year basis is a decline in PAP testing and my hypothesis and I will tell you its only a hypothesis, it’s very hard to prove out but my hypothesis is you were seeing a lot of people, a lot of women who are differing a PAP for a year, whether its because on financial considerations, whether its because the PAP itself isn’t very expensive but it’s also involves a physician office visit, which can be expensive. I don’t know the answer to that but that’s where we see the biggest impact in overall volume in the OB/GYN market.

So right now they get set of CPT codes and particularly with genetic testing that sort of CPT codes could be any number of a wide variety of tests.
So the concern is that whether it’s by design or otherwise, the coding is not consistent among providers for the tests and so that adds further opaqueness to what are they actually paying for.
We have always been supportive of greater transparency in CPT coding and in people knowing and payers knowing what they’re paying for, that’s absolutely appropriate and I think the concern that we’d express to Polmedo is make sure that when you implement guidelines such as these, you don’t run in to the law of unintended consequences as CMS did a couple of years ago with their medically, whatever they were called, the medically unbelievable and its where there were some significant potential consequences to provide they had not foreseen.
I know that recently the Monogram business people met with clinicians, met with medical director of Polmedo. They provided a very detailed data package on why Polmedo should reimburse appropriately for the trofile testing. Polmedo was very pleased with the package that we provided and I think what it says is, if you provide the appropriate date and you provide transparency, which is what we try to do, its not a big issue.
So I think again I think we will be fine with this. I think the initiative for greater transparency in coding is something that we at LabCorp welcome. So I think the key is to make sure that in doing these things there are not unintended consequences that are not foreseen at the time when the rules are implemented.

So our guidance for what we think we’re going to do in the fourth quarter is unchanged, because we think fundamentally the environment is unchanged. That’s why we are where we are.

I wanted to go back to gross margins. Just for a moment, I know you talked about drag from the couple of the acquisitions there, but even adding back some of the drag, it looks like gross margins still down year-over-year versus the first half of the year.

So that’s a headwind in terms of gross margin, but, offsetting that, and why we’re able to improve gross margin, the first half of the year and keeping net of the acquisitions flat this quarter is to continue progress on our 2010 initiatives and our efficiency initiatives and we expect those to continue to have a positive impact on gross margin overtime.

So, you are not going to see huge jumps in gross margin. You are going to see incremental gains, 10, 20 basis points, and I think that’s the way we should think about it. So we certainly should think about overtime, there is the opportunity to continue to improve our gross margin.

Last question.

So, I guess one there was an expectation that because of your scale, we'd see better margin on where that’s run historically. Then the second question is, what would you be amortizing, will that be significantly higher than your own amortization, which runs about 1.5% of revenue?

There are three lines of business within Genzyme Genetics; the genetics business, the hematology-oncology business and the clinical trials business. We are not going to rush through on the integration process to improve the margin profile at the expense of loosing the revenue and the value of the brand that we’re paying for.

We think that our results stand up well on there merit and that’s what we want our honors to evaluate us by.
With regards to the commentary as I don’t make it a habit of listening to our comparators call, I don’t know what comments they gave but the commentary I can give you is, we started to see the impact on, the economic impact volumes as early and we started to make reference to it, as early I believe is the second quarter of 2008 when we did that when others were expressing the view that they were not seeing that impact.
We did that, we undertook strategic initiative to redirect our sales force and to redirect our sales efforts to areas where we felt there was the greatest opportunity to continue to grow the business in spite of the economic challenge and so we put a lot of sales resources in to infective deceases, we put a lot of sales resources in to endocrinology, we put lot of resources in to particularly the up deferred market for pre-natal and pre-conception genetic testing.
So I think our results since we undertook those initiatives speak for themselves, which is that they have been positive not only by comparison to the industry, but generally in terms of just the profile of our business and the continued growth of the esoteric testing line.
We also have said that the acquisitions are part of our growth strategy and we continue to make strategic and in our view very sensible acquisitions and then deliver what we say we do which is we said monogram be accretive of post the annualization and monogram is accretive post the animalization and its driving top line revenue growth because of the pricing and because of the unique to sort of test offering.
So, we’re going to continue with the strategy that is been successful for us and of course always going to continued to refine that strategy to improve it as we take account of what’s going on in the market place and the long-term opportunity in the business when we receive regulatory clearance and close Genzyme Genetics and have a new window into a large hospital systems, academic medical centers, more pre-natal and pre-conceptions genetic testing, more hematology, oncology business in an area that is not subjected in-sourcing, which is a very sophisticated treatment of a blood and bone cancers. We feel great about the way the future looks for us.

On today's call, I'll discuss four key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. First, cash flow. Our cash",523,"Thank you, Steve. By now you should've had a chance to review our third quarter financial results. On today's call, I'll discuss four key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. 
First, cash flow. Our cash flow remained strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2010 was $718.2 million compared to $739.6 million in 2009, both net of transition payments to UnitedHealthcare. This decrease of 2.9% is attributable to higher capital expenditures, which were anticipated in our cash flow guidance. Also, third quarter cash flow was impacted by timing-related issues and accounts receivable, primarily related to acquisitions and higher tax payments. Importantly, our full year guidance related to operating cash flow remains $870 million.
We're extremely pleased with our cash collections despite the timing-related issues previously mentioned. DSO improved four days year-over-year to 44 days at the end of September and declined sequentially by one day from the second quarter. As a result of our continued success in cash collections, we're maintaining our bad debt rate of 4.8%.
Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. During the quarter we achieved strong growth in revenue per requisition which increased 5.7% year-over-year. The growth in revenue per requisition is attributable to test mix shift and increases in test per requisition. The revenue per requisition growth was also impacted by loss contracts and the recognition of deferred revenue resulting from an amendment to a customer contract, which together improved revenue per requisition by 2.5%. 
Total company volume increased 1.9% year-over-year. The contract losses in 2009 that we've previously discussed reduced volume by 1.4%. Excluding the loss contracts, volume increased by approximately 3.3% in the quarter. Esoteric volume increased 6.9% in the quarter. 
Third, margin. For the third quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 19.6%. Recent acquisitions that we have not yet fully integrated caused the 50 basis point drag on margin. 
Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of September, we had cash of $96.9 million and approximately $395 million available under our revolving line of credit. At the end of September, total debt was $1.3 billion, including $65 million drawn down on our revolving credit facility.
During the quarter, we repurchased $115.8 million of stock, representing 1.5 million shares. At the end of September, approximately $234.2 million of repurchase authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program. 
I would also like to point out that earnings per share benefited in the quarter as a result of a reduced tax rate, primarily due to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions. 
This morning, we updated our 2010 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 5%; adjusted EPS in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after September 30, 2010, compared to prior guidance of $5.40 to $5.55; operating cash flow of approximately $870 million excluding any transition payments made to UnitedHealthcare; and capital expenditures of approximately $135 million. This updated guidance does not include any impact from the Genzyme Genetics acquisition. 
I will now turn the call over to Dave."

We grew revenues 7.7% in the third quarter. We grew esoteric revenue by approximately 10.1%. Taking into account the impact of lost contracts, volume increased year-over-year by 3.3%. We are encouraged that we have achieved volume growth in a difficult economic environment and believe this reflects the effectiveness of our growth strategies. Revenue per requisition growth remained strong at 3.2% after adjusting for the impact on revenue per requisition from the lost contracts in deferred revenue. Thus, the pricing environment remains stable.
I would now like to update you on our recent progress on four of our strategic initiatives: acquisitions, expanding our managed care relationships, growing our clinical trials business and enhancing our IT capabilities.
First, we have consistently stated that the primary use of our free cash is to grow our business through strategic acquisitions. This quarter, we made a significant strategic acquisition when we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Genzyme Genetics, a business unit of Genzyme Corporation and one of the premier specialized medical testing laboratories in the United States in an all cash transaction valued at $925 million. Net of expected income tax benefits less acquisition-related expenses, the acquisition is expected to have a net cash cost to LabCorp of approximately $795 million.
We are very excited about the opportunity that the combination of Genzyme Genetics and LabCorp presents for future growth. The acquisition fits squarely into our key strategies, expanding esoteric testing capabilities and enhancing our leadership in personalized medicine. Combining Genzyme with our businesses will allow us to capitalize on two emerging trends: the increasing importance of diagnostics to healthcare and the evolution of personalized medicine into the mainstream of patient care. The acquisition will expand our capabilities in reproductive, genetic, hematology/oncology and clinical trial central laboratory testing and provides us with an attractive opportunity for future esoteric revenue growth.
As we have previously stated, we expect the transaction to be diluted to LabCorp's adjusted EPS for the first year after closing by $0.25 to $0.35, primarily attributable to financing costs and amortization. However, we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to operating cash flow at year one, excluding transaction costs such as bridge financing, legal and advisory fees and restructuring costs. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive to LabCorp's adjusted EPS beginning in the second year after closing. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customer and closing conditions set forth in the agreement, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 as amended. Our goal is to close the acquisition by the end of this year and we look forward to welcoming the employees of Genzyme Genetics to our LabCorp family upon completing the transaction.
On June 16, LabCorp acquired certain assets of Westcliff Medical Laboratories, a clinical lab in California, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement and an order of the bankruptcy court administering the bankruptcy of Westcliff. The acquisition furthers our strategy to grow our footprint in the California market where we have historically been underrepresented. LabCorp was notified by the Federal Trade Commission that it intended to review the acquisition. And on June 24, we entered into an agreement with the FDC to run the Westcliff business as an independent company separate from LabCorp, while the FDC conducts its review of the transaction. The Westcliff business continues to lose money as a separate entity and accounted for the bulk of the margin contraction we experienced in the third quarter. We hope that the FDC will expeditiously conclude its review and allow us to integrate the businesses. At this time, we are unable to provide further information on the transaction.
Second, expanding managed care relationships has long been a key growth strategy for LabCorp. As we have said since gaining access to the New York market through the UnitedHealthcare contract, we are focused on growing our business in this important region. To that end, on August 1, 2010, we gained access to all of the Empire BlueCross BlueShield markets and products as an in-network provider. Empire is New York's largest insurer by medical membership. This expansion of the network provides broader choice for Empire's members and physicians and reduces member cost associated with out-of-network laboratories. We are working diligently to build relationships with Empire and their physicians and look forward to providing Empire members with greater choice and exceptional lab service.
Third, we have consistently discussed our desire to expand the international footprint of our clinical trials central laboratory. After carefully reviewing many opportunities, we took a significant step in doing so by partnering with Clearstone Central Laboratories, a global central laboratory specializing in drug development and pharmaceutical services. The collaboration combines the complementary strengths of two leading central laboratories to support growth development and enhances our clinical trials to central lab offerings in key international geographies, including China, France, Singapore and Canada. Our collaboration is proceeding as anticipated and we remain pleased with the growth opportunities this relationship will provide.
Fourth, we have recently discussed enhancements of our IT products and improvements in client connectivity. This summer, we began the rollout of our new online gateway for client lab connectivity, LabCorp Beacon. Accessible anywhere and at any time, LabCorp Beacon is an end-to-end solution that allows physicians to view, share, manage and analyze lab results. Beacon also gives physicians a choice of tailored solutions, including robust integration with EMRs, EHRs and personal health record applications. These options allow our customers to choose the right solution based on their needs for decision support, interoperability and use objectives. We will complete our launch of Beacon on a national scale by the end of the year. Additional ordering functionality will also be added to Beacon by year end, providing our customers with enhanced analytic capabilities and intuitive interface and a superior customer experience. As with all of our customer facing IT systems, Beacon is built on an open platform strategy that allows seamless integration with hundreds of VHRs and physician practice management systems.
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and we are proud of our progress on our key strategic initiatives. Though the economic climate remains uncertain, we are confident about the long-term growth opportunities in the clinical laboratory space and about the strategies we are employing to capitalize on them.
Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions."

In the third quarter, approximately 37% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. We have previously stated that our goal over the next three to five years was to increase our esoteric tests mix to approximately 40% of revenue. Once we received regulatory clearance, the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics will achieve this goal. We will provide you with updated growth goals for our Esoteric business after we have closed the acquisition.
Does acquiring Genzyme Genetics limit your ability to repurchase shares or act upon other acquisition opportunities?
While we do not comment specifically on share repurchase, we have historically been a consistent purchaser of our shares. Also, we believe that we can still be active with acquisitions.

Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse trended during the year?
In the quarter, our drugs of abuse volume increased 13.9% year-over-year. That compares to a year-over-year increase of 15.4% in Q2 of 2010, a year-over-year increase of 6.8% in Q1 of 2010, a year-over-year decrease of 6.5% in Q4 of 2009 and a year-over-year decrease of 15% in Q3 of 2009.
What is the status of your transition payments to UnitedHealthcare?
Our obligation to reimburse UnitedHealthcare for transition payments ended on December 31, 2009. We have received and paid the final invoices for these payments. The final amount was approximately $120 million.
What impact would the proposed 2011 Medicare physician fee schedule rule have on your business? 
Assuming the Congress acts to prevent the reduction in the physician fee schedule, we would expect to receive a modest increase to our revenue tied to that schedule. As a reminder, approximately 2% of our revenue is tied to the physician fee schedule. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave."

And for reference, in about 2005, that business was a $40 million business. So in the space of less than five years, it's tripled from a revenue perspective. And I would point out that last year was a very tough year, so we actually went backwards a little bit. And this year, we're getting back to where we were really in the 2008 time. So it's been an excellent source of growth for us, it's also been an excellent source of innovation and it's positioned us in terms of our ability to license and capitalize on assays like IL28B because the pharmaceutical sponsors recognize our superior esoteric capabilities and all the other advantages we have, including our infrastructure and service centers that can help them with patient collection. So the business has been a very good business. What it has lacked and what we've talked about probably for at least the last year if not more is we have lacked a central lab network that went beyond the United States, our central lab in Belgium, and some loose affiliations that we had with labs in other countries. And the reality is that the naive patients, so when I say that patients who are not being treated and therefore the patients that are most desirable for trial sponsors. The naive patients largely these days are in the developing markets. So that's India, it's China, Singapore, Malaysia and our lack of central lab capabilities in those areas has been a detriment, particularly in China because under Chinese regulations, we're not allowed -- no one is allowed to move blood out of the country to do testing elsewhere. So the Clearstone -- what Clearstone offers us is a collaboration that makes our services and also our esoteric testing capabilities available in places that we previously have not had those capabilities and I think it'll be a significant opportunity to grow the Clinical Trials business going forward."

Our trends in the OB/GYN market continued to be better than the IMS data. So if the IMS data is down by x, we're down by less than x. But we're still down. And I would say the biggest thing we noticed on a year-over-year basis is a decline in pap testing. And my hypothesis, and I will tell you it's only a hypothesis, it's very hard to prove out. But my hypothesis is you are seeing a lot of people, a lot of women who are deferring a pap for a year whether it's because of financial considerations, whether it's because the pap itself isn't very expensive but it also involves a physician office visit, which can be expensive. I don't know the answer to that, but that's where we see the biggest impact in overall volume in the OB/GYN market."

So right now, they get a set of CPT codes and particularly with genetic testing, that set of CPT codes could be any number of a wide variety of tests. And the concern is that whether it's by design or otherwise, the coding is not consistent among providers for the test, and so that adds further opaqueness to of what are they actually paying for. We have always been supportive of greater transparency in CPT coding and people knowing and payers knowing what they're paying for. That's absolutely appropriate. And I think the concern that we've expressed the Palmetto is make sure that when you implement guidelines such as these, that you don't run into the law of unintended consequences as CMS did a couple of years ago with their medically, whatever they were called, the medically unbelievable edits where there was some significant potential consequences to providers that they have not foreseen. So I know that recently, the Monogram business people and the clinicians met with the Medical Director of Palmetto. They provided a very detailed data package on why Palmetto should reimburse appropriately for the profile testing, Palmetto was very pleased with the package that we provided. And I think what it says is, if you provide the appropriate data and you provide transparency, which is what we try to do, it's not a big issue. And so again, I think we'll be fine with this. I think the initiative for greater transparency in coding is something that we, at LabCorp, welcome. And I think the key is to make sure that in doing these things, they are not unintended consequences that are not foreseen at the time that those are implemented."

The timings of our earnings are largely dictated by closing the quarter. The timings of our announcements are largely dictated by closing the quarter. And recognizing your comment at the same time, we think that our results stand up well on their merit and that's what we want our owners to evaluate us by. With regards to the commentary as I don't make a habit of listening to our competitor's call, I don't know what commentary they gave. But the commentary I can give you is we started to see the economic impact on volumes as early and we started to make reference to it as early, I believe, as the second quarter of 2008. When we did that when others were expressing the view that they were not seeing that impact. We did that. We undertook a strategic initiative to redirect our sales force and to redirect our sales efforts to areas where we felt there was the greatest opportunity to continue to grow the business despite of the economic challenge. And so we put a lot of sales resources into infectious disease, we put a lot of sales resources into endocrinology, we put a lot of resources into the, particularly, the obstetrics market for prenatal and preconception genetic testing. And I think our results since we undertook those initiatives speak for themselves, which is they have been positive, not only by comparison to the industry but generally, in terms of just the profile of our business and the continued growth of the esoteric testing line. We also have said that acquisitions are part of our growth strategy and we continue to make strategic, and in our view, very sensible acquisitions and then deliver what we say we do, which is we said Monogram would be accretive post the annualization, and Monogram is accretive post the annualization. And it's driving top line revenue growth because of the pricing and because of the unique test offering. So we're going to continue with a strategy that has been successful for us. We're, of course, always going to continue to refine that strategy, to improve it as we take account of what's going on in the marketplace. And the long-term opportunity in the business, when we receive regulatory clearance and close Genzyme Genetics and have a new window into large hospital systems, academic medical centers, more prenatal and preconception genetic testing, more hematology/oncology business in an area that is not subject to in-sourcing which is the very sophisticated treatment of blood and bone cancers, we feel great about the way the future looks for us."
