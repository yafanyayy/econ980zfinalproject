Before we get started, I'd like to say hello and once again, recognize all of our employees around the world who continue to dedicate themselves to helping Mylan meet its goal o",1112,"Thank you, Dan. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I'd like to say hello and once again, recognize all of our employees around the world who continue to dedicate themselves to helping Mylan meet its goal of becoming the highest quality and most efficient global generics and specialty pharmaceutical company in the industry. Time and time again, our employees deliver results that outpace expectations. On behalf of our Board of Directors and our management team, I would like to thank each and everyone of them. Since I became Mylan's Chief Executive Officer almost eight years ago, we've been committed to a very clear and consistent growth strategy, which is to combine Mylan's existing strong organic capabilities with external opportunities. Today, it is very evident that Mylan has successfully implemented this strategy as demonstrated by the global platform we've created, as well as the strong union we have forged between the vision, that vision, and the impeccable execution today. This ultimately is what's delivering the solid results and anticipated growth that we are here to report to you today.Before we look at 2010 and beyond, I'd like to review a few key accomplishments from 2009. First, I am pleased with the very strong fourth quarter results, capping off yet another extremely successful year, our second full year of operating the new Mylan. As stated many times, we knew that 2009 was going to be a year dependent predominantly on tremendous execution and again, I would like to thank my management team and all of our employees for making that happen.Our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $0.33, a 27% increase over the same quarter in 2008. For the year, we delivered an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.30, which is a 63% increase over 2008. This surge in our adjusted diluted earnings per share represents the highest annual growth rate among our industry peers by a very significant margin, a statistic that we are proud of and a trend that we fully expect to continue throughout the next several years.In addition to the impeccable execution from our operations, we were able to generate strong operating cash flows throughout the year. Some of the excess cash flows were used to purchase the bulk of the remaining minority interest of Matrix, now a privately held subsidiary, and some was used to deliver on our commitment to continue to delever, by prepaying an approximately $350 million in bank term loans borrowings that were due in 2010 and 2011. We are now in a position where we have only minimal long-term obligations due before 2012. In 2009, we also continue to see the rewards for the hard work and outstanding leadership of Mylan's best-in-class management team. Heather Bresch was promoted to President, and Rajiv Malik succeeded Heather in a position of Chief Operating Officer. These changes as well as many other promotions throughout our company continue to reflect the recognition and strong track record of this management team. We also continue to successfully attract exceptional leaders from outside as well. As you know, today, we announced the employment of John Sheehan as Mylan's new Chief Financial Officer, an appointment that I am very excited about. John's extensive and broad-based technical knowledge, significant multinational manufacturing experience and his ability to lead large complex international finance organizations make him an outstanding addition to Mylan. With that said, I would like to personally thank our very, very strong global corporate finance team for their continued commitment and outstanding performance. This is truly another testament to the strength of Mylan's overall management team.In 2009, we also said farewell to our co-founder, Mike Puskar, who stepped down from the Board of Directors in October. It is my great honor to have succeeded Mike as Chairman of our Board. I was equally as pleased this past year to be able to appoint Rod Piatt as Vice Chairman, and to welcome Mylan's newest Board member, industry veteran Mark Parrish. Mylan was also recognized and rewarded externally in 2009 for its multiple achievements. Our stock price rose 86% during the year. We received positive actions from both independent rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, and we were also named to the Fortune 500. Looking to 2010, I am extremely pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.50 to $1.70. This should translate into an industry-leading earnings per share growth rate over the 2008 and 2010 period. This guidance fully incorporates our continued heavy investment into our business, including our biologics strategy. It also includes any potential negative arbitrage in interest rates as we continue to look at meaningful opportunities in the capital markets to further improve our capital structure as we look to stagger our debt maturities in a more favorable manner.  That said, I fully expect that as we roll forward into 2010, there may be additional opportunities to possibly improve and even further tighten our guidance range. In a few minutes, Heather will provide you with insights into our longer-term strategic growth targets for 2011, '12 and '13. This will include discussions about Mylan's unique position from which we will be able to control our business by continuing to strategically leverage this powerful, one-of-a-kind platform that we have created.  Through continuing our outstanding execution, portfolio expansion, additional commercial diversification, operational efficiency and an even stronger balance sheet, I am extremely confident in our projected annual top-line growth rate of 15%, culminating with revenues in excess of $8.5 billion by 2013, and a bottom line CAGR of 20%. I am also highly confident that we will achieve earnings per share in excess of $2 in 2011. With these achieved growth targets, we also expect to generate approximately $4 billion of cumulative operating cash flows by the end of 2013.Lastly, the most important aspect of our expected growth is that it is predominantly organic, and all the work necessary to achieve these results is either already completed or will be by the end of 2010. This is even more impressive, considering that this anticipated growth does not include any M&A activity or any meaningful contribution from generic biologics or our future launch of Copaxone, which could only provide additional upside after the expiration of the 30-month stay in March of 2012. Let me close by stating that in the eight years I have served as the Chief Executive Officer, I have never been more confident about our industry and about the growth potential for Mylan. With that, I will now turn the call over to our President, Heather Bresch."

As you saw from the very strong fourth quarter and full year results we announced earlier today, Mylan continues to perform at levels that exceed even our own high expectations. Throughout the quarter and the",2454,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from the very strong fourth quarter and full year results we announced earlier today, Mylan continues to perform at levels that exceed even our own high expectations. Throughout the quarter and the year, we continue to submit applications, launch new products, grow our customer base and capture synergies and efficiencies. We maintained our focus and executed relentlessly just as we always have. Our strong '09 performance should demonstrate our ability to hit our 2010 guidance while at the same time, finding additional opportunities to further leverage our powerful operating platform, positioning us to continue delivering outstanding performance in 2011 and beyond. During my prepared remarks today, which will be accompanied by slides on this webcast, I'll review our operational results for the quarter and the year, provide you with an updated perspective on our guidance for 2010 and then give you some color on how we expect to achieve a compound annual EPS growth rate of 20% through 2013. As you can see on Slide 3, Mylan delivered very strong performance in 2009. We generated nearly $5.1 billion in adjusted revenues, about $1.25 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.30 in adjusted diluted EPS. 2009 played out much as we expected. During the first half of the year, 180-day exclusivity period we enjoyed on Divalproex in the U.S., was a major contributor to revenue and earnings growth. As promised, we maintained solid revenue and earnings results during the second half of the year through numerous product launches around the world, and accelerated as well as generated additional synergies. These events complemented our global-based business, which contributed to our strong, balanced quarterly results throughout the year. I'd like to echo a comment that Robert makes on every quarterly call, which is that the credit of our success belongs to our employees. So I'd like to take a moment now to thank each and every one of them for routinely going above and beyond to demonstrate that Mylan truly is a world-class generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company, with an operating platform and a work ethic that is second to none. Thanks to their dedication. Our future has never been brighter.Moving on to Slide 4, I'll now walk you through our sales performance by region. Overall, I'd characterize our results as being solid across the board, underscoring the power and consistency of our diversified global operating platform. Also noteworthy is that we maintain the best-in-class customer service levels by simultaneously optimizing our supply chain. This allowed us to respond successfully to opportunities created throughout the year by a variety of market disruptions. Our Generics business in North America continued its strong performance. We generated third-party revenues of $539 million for the quarter as compared to $557 million for the same period in 2008. New products launched in the fourth quarter in the U.S. combined with our strong base business, nearly managed to offset the revenue decrease caused by the loss of exclusivity we enjoyed on Levetiracetam in the last quarter of 2008. For the year, third-party revenues in North America were $2.1 billion, an increase of 14% over the $1.85 billion reported in '08. Contributing to this growth was the 180 days of exclusivity we had on Divalproex, an increase in synergies as well as 5% year-over-year growth in Canada. Our EMEA region hit an all-time record during the fourth quarter. Third-party revenues of $480 million increased $110 million or 30% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Revenues in the current quarter were affected favorably by foreign currency translation, reflecting a weaker U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis, operational revenue growth was about 19% year-over-year. This operational growth was led by higher volumes and new launches such as Clopidogrel, which we successfully introduced in several markets, including France and Spain. Both of those markets produced record sales as local currency revenues rose about 20% and 30% year-over-year, respectively. Italy also enjoyed record sales during the quarter as local currency revenues increased nearly 60% over the year-ago period, responsible for higher volumes on several key products and a favorable impact of regulatory changes on pricing.For the full year, EMEA performed well. Total revenues increased 1% to $1.65 billion as compared to '08. However, on a constant currency basis, total revenues rose 8%. In general, growth was driven by our base business, new launches and improved cost of goods, which continue to offset pricing pressure. In our Asia Pacific region, for which the fourth quarter is traditionally strongest seasonally, we again delivered solid results. Total revenues were $271 million, up 36% over '08's fourth quarter results of $199 million. Operational revenue growth accounted for 20% of this increase while currency effects contributed the remainder.The operational growth was driven by higher year-over-year local currency revenues in our major business operations in India, Australia and Japan. Our Matrix business had a record quarter due to higher sales of its expanding line of ARV finished dosage form products and third-party APIs for both ARV and other products.In Australia, we achieved high single-digit local currency revenue growth as an approximate 20% increase in product volumes more than offset the impact of price discount. And in Japan, we saw low single-digit local currency revenue year-over-year consistent with the pace at which the generic market there continues to expand. For the full year, total revenues in our APAC region were $882 million, an increase of 10% over '08's results of $802 million. That 10% reflects 16% of operational growth, offset by a negative currency effect of 6% as expected. Matrix led the way with accelerating double-digit growth. And at our Specialty business today, fourth quarter total revenues rose 8% to $87 million. This includes intercompany revenues of $25 million associated with the transfer of Dey's generic products to our Mylan Pharmaceutical subsidiary. As you know, we launched the new version of our EpiPen Auto-Injector in October, and I'm pleased to report that the product is doing very well as expected, and we are receiving positive feedback on its enhanced design features. For the full year, Dey's adjusted third-party revenues were $413 million, a 7% increase over '08 results of $386 million. Excluding revenues associated with the transfer of generic products, revenue growth exceeded 10%, right in line with our original expectation of double-digit growth. Revenues from our Auto-Injector grew almost 10% year-over-year, while performance revenues doubled. In summary, '09 was an outstanding year for Mylan. We produced phenomenal financial results while executing to meet or exceed all of our stated objectives. On Slide 5, looking at our performance for 2008 through 2010, you can see that we truly are reaping what we've sown and delivering industry-leading year-over-year growth. Using the middle of our 2010 guidance as the basis for our calculation, adjusted revenues are rising at a 10% compounded annual rate, EBITDA is coming in at 20% and EPS is growing nicely at 41%. And as I'll discuss, there is still a lot to leverage on our platform, which will allow us to deliver our stated EPS growth target at 20% through 2013.Before moving on to our longer-term outlook, I'll touch briefly on our guidance for 2010, which appears on Slide 6. As Robert mentioned, we are reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for 2010 of $1.50 to $1.70. Most of the elements of that guidance remain intact, the exceptions being revenue and R&D, both of which we've increased as we continue to grow and invest for the future.We anticipate that the second half of 2010 will be stronger than the first half as we capitalize on the full year effect of hundreds of first quarter launches, as well as $120 million of back-end loaded incremental synergies. As you consider our guidance and reflect on our achievements to date, I trust a key takeaway is that you can absolutely, positively depend on us to execute and deliver. As we stated many times, 2010 is the baseline year from which Mylan will continue to grow. We have an extremely powerful platform. We are fanatic about execution, and we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are perfectly positioned to leverage our assets over the years to come. In fact, as you'll see, we are just getting started. Looking ahead on Slide 7, we intend to build on our industry-leading year-over-year growth by delivering compound annual growth in revenues of 15% and adjusted EPS of 20% through 2013. We expect this momentum to yield more than $8.5 billion in revenues, while maintaining a relatively stable gross margin and generate more than $2.75 in adjusted diluted EPS. All of this being created organically and while pushing out the launch of Dey's combo products to 2015. Just a further note, there is no reliance on any M&A. Our formula for delivering this performance is not complicated. In fact, it's very simple and straightforward. We will achieve this growth through continued execution of what are by now, very familiar opportunities, as shown on Slide 8. Specifically, we will expand our portfolio, keep realizing additional efficiencies, continue diversifying and further deleverage our balance sheet. By staying focused on leveraging the assets we already have, we will continue to control our growth and our destiny. Moving to the next slide, as you may remember, we stated that while we were vertically integrating, repatriating products and selling our global pipeline, regulatory time frames did not allow any meaningful portfolio expansion from 2008 to 2010.  Looking ahead, however, we stand to reap tremendous benefits of that work as we enjoy once again, the largest pipeline in our history. The approximately 3,000 products submissions we will have made cumulatively by the end of this year, represent a key driver of the $8.5 billion revenue we will generate. In the U.S. alone, we have more than 140 ANDAs pending approval with the FDA, more than 40 of which represent first-to-file opportunity. Further, we believe that approximately 1,000 submissions per year and about 500 launches per year represent sustainable run rate to our company.Turning to Slide 10, we currently have a global supply chain that is second to none, delivering the most efficient high quality product while maintaining superior customer service. From the beginning, we have continued to accelerate and find additional synergies that will deliver a cumulative annual benefit of $350 million by the end of this year. We intend to capture even more efficiencies as we continue to leverage our platform. As of today, 50% of our pipeline is vertically integrated. In addition, you may recall that legacy Merck business in-licensed most of its products, about 75% of them. We've since pushed that figure down to 55%, and by the end of 2013, it will stand at 30%. As you can imagine, the economics associated with these actions are tremendous. When you connect to our pipeline and supply chain to the many attractive markets around the world in which we already operate, you really can begin to see why Mylan is and will be the greatest growth story in the industry.Turning to the next slide. In the largest market in the world, the United States, where we already are a powerhouse, we see more opportunity. We sell one out of every 12 scripts written, branded or generic, with a Mylan product. We enjoy a 12% share of the generics market overall, and we represent the gold standard when it comes to quality and reliability. Additionally, our products command on average, 40% market share. To this, we now add the largest pipeline in our history. Further, we are confident that Dey will continue to deliver double-digit growth, especially as we leverage the market expansion opportunities around EpiPen in the United States and globally, continued growth of Perforomist and additional upside from EMSAM.In Europe, on Slide 12, we're excited about the potential of increased utilization, especially in our growth markets. France, our largest market, is increasing generics utilization, and we have a 31% market share. Bringing our integrated products into this market and capturing increased utilization will prove very beneficial, as it will in our other rapidly growing markets such as Spain, Italy and Portugal.Moving on to the next slide. In Asia-Pacific, it's the same story. We will bring our global competencies to bear as we drive efficiencies while maintaining local commercial expertise. Japan is the world's second largest pharmaceutical market that utilization is low, about 19%. While we rank fourth in market share and are growing from a small base, we believe we will experience accelerated growth as current and upcoming incentives continue to motivate pharmacists to substitute generic products. In Australia, we are maintaining our number one market position and expect utilization rates to continue to increase. We expect Matrix to continue growing an accelerated double-digit clip. An important force behind the growth of Matrix is our ARV portfolio, which now includes 30 products. Today, nearly one out of every three people being treated for HIV/AIDS in the developing world depends on our product. Moreover, we have pledged to do for access what we have already done for affordability for this devastating disease. All of this drives our commitment to continue diversifying our product mix, geographies and financial profile. Finally, as described on Slide 14, we fully intend to build on our past track record of delevering our balance sheet. We continue to demonstrate very strong cash flow and look to generate $4 billion in cumulative operating cash flow through 2013. This gives us the ability to keep investing in our business while continuing to pay down our debt. In addition, we intend to optimize our long-term capital structure, tapping the capital markets opportunistically as appropriate. I think you all realize that we love to think big and unconventionally. But what really separates us is that we deliver and standing still is never an option. No imagination is necessary to see that the stage is set to deliver our anticipated compound annual growth of 20% through 2013. Now, on this final Slide, let's talk about what we're doing today to prepare for tomorrow. Our growth drivers for beyond 2013 includes Copaxone, which we expect will deliver very robust performance. We continue to expand geographically and introduce new therapeutic categories and dosage forms, such as injectables. We also continue to invest today in our biologics platform, which we see as the next big bolus [ph] for the generic industry globally. We also will consider additional M&A opportunities as we look forward to the 2015 launch of Dey's combo product, as well as other complementary product offerings. I am proud of what we've accomplished and truly believe Mylan's best days are yet to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan Rizzo."

This morning, I will walk you through our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, our 2010 guidance key assumptions, and then I'll turn it over to our Treasurer, Brian Byala to conclude by provi",1379,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will walk you through our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, our 2010 guidance key assumptions, and then I'll turn it over to our Treasurer, Brian Byala to conclude by providing an update on the status of our capital structure and liquidity position. As Dan mentioned earlier, I will at times, be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis, which again, are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP measures as they are prepared on the same basis used by management and the Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our business. Now turning back to Slide 3 that details our 2009 financial highlights. As a reminder, the more significant items that are excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted basis results for the 2009 fourth quarter are purchase accounting amortization of $72 million, integration and other expenses of $41 million, net unfavorable litigation settlements of $114 million and imputed interest expense related to our convertible debt of $11 million, and a net tax benefit related to the excluded items and tax benefits from internal reorganizations, together totaling $135 million. Please refer to this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website for a complete reconciliation from our GAAP basis to non-GAAP financial measures for the 2009 and 2008 fourth quarter and full year, as the nature and amount of the adjustments included on the reconciliation can and do change from period to period.On to our 2009 results. As you have heard from Heather, our very strong operational execution across the board enabled us to meet or exceed each element of our 2009 financial guidance, which we last updated in October. Starting with our consolidated top line, total revenues for the quarter were $1.35 billion, an increase of 12% over last year's fourth quarter of $1.2 billion. Revenues in the current quarter were favorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, reflecting a weaker U.S. dollar. Translating currency, current year revenues at prior year exchange rates would have resulted in operational year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 6%, while the change in currency rates also contributed six percentage points of growth.For the full year, adjusted revenues increased 8% to $5.1 billion, which is the upper end of our guidance range. Revenues in the current year were unfavorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar. Compared to last year's full year adjusted revenue of $4.7 billion, operational growth calculated, as I just explained, was 12% and the negative impact of currency was 4%. Looking at our operational profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 44%, resulting in a full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 46.5%, in line with our guidance range. As anticipated, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was our lowest of the year, reflecting a seasonally light quarter for EpiPen Auto-Injector revenues and price erosion following the loss of exclusivity on Divalproex in the third quarter. We continue to do an excellent job of increasing the efficiency of our R&D spend and leveraging our infrastructure that has allowed us to keep our R&D and SG&A costs in check while increasing the productivity of these expenditures, as you saw in the submission and launches metrics Heather reviewed. Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $72 million or 5.3% of revenue, bringing full year adjusted R&D expense to $250 million or about 5% of adjusted revenues. Adjusted SG&A expense was $253 million for the quarter and $990 million for the year or 19.6% of adjusted revenues, just below the middle of our guidance range. Our quarterly adjusted EBITDA was again strong at $312 million in the fourth quarter. This represented our fifth consecutive quarter of generating adjusted EBITDA of $300 million or more. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was $1.25 billion, at the upper end of our guidance range and represented a 21% increase over last year's adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion. Moving now to a couple of our non-operating financial metrics. Interest expense adjusted to exclude imputed interest on our converts was $67 million in the fourth quarter and totaled $276 million for the year, essentially in line with our previous full year projection of approximately $280 million. Our fourth quarter and full year adjusted effective income tax rates came in at 30%, in line with our October projections. In total, these metrics drove strong adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. For the fourth quarter, adjusted net income was $143 million, an increase of $23 million or 19% over the $120 million for the same period a year ago.Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.33, an increase of $0.07 or 27% over last year's fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $0.26, and $0.01 stronger than the third quarter this year, demonstrating our ability to maintain our earnings momentum. For the full year, adjusted net income totaled $583 million, which exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $1.30, representing an increase of $0.50 or 63% over last year's $0.80. Contributing to our adjusted diluted EPS during the quarter was the effect of a lower if-converted shares associated with the company's mandatory stock, as a result of the strength of our stock price. Turning to our cash flow metrics. Once again, we produced strong cash flows from operations. For the full year, cash flow from operations were $605 million, which despite including approximately $52 million in net after-tax cash outflows during the fourth quarter related to the DOJ legal settlement, came in near the upper end of our guidance range of $550 million to $625 million. Additionally, after a particularly robust fourth quarter, spending on capital for the full year totaled $170 million, in line with our most recent full year forecast. In summary, we had an exceptionally strong finish to a very successful year on many fronts, building up strong momentum as we enter 2010. Now turning back to Slide 7 that details our 2010 guidance. Heather has already provided you with the update to our guidance for 2010, our baseline year from which Mylan will continue to grow. Before turning it over to Brian, I would like to share the details of some of the assumptions that underlie this guidance, some of which have changed. First, the midpoint of our unchanged 2010 47% to 49% adjusted gross margin guidance range reflects a forecasted expansion of about 160 basis points from 2009, largely as a result of the benefit of our ongoing synergy and operational efficiency programs, and our API and FDF vertical integration efforts that Heather detailed earlier and a continued strong product mix. Continuing this trend, the midpoint of our SG&A as a percent of revenues represents a 60 basis point improvement, as we further leverage our infrastructure and keep our SG&A costs in check while increasing our productivity. With respect to Paragraph IV opportunities, these opportunities, as we said last year, are not a significant element of our 2010 guidance. On the currency front, the FX rates used in our 2010 guidance and our growth targets approximate current market conditions. We continue to forecast 2010 interest expense, net of the imputed interest on our converts, to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million. This range considers the potential for higher short-term interest rates and potentially a higher level of interest expense, should we opportunistically execute a long-term financing transaction during 2010.With regard to income tax, we are now assuming an all-in adjusted effective income tax rate in the range of 28% to 30% over the 2010 to 2013 period, versus 30% in 2009 due to the benefit of additional anticipated tax planning strategies. And finally, two important cash flow metrics. We expect 2010, operating cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million, almost 30% higher than our strong 2009, based on the midpoint of this range. We project our investment in capital to be around the $250 million run rate for the next several years, as we continue to invest on our global platform. Now let me turn the call over to Brian for an update on our capital structure and liquidity position."

Thanks to our",370,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As we've reported over the last several quarters, we continued to be in great shape from a capital structure liquidity perspective, and our position continues to improve with each passing quarter. Thanks to our strong operating cash flow throughout the year, we invested approximately $340 million related to capital and business acquisitions, including purchasing the bulk of the remaining minority shares of Matrix. We prepaid approximately $350 million in long-term debt maturities, and we paid $139 million in preferred dividends.Notwithstanding these cash outflows, that aggregated approximately $830 million, we still closed the year with over $400 million in unrestricted cash and marketable securities. As a result of the previously mentioned debt prepayment, we have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the third quarter of 2012 and from a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 2.7x our last 12-month covenant basis [ph] adjusted EBITDA, which is well below our December 31, 2009 covenant threshold of 4.0x, and also comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5x.As you already heard from Robert and Heather, we're targeting compound annual earnings growth of 20% for 2013, and expect to generate approximately $4 billion in total operating cash flow in 2010 through 2013. This projected strong cash flow provides us with substantial flexibility to continue to invest in the growth of our business while at the same time, meet the approximate $1 billion in debt payment requirements through 2013, potentially on an accelerated timetable. In addition, we expect we will have opportunities to accelerate repayment of our 2014 debt schedule. And as Dan just mentioned, also look for us to opportunistically go to the capital market to refinance a portion of our term loans, to continue to further optimize the maturity profile of our capital structure. Lastly, let me remind you that our mandatory convertible preferred shares will convert to common stock in November. Not only will this eliminate our $139 million annual dividend commitment, but will also result in the largest market capitalization in the company's history. At recent stock prices, well in excess of $8 billion. I'll now turn the call back over to Dan to start the Q&A."

And I've asked those shareholders to stick with us and I will not have any disruption. We see that we've delivered, we're going to continue to deliver. I don't really need -- I mean, I think the first thing we should ask ourselves, do I need anything else that's out there? And I've said this many times, I just don't see anything else out there that we would need that would further enhance our strategic and operational capabilities. We have everything you would ever want in this industry on board right now. And when you take a look at the growth for just what we already have, certainly, if I did look at anything in the future, it's not going to be anything that's going to be strategic and certainly not dilutive. I don't want to interrupt the earnings momentum that we have right now. But do I see like both and on -- for example, I think the simplest way to look at the opportunities I'm going to look at, I think when Teva gave their presentation, they said they were going from 22% market share to 35%. If you look at that 22%, you'll see that growth, I think in North America alone, we were at 7.8% or 7.8% there, like it's 7.6% market share in North America. If you take a look at that growth rate, you'll find that there was 10.8% of market share that they included on products that we did not have yet. So if you can just imagine what we are going to focus on, we certainly built this platform of scale. You should just be thinking about those therapeutic categories. That 10.8% share that they have, we don't have it yet, and you should expect us to layer those in as we go along. That's more of the kind of activity I think you should anticipate from me going forward rather than some, a need for some huge acquisition."

But again, let me be clear about -- each region is modeled a little bit differently. In the United States, I would have to tell you with all due respect, a lot of the external dynamics and external environment that we see within the industry is I believe, we are certainly benefiting from. I believe that our customer base has a significant higher appreciation for high-quality, high-volume producers. And so I do see more of that in the United States in terms of single-digit, pricing reduction, which has been consistent in our models offset again by the significant further appreciation for to say a platform like Mylan as a reliable quality supplier. In Europe, we are reliant substantially on a continuation of rightsizing that infrastructure as markets continue to move towards a more, a different kind of a distribution system, whether it's tenders. So we have enough mitigating opportunities over there, mitigating cost opportunities over there that we believe we can keep pace with where we see the European market going. But more importantly Europe, we see a significant increase in generic utilization. And it's through our ability to capture those additional volumes, that's another mitigating factor we see in the European region. In the Asia-Pacific region, as you know in 2008, Australia already went off the cliff completely in terms of changing its whole healthcare system from a more of a brand to generic to more of a commodity type of distribution. We've now settled in 2009 there. We are now rebuilding from a new baseline in Australia. And in Japan, all I can tell you is that even though we're, I would say, not material today, I do see a substantial opportunity in Japan. For increased generic utilization. And Heather, do you want to add anything on the Paragraph IV side?"

I’d especially like to welcome and thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. The phenomenal execution and continued dedication for Mylan’s core values combined with the exceptional leadership provided by our senior management team that made it possible for us to report yet another strong quarter results.
I’m behalf of the Board of Directors and our Executive Management team I’d like to thank each and everyone of your contribution. I’d also like to take a moment and welcome John Sheehan this morning as all of you know we've announced John’s appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on our last call and today he joined us for the first earnings report here with Mylan. Welcome John.
Early this morning we reported adjusted diluted and earnings per share $0.36 and reaffirmed our 2010 guidance of the $1.50 to $1.70. These strong results of set the stage for yet another exceptional year at Mylan and they reflect the positive momentum that continues to build from 2009. While this quarter came in slightly better than expected looking forward and as we had guided on our last earnings call, we expect the second quarter results to come in at a comparable level with the majority of our 2010 growth coming in the second half of this year.
Before I turn the call over to our President Heather Bresch, I would like to make another brief comment about the historic healthcare legislation enacted recently in Washington. Even though the reforms did have a financial impact on Mylan, this impact has been fully absorbed in our guidance.
With that said we also anticipate incremental positives due to the passage of this legislation beginning in 2014 when more than 30 million uninsured Americans begin to receive healthcare benefits.
I’ll look forward to answer in your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Heather.

As Robert stated Mylan is off to a great start for the year. We are very please with our first quarter results and remain on track to achieve the 2010 guidance we reported in February and are reiterating today. Du",1139,"Thank you, Robert. Good morning everyone. As Robert stated Mylan is off to a great start for the year. We are very please with our first quarter results and remain on track to achieve the 2010 guidance we reported in February and are reiterating today. During the first quarter we generated total revenues of $1.29 billion compared to last years first quarter adjusted revenues of $1.18 billion an increase of almost 10% and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis.
On the bottom line solid execution in all areas of our business allowed us to generate $0.36 of adjusted diluted EPS and 9% increased over last years first quarter result. Before moving to the performance of our businesses I wanted to tough briefly on our gross margin in R&D expenditures for the quarter. As our results in both areas fell outside of our full year guidance ranges.
Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 46% compared to our full year guidance range of 47% to 49%. As I mentioned on our last call we expect to see a larger contribution to gross margins from current year product launches, higher specialty business sales and synergy realization later in the year, mainly in the second half. As such we continue to expect to meet this element of our guidance.
R&D expenditures total $60 million or nearly 5% of revenues. Similar to last year we fully expect R&D expenditures to rise in quarters 2 through 4 such that we also will meet the element of our guidance; more over our R&D output remain strong. We currently have more than 1440 global product submissions pending approval, more than 300 of which were filed during the first quarter, further we still are targeting more than a 1000 submissions in 2010.
Now I’d like to walk you thorough the performance of our generic business by region and then our specialty segment. Staring with our generic business in North America, third-party revenues for the first quarter were $560 million unchanged from adjusted third-party revenues reported from North America in the comparable year ago period.
This result is notable in that during last year’s first quarter, we launched divalproex ER, a product that enjoyed 180 days of exclusivity. Though we launched fewer products than expected during the quarter due to longer than anticipated delays, in FDA approvals our revenues benefited, from new products launched in the U.S. over the last 12 months including lansoprazole and clindamycin-benzoyl peroxide gel.
The new products contributed approximately $55 million in the first quarter revenue. Further as of April 27, we have launched about half of the dozen limited competition product we expect to introduce by year end. 
Our Canadian business also was a contributor with double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter. As we stated many times the portfolio of countries we manage in Europe is very diverse and dynamic and we continually look for opportunities to maximize its performance.
With that said, in EMEA third-party revenues were $411 million increased $56 million or 16% over the last years first quarter adjusted third-party revenues of $355 million. Revenues were affected favorably by foreign currency translation reflecting a weaker U.S dollar.
On a constant currency basis operational growth in EMEA with 9% year-over-year, that operational result was led not only by continued growth in France, but also in several other countries across the region including Italy, Spain and U.K., and which experience double digit growth. These gains more than offset lower revenues in several markets including the commoditized German market, primarily due to the ongoing implementation of tenders.
In France we had a strong quarter absorbing a well anticipated price cut. In addition our hospital unit delivered strong performance we command market share of 32% in the French generics market overall and 33% in the hospital segment
In Italy our result were affected possibility by some very successful launches in higher product volumes as a result we had captured a disproportionate share the current upside in Italy, further evidence of the opportunity we have to grow in that high potential generics market.
In addition our performance in Spain as an example of our ability to read and react to changing market conditions on a real time basis. As you may know the Spanish government announced during the first quarter then an average price cut of 25% we go into effect in the second quarter.
However we still manage to deliver higher revenues year-over-year as a result of successful product launches. We will continue to adapt our business inline with market changes, so as remain very efficient and competitive in an environment where we expect to see increased generic utilization.
Moving on to Asia-pacific region for the first quarter traditionally our lightest, we delivered very solid result. Total third-party revenues return on $37 million up 27% over ’09s first quarter third-party revenues of a $187 million. Operational revenue growth accounted for 11% of this increase while favorable changes in currency rate contributed to the remainder.
In Australia however local currency revenues declined brightly as we continued to experience irrational and unsustainable pricing by competitor. In addition we continued to remain sensitive to any additional government action on healthcare that might affect the generic industry. Nonetheless we will continue to optimize our business in this market so as to remain our leadership position.
In Japan we saw mid single-digit local currency revenue growth year-over-year, which included the impact Biennial Government price reductions are begin to affect our business in March. Also in the region our Matrix business delivered another quarter of year-over-year double-digit growth primarily responsible with higher sales of its expanding line of ARV finished dosage form products.
Finally, our Specialty segment Dey continued to perform well. Total revenues increased 33% year-over-year for the quarter to $101 million, a result that excludes inter company revenues up $17 million associated with the transfer in last year’s fourth quarter of Dey’s generic products to our Mylan pharmaceutical division. Including this product Dey’s revenues rose 20%.
Dey’s third-party revenues for the quarter were $85 million and increase of more than 30% when excluding from last year’s first quarter revenues associates with the transfer generic I just mentioned. Including those product Dey’s third-party revenues rose 7%.
Dey’s growth came from higher EpiPen auto-injector sales, which resulted from market expansion in a higher price point on the next generation of the product, we began marketing in October. Also contributing today’s performance was continued growth Perforomist and incremental sales of EMSAM, which Dey began marketing during last year’s second quarter.
In summary, I would like to reiterate that we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and remain very confident in our ability to achieve our 2010 guidance metrics, as well as our long-term growth target.
With that I will turn the call over to John.

This morning I would like to walk you through our first quarter 2010 financial results, while at the same time reminding you of our unchanged 2010 financial guidance metrics. I’ll conclude by briefly reviewing our capital structure and liquidity position.
Before doing so though I’d like to start up by saying that on extremely excited to be here at Mylan and working with each of you as the company’s new CFO. I look forward to meeting many of you in the investment community as I get out on the road over the next weeks and months at industry conferences and other up coming investor events.
As most of you maybe aware following 20 years at KPMG, I then spent the last seven years at Delphi Automotive most recently our CFO. As we are very aware the automotive industry experienced nothing sort of the most challenging times ever over the past several years. Although difficult I sound my experiences leading Delphi through a significant re-organization extremely rewarding and valuable as I proactively looked or in my next profession challenge.
As I consider the opportunity to join Mylan, I was very impressed with the growth prospects of the generics and specialty pharmaceutical sector. The soundness of Mylan's growth strategy that was put in motion 2.5 years ago and the significant progress the team has made on executing against that strategy and making that strategic vision become a reality, it was simply an opportunity I could not pass up.
After my first 30 days on the job here at Mylan I’ll tell you that I am fully energized and excited to be in a position to meet a completely different set of challenges. Challenges related to long-term growth, I am especially excited to be working with Robert, Heather, Rajiv and the rest of the leadership and employees of Mylan to deliver on the long-term growth target that we recently set for ourselves.
Over the past few months, you’ve heard Robert comment from the time-to-time about its high level of confidence in the continued solid execution of the companies finance organization well he searched for a new CFO. Well let me tell you during my first 30 days here at Mylan, I’ve come to fully understand and appreciate exactly where Robert settlement has been coming from.
My initial observations are that I’ve inherited a strong, seasoned and highly capable team of finance professionals across the organization. This well established solid finance infrastructure will no doubt proved to be invaluable in allowing me to focus not just on finance, but also being a strong business leader and value-added partner in the successful operation of our global businesses.
Now, moving on to my review of the first quarter financial result. As Dan mentioned earlier, I'm going to be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are prepared on the same basis as used by our management and our Board of Directors in evaluating the performance of our business.
This morning's earnings release includes a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for our first quarter 2010 and 2009 results. Our earnings release is available on our website and I encourage you to take a look at it, as the nature and amounts of the adjustments included in the reconciliation changes from period-to-period.
In summary, the more significant items that are excluded in coming to our adjusted basis results for the 2010 first quarter, our purchase accounting amortization of $72 million, integration and other expenses of $12 million, imputed interest expense related to our convertible debt of a $11 million and the net tax benefit related to the excluded items of approximately $33 million. (Inaudible) Robert and Heather sentiment on the quarter we are off to a very solid start to the New Year.
Let me start at the top of the income statement. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.29 billion, an increase of nearly 10% over last year's first quarter total adjusted revenues of $1.18 billion. Revenues in the current quarter were favorably impacted by approximately six percentage points related to the affect of foreign currency translation reflecting the weaker US dollar.
Importantly and as Heather made reference too earlier excluding the significant decline in revenues related to divalproex sodium ER, which was expected our year-over-year revenue growth rate would have been much higher. For the full year we do continue to project total revenues in the range of $5.45 to $5.75 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 46% compared to our full-year guidance range of 47% to 49%. This margin is lower than the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the loss of exclusivity and divalproex in the second half of 2009. However sequentially it was higher by two percentage points compared to our Q4, 2009 adjusted gross margin.
As Heather mentioned in her remarks we continue to fully expect our operating performance and gross margins to improve as the year progresses, particularly in the second half. Adjusted R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million or approximately 5% of revenues.
While the spending is consistent with our first quarter of 2009 spending level it is lower than our full-year guidance range of 6% to 7% of revenues. Our projects remain on target and we are planning for higher levels of spending over the remainder of the year. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $245 million for the quarter or 19% of revenues, in the middle of our 18% to 20% full-year guidance range.
Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $323 million, if you combine this results with our expectation for generating higher levels of rev earnings later in the year we see ourselves on track to meet our adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $1.4 to $1.6 billion for the full year.
Now, let me move to a couple of our non-operating financial metrics. First quarter 2010 interest expense adjusted to exclude imputed interest on our convertible debt with $63 million. As you know a short-term floating interest rates continued to be an historic lows.
We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be in the range of $280 to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates and potentially a higher level of interest expense should we opportunistically execute on the long-term debt refinancing transaction this year. Income taxes; our first quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 29% inline with our full-year projection for an adjusted effective income tax rate in the range of 28% to 30%.
In summary first quarter adjusted net income was $158 million or $0.36 per share. I believe you’re all aware, but let me say it. In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into a 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the 35 million quarterly preferred dividends. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of 437 million shares.
As you all are aware and we were pleased with, the performance of our stock price in the first quarter was strong. Depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase over the final three quarters of the year due to further dilution from stock option and other potentially dilutive financial instruments such as warrants related to our convertible debt obligation. Our unchanged full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $1.50 to $1.70 does consider the potential for a higher average diluted share count.
Turning to our cash flow metrics, our first quarter cash flow from operations was $241 million, this amount includes $99 million income tax refund related to capital losses previously realized on internal reorganizations. Excluding the benefit of these refund cash from operations was $142 million, compared to $126 million in last year’s first quarter.
We do continue to project full-year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million, excluding certain one-off items. First quarter capital spending was $20 million and similar to 2009, but was less than one quarter of our expected annual spend. Based on anticipated projects timing, we do expect spending to increasing Q2 and continued to project capital spending in the range of about $250 million for the full-year.
Now, let me turn to our capital structure and liquidity position. As most of you are aware, this past December, we repaid our 2011 maturities on our bank term loans, which totaled $196 million and as a result, we have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the first quarter of 2012. 
From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 2.6 times, our last 12 months covenants basis adjusted EBITDA. This is well below our March 31, 2010 covenant threshold of four times and also comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5 times. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $550 million of unrestricted cash and marketable securities compared to just over $400 million at December 31. 
Our balance sheet in this morning's earnings release indicates the strong performance of our stock price in the first quarter also had on the effective increasing the value of the cash conversion feature of our cash convertible notes, which increased our long-term debt balance at the end of the first quarter.
This convergence feature is mark-to-market at the end of each period and reflected in that recorded long-term debt balance, there was an equal and offsetting assets that is recorded in the other asset section of our balance sheet related to a financial instrument hedge we have in place in order to offset the value of the bonds conversion features.
Excluding this and unamortized discounts related to both of our convertible note issuances. The balance of our long-term debt was $4.70 billion at March 31, compared to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2009. This difference relates to the impact on our euro denominated debt of the decline in the value of the euro between the two balance sheet dates. In closing, let me once again say, I believe we’re off to a very solid start to the year.
That concludes my remarks, I’ll turn the call back over to Dan and I look forward to the Q-and-A. Dan.

It’s more systemic in this way, even though the OGD is kind of reorganizing itself with some of the some of the announcements that they work.
Some of the backlog and some of the product approvals, we look at what's going on there more from a timing perspective. For example, some of the products to we anticipated to get actually approved in the first quarter has actually been delayed and we anticipate those approvals just to roll forward.
So you would think on one hand that that would be a negative, but really on the other hand, because this is more of a systemic issue with the FDA, the OGD in particular as a whole within the industry, some of the other products that we have in our portfolio that we anticipated competition, we didn't get either. So the two kind of offset on another and what you have is a rolling forward scenario where again this is simply maybe a timing issue and nothing more than that. Heather.

So and because we done give quarterly guidance, we give annual guidance, I want to stress that, we don’t give quarterly guides, we give annual guidance. I don’t believe very responsible to try to look at a quarter and judge with the guidance that we given over the year, because of this trajectory that I’ve told you, but to your point and an excellent question, I think that there is actually a strong combination and I don’t want to put too much weight on one versus the other.
I will tell you that, we have a voluminous amount of product launches that we see at the later part of the year, but we also rundle to your point that DC continued lower cost of goods savings also coming into that gross margin plan.

So we look at that as an opportunity and as the markets continue and these countries continue to decide to reduce its prices, it basically comes directly up against the actual infra structure in the current models that are in place. So you can fully expect as we continue to monitor each country, as they make -- each of them make their decision about what type of pharmaceutical model they want to have for their country, whether or not they want to support a higher infrastructure cost or whether or not they want a different type of pull through effect.
We on the other hand as management will manage each one of those countries and right size the infrastructure according to what the government wants in terms of that particular region, so we are not concerned at all but overall, we are certainly not concerned in our ability to deliver what we have feel appropriate targets that we set ourselves, but overall I think you should all anticipate a continuation of price cuts going forward as we look out in the whole EMEA section.

I'd especially like to welcome and thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. The phenomenal execution and continued dedication to Mylan's core values combined with the exceptional leadership provided by our senior management team have made it possible for us to report yet another strong quarter results. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our executive management team, I would like to thank each and everyone of you for your contribution. I'd also like to take a moment to welcome John Sheehan this morning. As all of you know, we have announced John's appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on our last call. And today, he joins us for the first earnings report here with Mylan. Welcome, John.
Early this morning, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.36 and reaffirmed our 2010 guidance of $1.50 to $1.70. These strong results set the stage for yet another exceptional year at Mylan and they reflect the positive momentum that continues to build from 2009. While this quarter came in slightly better than expected, looking forward and as we had guided on our last earnings call, we expect the second quarter results to come in at a comparable level with the majority of our 2010 growth coming in the second half of this year.
Before I turn the call over to our President, Heather Bresch, I would like to make another brief comment about the historic healthcare legislation enacted recently in Washington. Even though the reforms did have a financial impact on Mylan, this impact had been fully absorbed in our guidance. With that said, we also anticipate incremental positives due to the passage of this legislation beginning in 2014, when more than 30 million uninsured Americans begin to receive healthcare benefits. 
I look forward to answering your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Heather."

As Robert stated, Mylan is off to a great start for the year. We're very pleased with our first quarter results and remain on track to achieve the 2010 guidance we reported in February and are reiterating tod",1132,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As Robert stated, Mylan is off to a great start for the year. We're very pleased with our first quarter results and remain on track to achieve the 2010 guidance we reported in February and are reiterating today. During the first quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.29 billion compared to last year's first quarter adjusted revenues of $1.18 billion, an increase of almost 10% and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, solid execution on all areas of our business allowed us to generate $0.36 of adjusted diluted EPS, a 9% increase over last year's first quarter result.
Before moving to the performance of our businesses, I wanted to touch briefly on our gross margin and R&D expenditures for the quarter, as our results in both areas fell outside of our full year guidance ranges. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 46% compared to our full year guidance range of 47% to 49%. As I mentioned on our last call, we expect to see a larger contribution to gross margins from current year product launches, higher Specialty business sales and synergy realization later in the year, mainly in the second half. As such, we continue to expect to meet this element of our guidance.
R&D expenditures totaled $60 million or nearly 5% of revenues. Similar to last year, we fully expect R&D expenditures to rise in quarters two through four, such that we also will meet this element of our guidance. Moreover, our R&D output remain strong. We currently have more than 1,440 global product submissions pending approval, more than 300 of which were filed during the first quarter. Further, we still are targeting more than 1,000 submissions in 2010. Now I'd like to walk you through the performance of our Generics business by region and then our Specialty segment. 
Starting with our Generics business in North America. Third-party revenues for the first quarter were $560 million, unchanged from adjusted third-party revenues reported for North America in the comparable year-ago period. This result is notable. And that during last year's first quarter, we launched Divalproex ER, a product that enjoyed 180 days of exclusivity. Though we launched fewer products than expected during the quarter due to longer-than-anticipated delays in FDA approvals, our revenues benefited from new products launched in the U.S. over the last 12 months, including Lansoprazole and Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel. The new products contributed approximately $55 million in the first quarter revenue. Further as of April 27, we have launched about half of the dozen limited competition product we expect to introduce by year end. Our Canadian business also was a contributor with double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter. 
As we stated many times, the portfolio of countries we manage in Europe is very diverse and dynamic and we continually look for opportunities to maximize its performance. With that said, in EMEA third-party revenues were $411 million, increased $56 million or 16% over the last year's first quarter adjusted third-party revenues of $355 million. Revenues were affected favorably by foreign currency translation reflecting a weaker U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis, operational growth in EMEA was 9% year-over-year. That operational result was led not only by continued growth in France but also in several other countries across the region, including Italy, Spain and the U.K. and which experienced double-digit growth. These gains more than offset lower revenues in several markets including the commoditized German market, primarily due to the ongoing implementation of tenders.
In France, we had a strong quarter absorbing a well-anticipated price cuts. In addition, our hospital units delivered strong performance. We command market share of 32% in the French generics market overall and 33% in the Hospital segment. 
In Italy, our results were affected positively by some very successful launches on higher product volumes. As a result, we have captured a disproportionate share of the current upside in Italy, further evidence of the opportunity we have to grow in that high potential generics market. 
In addition, our performance in Spain is an example of our ability to read and react to changing market conditions on a real-time basis. As you may know, the Spanish government announced during the first quarter that an average price cut of 25% will go into effect in the second quarter. However, we still managed to deliver higher revenues year-over-year as a result of successful product launches. We will continue to adapt our business in line with market changes so as to remain very efficient and competitive in an environment where we expect to see increased generic utilization.
Moving onto Asia Pacific region. For the first quarter, traditionally our lightest, we delivered very solid result. Total third-party revenues were $237 million, up 27% over '09's first quarter third-party revenues of $187 million. Operational revenue growth accounted for 11% of this increase while favorable changes in currency rates contributed to the remainder. 
In Australia, however, local currency revenues declined slightly as we continue to experience irrational and unsustainable pricing by competitors. In addition, we continue to remain sensitive to any additional government action on healthcare that might affect the generics industry. Nonetheless, we will continue to optimize our business in this market so as to remain our leadership position. 
In Japan, we saw a mid-single-digit local currency revenue growth year-over-year, which included the impact of biennial government price reductions that began to affect our business in March. Also in the region, our Matrix business delivered another quarter of year-over-year double-digit growth, primarily responsible with higher sales of its expanding line of ARV finished dosage form products.
Finally, our Specialty segment, Dey, continue to perform well. Total revenues increased 33% year-over-year for the quarter to $101 million, a result that excludes intercompany revenues of $17 million associated with the transfer in last year's fourth quarter of Dey's generic products to our Mylan Pharmaceuticals division. Including this product, Dey's revenues rose 20%. Dey's third-party revenues for the quarter were $85 million, an increase of more than 30% when excluding from last year's first quarter revenues associated with the transfer generics I just mentioned. Including those products, Dey's third-party revenues rose 7%. Dey's growth came from higher EpiPen Auto-Injector sales, which resulted from market expansion and a higher price point on the next generation of the product we begin marketing in October. Also contributing to Dey's performance was continued growth of Perforomist and incremental sales of EMSAM, which Dey began marketing during last year's second quarter. 
In summary, I'd like to reiterate that we're very pleased with our first quarter performance and remain very confident in our ability to achieve our 2010 guidance metrics as well as our long-term growth target. 
With that I'll turn the call over to John."

This morning, I'd like to walk you through our first quarter 2010 financial results while at the same time reminding you of our unchanged 2010 financial guidance metrics. I'll conclude by briefly reviewing our capital structure and liquidity position. Before doing so though, I'd like to start out by saying that I'm extremely excited to be here at Mylan and working with each of you as the company's new CFO. I look forward to meeting many of you in the investment community as I get out on the road over the next weeks and months at industry conferences and other upcoming investor events. 
As most of you may be aware, following 20 years at KPMG, I then spent the last seven years at Delphi Automotive, most recently as CFO. As we're all very aware, the automotive industry experienced nothing short of the most challenging times ever over the past several years. Although difficult, I found my experiences leading Delphi through a significant reorganization extremely rewarding and valuable as I proactively looked for my next professional challenge. As I considered the opportunity to join Mylan, I was very impressed with the growth prospects of the generics and specialty pharmaceuticals sector. The soundness of Mylan's growth strategy that was put in motion two and a half years ago and the significant progress the team has made on executing against that strategy and making that strategic vision become a reality. It was simply of an opportunity I could not pass up. 
After my first 30 days on the job here at Mylan, I'll tell you that I am fully energized and excited to be in a position to meet a completely different set of challenges. Challenges related to long-term growth. I'm especially excited to be working with Robert, Heather, Rajiv and the rest of the leadership and employees at Mylan to deliver on the long-term growth targets that we recently set for ourselves. 
Over the past few months, you've heard Robert comment from time to time about his high level of confidence in the continued solid execution of the company's finance organization while he searched for a new CFO. Well, let me tell you, during my first 30 days here at Mylan, I've come to fully understand and appreciate exactly where Robert's sentiment has been coming from. My initial observations are that I've inherited a strong, seasoned and highly capable team of finance professionals across the organization. These well-established solid finance infrastructure will no doubt prove to be invaluable in allowing me to focus not just on finance, but also being a strong business leader and value-added partner in the successful operation of our global businesses.
Now moving on to my review of the first quarter financial results. As Dan mentioned earlier, I'm going to be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they're prepared on the same basis as used by our management and our Board of Directors in evaluating the performance of our business. This morning's earnings release includes a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for our first quarter 2010 and 2009 results. Our earnings release is available on our website and I encourage you to take a look at it as the nature and amount of the adjustments included in the reconciliation changes from period-to-period.
In summary, the more significant items that are excluded in coming to our adjusted basis results for the 2010 first quarter are purchase accounting amortization of $72 million, integration and other expenses of $12 million, imputed interest expense related to our convertible debt of $11 million and a net tax benefit related to the excluded items of approximately $33 million. Echoing Robert and Heather's sentiment on the quarter, we're off to a very solid start to the new year.
Let me start at the top of the income statement. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.29 billion, an increase of nearly 10% over last year's first quarter, total adjusted revenues of $1.18 billion. Revenues in the current quarter were favorably impacted by approximately six percentage points related to the effect of foreign currency translation, reflecting the weaker U.S. dollar. Importantly, and as Heather made reference to earlier, excluding the significant decline in revenues related to Divalproex Sodium ER, which was expected, our year-over-year revenue growth rate would have been much higher. For the full year, we do continue to project total revenues in the range of $5.45 billion to $5.75 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 46% compared to our full year guidance range of 47% to 49%. This margin is lower than the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the loss of exclusivity in Divalproex in the second half of 2009. However, sequentially, it was higher by two percentage points compared to our Q4 2009 adjusted gross margin. As Heather mentioned in her remarks, we continue to fully expect our operating performance and gross margins to improve as the year progresses, particularly in the second half. 
Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $60 million or approximately 5% of revenues. While this spending is consistent with our first quarter 2009 spending level, it is lower than our full year guidance range of 6% to 7% of revenues. Our projects remain on target and we are planning for higher levels of spending over the remainder of the year. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses were $245 million for the quarter or 19% of revenues, in the middle of our 18% to 20% full year guidance range. 
Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $323 million. If you combine this result with our expectation for generating higher levels of rev earnings later in the year, we see ourselves on track to meet our adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year.
Now let me move to a couple of our non-operating financial metrics. First quarter 2010 interest expense adjusted to exclude imputed interest on our convertible debt was $63 million. As you know, short-term floating interest rates continue to be at historic lows. We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates and potentially, a higher level of interest expense should we opportunistically execute on a long-term debt refinancing transaction this year. 
Income taxes. Our first quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 29%, in line with our full year projection for an adjusted effective income tax rate in the range of 28% to 30%.
In summary, first quarter adjusted net income was $158 million or $0.36 per share. I believe you're all aware, but let me say it. In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the 35 million quarterly preferred dividend. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of 437 million shares. As you're all aware and we were pleased with, the performance of our stock price in the first quarter was strong. Depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase over the final three quarters of the year due to further dilution from stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments, such as warrants related to our convertible debt obligations. Our unchanged full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $1.50 to $1.70 does consider the potential for a higher average diluted share count.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $241 million. This amount includes a $99 million income tax refund related to capital losses previously realized on internal reorganizations. Excluding the benefit of this refund, cash from operations was $142 million, compared to $126 million in last year's first quarter. We do continue to project full year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million, excluding certain one-off items. 
First quarter capital spending was $20 million and similar to 2009, but was less than one quarter of our expected annual spend. Based on anticipated projects timing, we do expect spending to increase in Q2 and continue to project capital spending in the range of about $250 million for the full year.
Now let me turn to our capital structure and liquidity position. As most of you are aware, this past December, we repaid our 2011 maturities on our bank term loans, which totaled $196 million. And as a result, we have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the first quarter of 2012. From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 2.6x our last 12-month covenant basis adjusted EBITDA. This is well below our March 31, 2010, covenant threshold of 4x and also comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010, threshold of 3.5x. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $550 million of unrestricted cash and marketable securities compared to just over $400 million at December 31. 
Our balance sheet in this morning's earnings release indicates the strong performance of our stock price in the first quarter, also had on the effective increasing the value of the cash conversion feature of our cash convertible notes, which increased our long-term debt balance at the end of the first quarter. This conversion feature is mark-to-market at the end of each period and reflected in the recorded long-term debt balance. There is an equal and offsetting asset that is recorded in the Other Assets section of our balance sheet related to a financial instrument hedge we have in place in order to offset the value of the bond's conversion feature. Excluding this and unamortized discounts related to both of our convertible note issuances, the balance of our long-term debt was $4.7 billion at March 31 compared to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2009. This difference relates to the impact on our euro-denominated debt of the decline in the value of the euro between the two balance sheet dates.
In closing, let me once again say, I believe we're off to a very solid start to the year. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dan and I'll look forward to the Q&A. Dan?"

It's not something that I would say that's acute to any particular company. It's more systemic in this way. Even though the OGD is kind of reorganizing itself with some of the announcements that there were, and some of the backlog and some of the product approvals, we look at what's going on. They're more from a timing perspective. For example, some of the products that we anticipate that get actually approved in the first quarter has actually been delayed, and we anticipate those approvals just to roll forward. So you would think on one hand that, that would be a negative. But really, on the other hand, because this is more of a systemic issue with the FDA and the OGD in particular, as a whole within the industry, some of the other products that we have in our portfolio that we anticipated competition, we didn't get either.

And we fully have incorporated that into, not only our guidance, but even in our targets. But those things, the opportunity for us is to balance that with the increase in volumes that we anticipate strictly as a result of the lower cost of the pharmaceutical products as a whole, especially the increased generics through increased generic utilization. But most importantly, in addition, I have to tell you again, we do not view some of the markets over in Europe as being the most efficient markets when it comes to the pull-through effect of generics and generic utilization as a whole. So we look at that as an opportunity and as the markets continue and these countries continue to decide to reduce its prices, it basically comes directly up against the actual infrastructure in the current models that are in place. So you can fully expect, as we continue to monitor each country as each of them make their decision about what type of pharmaceutical model they want to have for their country, whether or not they want to support a higher infrastructure costs or whether or not they want a different type of pull-through effect. We on the other hand, as management, will manage each one of those countries and rightsize the infrastructure according to what the government wants in terms of that particular region. So we are not concerned at all, but overall, we are certainly not concerned in our ability to deliver what we feel are appropriate targets that we set for ourselves.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Once again, I would like to start by sincerely thanking each and every one of our employees around the world for yet another great quarter. It is truly your continued outstanding hard work and dedication to Mylan that makes it possible for us to again deliver such strong results. 
We were able to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.37 despite many challenges, including the delay of certain product approvals, global pricing pressures and the impact of negative currency trends. This quarter's strong results only continue to demonstrate the underlying strength of our overall business.
Considering these results and several significant recent announcements, we are now able to narrow our 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share range to $1.55 to $1.65. Also, even though we haven't provided formal earnings guidance for 2011, we remain confident in our forecast to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2 by the end of 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to our President, Heather Bresch, I would like to review at a high level a couple of our significant corporate achievements since our last earnings call.
First, in May, we successfully raised $1.25 billion in long-term notes, and with most of the proceeds we prepaid $1 billion of secured term loan borrowings. 
Second, I was also extremely pleased to be able to fulfill yet another one of our stated objectives by our recent announcement of our intention to acquire Bioniche Pharma, a high-growth global injectable pharmaceutical company. As we reported at the time of the announcement, this business is expected to be immediately accretive in year one, not accounting for any synergies. 
In addition, we expect Bioniche Pharma's growth rate to be well above our stated long-term growth rates. The addition of Bioniche Pharma will only add further assurance in our ability to meet our stated objectives.
With that said, I'd like to forward -- I look forward to answering your questions, but I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather."

First, though, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees. Their outstanding work ethic and commitment to excellence have once again made it possible for Mylan to deliver very strong results. I'd like to start by touching briefly upon a few of the elements of our 2010 guidance.
First, in addition to narrowing our range for adjusted EPS, which Robert mentioned, we are tightening and revising our range for adjusted revenues. We now expect to generate revenues between $5.4 billion and $5.6 billion. 
Next, our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45% compared to our full year guidance range of 47% to 49%. We've mentioned in the past that product mix is an important driver of gross margin, and approval delays in the U.S. played a role in this quarter's performance. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to meet this element of our guidance due to recent approvals we've received on higher-margin limited-competition products, higher specialty business sales, our planned Bioniche Pharma acquisition and continued synergy realization in the second half of the year. 
Finally, as it relates to R&D. We are revising this element of our guidance to 5% to 6% from 6% to 7%. Our adjusted expenditure for the quarter totaled $66 million or approximately 5% of revenues. At this level of investment, our R&D activities are hitting on all cylinders, and our output remains very strong. We currently have 1,480 global product submissions pending approval, and we are on track to achieve our target of 1,000 global submissions annually in 2010 through 2013. In addition, because of Bioniche Pharma's robust pipeline, we do not see a need for any meaningful external R&D activity during the remainder of the year. 
I'd like to turn now to the topic of pricing, which has received much attention lately. Our company has a very long history of delivering profitable growth in the U.S., which is by far one of the world's most competitive pharmaceutical markets. As such, we're very experienced at anticipating and responding to price and reimbursement cuts and managing fluctuations in volume. Now that we have a diversified global platform, we are able to effectively manage these same dynamics on even a larger scale and have more levers available to manage, drive and grow our business.
As we've stated before, we anticipated greater pricing pressure, especially in Europe, than in previous years and took these dynamics into consideration going into 2010. Though these pressures were slightly greater than what we anticipated, we have been able to absorb them.
Being able to manage such dynamics creates tremendous opportunities for Mylan. In fact, we believe we are positioned to leverage our vertically and horizontally integrated capabilities, economies of scale, and reliable and responsive supply chain across our global operations. All the hard work done over the last three years under the campaign of synergies have transformed us into a highly competitive organization. 
This tremendous advantage is the realization of the vision we set out to achieve when we brought together legacy Mylan, the former Merck business and Matrix Laboratories nearly three years ago. During those first three years, we focused on executing the integration of the businesses and on capturing significant synergies. Our strong results throughout that period demonstrate our phenomenal success in that regard. Now that same result has succeeded, paving the way for our strong top and bottom line growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Now I would like to walk you through the performance of our commercial operation.
During the second quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.37 billion compared to last year's second quarter total adjusted result of $1.27 billion. That's an increase of approximately 8%. Revenues grew in both our Generics and Specialty segments. On the bottom line, solid execution across our business allowed us to generate $0.37 of adjusted diluted EPS, a 16% increase over last year's second quarter result. This result is in line with our guidance. 
Within our Generics segment, our North America operations delivered third-party revenues for the second quarter of $589 million, up 12% from last year's second quarter results of $526 million. The increase was driven by sales of new products and increased volumes on our base business. This performance is a true testament to the strength of critical mass in controlling your supply chain so as to seize on market opportunities. 
Our higher revenues also absorbed the loss of exclusivity on Divalproex, which we enjoyed during last year's second quarter.
Complimenting this very strong performance was the record number of product approvals we received during the quarter from the FDA, with a year-to-date total of 33. We have also launched, to date, eight of the dozen limited-competition products we expect to introduce by the year end. These achievements demonstrate the strength of our pipeline and are among the many reasons we're so confident about our future.
I'd also like to add that we remain on track to achieve our full year target of 50 to 60 launches in the U.S. 
Currently in the U.S., we have 131 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing about $92 billion in annual brand sales, and 41 of these pending ANDAs are potential first-to-file opportunities representing more than $21 billion in annual brand sales. 
In Canada, we saw local currency third-party sales grow about 19% versus the year-ago quarter, led by products launched in the last 18 months. Pricing pressures in Ontario, Québec and other provinces due to recent or pending legislation have been offset by a required reduction in payments to pharmacies, particularly in Ontario, resulting in a net impact that we expect will be relatively neutral to our business. 
In EMEA [Europe, the Middle East and Africa], where France drives our performance, third-party revenues of $379 million fell about 4% last year's second quarter third-party revenues of $393 million. However, on a constant-currency basis, operational growth in EMEA was nearly 3% year-over-year. The increase was driven by new product launches in several markets, totaling approximately $31 million, as well as increased volumes in certain countries. We remain committed to optimizing our business to align the new market dynamics in this region. 
In France, our sales dipped slightly versus a year-ago quarter as competitive pressure resulted in lowering price, which offset the favorable contribution from new products and increased sales of existing products. However, our market leadership position remains very strong.
In Spain, we saw a double-digit increase in sales as new product launches more than offset the negative effect on pricing in the portfolio. We also experienced single-digit growth in a variety of countries such as the UK. 
In Italy, second quarter local currency sales almost doubled versus the year-ago quarter due to new product launches and increased market penetration, which resulted in increased volume, as well as regulatory changes that have affected pricing positively. 
Moving onto Asia-Pacific region. We delivered solid second quarter results. Total third-party revenues were $265 million, up nearly 23% over last year's second quarter result of $216 million. On a constant-currency basis, sales increased about 12%. 
In Australia, local currency revenues declined slightly. We are continuing to optimize our business to align to new market dynamics while maintaining our leadership position. 
In Japan, local currency sales rose approximately 7% due to new product launches and continued market expansion. We remain optimistic about longer-term growth opportunities presented by this market and our ability to capture our share of that growth. 
Also in the region, our Matrix business delivered another very strong quarter of year-over-year growth. Primarily responsible were sales of ARV finished dosage forms to third-parties, which more than doubled versus the second quarter of '09, and sales of API to third parties. 
Finally, Dey Pharma, our Specialty segment, continued to perform well during the second quarter. Third-party revenues rose 14% over the same period last year after adjusting last year's third-party sales for the transfer of Dey's generics product to our Mylan Pharms [Mylan Pharmaceuticals] division. The primary driver of that growth was domestic sales of our EpiPen Auto-Injector. 
Moving on, I'd like to express how excited we are about our planned acquisition of Bioniche Pharma.
Bioniche Pharma will further our stated objective of identifying bolt-on acquisitions to fill gaps in our U.S. product portfolio and therapeutic categories. It also will give us the critical mass needed to immediately enter the North American injectables market. As Robert mentioned, we expect the business to be accretive in year one without accounting for any synergies. 
For those of you unfamiliar with the company, Bioniche Pharma is a leading U.S.-focused specialty injectable company based in Galway, Ireland. The company focuses on the development, production and sale of high-quality injectable products, many of which are difficult to develop or produce or that experience limited competition. The products are used in hospital settings and span several therapeutic categories including analgesics, orthopedics, oncology and urology. 
Bioniche currently markets about 30 products, and its pipeline includes 15 ANDAs pending approval with the FDA. The company also has more than 25 additional products in various stages of development. Net revenues totaled approximately $130 million for the 12 months ended May 31, 2010, and approximately $43.5 million for the last three months ended May 31, 2010.
Though the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, we expect the deal to close in September. 
We're excited about this transaction for two reasons. First, we expect Bioniche Pharma's top line growth rate to be well above our stated growth target, which only further bolsters our confidence in them. And because Bioniche Pharma is a higher gross margin business, we expect it to have a positive impact on Mylan's overall gross margin.
Further, while we are not providing synergy numbers, as there is little overlap with our existing operation, we do see opportunities to capture synergies both commercial and technical. We anticipate that once we close, integration activities will be swift and seamless. 
Secondly, we consider this transaction to be strategic in that Bioniche Pharma will become one of the pillars of Mylan Institutional, our newly formed institutional business, which will serve hospitals and long-term care facilities in North America with a differentiated and tailored pharmaceutical product offering.
We expect that offering will initially include that of UDL, the largest unit dose provider to hospitals in the U.S., and Bioniche Pharma's high quality injectables. Moreover, because of the nature of the institutional marketplace, the new Mylan Institutional will fill an important prerequisite to the viability of the commercialization of Mylan's own generic biologics platform in the near future, as well as commercialization of specialized products such as Copaxone. 
As you can see, we have a lot to be excited about in the second half of 2010, from receiving new product approvals to driving continued increases in volumes around the world and achieving annual synergies of $350 million, if not more. 
Looking ahead to 2011. We are as bullish as ever about our prospects and believe our momentum going into the year will be very strong. Specifically, we look forward in 2011 to the additional revenues that will result from the approximately 500 products we expect to launch globally. Among them will be oral contraceptives, which we expect to begin launching in the U.S. around mid-year; the monetization of first-to-file opportunities, such as our previously announced settlements related to Voriconazole, Letrozole, and Venlafaxine; and our recently announced settlement on Minocycline, which John will elaborate on shortly. 
In addition, we will see the expiration of 30-month stays on a number of additional first-to-file opportunities, and we expect to launch in excess of a dozen limited-competition products.
Finally, let me remind you that our legacy Merck Generics business inlicensed about 70% of its product when we purchased it back in '07. By year-end, we'll be at about 55% and expect to keep pushing that figure lower throughout '11 in achieving internalization of 70% by 2013, resulting a positive financial impact. 
At this time, beyond 2011 and through '13, we continue to see strong growth in our overall business and expect to accelerate our top line growth by executing on the key drivers of portfolio expansion, continued realization of operational efficiencies, continued diversification and balance sheet deleveraging. 
In summary, I'd like to remind everyone that we have stated many times that 2010 is the baseline year from which Mylan will continue to grow. We have an extremely powerful platform, a proven ability to execute and an unshakable belief that we are perfectly positioned to leverage our assets over the years to come. The results we announce today only reinforce our confidence that we will deliver performance in 2010 and beyond that is in line with our updated guidance and with our long-term targets.
With that, I'll turn over to John."

This afternoon, I will walk you through our second quarter 2010 financial results and discuss our 2010 financial guidance, the range of which we have narrowed. I will conclude by briefly reviewing our capital structure and liquidity posit",2637,"Thanks, Heather. This afternoon, I will walk you through our second quarter 2010 financial results and discuss our 2010 financial guidance, the range of which we have narrowed. I will conclude by briefly reviewing our capital structure and liquidity position. 
Before I begin, I would like to comment briefly on what I've seen at Mylan during, this, my first full quarter as CFO.
One of the aspects of joining Mylan that I found most intriguing was that of the growth prospects of the Generics and Specialty Pharmaceuticals sector, and in particular, how well poised Mylan is to take advantage of such opportunities. This has been quickly confirmed for me with our recent approvals and subsequent launches of Valacyclovir and the Clonidine patch, and most recently, our approval and launch of Minocycline and subsequent legal settlement, which I will discuss in more detail later. 
Additionally, this growth continues to increase our ability to leverage our global production capabilities and robust R&D pipeline. When I was making my decision to join Mylan, one of the key points that both Robert and Heather continued to stress with me was the soundness of Mylan's growth strategy, and perhaps most important, the company's ability to execute against these strategies and make their vision become a reality. This, too, has been clearly demonstrated to me in my short time here with our recently announced planned acquisition of Bioniche Pharma, which immediately makes Mylan a player in the North American injectables market, yet another successful accomplishment of a stated objective.
Whether it be product approvals, such as those we have recently seen, or acquisitions such as Bioniche, it is developments and actions such as these that demonstrate that Mylan executes on what says it's going to do and continues to make me confident in Mylan's long-term growth targets. 
Now moving on to my review of our second quarter financial results. As Kris mentioned, I'm going to be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they're prepared on the same basis as used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our business. This afternoon's earnings release includes a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for our second quarter 2010 and 2009 results. Earnings release is available on our website and I encourage you to take a look at it. 
In summary, the more significant items that are excluded in arriving at our adjusted basis results for the 2010 second quarter are: purchase accounting amortization of $71 million; integration and other expenses of $18 million; incremental interest expense, which is primarily the imputed interest expense related to our convertible debt, of $14 million; charges related to the net settlement of litigation, totaling $12 million; costs associated with our recent issuance of the new senior unsecured notes, which I will discuss later, totaling $15 million, which was mainly related to the write-off of debt issuance costs and certain costs associated with the termination of interest rate swaps; and finally, the net tax benefit related to the excluded items, of approximately $53 million. 
I strongly agree with Robert and Heather's comments on the quarter and first six months, both of which were very solid operationally and financially. Let me start at the top of the income statement.
Total revenues for the quarter were $1.37 billion, an increase of 8% over last year's second quarter total adjusted revenue of $1.27 billion. The effect of foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on our second quarter results as compared to the same prior-year period, as the effect of a weaker euro was offset by the strengthening of the currencies of our other subsidiaries, mainly the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar.
To reiterate what Heather mentioned earlier, new product launches and favorable volume on our existing base business more than compensated for the decline in sales due to the loss of exclusivity on Divalproex ER in the prior year. 
Absent the drop in sales as a result of Divalproex, our increase in sales in both the current quarter and current year-to-date period would have been significantly higher. For the full year, we continue to project total revenues in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45% compared to 47% in the prior year and two points below our full year guidance range of 47% to 49%. Our Q2 gross margin was dampened by close to 1% as a result of an atypical level of inventory charges. 
The year-over-year decrease in margin is primarily the result of the loss of exclusivity on Divalproex in the second half of 2009. For the reasons Heather mentioned in her remarks, we continue to fully expect our operating performance and gross margin to improve during the second half of 2010, and we expect full year margin will be within our guidance range, though nearer to the low end. 
Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $66 million or approximately 5% of revenues. This spending is slightly above that of our first quarter 2010 spending level, but is in line with our revised full year guidance range of 5% to 6% of revenues as Heather previously discussed. Importantly, our R&D projects remain on target, and we are planning for higher levels of spending over the remainder of the year. 
Adjusted SG&A expense was $251 million for the quarter or 18% of revenues, within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $335 million. If you combine this result with our expectation for generating higher levels of earnings later in the year, we see ourselves on track to meet our adjusted EBITDA guidance, which we have revised to a range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion for the full year. 
Now let me move to couple of non-operating financial metrics. Second quarter 2010 adjusted interest expense was $65 million. We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates and a higher level of interest expense as a result of our Q2 issuance of new senior unsecured notes. 
Income taxes. Our second quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 29%. Today's narrowed guidance range incorporates a full year projected adjusted effective income tax rate range of 28% to 29%.
In summary, second quarter adjusted net income was $163 million or $0.37 per share, which was slightly negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus those existing at the time when we provided earnings guidance earlier in the year. 
In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the $35 million quarterly preferred dividend. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of 440 million shares. 
Touching briefly on the year-to-date results. The more significant items that are excluded in arriving at our adjusted basis results for the 2010 year-to-date period are: purchase accounting amortization of $143 million; integration and other expenses of $31 million; incremental interest expense, which is primarily the imputed interest expense related to our convertible debt, of $24 million; charges related to the net settlement of litigation totaling $13 million; costs associated with our recent issuance of new unsecured notes totaling $15 million; and finally, the net tax benefit related to the excluded items of approximately $86 million. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, total revenues were $2.66 billion, an increase of 9% over adjusted revenues of $2.45 billion in the same prior-year period. Foreign currency translations did impact our year-to-date result with a favorable effect of approximately 3% due mainly to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. The euro did not have a significant effect. 
Adjusted gross margin for the six months was approximately 45%, with the impact of Divalproex also having an unfavorable effect on our year-to-date margin when compared to the prior year. Adjusted R&D expense was $126 million, and adjusted SG&A was $496 million for the current six-month period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2010 was $658 million. Adjusted income was $322 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 per share. 
As in the quarter, adjusted diluted EPS was calculated assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million shares of common stock. The number of shares assumed in the conversion of our preferred stock is dependent upon our stock price. We expect our share price to continue to remain at a level at which 125 million shares will be the assumed conversion amount. Additionally, depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase further due to the additional dilution from stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments, such as our convertible debt obligations and the related warrant. 
We have considered the potential for a higher average diluted share count in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which, as Robert indicated, we have narrowed to $1.55 to $1.65 per share, with adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter expected to exceed that of the third quarter. 
In our earnings release this afternoon, we provided a comparison of exchange rates that were used in preparing our initial guidance to those that were used in preparing our revised guidance. Prospectively, we will continue to update you on the FX rates we are using whenever we revise our guidance. This is intended to ease your understanding of our forecast.
As you'll see, certain currencies, in particular the euro, have weakened since our original guidance was prepared. It is important to note, however, that most of our non-U.S. operations have their revenues and their cost structures based in their local currencies. 
For our euro-based entities, their euro-denominated cash flows are offset against euro-denominated debt. As such, while changes in the euro, either positive or negative, will impact our reported U.S. dollar results, there is little impact from a truly economic standpoint. 
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $118 million compared to $210 million in last year's second quarter. The decrease is primarily the result of the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received in early July; the timing of income tax payments; and the payment of approximately $22 million related to the termination of certain interest rate swaps associated with the financing completed this quarter. We do continue to project full year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million excluding certain one-off items. 
Second quarter capital spending of $33 million was more than 2009 but well below our expected annual spend. However, based on anticipated project timing, we do expect spending to increase significantly in the second half of 2010 and continue to project capital spending in the range of about $250 million for the full year. 
Let me now turn to our capital structure and liquidity position. In May, we completed a private placement of $550 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and bearing interest at 7 5/8% and $700 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2020 and bearing interest at 7 7/8%.
$1 billion of the net proceeds were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our credit facility. This bond issuance was in accordance with our objective of extending the maturity profile of our outstanding indebtedness. We continue to have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the $600 million due under our convertible notes in the first quarter of 2012, which we currently intend to repay with available cash at that time. 
In addition, it is important to keep in mind that the last $35 million quarterly dividend payment related to our outstanding preferred stock is scheduled to be paid on November 15, 2010.
Also, as mentioned previously, we incurred charges of approximately $15 million associated with the issuance of these senior notes. Approximately half of this charge was to write off capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the amounts that were repaid, with the other half related to the termination of interest rate swaps also associated with the debt that was repaid. The swaps terminated restored us to what we believe to be an appropriate ratio of fixed to floating rate debt. 
Concerning leverage, as Robert has stated many times, it is our commitment to achieving a long-term leverage ratio of less -- of 3:1 or less. We are firmly committed to balancing growth in our business through the continued use of prudent and responsible financing. As such, Mylan remains committed to deleveraging over time to meet this long-term capital structure goal.
From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 1.9x our last 12-month covenant basis adjusted EBITDA. This is well below our June 30, 2010, covenant threshold of 4x times and also comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5x. 
At the end of the current -- of the quarter, we had approximately $833 million of unrestricted cash and marketable securities compared to just over $400 million at December 31. We expect to use some of this cash, along with available borrowings, to finance the acquisition of Bioniche.
Bioniche is an exciting opportunity for Mylan and one that we believe will be accretive to Mylan's earnings in the first year, even before considering any synergies. It is important to note, however, that we do not believe that the impact from this acquisition will be significant to our 2010 results.
In addition to a revenue growth rate that is in excess of Mylan's growth rate, the Bioniche acquisition will be especially complementary, as A, its margins are in excess of our consolidated margins, and B, their relatively lower effective tax rate as a result of being domiciled in Ireland.
While we expect the contribution from the sale of Bioniche's products to benefit our overall gross margin, we do not foresee a significant change in our overall consolidated corporate tax rate. 
One last item that I would like to briefly address is our recently announced approval, launch and settlement with respect to Minocycline ER.
Our Matrix subsidiary received final approval of its ANDA on July 20, 2010, and we began shipping immediately. On July 22, 2010, we reached a settlement with Medicis, the innovator, to resolve outstanding patent litigation. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to cease additional distribution of the product until November 11, 2011, or earlier under certain circumstances. 
With respect to the product already shipped, we have been released by Medicis of any potential liability associated therewith. However, because of uncertainties that could affect pricing and market conditions, accounting rules require that we defer revenue recognition. As we've done in similar situations in the past, most recently related to Amlodipine, we will defer the revenue from our initial shipments of the product until such time as the product is sold by our customers.
To reiterate: as these shipments were made in July, this is a third quarter item. We expect this revenue to be recognized throughout the second half of the year and into 2011. 
In closing, let me say once again: I am pleased with our very solid first half of the year, and I'm extremely excited about our prospects for the remainder of 2010 and beyond.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kris to start the Q&A."

Just want to make sure I understand that historically, it seemed like more of the growth would be coming from x U.S. In fact, rationale for doing the Merck Generics deals was less dependence on first-to-files and such in the U.S. Is that still the case for 2011, that we shouldn't expect the U.S. to be the primary driver, but rather x U.S.? And then the last question is just on FX. The rates that you disclosed in the press release today, are those the rates that we should be looking for 2011?"

And what we're going to for you for now on, now that we set a baseline, rather than have you guess what rates we're using at anytime, anytime we change guidance on a going-forward basis, you're going to know exactly the rates that we're using in our guidance. And so the answer is yes to that. In terms of x U.S., U.S. reliance, Paragraph IVs or not, let me just explain. 2011 to me is a completely different year. To me, 2011, as I've stated all along, remember I said that 2010 is simply what we call the baseline year that represents what these three conglomerates coming together really means to grow from. 2011 completely -- it really is the first year of, the first full year of recognizing what these three assets are potentially capable of doing. If you recall, the growth, the -- our CAGR up to this point was predominantly weighted on our ability to yield the efficiencies out of these three assets. Not only is that going to continue in '11 and beyond, but now you're going to see top line growth, a robust growth in top line by the sheer number products that we're going to launch. And if you also recall, we had hardly any Paragraph IV opportunities in the last three years, especially in 2010, in our numbers and our projections, where -- because we've been building our pipeline, incubating those opportunities. You've already seen some of the settlements that are going to come through. And, yes, and we cannot forget and we should not ignore that the United States is the largest pharmaceutical company in the world by dollars. And that in the United States, I've often said, you do a little bit, you get a lot. And in the rest of the world, you do a lot, and you get a little bit. So yes, I think that these are very meaningful. But we're not going to shy away from the opportunities that we have in the United States to continue to grow our overall platform, on top of the additional opportunities that we see in market expansions throughout the world. You want to add anything, Heather?"

I am extremely pleased with what I'm seeing so far in the development, the joint development between Mylan and Biocon. I'm loving the early results of some of the work that's being done. And so I think that that's coming along just fine and yes, the Bioniche is exactly what we were looking for in terms of that entering in, being able from a commercial point of view, being able to enter into the biosimilar market, including here in the United States. So we are very pleased. And as you mentioned, it does line up quite well to our strategy. As far as the -- my commentary in terms of just the whole issue around the FDA in terms of their most recent actions. First, I have to tell you, I believe that certain people are really trying to speak too much for the FDA and on behalf of the FDA. I think we should leave it up to the FDA to continue to speak. Certainly they have. Teva continues to try to create the fact that somehow -- that the science is not there. Well, it's there. And the FDA has and continues to demonstrate that they will look and respect good science. And they have confirmed that in their answer to the citizens petition of Teva. If you read the citizens petition, I think the FDA's actions were almost exactly what they told Teva in their answer to the citizens petition. And people should have taken note of that. No, this Lovenox is not a surprise. And lastly, in terms of Teva's position about generic Copaxone, I find it extremely difficult to believe that they could actually say so aggressively and openly, especially after the FDA's actions. I do believe, Ronny, I think you were the one that might have put out a note. I agree absolutely, if it was you, I do believe it was you. You talked about there being almost a change at the FDA in terms of it stepping itself up to be more open and demonstrating its commitment to Congress and the legislatures that it'll be more open-minded into a biosimilar strategy and an ability to approve these complex compounds. And lastly, when you take a look at our application, even our application with the FDA. That should've been a red flag. Because as you all know, and quite surprisingly, the FDA has accepted our application several months in advance of how long it took to accept the application of Momenta's and Sandoz' Copaxone application. That should've told people something right there. I've tried to explain that these are very, very strong indications in terms of my confidence level about how I feel about the particular program or how I think the FDA is thinking about things. I think the FDA is doing a fantastic job in that front. And the most important point, I think, from a Mylan perspective, that you should know, is that there are several analysts that are still somehow -- I don't know where they get their information but I think were under the impression that our formulation is a Natco formulation. That is just wrong. We certainly have -- Teva certainly knows now that it's not a Natco formulation. It's a Mylan formulation. It's a formulation to bring Copaxone to a highly regulated market like the United States. And certainly, Mylan knows how to file an application and the requirements. So I want you to combine the fact that how quickly our petition was accepted by the FDA compared to Momenta's and Sandoz'. That should've been, again, a signal and a red flag. I want you to look at Mylan's track record of -- its regulatory track record and our relationship for very, very complex compounds, and the fact that when it comes to science, we know how the FDA respects science. It's exactly what they looked at when they examined our application. And no, we don't have a Natco formulation. We have a Mylan formulation. And that needs to be clearly understood and corrected for all those analysts who I think been under a wrong impression.

Is there something that we need to think about more for 2011 in terms of FX? And than secondly, on  Bioniche, maybe a longer-term question.

One, I said I will not do a transaction unless it was financially accretive. They are. Two, they fill a strategic void in a therapeutic category that we were not in before. And three, they do it in a very large way. We have instant critical mass to be meaningful as we work, over the next few years, to build upon that as we get ready to layer in our biosimilars, as legislation and the FDA continues to set forth its revelatory path. In terms of the FX. You've missed absolutely nothing except something very small, which could be very large in your thinking. And that is, there's only six months left in 2010. There's a whole year left in 2011. And, if you couple the fact that we see continued growth in 2011, you don't only have a whole year left, but you have larger numbers.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Once again, I would like to start by sincerely thanking each and every one of our employees around the world for yet another great quarter. It is truly your continued",347,"Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Once again, I would like to start by sincerely thanking each and every one of our employees around the world for yet another great quarter. It is truly your continued outstanding hard work and dedication to Mylan that makes it possible for us to again deliver such strong results. 
We were able to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.37 despite many challenges, including the delay of certain product approvals, global pricing pressures and the impact of negative currency trends. This quarter's strong results only continue to demonstrate the underlying strength of our overall business.
Considering these results and several significant recent announcements, we are now able to narrow our 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share range to $1.55 to $1.65. Also, even though we haven't provided formal earnings guidance for 2011, we remain confident in our forecast to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2 by the end of 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to our President, Heather Bresch, I would like to review at a high level a couple of our significant corporate achievements since our last earnings call.
First, in May, we successfully raised $1.25 billion in long-term notes, and with most of the proceeds we prepaid $1 billion of secured term loan borrowings. 
Second, I was also extremely pleased to be able to fulfill yet another one of our stated objectives by our recent announcement of our intention to acquire Bioniche Pharma, a high-growth global injectable pharmaceutical company. As we reported at the time of the announcement, this business is expected to be immediately accretive in year one, not accounting for any synergies. 
In addition, we expect Bioniche Pharma's growth rate to be well above our stated long-term growth rates. The addition of Bioniche Pharma will only add further assurance in our ability to meet our stated objectives.
With that said, I'd like to forward -- I look forward to answering your questions, but I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather."

As Robert said, we're very pleased with our exceptional second quarter performance and remain confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results in line with the updated guidance we are announcing today. In",2230,"Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert said, we're very pleased with our exceptional second quarter performance and remain confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results in line with the updated guidance we are announcing today. 
In addition, we're excited about the growth we see coming in '11, which we believe will result in earnings of $2 per share, as well as our long-term growth targets. During my prepared remarks, I'll provide you with more color around our performance during the past quarter and on what we expect as drivers to achieve the second half of '10, plus '11 and beyond. 
First, though, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees. Their outstanding work ethic and commitment to excellence have once again made it possible for Mylan to deliver very strong results. I'd like to start by touching briefly upon a few of the elements of our 2010 guidance.
First, in addition to narrowing our range for adjusted EPS, which Robert mentioned, we are tightening and revising our range for adjusted revenues. We now expect to generate revenues between $5.4 billion and $5.6 billion. 
Next, our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45% compared to our full year guidance range of 47% to 49%. We've mentioned in the past that product mix is an important driver of gross margin, and approval delays in the U.S. played a role in this quarter's performance. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to meet this element of our guidance due to recent approvals we've received on higher-margin limited-competition products, higher specialty business sales, our planned Bioniche Pharma acquisition and continued synergy realization in the second half of the year. 
Finally, as it relates to R&D. We are revising this element of our guidance to 5% to 6% from 6% to 7%. Our adjusted expenditure for the quarter totaled $66 million or approximately 5% of revenues. At this level of investment, our R&D activities are hitting on all cylinders, and our output remains very strong. We currently have 1,480 global product submissions pending approval, and we are on track to achieve our target of 1,000 global submissions annually in 2010 through 2013. In addition, because of Bioniche Pharma's robust pipeline, we do not see a need for any meaningful external R&D activity during the remainder of the year. 
I'd like to turn now to the topic of pricing, which has received much attention lately. Our company has a very long history of delivering profitable growth in the U.S., which is by far one of the world's most competitive pharmaceutical markets. As such, we're very experienced at anticipating and responding to price and reimbursement cuts and managing fluctuations in volume. Now that we have a diversified global platform, we are able to effectively manage these same dynamics on even a larger scale and have more levers available to manage, drive and grow our business.
As we've stated before, we anticipated greater pricing pressure, especially in Europe, than in previous years and took these dynamics into consideration going into 2010. Though these pressures were slightly greater than what we anticipated, we have been able to absorb them.
Being able to manage such dynamics creates tremendous opportunities for Mylan. In fact, we believe we are positioned to leverage our vertically and horizontally integrated capabilities, economies of scale, and reliable and responsive supply chain across our global operations. All the hard work done over the last three years under the campaign of synergies have transformed us into a highly competitive organization. 
This tremendous advantage is the realization of the vision we set out to achieve when we brought together legacy Mylan, the former Merck business and Matrix Laboratories nearly three years ago. During those first three years, we focused on executing the integration of the businesses and on capturing significant synergies. Our strong results throughout that period demonstrate our phenomenal success in that regard. Now that same result has succeeded, paving the way for our strong top and bottom line growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Now I would like to walk you through the performance of our commercial operation.
During the second quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.37 billion compared to last year's second quarter total adjusted result of $1.27 billion. That's an increase of approximately 8%. Revenues grew in both our Generics and Specialty segments. On the bottom line, solid execution across our business allowed us to generate $0.37 of adjusted diluted EPS, a 16% increase over last year's second quarter result. This result is in line with our guidance. 
Within our Generics segment, our North America operations delivered third-party revenues for the second quarter of $589 million, up 12% from last year's second quarter results of $526 million. The increase was driven by sales of new products and increased volumes on our base business. This performance is a true testament to the strength of critical mass in controlling your supply chain so as to seize on market opportunities. 
Our higher revenues also absorbed the loss of exclusivity on Divalproex, which we enjoyed during last year's second quarter.
Complimenting this very strong performance was the record number of product approvals we received during the quarter from the FDA, with a year-to-date total of 33. We have also launched, to date, eight of the dozen limited-competition products we expect to introduce by the year end. These achievements demonstrate the strength of our pipeline and are among the many reasons we're so confident about our future.
I'd also like to add that we remain on track to achieve our full year target of 50 to 60 launches in the U.S. 
Currently in the U.S., we have 131 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing about $92 billion in annual brand sales, and 41 of these pending ANDAs are potential first-to-file opportunities representing more than $21 billion in annual brand sales. 
In Canada, we saw local currency third-party sales grow about 19% versus the year-ago quarter, led by products launched in the last 18 months. Pricing pressures in Ontario, Québec and other provinces due to recent or pending legislation have been offset by a required reduction in payments to pharmacies, particularly in Ontario, resulting in a net impact that we expect will be relatively neutral to our business. 
In EMEA [Europe, the Middle East and Africa], where France drives our performance, third-party revenues of $379 million fell about 4% last year's second quarter third-party revenues of $393 million. However, on a constant-currency basis, operational growth in EMEA was nearly 3% year-over-year. The increase was driven by new product launches in several markets, totaling approximately $31 million, as well as increased volumes in certain countries. We remain committed to optimizing our business to align the new market dynamics in this region. 
In France, our sales dipped slightly versus a year-ago quarter as competitive pressure resulted in lowering price, which offset the favorable contribution from new products and increased sales of existing products. However, our market leadership position remains very strong.
In Spain, we saw a double-digit increase in sales as new product launches more than offset the negative effect on pricing in the portfolio. We also experienced single-digit growth in a variety of countries such as the UK. 
In Italy, second quarter local currency sales almost doubled versus the year-ago quarter due to new product launches and increased market penetration, which resulted in increased volume, as well as regulatory changes that have affected pricing positively. 
Moving onto Asia-Pacific region. We delivered solid second quarter results. Total third-party revenues were $265 million, up nearly 23% over last year's second quarter result of $216 million. On a constant-currency basis, sales increased about 12%. 
In Australia, local currency revenues declined slightly. We are continuing to optimize our business to align to new market dynamics while maintaining our leadership position. 
In Japan, local currency sales rose approximately 7% due to new product launches and continued market expansion. We remain optimistic about longer-term growth opportunities presented by this market and our ability to capture our share of that growth. 
Also in the region, our Matrix business delivered another very strong quarter of year-over-year growth. Primarily responsible were sales of ARV finished dosage forms to third-parties, which more than doubled versus the second quarter of '09, and sales of API to third parties. 
Finally, Dey Pharma, our Specialty segment, continued to perform well during the second quarter. Third-party revenues rose 14% over the same period last year after adjusting last year's third-party sales for the transfer of Dey's generics product to our Mylan Pharms [Mylan Pharmaceuticals] division. The primary driver of that growth was domestic sales of our EpiPen Auto-Injector. 
Moving on, I'd like to express how excited we are about our planned acquisition of Bioniche Pharma.
Bioniche Pharma will further our stated objective of identifying bolt-on acquisitions to fill gaps in our U.S. product portfolio and therapeutic categories. It also will give us the critical mass needed to immediately enter the North American injectables market. As Robert mentioned, we expect the business to be accretive in year one without accounting for any synergies. 
For those of you unfamiliar with the company, Bioniche Pharma is a leading U.S.-focused specialty injectable company based in Galway, Ireland. The company focuses on the development, production and sale of high-quality injectable products, many of which are difficult to develop or produce or that experience limited competition. The products are used in hospital settings and span several therapeutic categories including analgesics, orthopedics, oncology and urology. 
Bioniche currently markets about 30 products, and its pipeline includes 15 ANDAs pending approval with the FDA. The company also has more than 25 additional products in various stages of development. Net revenues totaled approximately $130 million for the 12 months ended May 31, 2010, and approximately $43.5 million for the last three months ended May 31, 2010.
Though the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, we expect the deal to close in September. 
We're excited about this transaction for two reasons. First, we expect Bioniche Pharma's top line growth rate to be well above our stated growth target, which only further bolsters our confidence in them. And because Bioniche Pharma is a higher gross margin business, we expect it to have a positive impact on Mylan's overall gross margin.
Further, while we are not providing synergy numbers, as there is little overlap with our existing operation, we do see opportunities to capture synergies both commercial and technical. We anticipate that once we close, integration activities will be swift and seamless. 
Secondly, we consider this transaction to be strategic in that Bioniche Pharma will become one of the pillars of Mylan Institutional, our newly formed institutional business, which will serve hospitals and long-term care facilities in North America with a differentiated and tailored pharmaceutical product offering.
We expect that offering will initially include that of UDL, the largest unit dose provider to hospitals in the U.S., and Bioniche Pharma's high quality injectables. Moreover, because of the nature of the institutional marketplace, the new Mylan Institutional will fill an important prerequisite to the viability of the commercialization of Mylan's own generic biologics platform in the near future, as well as commercialization of specialized products such as Copaxone. 
As you can see, we have a lot to be excited about in the second half of 2010, from receiving new product approvals to driving continued increases in volumes around the world and achieving annual synergies of $350 million, if not more. 
Looking ahead to 2011. We are as bullish as ever about our prospects and believe our momentum going into the year will be very strong. Specifically, we look forward in 2011 to the additional revenues that will result from the approximately 500 products we expect to launch globally. Among them will be oral contraceptives, which we expect to begin launching in the U.S. around midyear; the monetization of first-to-file opportunities, such as our previously announced settlements related to voriconazole, letrozole, and venlafaxine; and our recently announced settlement on minocycline, which John will elaborate on shortly. 
In addition, we will see the expiration of 30-month stays on a number of additional first-to-file opportunities, and we expect to launch in excess of a dozen limited-competition products.
Finally, let me remind you that our legacy Merck Generics business inlicensed about 70% of its products when we purchased it back in '07. By year end, we'll be at about 55% and expect to keep pushing that figure lower throughout '11 and achieving internalization of 70% by 2013, resulting in a positive financial impact. 
At this time, beyond 2011 and through '13, we continue to see strong growth in our overall business and expect to accelerate our top line growth by executing on the key drivers of portfolio expansion, continued realization of operational efficiencies, continued diversification and balance sheet deleveraging. 
In summary, I'd like to remind everyone that we have stated many times that 2010 is the baseline year from which Mylan will continue to grow. We have an extremely powerful platform, a proven ability to execute and an unshakable belief that we are perfectly positioned to leverage our assets over the years to come. The results we announce today only reinforce our confidence that we will deliver performance in 2010 and beyond that is in line with our updated guidance and with our long-term targets.
With that, I'll turn over to John."

This afternoon, I will walk you through our second quarter 2010 financial results and discuss our 2010 financial guidance, the range of which we have narrowed. I will conclude by briefly reviewing our capital structure and liquidity position. 
Before I begin, I would like to comment briefly on what I've seen at Mylan during, this, my first full quarter as CFO. One of the aspects of joining Mylan that I found most intriguing was that of the growth prospects of the Generics and Specialty Pharmaceuticals sector, and in particular, how well poised Mylan is to take advantage of such opportunities. This has been quickly confirmed for me with our recent approvals and subsequent launches of valacyclovir and the clonidine patch, and most recently, our approval and launch of minocycline and subsequent legal settlement, which I will discuss in more detail later. 
Additionally, this growth continues to increase our ability to leverage our global production capabilities and robust R&D pipeline. When I was making my decision to join Mylan, one of the key points that both Robert and Heather continued to stress with me was the soundness of Mylan's growth strategy, and perhaps most important, the company's ability to execute against these strategies and make their vision become a reality. This, too, has been clearly demonstrated to me in my short time here with our recently announced planned acquisition of Bioniche Pharma, which immediately makes Mylan a player in the North American injectables market, yet another successful accomplishment of a stated objective.
Whether it be product approvals, such as those we have recently seen, or acquisitions such as Bioniche, it is developments and actions such as these that demonstrate that Mylan executes on what says it's going to do and continues to make me confident in Mylan's long-term growth targets. 
Now moving on to my review of our second quarter financial results. As Kris mentioned, I'm going to be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they're prepared on the same basis as used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our business. This afternoon's earnings release includes a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for our second quarter 2010 and 2009 results. Earnings release is available on our website and I encourage you to take a look at it. 
In summary, the more significant items that are excluded in arriving at our adjusted basis results for the 2010 second quarter are: purchase accounting amortization of $71 million; integration and other expenses of $18 million; incremental interest expense, which is primarily the imputed interest expense related to our convertible debt, of $14 million; charges related to the net settlement of litigation, totaling $12 million; costs associated with our recent issuance of the new senior unsecured notes, which I will discuss later, totaling $15 million, which was mainly related to the write-off of debt issuance costs and certain costs associated with the termination of interest rate swaps; and finally, the net tax benefit related to the excluded items, of approximately $53 million. 
I strongly agree with Robert and Heather's comments on the quarter and first six months, both of which were very solid operationally and financially. Let me start at the top of the income statement.
Total revenues for the quarter were $1.37 billion, an increase of 8% over last year's second quarter total adjusted revenue of $1.27 billion. The effect of foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on our second quarter results as compared to the same prior-year period, as the effect of a weaker euro was offset by the strengthening of the currencies of our other subsidiaries, mainly the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar.
To reiterate what Heather mentioned earlier, new product launches and favorable volume on our existing base business more than compensated for the decline in sales due to the loss of exclusivity on divalproex ER in the prior year. 
Absent the drop in sales as a result of Divalproex, our increase in sales in both the current quarter and current year-to-date period would have been significantly higher. For the full year, we continue to project total revenues in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion.
Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45% compared to 47% in the prior year and two points below our full year guidance range of 47% to 49%. Our Q2 gross margin was dampened by close to 1% as a result of an atypical level of inventory charges. 
The year-over-year decrease in margin is primarily the result of the loss of exclusivity on divalproex in the second half of 2009. For the reasons Heather mentioned in her remarks, we continue to fully expect our operating performance and gross margin to improve during the second half of 2010, and we expect full year margin will be within our guidance range, though nearer to the low end. 
Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $66 million or approximately 5% of revenues. This spending is slightly above that of our first quarter 2010 spending level, but is in line with our revised full year guidance range of 5% to 6% of revenues as Heather previously discussed. Importantly, our R&D projects remain on target, and we are planning for higher levels of spending over the remainder of the year. 
Adjusted SG&A expense was $251 million for the quarter or 18% of revenues, within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $335 million. If you combine this result with our expectation for generating higher levels of earnings later in the year, we see ourselves on track to meet our adjusted EBITDA guidance, which we have revised to a range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion for the full year. 
Now let me move to couple of non-operating financial metrics. Second quarter 2010 adjusted interest expense was $65 million. We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates and a higher level of interest expense as a result of our Q2 issuance of new senior unsecured notes. 
Income taxes. Our second quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 29%. Today's narrowed guidance range incorporates a full year projected adjusted effective income tax rate range of 28% to 29%.
In summary, second quarter adjusted net income was $163 million or $0.37 per share, which was slightly negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus those existing at the time when we provided earnings guidance earlier in the year. 
In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the $35 million quarterly preferred dividend. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of 440 million shares. 
Touching briefly on the year-to-date results. The more significant items that are excluded in arriving at our adjusted basis results for the 2010 year-to-date period are: purchase accounting amortization of $143 million; integration and other expenses of $31 million; incremental interest expense, which is primarily the imputed interest expense related to our convertible debt, of $24 million; charges related to the net settlement of litigation totaling $13 million; costs associated with our recent issuance of new unsecured notes totaling $15 million; and finally, the net tax benefit related to the excluded items of approximately $86 million. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, total revenues were $2.66 billion, an increase of 9% over adjusted revenues of $2.45 billion in the same prior-year period. Foreign currency translations did impact our year-to-date result with a favorable effect of approximately 3% due mainly to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. The euro did not have a significant effect. 
Adjusted gross margin for the six months was approximately 45%, with the impact of divalproex also having an unfavorable effect on our year-to-date margin when compared to the prior year. Adjusted R&D expense was $126 million, and adjusted SG&A was $496 million for the current six-month period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2010 was $658 million. Adjusted income was $322 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 per share. 
As in the quarter, adjusted diluted EPS was calculated assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million shares of common stock. The number of shares assumed in the conversion of our preferred stock is dependent upon our stock price. We expect our share price to continue to remain at a level at which 125 million shares will be the assumed conversion amount. Additionally, depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase further due to the additional dilution from stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments, such as our convertible debt obligations and the related warrant. 
We have considered the potential for a higher average diluted share count in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which, as Robert indicated, we have narrowed to $1.55 to $1.65 per share, with adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter expected to exceed that of the third quarter. 
In our earnings release this afternoon, we provided a comparison of exchange rates that were used in preparing our initial guidance to those that were used in preparing our revised guidance. Prospectively, we will continue to update you on the FX rates we are using whenever we revise our guidance. This is intended to ease your understanding of our forecast.
As you'll see, certain currencies, in particular the euro, have weakened since our original guidance was prepared. It is important to note, however, that most of our non-U.S. operations have their revenues and their cost structures based in their local currencies. 
For our euro-based entities, their euro-denominated cash flows are offset against euro-denominated debt. As such, while changes in the euro, either positive or negative, will impact our reported U.S. dollar results, there is little impact from a truly economic standpoint. 
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $118 million compared to $210 million in last year's second quarter. The decrease is primarily the result of the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received in early July; the timing of income tax payments; and the payment of approximately $22 million related to the termination of certain interest rate swaps associated with the financing completed this quarter. We do continue to project full year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million excluding certain one-off items. 
Second quarter capital spending of $33 million was more than 2009 but well below our expected annual spend. However, based on anticipated project timing, we do expect spending to increase significantly in the second half of 2010 and continue to project capital spending in the range of about $250 million for the full year. 
Let me now turn to our capital structure and liquidity position. In May, we completed a private placement of $550 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and bearing interest at 7 5/8% and $700 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2020 and bearing interest at 7 7/8%.
$1 billion of the net proceeds were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our credit facility. This bond issuance was in accordance with our objective of extending the maturity profile of our outstanding indebtedness. We continue to have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the $600 million due under our convertible notes in the first quarter of 2012, which we currently intend to repay with available cash at that time. 
In addition, it is important to keep in mind that the last $35 million quarterly dividend payment related to our outstanding preferred stock is scheduled to be paid on November 15, 2010.
Also, as mentioned previously, we incurred charges of approximately $15 million associated with the issuance of these senior notes. Approximately half of this charge was to write off capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the amounts that were repaid, with the other half related to the termination of interest rate swaps also associated with the debt that was repaid. The swaps terminated restored us to what we believe to be an appropriate ratio of fixed to floating rate debt. 
Concerning leverage, as Robert has stated many times, it is our commitment to achieving a long-term leverage ratio of less -- of 3:1 or less. We are firmly committed to balancing growth in our business through the continued use of prudent and responsible financing. As such, Mylan remains committed to deleveraging over time to meet this long-term capital structure goal.
From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 1.9x our last 12-month covenant basis adjusted EBITDA. This is well below our June 30, 2010, covenant threshold of 4x times and also comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5x. 
At the end of the current -- of the quarter, we had approximately $833 million of unrestricted cash and marketable securities compared to just over $400 million at December 31. We expect to use some of this cash, along with available borrowings, to finance the acquisition of Bioniche.
Bioniche is an exciting opportunity for Mylan and one that we believe will be accretive to Mylan's earnings in the first year, even before considering any synergies. It is important to note, however, that we do not believe that the impact from this acquisition will be significant to our 2010 results.
In addition to a revenue growth rate that is in excess of Mylan's growth rate, the Bioniche acquisition will be especially complementary, as A, its margins are in excess of our consolidated margins, and B, their relatively lower effective tax rate as a result of being domiciled in Ireland.
While we expect the contribution from the sale of Bioniche's products to benefit our overall gross margin, we do not foresee a significant change in our overall consolidated corporate tax rate. 
One last item that I would like to briefly address is our recently announced approval, launch and settlement with respect to minocycline ER.
Our Matrix subsidiary received final approval of its ANDA on July 20, 2010, and we began shipping immediately. On July 22, 2010, we reached a settlement with Medicis, the innovator, to resolve outstanding patent litigation. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to cease additional distribution of the product until November 11, 2011, or earlier under certain circumstances. 
With respect to the product already shipped, we have been released by Medicis of any potential liability associated therewith. However, because of uncertainties that could affect pricing and market conditions, accounting rules require that we defer revenue recognition. As we've done in similar situations in the past, most recently related to Amlodipine, we will defer the revenue from our initial shipments of the product until such time as the product is sold by our customers.
To reiterate: as these shipments were made in July, this is a third quarter item. We expect this revenue to be recognized throughout the second half of the year and into 2011. 
In closing, let me say once again: I am pleased with our very solid first half of the year, and I'm extremely excited about our prospects for the remainder of 2010 and beyond.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Kris to start the Q&A."

Remember, all along I've been telegraphing exactly what we were going to do in terms of our platform, identifying voids and layering in those voids.

And so the answer is yes to that. In terms of x U.S., U.S. reliance, Paragraph IVs or not, let me just explain. 2011 to me is a completely different year. To me, 2011, as I've stated all along, remember I said that 2010 is simply what we call the baseline year that represents what these three conglomerates coming together really means to grow from. 2011 completely -- it really is the first year of, the first full year of recognizing what these three assets are potentially capable of doing. If you recall, the growth, the -- our CAGR up to this point was predominantly weighted on our ability to yield the efficiencies out of these three assets. Not only is that going to continue in '11 and beyond, but now you're going to see top line growth, a robust growth in top line by the sheer number products that we're going to launch. And if you also recall, we had hardly any Paragraph IV opportunities in the last three years, especially in 2010, in our numbers and our projections, where -- because we've been building our pipeline, incubating those opportunities. You've already seen some of the settlements that are going to come through. And, yes, and we cannot forget and we should not ignore that the United States is the largest pharmaceutical company in the world by dollars. And that in the United States, I've often said, you do a little bit, you get a lot. And in the rest of the world, you do a lot, and you get a little bit. So yes, I think that these are very meaningful. But we're not going to shy away from the opportunities that we have in the United States to continue to grow our overall platform, on top of the additional opportunities that we see in market expansions throughout the world.

So I'm using 2010 to basically restructure what we already have, thinking about, rolling forward, what else I would like to have to marry up and bolt-on to what I already got in order to execute, again, in gaining our -- and garner our disproportionate share of what we think the growth opportunities are over there. That could mean as much as investing partly in a Japanese company, or if it's small enough, an outright acquisition over there, or even a joint venture of some sort over there, where there's some joint development opportunities there.

Let me start by saying in terms of our biosimilar strategy. Literally, we are right on track. I am extremely pleased with what I'm seeing so far in the development, the joint development between Mylan and Biocon. I'm loving the early results of some of the work that's being done. And so I think that that's coming along just fine and yes, the Bioniche is exactly what we were looking for in terms of that entering in, being able from a commercial point of view, being able to enter into the biosimilar market, including here in the United States. So we are very pleased. And as you mentioned, it does line up quite well to our strategy. As far as the -- my commentary in terms of just the whole issue around the FDA in terms of their most recent actions. First, I have to tell you, I believe that certain people are really trying to speak too much for the FDA and on behalf of the FDA. I think we should leave it up to the FDA to continue to speak. Certainly they have. Teva continues to try to create the fact that somehow -- that the science is not there. Well, it's there. And the FDA has and continues to demonstrate that they will look and respect good science. And they have confirmed that in their answer to the citizens petition of Teva. If you read the citizens petition, I think the FDA's actions were almost exactly what they told Teva in their answer to the citizens petition. And people should have taken note of that. No, this Lovenox is not a surprise. And lastly, in terms of Teva's position about generic Copaxone, I find it extremely difficult to believe that they could actually say so aggressively and openly, especially after the FDA's actions. I do believe, Ronny, I think you were the one that might have put out a note. I agree absolutely, if it was you, I do believe it was you. You talked about there being almost a change at the FDA in terms of it stepping itself up to be more open and demonstrating its commitment to Congress and the legislatures that it'll be more open-minded into a biosimilar strategy and an ability to approve these complex compounds. And lastly, when you take a look at our application, even our application with the FDA. That should've been a red flag. Because as you all know, and quite surprisingly, the FDA has accepted our application several months in advance of how long it took to accept the application of Momenta's and Sandoz' Copaxone application. That should've told people something right there. I've tried to explain that these are very, very strong indications in terms of my confidence level about how I feel about the particular program or how I think the FDA is thinking about things. I think the FDA is doing a fantastic job in that front. And the most important point, I think, from a Mylan perspective, that you should know, is that there are several analysts that are still somehow -- I don't know where they get their information but I think were under the impression that our formulation is a Natco formulation. That is just wrong. We certainly have -- Teva certainly knows now that it's not a Natco formulation. It's a Mylan formulation. It's a formulation to bring Copaxone to a highly regulated market like the United States. And certainly, Mylan knows how to file an application and the requirements. So I want you to combine the fact that how quickly our petition was accepted by the FDA compared to Momenta's and Sandoz'. That should've been, again, a signal and a red flag. I want you to look at Mylan's track record of -- its regulatory track record and our relationship for very, very complex compounds, and the fact that when it comes to science, we know how the FDA respects science. It's exactly what they looked at when they examined our application. And no, we don't have a Natco formulation. We have a Mylan formulation. And that needs to be clearly understood and corrected for all those analysts who I think been under a wrong impression. Again, certainly Teva knows, because in our litigation we had to turn over that to them."

If you -- it is our feeling here, it's our vision here, that in order to market biosimilar products here in the United States, having a large hospital presence, we think, is going to be critical. Okay? So they bring that to us instantly. And no, I don't believe I really need any more at this time in terms of assets. Bioniche has resolved almost every metric that we outline. One, I said I will not do a transaction unless it was financially accretive. They are. Two, they fill a strategic void in a therapeutic category that we were not in before. And three, they do it in a very large way. We have instant critical mass to be meaningful as we work, over the next few years, to build upon that as we get ready to layer in our biosimilars, as legislation and the FDA continues to set forth its revelatory path. In terms of the FX. You've missed absolutely nothing except something very small, which could be very large in your thinking. And that is, there's only six months left in 2010. There's a whole year left in 2011. And, if you couple the fact that we see continued growth in 2011, you don't only have a whole year left, but you have larger numbers. So if you take a look at the fact that I'm using today's current rates compared to when I originally gave that projection, that forecast of $2 in 2011, and adjust the prior rates to today's rates and then roll it forward, I think that if you do the math, you'll see exactly what I meant by that."

I would also like to welcome all of the Mylan employees on the call today, especially those from Bioniche Pharma, who are listening as the new members of the M",530,"Thank you, Kris. Welcome, everyone and thank you for taking the time to join us this afternoon. I would also like to welcome all of the Mylan employees on the call today, especially those from Bioniche Pharma, who are listening as the new members of the Mylan family. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our leadership team, I'd like to thank each and everyone of you for your continued hard work, dedication and outstanding performance.
I am extremely pleased to report to you yet another strong quarter performance of exceptional earnings. As I mentioned on the last conference call, I did anticipate the third quarter to be better than the second quarter, and I am extremely pleased to report adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43, a 16% increase from our second quarter results. With that said, I still expect at this time that the fourth quarter will come in slightly better than the third quarter.
We maintain this position even with the most recent ruling related to our Paroxetine CR. While we are extremely disappointed with the lower court's ruling, we believe strongly that the lower court has erred in its decision not to grant us an injunction, and we have appealed that decision. It should also be noted that this is still just a ruling on an injunction. It is not a final decision resolving Mylan's rights on this matter. Regardless of the outcome of the appellant court decision on the injunction, we will continue our litigation to enforce our contractual rights and all of its negotiated provisions with GSK.
With that said, and irrespective of this short-term distraction, the longer-term fundamentals of our business have not changed, which is why we remain committed to our stated targets of $2 of adjusted diluted earnings per share for calendar year 2011 and our longer-term growth targets of 15% top line and 20% bottom line CAGR by the end of 2013. We very much look forward to providing you a detailed breakdown of our 2011 guidance on our next conference call.
Moving on to other activity in the quarter. You will recall that we issued $300 million in follow-on 10-year bonds to finance the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma. In addition, we are also able to use part of the strong operating cash flows that we continue to generate to prepay $300 million in term loan borrowings in the third quarter as well, further reducing our leverage and staying committed to our stated objective to achieve a 3:1 debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio. 
And finally, you may remember that on November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert to common stock. Given the recent growth and strength of our stock price performance, we anticipate issuing the lowest number of shares required under the terms of the preferred stock agreement, which is approximately 125 million shares. A further note, November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend, thereby substantially enhancing our future free cash flows to the company by $139 million per year.
I look forward to answering your questions, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Bresch."

As Robert said, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance and a great start to our expected strong second half of 2010. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results",1328,"Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert said, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance and a great start to our expected strong second half of 2010. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results in line with the guidance we have reaffirmed today. We also continue to be extremely confident about our growth prospects for '11 and beyond. I too would like to commend our employees around the world for making our continued exceptional performance possible.
During my remarks today, I'll review our performance by segment, provide an update on synergies and comment on why we remain so confident about our future. I'd now like to walk you through the performance of our commercial operations. During the third quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.36 billion, an increase of 7% compared to last year's third quarter total revenues of $1.26 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up approximately 9% year-over-year, and on the bottom line, we generated $0.43 of adjusted EPS, a 34% increase over last year's third quarter result of $0.32.
We also delivered a strong adjusted gross margin of 48.4% during the  third quarter, up from our second quarter performance of 45% and right in line with our full year expected range of 47% to 49%. As expected, driving the strong performance were recent approvals on higher margin, limited competition products, higher sales in our Specialty segment and continued synergy realization.
Within our Generics segment, our North American operations delivered third-party net sales for the third quarter of $573 million, up 17% from last year's third quarter result of $488 million. The increase was mainly the result of new product launches in the United States. Among those launches were limited competition products, Minocycline ER, Clonidine Transdermal and Tacrolimus, bringing to ten the dozen such products we anticipate launching by year end, and we remain on track to achieve our full year target of 50 to 60 launches in the U.S.
Our third quarter also includes results from Bioniche, a Specialty Injectables business we acquired on September 7. The integration has been seamless so far, and on October 4, we announced our first approval from the FDA for our Bioniche product, Fludarabine, an injectable chemotherapy medication for leukemia. Our ANDA filings now include those of Bioniche Pharma. Currently, we have 153 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing about $95 billion in annual brand sales. 45 of these pending ANDAs are potential first-to-file opportunities, representing more than $24 billion in annual branded sales. 
In EMEA, third-party net sales of $364 million, 12% versus last year's third quarter third-party sales of $414 million. However, on a constant currency basis, operational performance in EMEA declined only 3% year-over-year while year-to-date, sales have risen almost 2%. That result was driven by unfavorable pricing throughout Europe, which was partially offset by new product launches in several markets. 
Looking forward, we continue to see our ability to even further offset negative trends in the region, thanks to the sheer number of internal products we expect to launch in 2011 and beyond. In addition, we continue to repatriate finished dosage forms, which will continue to add to our competitive position throughout Europe. 
In France, third quarter local currency sales rose compared to the year-ago quarter. New product launches and higher volumes on existing products more than offset ongoing competitive pricing pressures. With more than 30% market share, our market position remains very strong in France, which drives our performance in Europe.
We also experienced higher year-over-year third quarter local currency sales in Italy, where we benefited from a combination of new product launches, higher generic penetration and the continued favorable effect of regulatory changes. And in Spain, our new product launches offset the impact of government-posed price reduction.
Other markets such as Portugal and Germany experienced lower sales during the third quarter due to government-imposed price reductions and the impact of tender systems, respectively.
Turning now to our Asia Pacific region. We delivered very strong third quarter results. Third-party net sales for $268 million, up 30% over last year's third quarter sales on $206 million. On a constant currency basis, sales rose about 22%. Matrix, Australia and Japan all contributed to the strong results. Matrix continued to deliver strong double-digit growth through API and ARV sales and our ARV portfolio now contains 33 products.
Finally, Dey, our Specialty segment performed well during the third quarter. Third-party net sales rose 6% to $141 million over the same period last year after adjusting last year's third-party sales to account for the fact that in 2010, our Mylan Pharmaceutical division assumes responsibility for selling Dey's generic products. The primary driver of our growth was domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector, which were strong compared to the third quarter of '09. Recall that last October, we launched our next-generation needle-protected auto-injector, which has been received favorably in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, compared to our second quarter, sales benefited from the seasonal return of children to school. Further, we can continue to experience double-digit growth in many markets outside the U.S. as we continue the expansion opportunities for this very important product, mainly through focusing on an underserved population.
Moving on now to synergies. I'm pleased that we remain on track to deliver more than $350 million in cumulative annual benefit by the end of this year. We continue to seek out and capture additional opportunities to further increase our efficiency and leverage our powerful operating platform. Looking ahead to '11, as Robert stated, we will provide formal guidance for the year on our next conference call. 
Nonetheless, it's important to note and to remind you that we continue to see Mylan entering the new year with very strong momentum, especially as we launch more products around the globe than we have ever launched in our company's history. In 2011, we look forward to monetizing or continuing to monetize several opportunities resulting from prior settlements such as Minocycline ER, voriconazole, letrozole and Venlafaxine ER. We see a number of 30-month stay to expiring on other opportunities, some of which are first-to-file. We look forward to introducing oral contraceptives in the U.S., and once again, launching more than a dozen limited competition products. 
Worldwide, we continue to expect to launch approximately 500 products. As important, our pipeline is stronger than ever. We currently have about 15,000 global products initiatives pending approval. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to step back and make some observations about our company and how far we've come. Earlier this month, we've celebrated the three year anniversary of the union of legacy Mylan, Matrix and Merck. Behind that union was our vision that the world could be served far better if we created a global, vertically integrated and highly disciplined company that could consistently supply any market with high-quality, affordable generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.
Over the past three years, we have focused relentlessly on executing on our vision by integrating vertically, delivering synergies far beyond our expectations and serving customers in more than 140 countries and territories. Those accomplishments alone allowed us to meet or exceed Street [Wall Street] estimates for 13 consecutive quarters. 
But that's not all we've been doing for the last three years. We've also been selling our global network with internally supplied products by applying the same methodology and fundamentals that made our integration so successful. Among the actions we've been taking, optimizing R&D, enhancing our portfolio and management capabilities, repatriating products and filling gaps in our product line, we also have created a biologic strategy and strengthening the promising future of our Specialty business, Dey. And perhaps most important, we have filed approximately 3,000 applications globally by the end of this year. Now, we're ready to reap what we've sown. That is why we're so confident about our growth over the next three years and beyond. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John."

This afternoon, I will begin by walking you through our third quarter 2010 financial results, which, as Heather and Robert have both indicated, were exceptional. I will then provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.
As Kris mentioned earlier, I'm going to be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that has been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they're prepared on the same basis as used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our business. This afternoon's earnings release includes a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for our third quarter 2010 and 2009 results. Our earnings release is available on our website, and I encourage you to take a look at it.
Starting at the top of the income statement. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.36 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's third quarter total revenues of $1.26 billion. The effect of foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our third quarter revenues, reflecting a weaker euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of other currencies, primarily the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar.
During the third quarter, we launched Minocycline ER. As I discussed with you on last quarter's call, because of significant uncertainties surrounding the pricing and market conditions with respect to Minocycline, we are not able to reasonably estimate the magnitude of potential price adjustments, including product returns, and as a result, have deferred revenue recognition until such uncertainties are resolved. At this time, we considered such uncertainties to be resolved upon the sale by our customers of the product and have recognized revenue accordingly.
Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 48.4% compared to 46% in the prior year. As expected, this adjusted gross margin is an improvement from that of the first and second quarters and is within our full year guidance range of 47% to 49% and is primarily the result of new product launches in North America and favorable pricing on our Specialty segment, EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $69 million or approximately 5% of revenues. Also as expected, this level of spending represents an increase over the first half of 2010 and is in line with our revised full year guidance range of 5% to 6% of revenues. Importantly, our R&D projects remained on target, and we are planning for even higher levels of spending in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted SG&A expense was $257 million for the quarter or 19% of revenues, within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%, and our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $368 million.
Now let me move to a couple of non-operating financial metrics. Third quarter 2010 adjusted interest expense was $70 million. We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be at or near the low end of our guidance range of $280 million to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates. Our third quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 26%, which translates into a year-to-date and full year projected adjusted effective income tax rate of 28%, which is at the low end of our forecasted range of 28% to 29%. We do fully anticipate this full year effective tax rate to be sustainable going forward. In summary, third quarter adjusted net income was $189 million or $0.43 per share.
In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the $35 million quarterly preferred dividend. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of approximately 438 million shares.
Touching briefly on the year-to-date results, and again, please refer to our earnings release for a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to our non-GAAP financial measures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, total revenues were $4.02 billion, an increase of 8% over adjusted revenues of $3.71 billion in the same prior year period. For the nine months, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on revenues of approximately 1% due mainly to the strengthening of the rupee, yen, and Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker euro.
Adjusted gross margin for the nine months was approximately 46% compared to 47% in the same prior year period. The lower gross margin in the current year is the result of a loss of exclusivity on divalproex during the third quarter of 2009. However, the current year gross margin was negatively impacted by certain inventory charges, principally in Q2. Excluding the impacts of these inventory charges, year-to-date gross margin would have approached 47%. We continue to see full year gross margin at the low end of our 47% to 49% guidance range. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $195 million, and adjusted SG&A expense was $753 million for the current nine-month period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2010 was $1.03 billion. Adjusted net income was $511 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.16 per share.
As in the previous quarter, adjusted diluted EPS was calculated assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million shares of common stock. On November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock. The number of convertible shares will be based upon the closing stock price over the 20-day trading period ending on November 12. Based on the current stock price, we expect that approximately 125 million shares will be the conversion amount. 
As mentioned before, we have been including this preferred stock conversion in our forecasted results. As such, the actual conversion will not result in an additional dilution to our guidance amounts. November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend. 
Depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase further due to additional dilution from stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments such as our convertible debt obligations and related warrants. We also include such potential dilution in our forecasted results. 
As I mentioned previously, the impact of foreign exchange translation on our results was not significant, and actual foreign currency exchange rates during the period ended September 30, 2010, did not differ materially from those used to calculate our 2010 guidance, which we discussed with you last quarter.
More recently, we have seen the euro strengthened steadily against the U.S. dollar. However, we do not expect currency to have a significant impact on our results for the remainder of the year. This is due to the fact that the currencies of other markets in which we operate are moving in the opposite direction of the euro, and it's also a result of various hedging strategies that we've employed.
We've taken measures in an effort to prevent our results from being impacted significantly by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition to having on our balance sheet euro-denominated long-term debt against which the cash flows of our euro-denominated subsidiaries are offset, we use financial instruments such as forward contracts in order to mitigate this risk. Any favorable or unfavorable variances resulting from foreign exchange for the three- and nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, are included in the adjusted diluted per-share amount of $0.43 and $1.16 per share, respectively.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Our third quarter GAAP cash flow from operations was nearly $380 million, the highest in our company's history or $360 million excluding certain items. While we don't anticipate fourth quarter cash flow from operations to approach this level, we do continue to project full year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million excluding certain one-off items.
Our strong current quarter cash from operations was made possible through positive changes in our working capital, primarily accounts receivable as a result in improved cash collections, including amounts received with respect to Minocycline.
As you may recall, on last quarter's call, I indicated that Q2 cash from operations were negatively impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received in early July. Q3 cash from operations was also impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received prior to September 30, 2010. 
Third quarter capital spending was $53 million, including approximately $10 million paid toward the acquisition of a finished dose manufacturing facility in India. Based on the anticipated timing of spending on certain projects, we now project capital spending in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Our current quarter also include a cash outflow of approximately $544 million with respect to our acquisition of Bioniche Pharma, which is net of any cash acquired. As Heather mentioned, results of Bioniche are included in our current quarter results from September 7.
The Bioniche acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and the proceeds from recent notes offerings. As discussed last quarter, in May, we completed a private placement of $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and 2020. In the current quarter, we completed an add-on offering of an additional $300 million of the 2020 notes. These notes were issued at initial price of 105.5% and a coupon of 7 7/8% or an effective yield to maturity of slightly over 7%.
The notes issued in the current quarter's offering, together with the 2020 notes from the May offering, are treated as a single class of notes under the indenture. In addition to funding the Bioniche acquisition, the bond issuances were done in accordance with our objective of extending the maturity profile of our outstanding indebtedness. $1 billion of the net proceeds from the May issuance were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our credit facility. In late September, we used our strong operating cash to repay an additional $300 million of existing indebtedness under our credit facility. As a result of these repayments, we continue to have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the $600 million due under our convertible notes in the first quarter of 2012, which we currently intend to repay with available cash at that time.
At September 30, 2010, following the additional debt repayment of $300 million, we continue to have unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling over $640 million.
Continuing on with the capital structure, concerning leverage. As Robert have stated many times, it is our commitment to achieve a long-term leverage ratio of 3:1 or less. We are firmly committed to balancing growth in our business from the continued use of prudent and responsible financing. As such, Mylan remains committed to deleveraging over time to meet this long-term capital structure goal. We continue to expect to generate approximately $4 billion of cumulative operating cash flows by the end of 2013.
From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 1.7x our last 12 months covenant basis adjusted EBITDA, comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5x. In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid quarterly performance. A great start to what we've been saying will be a strong second half of 2010. 
That concludes my remarks. Lisa, I'll turn the call back over to you to start the Q&A."

First, again, there are many, many mitigating factors, and it's difficult, I understand from your perspective, not to be able to evaluate the number of moving variables. But let's start with EMEA. I said that this would be basically almost a two-bucket approach. I've been telling you all along that we continue to see what we've anticipated, what the governments are doing over there in terms of pricing and pushing prices down lower. But we've often said that we felt very comfortable with our position to be able to mitigate that by all the other initiatives that we have in place, including, I'll pull a knot, cost infrastructure that really doesn't fit with the new system, the new wave of direction where Europe is going. Our cost of goods, our repatriation, our bringing in a lot of the third parties back in-house, and of course, our increase in volumes. So that's kind of sort of -- and the races in Europe, Randall, the races, again, what I've always stated, the speed at which governments move and the speed at which we can, through a regulatory process, be able to yield all the benefits that we've been telling you all along. And in terms of the Paxil CR, we are in litigation. It's been a long-standing position of ours, and not to comment when we are on litigation. I tried to give you a signal, obviously, in our opening remarks about how I feel as a whole about that whole situation. We're extremely confident in our position. We think there's a lot more involved in terms of the dealings between GSK and Apotex, and it wasn't just a one-off type of situation. And that's what litigation is all about, and I'm very confident that we'll prevail once we have an opportunity to get inside. In terms of the $2, the last piece of your question, look, all these factors have -- there's nothing really new. There's just nothing new in terms of what we've thought about, what we've been trying to anticipate. And the best way I can explain to you on the $2 on why we're still confident is actually for two reasons. One, Randall, the fundamentals, the long-term fundamentals of the company have not changed at all, at all. Basically, what we're dealing with is the short-term issues that we have to just continue to manage or work our way through. And what I would bring to your attention is go back for the last 13 quarters where we have been trying the same exact question that we're faced with today about visibility in 2011 and beyond. When we were in 2007 roughly at $0.45 and an $0.80 in 2008 and $1.30 in 2009 and roughly a midpoint of $1.60 in 2010, nobody understood how we were going to get there. And what I can tell you, and what we have done already is this management team promised that it would manage. It would manage this new acquired platform for earnings growth. And I can tell you that when we were back at $0.45 and $0.80 and $1.30 and $1.60 in terms of our respective midpoints, when we started out that guidance and where we thought those earnings per share are going to come from and where they actually came from are not always exactly the same. That's just the nature of our business. So I can assure you that when we once again I think we have become at least somewhat predictable to all of you guys. If we tell you that our vision is in the balancing act, what we can see the number of variables versus what you may not be able to see, we are very comfortable that the $2 target in calendar year 2011 is achievable."

In a generic company, one can never project that a generic product forever will be in your product without competition. So obviously, it's a timing issue.

And my rationale is that I think what all of Europe is experiencing is the more regional companies, the more local companies, it's very, very difficult as Europe moves in the direction of some of the other markets around the world to be able to compete if you don't have scale. And without scale, again, that cost competitiveness, they're going to feel it. And I think that some of these mom-and-pop companies, these local companies, these regional companies begin to realize that the writing is on the wall. I think it will force them indirectly towards more activity. And I think as the more activity percolates, I think the supply-demand curve will kick in, and when there's more supply than there is demand, I think that you'll see multiples come down. So I do see more consolidation. I do think it's extremely healthy over in Europe to bring more capacity out of the market, and I do think that scale will prevail. Heather?"

So as we've seen with other regulations and some of the pricing throughout Europe, Spain, Italy continuing to do the same, not looking at just the generic manufacturers, but kind of the entire supply chain.

So I actually feel really good about where we stand in the capital structure. Our free cash flow is over $500 million a year with the final preferred dividend that we're making here in the fourth quarter. That will increase our free cash flow by $139 million a year. So I see us with a lot of cash. Robert has talked about the fact that we're not looking to make another strategic acquisition. We're fully committed to reducing our leverage to 3:1 or lower."

So I feel very comfortable that we will continue to generate very strong free cash flows with the continued commitment to delever, but I will say at  the same time I'm saying that, I wouldn't hesitate in a second to further extend those maturities if the opportunity arises and interest rates continue to be as advantageous as they are and simply give ourselves even more flexibility than what we've already provided ourselves."

During today's call, including the Q&A, we will be making forward-looking statements including those relating to our anticipated business levels, our future earnings, our planned activities, our anticipated growth and other expectations and targets for future periods. Note that these statements are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Because these statements are forward-looking, they inherently involve risks and uncertainties and accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

You can access our Form 10-K and other SEC filings through the SEC website at www.sec.gov, and we strongly encourage you to do so. 
In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted revenues, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website as it contains detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of our actual 2010 and 2009 third quarter results, including the allocation of each reconciled line item to specific income statement line items.

Welcome, everyone and thank you for taking the time to join us this afternoon. I would also like to welcome all of the Mylan employees on the call today, especially those from Bioniche Pharma, who are listening as the new members of the Mylan family. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our leadership team, I'd like to thank each and everyone of you for your continued hard work, dedication and outstanding performance.
I am extremely pleased to report to you yet another strong quarter performance of exceptional earnings. As I mentioned on the last conference call, I did anticipate the third quarter to be better than the second quarter, and I am extremely pleased to report adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43, a 16% increase from our second quarter results. With that said, I still expect at this time that the fourth quarter will come in slightly better than the third quarter.
We maintain this position even with the most recent ruling related to our Paroxetine CR. While we are extremely disappointed with the lower court's ruling, we believe strongly that the lower court has erred in its decision not to grant us an injunction, and we have appealed that decision. It should also be noted that this is still just a ruling on an injunction. It is not a final decision resolving Mylan's rights on this matter. Regardless of the outcome of the appellant court decision on the injunction, we will continue our litigation to enforce our contractual rights and all of its negotiated provisions with GSK.
With that said, and irrespective of this short-term distraction, the longer-term fundamentals of our business have not changed, which is why we remain committed to our stated targets of $2 of adjusted diluted earnings per share for calendar year 2011 and our longer-term growth targets of 15% top line and 20% bottom line CAGR by the end of 2013. We very much look forward to providing you a detailed breakdown of our 2011 guidance on our next conference call.
Moving on to other activity in the quarter. You will recall that we issued $300 million in follow-on 10-year bonds to finance the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma. In addition, we are also able to use part of the strong operating cash flows that we continue to generate to prepay $300 million in term loan borrowings in the third quarter as well, further reducing our leverage and staying committed to our stated objective to achieve a 3:1 debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio. 
And finally, you may remember that on November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert to common stock. Given the recent growth and strength of our stock price performance, we anticipate issuing the lowest number of shares required under the terms of the preferred stock agreement, which is approximately 125 million shares. A further note, November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend, thereby substantially enhancing our future free cash flows to the company by $139 million per year.
I look forward to answering your questions, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Bresch.

As Robert said, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance and a great start to our expected strong second half of 2010. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results",1328,"Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert said, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance and a great start to our expected strong second half of 2010. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results in line with the guidance we have reaffirmed today. We also continue to be extremely confident about our growth prospects for '11 and beyond. I too would like to commend our employees around the world for making our continued exceptional performance possible.
During my remarks today, I'll review our performance by segment, provide an update on synergies and comment on why we remain so confident about our future. I'd now like to walk you through the performance of our commercial operations. During the third quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.36 billion, an increase of 7% compared to last year's third quarter total revenues of $1.26 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up approximately 9% year-over-year, and on the bottom line, we generated $0.43 of adjusted EPS, a 34% increase over last year's third quarter result of $0.32.
We also delivered a strong adjusted gross margin of 48.4% during the  third quarter, up from our second quarter performance of 45% and right in line with our full year expected range of 47% to 49%. As expected, driving the strong performance were recent approvals on higher margin, limited competition products, higher sales in our Specialty segment and continued synergy realization.
Within our Generics segment, our North American operations delivered third-party net sales for the third quarter of $573 million, up 17% from last year's third quarter result of $488 million. The increase was mainly the result of new product launches in the United States. Among those launches were limited competition products, Minocycline ER, Clonidine Transdermal and Tacrolimus, bringing to ten the dozen such products we anticipate launching by year end, and we remain on track to achieve our full year target of 50 to 60 launches in the U.S.
Our third quarter also includes results from Bioniche, a Specialty Injectables business we acquired on September 7. The integration has been seamless so far, and on October 4, we announced our first approval from the FDA for our Bioniche product, Fludarabine, an injectable chemotherapy medication for leukemia. Our ANDA filings now include those of Bioniche Pharma. Currently, we have 153 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing about $95 billion in annual brand sales. 45 of these pending ANDAs are potential first-to-file opportunities, representing more than $24 billion in annual branded sales. 
In EMEA, third-party net sales of $364 million, 12% versus last year's third quarter third-party sales of $414 million. However, on a constant currency basis, operational performance in EMEA declined only 3% year-over-year while year-to-date, sales have risen almost 2%. That result was driven by unfavorable pricing throughout Europe, which was partially offset by new product launches in several markets. 
Looking forward, we continue to see our ability to even further offset negative trends in the region, thanks to the sheer number of internal products we expect to launch in 2011 and beyond. In addition, we continue to repatriate finished dosage forms, which will continue to add to our competitive position throughout Europe. 
In France, third quarter local currency sales rose compared to the year-ago quarter. New product launches and higher volumes on existing products more than offset ongoing competitive pricing pressures. With more than 30% market share, our market position remains very strong in France, which drives our performance in Europe.
We also experienced higher year-over-year third quarter local currency sales in Italy, where we benefited from a combination of new product launches, higher generic penetration and the continued favorable effect of regulatory changes. And in Spain, our new product launches offset the impact of government-posed price reduction.
Other markets such as Portugal and Germany experienced lower sales during the third quarter due to government-imposed price reductions and the impact of tender systems, respectively.
Turning now to our Asia Pacific region. We delivered very strong third quarter results. Third-party net sales for $268 million, up 30% over last year's third quarter sales on $206 million. On a constant currency basis, sales rose about 22%. Matrix, Australia and Japan all contributed to the strong results. Matrix continued to deliver strong double-digit growth through API and ARV sales and our ARV portfolio now contains 33 products.
Finally, Dey, our Specialty segment performed well during the third quarter. Third-party net sales rose 6% to $141 million over the same period last year after adjusting last year's third-party sales to account for the fact that in 2010, our Mylan Pharmaceutical division assumes responsibility for selling Dey's generic products. The primary driver of our growth was domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector, which were strong compared to the third quarter of '09. Recall that last October, we launched our next-generation needle-protected auto-injector, which has been received favorably in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, compared to our second quarter, sales benefited from the seasonal return of children to school. Further, we can continue to experience double-digit growth in many markets outside the U.S. as we continue the expansion opportunities for this very important product, mainly through focusing on an underserved population.
Moving on now to synergies. I'm pleased that we remain on track to deliver more than $350 million in cumulative annual benefit by the end of this year. We continue to seek out and capture additional opportunities to further increase our efficiency and leverage our powerful operating platform. Looking ahead to '11, as Robert stated, we will provide formal guidance for the year on our next conference call. 
Nonetheless, it's important to note and to remind you that we continue to see Mylan entering the new year with very strong momentum, especially as we launch more products around the globe than we have ever launched in our company's history. In 2011, we look forward to monetizing or continuing to monetize several opportunities resulting from prior settlements such as Minocycline ER, voriconazole, letrozole and Venlafaxine ER. We see a number of 30-month stay to expiring on other opportunities, some of which are first-to-file. We look forward to introducing oral contraceptives in the U.S., and once again, launching more than a dozen limited competition products. 
Worldwide, we continue to expect to launch approximately 500 products. As important, our pipeline is stronger than ever. We currently have about 15,000 global products initiatives pending approval. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to step back and make some observations about our company and how far we've come. Earlier this month, we've celebrated the three year anniversary of the union of legacy Mylan, Matrix and Merck. Behind that union was our vision that the world could be served far better if we created a global, vertically integrated and highly disciplined company that could consistently supply any market with high-quality, affordable generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.
Over the past three years, we have focused relentlessly on executing on our vision by integrating vertically, delivering synergies far beyond our expectations and serving customers in more than 140 countries and territories. Those accomplishments alone allowed us to meet or exceed Street [Wall Street] estimates for 13 consecutive quarters. 
But that's not all we've been doing for the last three years. We've also been selling our global network with internally supplied products by applying the same methodology and fundamentals that made our integration so successful. Among the actions we've been taking, optimizing R&D, enhancing our portfolio and management capabilities, repatriating products and filling gaps in our product line, we also have created a biologic strategy and strengthening the promising future of our Specialty business, Dey. And perhaps most important, we have filed approximately 3,000 applications globally by the end of this year. Now, we're ready to reap what we've sown. That is why we're so confident about our growth over the next three years and beyond. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.

This afternoon, I will begin by walking you through our third quarter 2010 financial results, which, as Heather and Robert have both indicated, were exceptional.

This afternoon, I will begin by walking you through our third quarter 2010 financial results, which, as Heather and Robert have both indicated, were exceptional. I will then provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.
As Kris mentioned earlier, I'm going to be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that has been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they're prepared on the same basis as used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our business. This afternoon's earnings release includes a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for our third quarter 2010 and 2009 results. Our earnings release is available on our website, and I encourage you to take a look at it.
Starting at the top of the income statement. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.36 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's third quarter total revenues of $1.26 billion. The effect of foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our third quarter revenues, reflecting a weaker euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of other currencies, primarily the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar.
During the third quarter, we launched Minocycline ER. As I discussed with you on last quarter's call, because of significant uncertainties surrounding the pricing and market conditions with respect to Minocycline, we are not able to reasonably estimate the magnitude of potential price adjustments, including product returns, and as a result, have deferred revenue recognition until such uncertainties are resolved. At this time, we considered such uncertainties to be resolved upon the sale by our customers of the product and have recognized revenue accordingly.
Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 48.4% compared to 46% in the prior year. As expected, this adjusted gross margin is an improvement from that of the first and second quarters and is within our full year guidance range of 47% to 49% and is primarily the result of new product launches in North America and favorable pricing on our Specialty segment, EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $69 million or approximately 5% of revenues. Also as expected, this level of spending represents an increase over the first half of 2010 and is in line with our revised full year guidance range of 5% to 6% of revenues. Importantly, our R&D projects remained on target, and we are planning for even higher levels of spending in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted SG&A expense was $257 million for the quarter or 19% of revenues, within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%, and our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $368 million.
Now let me move to a couple of non-operating financial metrics. Third quarter 2010 adjusted interest expense was $70 million. We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be at or near the low end of our guidance range of $280 million to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates. Our third quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 26%, which translates into a year-to-date and full year projected adjusted effective income tax rate of 28%, which is at the low end of our forecasted range of 28% to 29%. We do fully anticipate this full year effective tax rate to be sustainable going forward. In summary, third quarter adjusted net income was $189 million or $0.43 per share.
In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the $35 million quarterly preferred dividend. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of approximately 438 million shares.
Touching briefly on the year-to-date results, and again, please refer to our earnings release for a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to our non-GAAP financial measures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, total revenues were $4.02 billion, an increase of 8% over adjusted revenues of $3.71 billion in the same prior year period. For the nine months, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on revenues of approximately 1% due mainly to the strengthening of the rupee, yen, and Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker euro.
Adjusted gross margin for the nine months was approximately 46% compared to 47% in the same prior year period. The lower gross margin in the current year is the result of a loss of exclusivity on divalproex during the third quarter of 2009. However, the current year gross margin was negatively impacted by certain inventory charges, principally in Q2. Excluding the impacts of these inventory charges, year-to-date gross margin would have approached 47%. We continue to see full year gross margin at the low end of our 47% to 49% guidance range. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $195 million, and adjusted SG&A expense was $753 million for the current nine-month period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2010 was $1.03 billion. Adjusted net income was $511 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.16 per share.
As in the previous quarter, adjusted diluted EPS was calculated assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million shares of common stock. On November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock. The number of convertible shares will be based upon the closing stock price over the 20-day trading period ending on November 12. Based on the current stock price, we expect that approximately 125 million shares will be the conversion amount. 
As mentioned before, we have been including this preferred stock conversion in our forecasted results. As such, the actual conversion will not result in an additional dilution to our guidance amounts. November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend. 
Depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase further due to additional dilution from stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments such as our convertible debt obligations and related warrants. We also include such potential dilution in our forecasted results. 
As I mentioned previously, the impact of foreign exchange translation on our results was not significant, and actual foreign currency exchange rates during the period ended September 30, 2010, did not differ materially from those used to calculate our 2010 guidance, which we discussed with you last quarter.
More recently, we have seen the euro strengthened steadily against the U.S. dollar. However, we do not expect currency to have a significant impact on our results for the remainder of the year. This is due to the fact that the currencies of other markets in which we operate are moving in the opposite direction of the euro, and it's also a result of various hedging strategies that we've employed.
We've taken measures in an effort to prevent our results from being impacted significantly by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition to having on our balance sheet euro-denominated long-term debt against which the cash flows of our euro-denominated subsidiaries are offset, we use financial instruments such as forward contracts in order to mitigate this risk. Any favorable or unfavorable variances resulting from foreign exchange for the three- and nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, are included in the adjusted diluted per-share amount of $0.43 and $1.16 per share, respectively.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Our third quarter GAAP cash flow from operations was nearly $380 million, the highest in our company's history or $360 million excluding certain items. While we don't anticipate fourth quarter cash flow from operations to approach this level, we do continue to project full year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million excluding certain one-off items.
Our strong current quarter cash from operations was made possible through positive changes in our working capital, primarily accounts receivable as a result in improved cash collections, including amounts received with respect to Minocycline.
As you may recall, on last quarter's call, I indicated that Q2 cash from operations were negatively impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received in early July. Q3 cash from operations was also impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received prior to September 30, 2010. 
Third quarter capital spending was $53 million, including approximately $10 million paid toward the acquisition of a finished dose manufacturing facility in India. Based on the anticipated timing of spending on certain projects, we now project capital spending in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Our current quarter also include a cash outflow of approximately $544 million with respect to our acquisition of Bioniche Pharma, which is net of any cash acquired. As Heather mentioned, results of Bioniche are included in our current quarter results from September 7.
The Bioniche acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and the proceeds from recent notes offerings. As discussed last quarter, in May, we completed a private placement of $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and 2020. In the current quarter, we completed an add-on offering of an additional $300 million of the 2020 notes. These notes were issued at initial price of 105.5% and a coupon of 7 7/8% or an effective yield to maturity of slightly over 7%.
The notes issued in the current quarter's offering, together with the 2020 notes from the May offering, are treated as a single class of notes under the indenture. In addition to funding the Bioniche acquisition, the bond issuances were done in accordance with our objective of extending the maturity profile of our outstanding indebtedness. $1 billion of the net proceeds from the May issuance were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our credit facility. In late September, we used our strong operating cash to repay an additional $300 million of existing indebtedness under our credit facility. As a result of these repayments, we continue to have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the $600 million due under our convertible notes in the first quarter of 2012, which we currently intend to repay with available cash at that time.
At September 30, 2010, following the additional debt repayment of $300 million, we continue to have unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling over $640 million.
Continuing on with the capital structure, concerning leverage. As Robert have stated many times, it is our commitment to achieve a long-term leverage ratio of 3:1 or less. We are firmly committed to balancing growth in our business from the continued use of prudent and responsible financing. As such, Mylan remains committed to deleveraging over time to meet this long-term capital structure goal. We continue to expect to generate approximately $4 billion of cumulative operating cash flows by the end of 2013.
From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 1.7x our last 12 months covenant basis adjusted EBITDA, comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5x. In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid quarterly performance. A great start to what we've been saying will be a strong second half of 2010.

First, again, there are many, many mitigating factors, and it's difficult, I understand from your perspective, not to be able to evaluate the number of moving variables. But let's start with EMEA. I said that this would be basically almost a two-bucket approach. I've been telling you all along that we continue to see what we've anticipated, what the governments are doing over there in terms of pricing and pushing prices down lower. But we've often said that we felt very comfortable with our position to be able to mitigate that by all the other initiatives that we have in place, including, I'll pull a knot, cost infrastructure that really doesn't fit with the new system, the new wave of direction where Europe is going. Our cost of goods, our repatriation, our bringing in a lot of the third parties back in-house, and of course, our increase in volumes. So that's kind of sort of -- and the races in Europe, Randall, the races, again, what I've always stated, the speed at which governments move and the speed at which we can, through a regulatory process, be able to yield all the benefits that we've been telling you all along. And in terms of the Paxil CR, we are in litigation. It's been a long-standing position of ours, and not to comment when we are on litigation. I tried to give you a signal, obviously, in our opening remarks about how I feel as a whole about that whole situation. We're extremely confident in our position. We think there's a lot more involved in terms of the dealings between GSK and Apotex, and it wasn't just a one-off type of situation. And that's what litigation is all about, and I'm very confident that we'll prevail once we have an opportunity to get inside. In terms of the $2, the last piece of your question, look, all these factors have -- there's nothing really new. There's just nothing new in terms of what we've thought about, what we've been trying to anticipate. And the best way I can explain to you on the $2 on why we're still confident is actually for two reasons. One, Randall, the fundamentals, the long-term fundamentals of the company have not changed at all, at all. Basically, what we're dealing with is the short-term issues that we have to just continue to manage or work our way through. And what I would bring to your attention is go back for the last 13 quarters where we have been trying the same exact question that we're faced with today about visibility in 2011 and beyond. When we were in 2007 roughly at $0.45 and an $0.80 in 2008 and $1.30 in 2009 and roughly a midpoint of $1.60 in 2010, nobody understood how we were going to get there. And what I can tell you, and what we have done already is this management team promised that it would manage. It would manage this new acquired platform for earnings growth. And I can tell you that when we were back at $0.45 and $0.80 and $1.30 and $1.60 in terms of our respective midpoints, when we started out that guidance and where we thought those earnings per share are going to come from and where they actually came from are not always exactly the same. That's just the nature of our business. So I can assure you that when we once again I think we have become at least somewhat predictable to all of you guys. If we tell you that our vision is in the balancing act, what we can see the number of variables versus what you may not be able to see, we are very comfortable that the $2 target in calendar year 2011 is achievable.

You have this bubble. And I can only tell you that unless we thought, Randall, that somehow Paxil CR was never going to achieve competition ever, ever, ever, then I can say that, that would be an effect on us. In a generic company, one can never project that a generic product forever will be in your product without competition. So obviously, it's a timing issue.

I believe that, that is one market that will go from a seller's market to a buyer's market. That is one region, I believe, that the multiples ought to contract. And my rationale is that I think what all of Europe is experiencing is the more regional companies, the more local companies, it's very, very difficult as Europe moves in the direction of some of the other markets around the world to be able to compete if you don't have scale. And without scale, again, that cost competitiveness, they're going to feel it. And I think that some of these mom-and-pop companies, these local companies, these regional companies begin to realize that the writing is on the wall. I think it will force them indirectly towards more activity. And I think as the more activity percolates, I think the supply-demand curve will kick in, and when there's more supply than there is demand, I think that you'll see multiples come down. So I do see more consolidation. I do think it's extremely healthy over in Europe to bring more capacity out of the market, and I do think that scale will prevail. Heather?

And to the extent that, like I said, we believe that was right in line with our thinking of where 2011 would be as well as some continuing to look at the whole value chain, not just the generic manufacturers. So as we've seen with other regulations and some of the pricing throughout Europe, Spain, Italy continuing to do the same, not looking at just the generic manufacturers, but kind of the entire supply chain. So that's why I stated the trends, and as I said, the tender markets whether it's Germany and some of the pricing pressure that you see that blimp that of course was attached to this quarter.

And look, I can assure you, will not stop our efforts of being out there educating and showing the sustainability of generic penetration versus just, like I said, the price cuts. And I think the other point to note here is the responsibility that we have seen and demonstrate between looking at the entire supply chain and not just the generic manufacturer, whether it's from the pharmacy perspective, the brand arena. So it's balancing both of those fronts.

As I noted this quarter,our  sales were up year-over-year for France as well as Italy and Spain, and we continue to see those being contributors as well in this growth for Q4 both year-over-year and sequentially. As far as APAC is concerned, Matrix, while we don't break out the individual divisions within a segment, we have continued and will continue to at least give what the leaders are and Matrix has led that with double-digit growth from the APAC region, but we did have contribution both from Australia as well as Japan year-over-year.

In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan’s on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted revenues, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and our leadership team, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your continued hard work, dedication and outstanding performance.
I am extremely pleased to report to you yet another strong quarter performance of exceptional earnings. As I mentioned on the last conference call, I did anticipate the third quarter to be better than the second quarter, and I am extremely pleased to report adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43, a 16% increase from our second quarter results. With that said, I still expect at this time that the fourth quarter will come in slightly better than the third quarter.
We maintain this position even with the most recent ruling related to our Paroxetine CR. While we are extremely disappointed with the lower court's ruling, we believe strongly that the lower court has erred in its decision not to grant us an injunction, and we have appealed that decision. It should also be noted that this is still just a ruling on an injunction. It is not a final decision resolving Mylan's rights on this matter. Regardless of the outcome of the appellant court decision on the injunction, we will continue our litigation to enforce our contractual rights and all of its negotiated provisions with GSK.
With that said, and irrespective of this short-term distraction, the longer-term fundamentals of our business have not changed, which is why we remain committed to our stated targets of $2 of adjusted diluted earnings per share for calendar year 2011 and our longer-term growth targets of 15% top line and 20% bottom line CAGR by the end of 2013. We very much look forward to providing you a detailed breakdown of our 2011 guidance on our next conference call.
Moving on to other activity in the quarter. You will recall that we issued $300 million in follow-on 10-year bonds to finance the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma. In addition, we are also able to use part of the strong operating cash flows that we continue to generate to prepay $300 million in term loan borrowings in the third quarter as well, further reducing our leverage and staying committed to our stated objective to achieve a 3:1 debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio. 
And finally, you may remember that on November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert to common stock. Given the recent growth and strength of our stock price performance, we anticipate issuing the lowest number of shares required under the terms of the preferred stock agreement, which is approximately 125 million shares. Of further note, November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend, thereby substantially enhancing our future free cash flows to the company by $139 million per year.
I look forward to answering your questions, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Bresch."

As Robert said, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance and a great start to our expected strong second half of 2010. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results in line with the guidance we have reaffirmed today. We also continue to be extremely confident about our growth prospects for '11 and beyond. I too would like to commend our employees around the world for making our continued exceptional performance possible.
During my remarks today, I'll review our performance by segment, provide an update on synergies and comment on why we remain so confident about our future. I'd now like to walk you through the performance of our commercial operations. During the third quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.36 billion, an increase of 7% compared to last year's third quarter total revenues of $1.26 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up approximately 9% year-over-year, and on the bottom line, we generated $0.43 of adjusted EPS, a 34% increase over last year's third quarter result of $0.32.
We also delivered a strong adjusted gross margin of 48.4% during the third quarter, up from our second quarter performance of 45% and right in line with our full year expected range of 47% to 49%. As expected, driving the strong performance were recent approvals on higher margin, limited competition products, higher sales in our Specialty segment and continued synergy realization.
Within our Generics segment, our North American operations delivered third-party net sales for the third quarter of $573 million, up 17% from last year's third quarter result of $488 million. The increase was mainly the result of new product launches in the United States. Among those launches were limited competition products, Minocycline ER, Clonidine Transdermal, and Tacrolimus, bringing to ten the dozen such products we anticipate launching by year end, and we remain on track to achieve our full year target of 50 to 60 launches in the U.S.
Our third quarter also includes results from Bioniche, a Specialty Injectables business we acquired on September 7. The integration has been seamless so far, and on October 4, we announced our first approval from the FDA for our Bioniche product, Fludarabine, an injectable chemotherapy medication for leukemia. Our ANDA filings now include those of Bioniche Pharma. Currently, we have 153 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing about $95 billion in annual brand sales. 45 of these pending ANDAs are potential first-to-file opportunities, representing more than $24 billion in annual branded sales. 
In EMEA, third-party net sales of $364 million fell 12% versus last year's third quarter third-party sales of $414 million. However, on a constant currency basis, operational performance in EMEA declined only 3% year-over-year while year-to-date, sales have risen almost 2%. That result was driven by unfavorable pricing throughout Europe, which was partially offset by new product launches in several markets. 
Looking forward, we continue to see our ability to even further offset negative trends in the region, thanks to the sheer number of internal products we expect to launch in 2011 and beyond. In addition, we continue to repatriate finished dosage forms, which will continue to add to our competitive position throughout Europe. 
In France, third quarter local currency sales rose compared to the year-ago quarter. New product launches and higher volumes on existing products more than offset ongoing competitive pricing pressures. With more than 30% market share, our market leadership position remains very strong in France, which drives our performance in Europe.
We also experienced higher year-over-year third quarter local currency sales in Italy, where we benefited from a combination of new product launches, higher generic penetration and the continued favorable effects of regulatory changes. And in Spain, our new product launches offset the impact of government-posed price reduction.
Other markets such as Portugal and Germany experienced lower sales during the third quarter due to government-imposed price reductions and the impact of tender systems, respectively.
Turning now to our Asia Pacific region. We delivered very strong third quarter results. Third-party net sales were $268 million, up 30% over last year's third quarter sales on $206 million. On a constant currency basis, sales rose about 22%. Matrix, Australia and Japan all contributed to the strong results. Matrix continued to deliver strong double-digit growth through API and ARV sales and our ARV portfolio now contains 33 products.
Finally, Dey, our Specialty segment performed well during the third quarter. Third-party net sales rose 6% to $141 million over the same period last year after adjusting last year's third-party sales to account for the fact that in 2010, our Mylan Pharmaceutical division assumed responsibility for selling Dey's generic products. The primary driver of our growth was domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector, which were strong compared to the third quarter of '09. Recall that last October, we launched our next-generation needle-protected auto-injector, which has been received favorably in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, compared to our second quarter, sales benefited from the seasonal return of children to school. Further, we can continue to experience double-digit growth in many markets outside the U.S. as we continue the expansion opportunities for this very important product, mainly through focusing on an underserved population.
Moving on now to synergies. I'm pleased that we remain on track to deliver more than $350 million in cumulative annual benefit by the end of this year. We continue to seek out and capture additional opportunities to further increase our efficiency and leverage our powerful operating platform. Looking ahead to '11, as Robert stated, we will provide formal guidance for the year on our next conference call. 
Nonetheless, it's important to note and to remind you that we continue to see Mylan entering the new year with very strong momentum, especially as we launch more products around the globe than we have ever launched in our company's history. In 2011, we look forward to monetizing or continuing to monetize several opportunities resulting from prior settlements such as Minocycline ER, voriconazole, letrozole and Venlafaxine ER. We see a number of 30-month stays expiring on other opportunities, some of which are first-to-file. We look forward to introducing oral contraceptives in the U.S., and once again, launching more than a dozen limited competition products. 
Worldwide, we continue to expect to launch approximately 500 products. As important, our pipeline is stronger than ever. We currently have about 1,500 global products submissions pending approval. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to step back and make some observations about our company and how far we've come. Earlier this month, we celebrated the three year anniversary of the union of legacy Mylan, Matrix and Merck. Behind that union was our vision that the world could be served far better if we created a global, vertically integrated and highly disciplined company that could consistently supply any market with high-quality, affordable generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.
Over the past three years, we have focused relentlessly on executing on our vision by integrating vertically, delivering synergies far beyond our expectations and serving customers in more than 140 countries and territories. Those accomplishments alone allowed us to meet or exceed Street [Wall Street] estimates for 13 consecutive quarters. 
But that's not all we've been doing for the last three years. We've also been filling our global network with internally supplied products by applying the same methodology and fundamentals that made our integration so successful. Among the actions we've been taking, optimizing R&D, enhancing our portfolio and management capabilities, repatriating products and filling gaps in our product line, we also have created a biologic strategy and strengthening the promising future of our Specialty business, Dey. And perhaps most important, we have filed approximately 3,000 applications globally by the end of this year. Now, we're ready to reap what we've sown. That is why we're so confident about our growth over the next three years and beyond. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John."

The effect of foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our third quarter revenues, reflecting a weaker euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of other currencies, primarily the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar.
During the third quarter, we launched Minocycline ER. As I discussed with you on last quarter's call, because of significant uncertainties surrounding the pricing and market conditions with respect to Minocycline, we are not able to reasonably estimate the magnitude of potential price adjustments, including product returns, and as a result, have deferred revenue recognition until such uncertainties are resolved. At this time, we consider such uncertainties to be resolved upon the sale by our customers of the product and have recognized revenue accordingly.
Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 48.4% compared to 46% in the prior year. As expected, this adjusted gross margin is an improvement from that of the first and second quarters and is within our full year guidance range of 47% to 49% and is primarily the result of new product launches in North America and favorable pricing on our Specialty segment, EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $69 million or approximately 5% of revenues. Also as expected, this level of spending represents an increase over the first half of 2010 and is in line with our revised full-year guidance range of 5% to 6% of revenues. Importantly, our R&D projects remained on target, and we are planning for even higher levels of spending in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted SG&A expense was $257 million for the quarter or 19% of revenues, within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%, and our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $368 million.
Now let me move to a couple of non-operating financial metrics. Third quarter 2010 adjusted interest expense was $70 million. We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be at or near the low end of our guidance range of $280 million to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates. Our third quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 26%, which translates into a year-to-date and full year projected adjusted effective income tax rate of 28%, which is at the low end of our forecasted range of 28% to 29%. We do fully anticipate this full year effective tax rate to be sustainable going forward. In summary, third quarter adjusted net income was $189 million or $0.43 per share.
In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the $35 million quarterly preferred dividend. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of approximately 438 million shares.
Touching briefly on the year-to-date results, and again, please refer to our earnings release for a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to our non-GAAP financial measures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, total revenues were $4.02 billion, an increase of 8% over adjusted revenues of $3.71 billion in the same prior year period. For the nine months, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on revenues of approximately 1% due mainly to the strengthening of the rupee, yen, and Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker euro.
Adjusted gross margin for the nine months was approximately 46% compared to 47% in the same prior year period. The lower gross margin in the current year is the result of a loss of exclusivity on divalproex during the third quarter of 2009. However, the current year gross margin was negatively impacted by certain inventory charges, principally in Q2. Excluding the impacts of these inventory charges, year-to-date gross margin would have approached 47%. We continue to see full year gross margin at the low end of our 47% to 49% guidance range. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $195 million, and adjusted SG&A expense was $753 million for the current nine-month period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2010 was $1.03 billion. Adjusted net income was $511 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.16 per share.
As in the previous quarter, adjusted diluted EPS was calculated assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million shares of common stock. On November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock. The number of convertible shares will be based upon the closing stock price over the 20-day trading period ending on November 12. Based on the current stock price, we expect that approximately 125 million shares will be the conversion amount. 
As mentioned before, we have been including this preferred stock conversion in our forecasted results. As such, the actual conversion will not result in an additional dilution to our guidance amounts. November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend. 
Depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase further due to additional dilution from stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments such as our convertible debt obligations and related warrants. We also include such potential dilution in our forecasted results. 
As I mentioned previously, the impact of foreign exchange translation on our results was not significant, and actual foreign currency exchange rates during the period ended September 30, 2010, did not differ materially from those used to calculate our 2010 guidance, which we discussed with you last quarter.
More recently, we have seen the euro strengthen steadily against the U.S. dollar. However, we do not expect currency to have a significant impact on our results for the remainder of the year. This is due to the fact that the currencies of other markets in which we operate are moving in the opposite direction of the euro, and it's also a result of various hedging strategies that we've employed.
We've taken measures in an effort to prevent our results from being impacted significantly by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition to having on our balance sheet euro-denominated long-term debt against which the cash flows of our euro-denominated subsidiaries are offset, we use financial instruments such as forward contracts in order to mitigate this risk. Any favorable or unfavorable variances resulting from foreign exchange for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, are included in the adjusted diluted per-share amount of $0.43 and $1.16 per share, respectively.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Our third quarter GAAP cash flow from operations was nearly $380 million, the highest in our company's history or $360 million excluding certain items. While we don't anticipate fourth quarter cash flow from operations to approach this level, we do continue to project full year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million excluding certain one-off items.
Our strong current quarter cash from operations was made possible through positive changes in our working capital, primarily accounts receivable as a result in improved cash collections, including amounts received with respect to Minocycline. As you may recall, on last quarter's call, I indicated that Q2 cash from operations were negatively impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received in early July. Q3 cash from operations was also impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received prior to September 30, 2010. 
Third quarter capital spending was $53 million, including approximately $10 million paid toward the acquisition of a finished dose manufacturing facility in India. Based on the anticipated timing of spending on certain projects, we now project capital spending in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Our current quarter also included a cash outflow of approximately $544 million with respect to our acquisition of Bioniche Pharma, which is net of any cash acquired. As Heather mentioned, results of Bioniche are included in our current quarter results from September 7.
The Bioniche acquisition was financed through a combination of cash-on-hand and the proceeds from recent notes offerings. As discussed last quarter, in May, we completed a private placement of $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and 2020. In the current quarter, we completed an add-on offering of an additional $300 million of the 2020 notes. These notes were issued at initial price of 105.5% and a coupon of 7 7/8% or an effective yield to maturity of slightly over 7%.
The notes issued in the current quarter's offering, together with the 2020 notes from the May offering, are treated as a single class of notes under the indenture. In addition to funding the Bioniche acquisition, the bond issuances were done in accordance with our objective of extending the maturity profile of our outstanding indebtedness. $1 billion of the net proceeds from the May issuance were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our credit facility. In late September, we used our strong operating cash to repay an additional $300 million of existing indebtedness under our credit facility. As a result of these repayments, we continue to have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the $600 million due under our convertible notes in the first quarter of 2012, which we currently intend to repay with available cash at that time.
At September 30, 2010, following the additional debt repayment of $300 million, we continue to have unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling over $640 million.
Continuing on with the capital structure, concerning leverage. As Robert has stated many times, it is our commitment to achieve a long-term leverage ratio of 3:1 or less. We are firmly committed to balancing growth in our business through the continued use of prudent and responsible financing. As such, Mylan remains committed to de-leveraging over time to meet this long-term capital structure goal. We continue to expect to generate approximately $4 billion of cumulative operating cash flows by the end of 2013.
From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 1.7x our last 12 month covenant basis adjusted EBITDA, comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5x. In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid quarterly performance. A great start to what we've been saying will be a strong second half of 2010. 
That concludes my remarks. Lisa, I'll turn the call back over to you to start the Q&A."

First, again, there are many, many mitigating factors, and it's difficult, I understand from your perspective, not to be able to evaluate the number of moving variables. But let's start with EMEA. I said that this would be a basically almost a two-bucket approach. I've been telling you all along that we continue to see what we've anticipated, what the governments are doing over there in terms of pricing and pushing prices down lower. But we've often said that we felt very comfortable with our position to be able to mitigate that by all the other initiatives that we have in place, including, I'll pull a knot, cost infrastructure that really doesn't fit with the new system, the new wave of direction where Europe is going. Our cost of goods, our repatriation, our bringing in a lot of the third parties back in-house, and of course, our increase in volumes. So that's kind of sort of -- and the races in Europe, Randall, the races, again, what I've always stated, the speed at which governments move and the speed at which we can, through a regulatory process, be able to yield all the benefits that we've been telling you all along. And in terms of the Paxil CR, we are in litigation. It's been a long-standing position of ours, and not to comment when we are in litigation. I tried to give you a signal, obviously, in our opening remarks about how I feel as a whole about that whole situation. We're extremely confident in our position. We think there's a lot more involved in terms of the dealings between GSK and Apotex, and it wasn't just a one-off type of situation. And that's what litigation is all about, and I'm very confident that we'll prevail once we have an opportunity to get inside. In terms of the $2, the last piece of your question, look, all these factors have -- there's nothing really new. There's just nothing new in terms of what we've thought about, what we've been trying to anticipate. And the best way I can explain to you on the $2 on why we're still confident is actually for two reasons. One, Randall, the fundamentals, the long-term fundamentals of the company have not changed at all. At all. Basically, what we're dealing with is the short-term issues that we have to just continue to manage or work our way through. And what I would bring to your attention is go back for the last 13 quarters where we have been trying the same exact questions that we're faced with today about visibility in 2011 and beyond. When we were in 2007 roughly at $0.45 and then $0.80 in 2008 and $1.30 in 2009 and roughly a midpoint of $1.60 in 2010, nobody understood how we were going to get there. And what I can tell you, and what we have done already is this management team promised that it would manage. It would manage this new acquired platform for earnings growth. And I can tell you that when we were back at $0.45 and $0.80 and $1.30 and $1.60 in terms of our respective midpoints, when we started out that guidance and where we thought those earnings per share were going to come from and where they actually came from are not always exactly the same. That's just the nature of our business. So I can assure you that when we once again I think we have become at least somewhat predictable to all of you guys. If we tell you that our vision is in the balancing act, what we can see the number of variables versus what you may not be able to see, we are very comfortable that the $2 target in calendar year 2011 is achievable."

You have this bubble. And I can only tell you that unless we thought, Randall, that somehow Paxil CR was never going to achieve competition ever, ever, ever, then I can say that, that would be an effect on us. In a generic company, one can never project that a generic product forever will be in your product without competition. So obviously, it's a timing issue. And that's why the longer-term fundamentals simply haven't changed."

I believe that, that is one market that will go from a seller's market to a buyer's market. That is one region, I believe, that the multiples ought to contract. And my rationale is that I think what all of Europe is experiencing is the more regional companies, the more local companies, it's very, very difficult as Europe moves in direction of some of the other markets around the world to be able to compete if you don't have scale. And without scale, again, that cost competitiveness, they're going to feel it. And I think that some of these mom-and-pop companies, these local companies, these regional companies begin to realize that the writing is on the wall. I think it will force them indirectly towards more activity. And I think as the more activity percolates, I think the supply-demand curve will kick in, and when there's more supply than there is demand, I think that you'll see multiples come down. So I do see more consolidation. I do think it's extremely healthy over in Europe to bring more capacity out of the market, and I do think that scale will prevail. Heather?"

And as far as France and some of the trends, we absolutely what just came out for the 2011 time period we anticipated, and as you note, fairly modest. And to the extent that, like I said, we believe that was right in line with our thinking of where 2011 would be as well as them continuing to look at the whole value chain, not just the generic manufacturers. So as we've seen with other regulations and some of the pricing throughout Europe, Spain, Italy continuing to do the same, not looking at just the generic manufacturers, but kind of the entire supply chain. So that's why I say to the trends, and as I said, the tender markets whether it's Germany and some of the pricing pressure that you see that blimp that of course was attached to this quarter.

And as you know, we have public comments out there and have been working closely with FDA and the industry to really set up a fair level playing field as far as foreign inspections and this truly global supply chain that the FDA has to be able to support a product that's being sold into the U.S. So she, obviously, in her remarks have been very, very supportive of leveling that playing field and making sure that FDA has the resources they need to do inspections every two years of anyone who's supplying products into the U.S. market. So I think that some of her comments certainly go to the fact that, that heightening attention, the heightening of resources and us being able to put something through that would allow the FDA to accomplish that would certainly benefit not only leveling that playing field, but back to Robert's point, it will also even go towards the backlog and where we see the applications, and I think, could see an improvement in those median times all being connected together, and that's the approach we’ve certainly taking of advocating and believe that FDA believes that, that would be beneficial on all fronts."

Our free cash flow is over $500 million a year with the final preferred dividend that we're making here in the fourth quarter. That will increase our free cash flow by $139 million a year.

As Mike mentioned, approximately a month ago at the Investors Day, we gave you a strategy and business update. Now I am pleased to report at the close of third quarter by making steady progress with our business across the globe. 
Transaction and constant-currency revenue trends in our Consumer-to-Consumer business have now improved for four quarters in a row, with overall transaction growth increasing to 10% in the third quarter. Compared to the second quarter, the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions delivered improved trends, and the EMEASA region was steady. We took further steps to expand our retail footprint in Europe through a planned relationship with DHL and to advance our banking strategy in the U.S. by signing an agreement to offer money transfer services at KeyBank.
In Global Business Payments, the billed payments revenue decline was fairly consistent with the second quarter. Custom House delivered a solid $27 million in revenue and remains on track for double-digit revenue growth for the year. We are currently re-branding customers to Western Union business solutions. I believe Western Union's global brand strength and high awareness levels, as well as the company's agents and regulatory relationships, should benefit our business-to-business category as we expand into new markets.
In Bill Pay, we are piloting an enhanced walk-in payment service in the U.S. This new service provides repeat customers a simplified, formless process for urgent payments and is being tested at select agent locations. We also received approvals for a bank license in Brazil, which will allow us to offer Bill Payment like we do it in Argentina, Panama and Peru, as well as intra-country money transfer and other services such as prepaid cards. These are, of course, in addition to our existing cross-border Consumer Money Transfer business.
Now overall, the company generated strong margin improvement in the third quarter, led by the Consumer-to-Consumer business, which delivered 30% margins. We continue to generate strong cash flow and return capital to shareholders as we repurchased almost $100 million of stock in the quarter and declared nearly $40 million in dividends. Including the latest dividend, which was paid in October, year-to-date, we have now returned over $630 million to shareholders through repurchase and dividends.
Now based on the third quarter performance, current business trends and improved tax rate, we are pleased to be able to raise our full year 2010 earnings per share outlook again. Although the environment remains challenging, with high global unemployment, our diversified portfolio is delivering results. The momentum has been positive, and our increased confidence is also allowing us to make incremental investment in the business in the fourth quarter. Scott will give you more details on the third quarter financial results and our outlook in a few minutes. But before this, following our Investors Day’s presentation, I would like to provide a quick update on progress with our strategic initiatives.
In Electronic Money Transfer, we continue to grow. westernunion.com transaction in the international markets once again increased over 60% in the quarter. Including the U.S., the global westernunion.com transaction growth was almost 20%. 
Account-based money transfer transaction, which includes both account to cash, cash to account with banks, grew more than 50% in the quarter. We now have 27 banks globally that have agreed to offer this service through Western Union. 
In mobile, we have enabled approximately 70,000 agent locations in 27 countries to provide cash to mobile service. Consumer can also send money transfers to mobile recipients from westernunion.com sites in six countries. We also expanded our relationship with the State Bank of India to allow account holders to receive money transfers in their bank accounts using their mobile phones beginning 2011. In Canada, we entered a strategic alliance with EnStream to allow Zoompass mobile wallet holders to send cross-border and domestic money transfers directly from their mobile phones.
Electronic channels are still a relatively small part of our portfolio today, at only 2% of revenues. But we continue to grow fast and lay the groundwork for the future. In prepaid, we had over 650,000 cards-in-force at the end of the quarter, and we increased our retail distribution in the U.S. to over to over 9,000 locations. 
As we reported at our Investors Day, year-to-date through the end of September, over $240 million of principal has been loaded on the cards to approximately 1.1 million loads. We began a direct response television campaign in the U.S. for our prepaid cards in the quarter, and also signed an agreement with CCH, a lead software for tax and accounting professionals. This agreement will allow customers to receive U.S. tax refunds on a Western Union MoneyWise Prepaid MasterCard beginning in 2011. We have also initiated plans for expanding prepaid into select international markets with several countries in the works for 2011. We believe the global opportunities for prepaid are large, and we are well positioned to offer this service in the appropriate markets.
So this is a quick progress update on some of our key initiatives. As we discussed at our recent Investors Day, this organization highly focused on four key strategic priorities: growing our Retail Money Transfer business; expanding Electronic Channels; developing our product portfolio with new services, such as prepaid cards and business-to-business solutions; and improving processes and productivity.
Since I was named CEO, I have spent a large amount of my time evaluating the company's competitive position, global market opportunities, organizational capabilities and processes. I strongly believe we now have the right strategy in place, and moving forward, our success will be highly dependent on execution. We are creating the proper alignment, processes, tools and incentives to drive results, and I believe we took some encouraging steps in this right direction in the third quarter.
Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results and the full year outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Scott."

Our third quarter revenue and transaction results were consistent with what we reported in our September 29 press release. We are pleased with the continued progress in Consumer-to-Consumer and Western Union business solutions, which wa",1715,"Thank you, Hikmet. Our third quarter revenue and transaction results were consistent with what we reported in our September 29 press release. We are pleased with the continued progress in Consumer-to-Consumer and Western Union business solutions, which was formerly Custom House. While U.S. Bill Payment remains challenging, the rate of decline in Bill Payment did moderate slightly. 
Overall for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue growth of 1% or 3% on a constant-currency basis. Total Western Union transaction fee revenue represented 78% of company revenue and was flat from the prior year. Foreign exchange revenue represented 20% of total company revenue and increased 11% in the quarter, benefiting from the acquisition of Custom House.
Our Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue increased 1% or 3% in constant currency. As Hikmet noted, each region contributed to this progress with steady to improving trends. 
Transaction growth in our C2C segment continued to accelerate with 10% year-over-year growth. Trends in the international C2C business were comparable to the second quarter. Revenue grew 2% in the third quarter or 4% constant currency on transaction growth of 7%. The company's C2C cross-border principal increased 4% in the quarter or 6% on a constant-currency basis. C2C principal per transaction decreased 4% year-over-year or declined 3% in constant-currency terms, generally in line with recent quarterly trends.
Turning to our regions. Our C2C business in Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew transactions consistent with the second quarter at 5%. Revenue declined 2% and was again negatively impacted by currency translation. On a constant-currency basis, EMEASA revenue increased in the quarter. 
We continue to see good performance from large markets, such as the U.K., Germany and Russia, while the Gulf states remained challenged, with transaction declines consistent with the second quarter. India transactions and revenues increased 2%, and transactions continue to be impacted by the Gulf state softness.
In the quarter, we also launched westernunion.com transaction site in Switzerland, agreed with certain banking partners in Romania, Turkey and Russia to offer account-based money transfer and introduced the Western Union loyalty card in Romania. 
Turning to the Americas region. Momentum continued with 13% transaction growth and 2% revenue increase in the quarter. U.S. domestic repositioning once again drove activity, led by the $0.00 to $50 principal band. Domestic money transfer delivering strong transaction growth of 35% in the quarter, revenue declined only 6%, and we continue to expect positive domestic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Mexico transactions grew 2% as revenue declined 1%, and the U.S. Outbound business continued to perform well, with the Philippines and Jamaican corridors leading the revenue growth.
The Asia-Pacific region delivered strong performance in the quarter, with growth of 15% in transactions and 12% in revenue. In China, transactions and revenue each grew 6%. We continue to see network expansion in corridor marketing as key drivers to growing share in this important country, and we'll be activating thousands of new locations with our new and existing bank partners over the next few years.
The Philippines and Australia also contributed to the regions' growth in the quarter, with especially strong performance of our Intra business in the Philippines. For the overall C2C business, the spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was seven percentage points, excluding the impact of currency, which had a negative two point impact. Consistent with the first half of 2010, the factors affecting the currency-adjusted spread included the domestic money transfer repositioning, international pricing and mix.
Domestic money transfer contributed four points of the transaction-to-revenue spread as a result of both pricing and mix. As we begin to anniversary the domestic repositioning in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the C2C transaction revenue spread will narrow, although we believe the $5 price point will still be an important growth driver going forward.
Moving to the Global Business Payments segment. Revenue increased 5% or declined 7%, excluding business solutions, consistent with our expectations. While the U.S. business continued to be challenged, particularly by the mortgage market, Banco Brasil in South America had another solid quarter. The integration of the Bill Payment business under the direction of Stewart Stockdale in the Americas region continues, and our objective is to gain revenue and cost efficiencies over time.
Western Union business solution revenues were strong at $27 million and remain on track for double-digit revenue growth this year. As a reminder, we acquired Custom House in September of 2009, so there was one month of revenue or $8 million in our third quarter results a year ago.
Turning to our margins. Third quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 26%. Excluding restructuring charges, the consolidated operating margin was 27%. We recorded $14 million of restructuring expenses in the quarter related to our May 27 announcement. Approximately $5 million of the charges is including cost of services, and $9 million is in SG&A. These amounts are not included in our segment operating results. 
For purposes of year-over-year comparisons, the third quarter of 2009 included a $71 million expense accrual related to the settlement with Arizona and several other states. To simplify operational comparisons, I will exclude both the 2010 restructuring charge and the 2009 settlement accrual from my margin commentary.
The operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, improved approximately 70 basis points from the third quarter of last year and 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, increased costs related to business solution investment spending and acquisition-related amortization were offset by lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies. 
Third quarter earnings per share were $0.36 or $0.37, excluding restructuring expenses. On a constant-currency basis, EPS was $0.01 higher or $0.38 excluding restructuring. This compares to GAAP EPS of $0.26 in the third quarter of last year or $0.33 excluding the settlement accrual. 
Our C2C segment operating margin was 30%, an increase of 230 basis points over the same period last year. The margin increase was primarily due to lower marketing, operating efficiencies and currency. Segment margin increased 80 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Global Business Payments operating margin of 15% included the Custom House intangible amortization expense and investment spending for future growth. Excluding Business Solutions, segment margin of 23% was down from 26% in the third quarter last year, driven by lower U.S. Bill Payments revenue. 
Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong. In the quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $384 million, while capital expenditures were $44 million. We repurchased 6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $16.15 per share for a total of $98 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $514 million to repurchase 32 million shares or 5% of the total shares outstanding at an average price of $16.23. As of September 30, we had $486 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization.
In the quarter, we also declared another $0.06 per share dividend, for which $39 million was paid on October 14. At quarter end, the company had total debt of $3.3 billion, and cash of $2 billion, of which approximately $900 million of cash was outside the United States. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $710 million and includes the impact of the $250 million refundable tax deposit that we made with the IRS in the first quarter.
Turning to our full year 2010 outlook. As Hikmet mentioned, we are increasing our earnings per share range for the year. Our C2C margins have been strong, our tax rate has improved, and we expect constant-currency revenues will be closer to the higher end of the previous range. The recent strengthening of the euro should aid GAAP revenues in the fourth quarter, although the impact on earnings will be lower due to our hedging programs.  As a result of the hedges, the strengthening of the euro will likely have a negative impact on fourth quarter operating margin. 
We plan to invest in the business in the fourth quarter to aid future growth, including incremental marketing spending and other strategic investments. The additional marketing spend will include investments in loyalty programs and general holiday advertising and promotion. We expect our marketing percentage, which was slightly below 4% of revenue, for the first nine months of 2010 to be around 5% in the fourth quarter, although for the full year, we should still be at approximately 4%.
We continue to expect our full year operating margin, excluding restructuring, to be between 26% and 26.5%. Including restructuring charges, we expect GAAP operating margins in the range of 24.5% to 25%. The full year tax rate, excluding the restructuring charge, is projected to be between 22% and 23%. Year-to-date through September, our tax rate, excluding restructuring, was approximately 23%. We expect the fourth quarter rate to benefit from onetime adjustments and certain favorable resolutions. We do not expect these benefits to affect the 2011 tax rate. Including the impact of restructuring, the outlook for the GAAP tax rate for the year would be between 21.5% and 22.5%. 
Given all these factors, our updated outlook for full year 2010 is: GAAP revenue growth in the range of plus 1% to plus 2%; constant-currency revenue growth, one point higher than GAAP or plus 2% to plus 3%; GAAP EPS of $1.29 to $1.32, including $0.07 of restructuring charges; EPS of $1.36 to $1.39, excluding restructuring; and constant-currency EPS, $0.01 higher.
We now expect GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $900 million to $1 billion, including the $250 million reduction in the first quarter refundable tax deposit. Capital expenditures are projected at 2% to 3% of revenue. We continue to expect the majority of the $80 million in restructuring charges announced in May to occur in 2010, with approximately $10 million of related savings this year.
In summary, we are pleased with the improving trends in our business. We have raised our EPS outlook, excluding restructuring, up from their previous outlook of $1.31 to $1.36 to our current outlook of $1.36 to $1.39. We will continue to balance margin enhancement with investments for future growth and believe we have the opportunities for both over the long term.
That concludes our prepared comments for the quarter. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike."

In some markets, we are building the brand name, and it's a market where we are investing. The interesting thing on APAC is also not only an inbound opportunity like in Philippines or China, but we also see intra-region within APAC: outbound and corridor building, inbound and outbound activities.

It takes some time to sell, it takes some time for that business to convert, but we've got to push hard on the top line to get that top line going north and not south, if you will. But also equally as important is looking at operating efficiencies or synergies and combining, if you will, those two organizations, so we create better leverage as we move forward. And then I'd just say, broadly, too, just, Pago Facil is doing well. It's a smaller piece of the business. But what's important for our business model in that area is product diversification, geographic diversification, and Custom House will play an element of that.

In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan’s on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted revenues, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website as it contains detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of our actual 2010 and 2009 third quarter results, including the allocation of each reconciled line item to specific income statement line items.

Welcome, everyone and thank you for taking the time to join us this afternoon. I would also like to welcome all of the Mylan employees on the call today, especially those from Bioniche Pharma, who are listening as the new members of the Mylan family. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our leadership team, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your continued hard work, dedication and outstanding performance.
I am extremely pleased to report to you yet another strong quarter performance of exceptional earnings. As I mentioned on the last conference call, I did anticipate the third quarter to be better than the second quarter, and I am extremely pleased to report adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43, a 16% increase from our second quarter results. With that said, I still expect at this time that the fourth quarter will come in slightly better than the third quarter.
We maintain this position even with the most recent ruling related to our Paroxetine CR. While we are extremely disappointed with the lower court's ruling, we believe strongly that the lower court has erred in its decision not to grant us an injunction, and we have appealed that decision. It should also be noted that this is still just a ruling on an injunction. It is not a final decision resolving Mylan's rights on this matter. Regardless of the outcome of the appellant court decision on the injunction, we will continue our litigation to enforce our contractual rights and all of its negotiated provisions with GSK.
With that said, and irrespective of this short-term distraction, the longer-term fundamentals of our business have not changed, which is why we remain committed to our stated targets of $2 of adjusted diluted earnings per share for calendar year 2011 and our longer-term growth targets of 15% top line and 20% bottom line CAGR by the end of 2013. We very much look forward to providing you a detailed breakdown of our 2011 guidance on our next conference call.
Moving on to other activity in the quarter. You will recall that we issued $300 million in follow-on 10-year bonds to finance the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma. In addition, we are also able to use part of the strong operating cash flows that we continue to generate to prepay $300 million in term loan borrowings in the third quarter as well, further reducing our leverage and staying committed to our stated objective to achieve a 3:1 debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio. 
And finally, you may remember that on November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert to common stock. Given the recent growth and strength of our stock price performance, we anticipate issuing the lowest number of shares required under the terms of the preferred stock agreement, which is approximately 125 million shares. Of further note, November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend, thereby substantially enhancing our future free cash flows to the company by $139 million per year.
I look forward to answering your questions, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Bresch."

As Robert said, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance and a great start to our expected strong second half of 2010. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results",1329,"Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert said, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter performance and a great start to our expected strong second half of 2010. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 2010 results in line with the guidance we have reaffirmed today. We also continue to be extremely confident about our growth prospects for '11 and beyond. I too would like to commend our employees around the world for making our continued exceptional performance possible.
During my remarks today, I'll review our performance by segment, provide an update on synergies and comment on why we remain so confident about our future. I'd now like to walk you through the performance of our commercial operations. During the third quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.36 billion, an increase of 7% compared to last year's third quarter total revenues of $1.26 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up approximately 9% year-over-year, and on the bottom line, we generated $0.43 of adjusted EPS, a 34% increase over last year's third quarter result of $0.32.
We also delivered a strong adjusted gross margin of 48.4% during the third quarter, up from our second quarter performance of 45% and right in line with our full year expected range of 47% to 49%. As expected, driving the strong performance were recent approvals on higher margin, limited competition products, higher sales in our Specialty segment and continued synergy realization.
Within our Generics segment, our North American operations delivered third-party net sales for the third quarter of $573 million, up 17% from last year's third quarter result of $488 million. The increase was mainly the result of new product launches in the United States. Among those launches were limited competition products, Minocycline ER, Clonidine Transdermal, and Tacrolimus, bringing to ten the dozen such products we anticipate launching by year end, and we remain on track to achieve our full year target of 50 to 60 launches in the U.S.
Our third quarter also includes results from Bioniche, a Specialty Injectables business we acquired on September 7. The integration has been seamless so far, and on October 4, we announced our first approval from the FDA for our Bioniche product, Fludarabine, an injectable chemotherapy medication for leukemia. Our ANDA filings now include those of Bioniche Pharma. Currently, we have 153 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing about $95 billion in annual brand sales. 45 of these pending ANDAs are potential first-to-file opportunities, representing more than $24 billion in annual branded sales. 
In EMEA, third-party net sales of $364 million fell 12% versus last year's third quarter third-party sales of $414 million. However, on a constant currency basis, operational performance in EMEA declined only 3% year-over-year while year-to-date, sales have risen almost 2%. That result was driven by unfavorable pricing throughout Europe, which was partially offset by new product launches in several markets. 
Looking forward, we continue to see our ability to even further offset negative trends in the region, thanks to the sheer number of internal products we expect to launch in 2011 and beyond. In addition, we continue to repatriate finished dosage forms, which will continue to add to our competitive position throughout Europe. 
In France, third quarter local currency sales rose compared to the year-ago quarter. New product launches and higher volumes on existing products more than offset ongoing competitive pricing pressures. With more than 30% market share, our market leadership position remains very strong in France, which drives our performance in Europe.
We also experienced higher year-over-year third quarter local currency sales in Italy, where we benefited from a combination of new product launches, higher generic penetration and the continued favorable effects of regulatory changes. And in Spain, our new product launches offset the impact of government-posed price reduction.
Other markets such as Portugal and Germany experienced lower sales during the third quarter due to government-imposed price reductions and the impact of tender systems, respectively.
Turning now to our Asia Pacific region. We delivered very strong third quarter results. Third-party net sales were $268 million, up 30% over last year's third quarter sales on $206 million. On a constant currency basis, sales rose about 22%. Matrix, Australia and Japan all contributed to the strong results. Matrix continued to deliver strong double-digit growth through API and ARV sales and our ARV portfolio now contains 33 products.
Finally, Dey, our Specialty segment performed well during the third quarter. Third-party net sales rose 6% to $141 million over the same period last year after adjusting last year's third-party sales to account for the fact that in 2010, our Mylan Pharmaceutical division assumed responsibility for selling Dey's generic products. The primary driver of our growth was domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector, which were strong compared to the third quarter of '09. Recall that last October, we launched our next-generation needle-protected auto-injector, which has been received favorably in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, compared to our second quarter, sales benefited from the seasonal return of children to school. Further, we can continue to experience double-digit growth in many markets outside the U.S. as we continue the expansion opportunities for this very important product, mainly through focusing on an underserved population.
Moving on now to synergies. I'm pleased that we remain on track to deliver more than $350 million in cumulative annual benefit by the end of this year. We continue to seek out and capture additional opportunities to further increase our efficiency and leverage our powerful operating platform. Looking ahead to '11, as Robert stated, we will provide formal guidance for the year on our next conference call. 
Nonetheless, it's important to note and to remind you that we continue to see Mylan entering the new year with very strong momentum, especially as we launch more products around the globe than we have ever launched in our company's history. In 2011, we look forward to monetizing or continuing to monetize several opportunities resulting from prior settlements such as Minocycline ER, voriconazole, letrozole and Venlafaxine ER. We see a number of 30-month stays expiring on other opportunities, some of which are first-to-file. We look forward to introducing oral contraceptives in the U.S., and once again, launching more than a dozen limited competition products. 
Worldwide, we continue to expect to launch approximately 500 products. As important, our pipeline is stronger than ever. We currently have about 1,500 global products submissions pending approval. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to step back and make some observations about our company and how far we've come. Earlier this month, we celebrated the three year anniversary of the union of legacy Mylan, Matrix and Merck. Behind that union was our vision that the world could be served far better if we created a global, vertically integrated and highly disciplined company that could consistently supply any market with high-quality, affordable generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.
Over the past three years, we have focused relentlessly on executing on our vision by integrating vertically, delivering synergies far beyond our expectations and serving customers in more than 140 countries and territories. Those accomplishments alone allowed us to meet or exceed Street [Wall Street] estimates for 13 consecutive quarters. 
But that's not all we've been doing for the last three years. We've also been filling our global network with internally supplied products by applying the same methodology and fundamentals that made our integration so successful. Among the actions we've been taking, optimizing R&D, enhancing our portfolio and management capabilities, repatriating products and filling gaps in our product line, we also have created a biologic strategy and strengthening the promising future of our Specialty business, Dey. And perhaps most important, we have filed approximately 3,000 applications globally by the end of this year. Now, we're ready to reap what we've sown. That is why we're so confident about our growth over the next three years and beyond. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John."

This afternoon, I will begin by walking you through our third quarter 2010 financial results, which, as Heather and Robert have both indicated, were exceptional. I will then provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.
As Kris mentioned earlier, I'm going to be referring to actual and projected financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they're prepared on the same basis as used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our business. This afternoon's earnings release includes a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for our third quarter 2010 and 2009 results. Our earnings release is available on our website, and I encourage you to take a look at it.
Starting at the top of the income statement. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.36 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's third quarter total revenues of $1.26 billion. The effect of foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our third quarter revenues, reflecting a weaker euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of other currencies, primarily the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar.
During the third quarter, we launched Minocycline ER. As I discussed with you on last quarter's call, because of significant uncertainties surrounding the pricing and market conditions with respect to Minocycline, we are not able to reasonably estimate the magnitude of potential price adjustments, including product returns, and as a result, have deferred revenue recognition until such uncertainties are resolved. At this time, we consider such uncertainties to be resolved upon the sale by our customers of the product and have recognized revenue accordingly.
Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was approximately 48.4% compared to 46% in the prior year. As expected, this adjusted gross margin is an improvement from that of the first and second quarters and is within our full year guidance range of 47% to 49% and is primarily the result of new product launches in North America and favorable pricing on our Specialty segment, EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Adjusted R&D expense for the quarter was $69 million or approximately 5% of revenues. Also as expected, this level of spending represents an increase over the first half of 2010 and is in line with our revised full-year guidance range of 5% to 6% of revenues. Importantly, our R&D projects remained on target, and we are planning for even higher levels of spending in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted SG&A expense was $257 million for the quarter or 19% of revenues, within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%, and our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $368 million.
Now let me move to a couple of non-operating financial metrics. Third quarter 2010 adjusted interest expense was $70 million. We continue to forecast adjusted interest expense for the year to be at or near the low end of our guidance range of $280 million to $300 million, which continues to consider the potential for higher short-term interest rates. Our third quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 26%, which translates into a year-to-date and full year projected adjusted effective income tax rate of 28%, which is at the low end of our forecasted range of 28% to 29%. We do fully anticipate this full year effective tax rate to be sustainable going forward. In summary, third quarter adjusted net income was $189 million or $0.43 per share.
In calculating our adjusted diluted EPS, the impact of assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million common shares was more dilutive than the $35 million quarterly preferred dividend. Therefore, adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter is calculated based on an average outstanding diluted share count of approximately 438 million shares.
Touching briefly on the year-to-date results, and again, please refer to our earnings release for a complete reconciliation from our GAAP to our non-GAAP financial measures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, total revenues were $4.02 billion, an increase of 8% over adjusted revenues of $3.71 billion in the same prior year period. For the nine months, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on revenues of approximately 1% due mainly to the strengthening of the rupee, yen, and Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker euro.
Adjusted gross margin for the nine months was approximately 46% compared to 47% in the same prior year period. The lower gross margin in the current year is the result of a loss of exclusivity on divalproex during the third quarter of 2009. However, the current year gross margin was negatively impacted by certain inventory charges, principally in Q2. Excluding the impacts of these inventory charges, year-to-date gross margin would have approached 47%. We continue to see full year gross margin at the low end of our 47% to 49% guidance range. 
Adjusted R&D expense was $195 million, and adjusted SG&A expense was $753 million for the current nine-month period. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2010 was $1.03 billion. Adjusted net income was $511 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.16 per share.
As in the previous quarter, adjusted diluted EPS was calculated assuming the conversion of our preferred shares into 125 million shares of common stock. On November 15 of this year, our mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock. The number of convertible shares will be based upon the closing stock price over the 20-day trading period ending on November 12. Based on the current stock price, we expect that approximately 125 million shares will be the conversion amount. 
As mentioned before, we have been including this preferred stock conversion in our forecasted results. As such, the actual conversion will not result in an additional dilution to our guidance amounts. November 15 will also mark the final payment of the preferred stock dividend. 
Depending on the market value of our common stock going forward, our average outstanding diluted share count could increase further due to additional dilution from stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments such as our convertible debt obligations and related warrants. We also include such potential dilution in our forecasted results. 
As I mentioned previously, the impact of foreign exchange translation on our results was not significant, and actual foreign currency exchange rates during the period ended September 30, 2010, did not differ materially from those used to calculate our 2010 guidance, which we discussed with you last quarter.
More recently, we have seen the euro strengthen steadily against the U.S. dollar. However, we do not expect currency to have a significant impact on our results for the remainder of the year. This is due to the fact that the currencies of other markets in which we operate are moving in the opposite direction of the euro, and it's also a result of various hedging strategies that we've employed.
We've taken measures in an effort to prevent our results from being impacted significantly by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition to having on our balance sheet euro-denominated long-term debt against which the cash flows of our euro-denominated subsidiaries are offset, we use financial instruments such as forward contracts in order to mitigate this risk. Any favorable or unfavorable variances resulting from foreign exchange for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, are included in the adjusted diluted per-share amount of $0.43 and $1.16 per share, respectively.
Turning to our cash flow metrics. Our third quarter GAAP cash flow from operations was nearly $380 million, the highest in our company's history or $360 million excluding certain items. While we don't anticipate fourth quarter cash flow from operations to approach this level, we do continue to project full year operating cash flow in the range of $725 million to $825 million excluding certain one-off items.
Our strong current quarter cash from operations was made possible through positive changes in our working capital, primarily accounts receivable as a result in improved cash collections, including amounts received with respect to Minocycline. As you may recall, on last quarter's call, I indicated that Q2 cash from operations were negatively impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received in early July. Q3 cash from operations was also impacted by the timing of collection of receivables, for which a substantial amount was received prior to September 30, 2010. 
Third quarter capital spending was $53 million, including approximately $10 million paid toward the acquisition of a finished dose manufacturing facility in India. Based on the anticipated timing of spending on certain projects, we now project capital spending in the range of $200 million to $250 million for the full year. Our current quarter also included a cash outflow of approximately $544 million with respect to our acquisition of Bioniche Pharma, which is net of any cash acquired. As Heather mentioned, results of Bioniche are included in our current quarter results from September 7.
The Bioniche acquisition was financed through a combination of cash-on-hand and the proceeds from recent notes offerings. As discussed last quarter, in May, we completed a private placement of $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and 2020. In the current quarter, we completed an add-on offering of an additional $300 million of the 2020 notes. These notes were issued at initial price of 105.5% and a coupon of 7 7/8% or an effective yield to maturity of slightly over 7%.
The notes issued in the current quarter's offering, together with the 2020 notes from the May offering, are treated as a single class of notes under the indenture. In addition to funding the Bioniche acquisition, the bond issuances were done in accordance with our objective of extending the maturity profile of our outstanding indebtedness. $1 billion of the net proceeds from the May issuance were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our credit facility. In late September, we used our strong operating cash to repay an additional $300 million of existing indebtedness under our credit facility. As a result of these repayments, we continue to have no meaningful long-term debt maturities until the $600 million due under our convertible notes in the first quarter of 2012, which we currently intend to repay with available cash at that time.
At September 30, 2010, following the additional debt repayment of $300 million, we continue to have unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling over $640 million.
Continuing on with the capital structure, concerning leverage. As Robert has stated many times, it is our commitment to achieve a long-term leverage ratio of 3:1 or less. We are firmly committed to balancing growth in our business through the continued use of prudent and responsible financing. As such, Mylan remains committed to de-leveraging over time to meet this long-term capital structure goal. We continue to expect to generate approximately $4 billion of cumulative operating cash flows by the end of 2013.
From a covenant perspective, the level of our senior secured debt is approximately 1.7x our last 12 month covenant basis adjusted EBITDA, comfortably ahead of our December 31, 2010 threshold of 3.5x. In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid quarterly performance. A great start to what we've been saying will be a strong second half of 2010. 
That concludes my remarks. Lisa, I'll turn the call back over to you to start the Q&A."

First, again, there are many, many mitigating factors, and it's difficult, I understand from your perspective, not to be able to evaluate the number of moving variables. But let's start with EMEA. I said that this would be a basically almost a two-bucket approach. I've been telling you all along that we continue to see what we've anticipated, what the governments are doing over there in terms of pricing and pushing prices down lower. But we've often said that we felt very comfortable with our position to be able to mitigate that by all the other initiatives that we have in place, including, I'll pull a knot, cost infrastructure that really doesn't fit with the new system, the new wave of direction where Europe is going. Our cost of goods, our repatriation, our bringing in a lot of the third parties back in-house, and of course, our increase in volumes. So that's kind of sort of -- and the races in Europe, Randall, the races, again, what I've always stated, the speed at which governments move and the speed at which we can, through a regulatory process, be able to yield all the benefits that we've been telling you all along. And in terms of the Paxil CR, we are in litigation. It's been a long-standing position of ours, and not to comment when we are in litigation. I tried to give you a signal, obviously, in our opening remarks about how I feel as a whole about that whole situation. We're extremely confident in our position. We think there's a lot more involved in terms of the dealings between GSK and Apotex, and it wasn't just a one-off type of situation. And that's what litigation is all about, and I'm very confident that we'll prevail once we have an opportunity to get inside. In terms of the $2, the last piece of your question, look, all these factors have -- there's nothing really new. There's just nothing new in terms of what we've thought about, what we've been trying to anticipate. And the best way I can explain to you on the $2 on why we're still confident is actually for two reasons. One, Randall, the fundamentals, the long-term fundamentals of the company have not changed at all. At all. Basically, what we're dealing with is the short-term issues that we have to just continue to manage or work our way through. And what I would bring to your attention is go back for the last 13 quarters where we have been trying the same exact questions that we're faced with today about visibility in 2011 and beyond. When we were in 2007 roughly at $0.45 and then $0.80 in 2008 and $1.30 in 2009 and roughly a midpoint of $1.60 in 2010, nobody understood how we were going to get there. And what I can tell you, and what we have done already is this management team promised that it would manage. It would manage this new acquired platform for earnings growth. And I can tell you that when we were back at $0.45 and $0.80 and $1.30 and $1.60 in terms of our respective midpoints, when we started out that guidance and where we thought those earnings per share were going to come from and where they actually came from are not always exactly the same. That's just the nature of our business. So I can assure you that when we once again I think we have become at least somewhat predictable to all of you guys. If we tell you that our vision is in the balancing act, what we can see the number of variables versus what you may not be able to see, we are very comfortable that the $2 target in calendar year 2011 is achievable."

In a generic company, one can never project that a generic product forever will be in your product without competition. So obviously, it's a timing issue.

I believe that, that is one market that will go from a seller's market to a buyer's market. That is one region, I believe, that the multiples ought to contract. And my rationale is that I think what all of Europe is experiencing is the more regional companies, the more local companies, it's very, very difficult as Europe moves in direction of some of the other markets around the world to be able to compete if you don't have scale. And without scale, again, that cost competitiveness, they're going to feel it. And I think that some of these mom-and-pop companies, these local companies, these regional companies begin to realize that the writing is on the wall. I think it will force them indirectly towards more activity. And I think as the more activity percolates, I think the supply-demand curve will kick in, and when there's more supply than there is demand, I think that you'll see multiples come down. So I do see more consolidation. I do think it's extremely healthy over in Europe to bring more capacity out of the market, and I do think that scale will prevail. Heather?"

I think we're starting to see that in Italy and Spain, as well as France. France, obviously, to me, is kind of the most mature in that Southern European region. And I see Italy and Spain kind of starting to follow suit as far as some incentives and increasing. And we've seen an increase in penetration in both of those markets. And look, I can assure you, will not stop our efforts of being out there educating and showing the sustainability of generic penetration versus just, like I said, the price cuts. And I think the other point to note here is the responsibility that we have seen and demonstrate between looking at the entire supply chain and not just the generic manufacturer, whether it's from the pharmacy perspective, the brand arena. So it's balancing both of those fronts."

Second question is maybe you can give us a sense of what happened in the quarter in Asia, just Australia versus Japan versus India? Just so we have a little more flavor there. Then the third question is just talk about EpiPen in the quarter. Was there growth year-over-year in EpiPen? It seemed a little weaker than what I thought it was going to be."

Yes, we saw, we definitely saw growth in EpiPen, both in volume as well as we had pricing in the year, but we certainly have seen some market expansion seeing the -- we saw the peak start a little earlier and last a little bit longer in the seasonality of that product. So we continue, as I said, to see our efforts around awareness to continue to help in that expansion. As far as Europe's concerned, obviously, as we continue to say, France is certainly the driver for us across the European region. As I noted this quarter, our sales were up year-over-year for France as well as Italy and Spain, and we continue to see those being contributors as well in this growth for Q4 both year-over-year and sequentially. As far as APAC is concerned, Matrix, while we don't break out the individual divisions within a segment, we have continued and will continue to at least give what the leaders are and Matrix has led that with double-digit growth from the APAC region, but we did have contribution both from Australia as well as Japan year-over-year."

It doesn't really look like it's a mix issue given that North America and Specialty were relatively the same percentage of sales. Also, so it's not really a volume issue. So is it fair to say that the bulk, if not the entire degree of improvement sequentially, is attributable to synergies?"

Look, I'd say certainly, as we forecasted and anticipated, synergy realization was going to be stronger in the second half of the year, but I wouldn't lose total sight on mix. We had important approvals of higher margin products as limited competition, like in clonidine, like in Minocycline and Tacrolimus so there is still -- you do have mix issues, which is why you have to look at the annual, the overall gross margin and the guidance, obviously, that we have out there."

With respect to the company's current capital structure and the duration of the debt obligations, sort of understand that you have quite a bit of financial flexibility through your first bolus payment in 2012, a little -- about $700 million in total. But if you look out to 2014, there's roughly a $2 billion bullet that's due, and that just happens to coincide with I guess sort of a large systemic increase in overall debt obligations coming due in the U.S. And given the likelihood that there's going to be a lot of folks looking to refinance debt and also the fact that short-term interest rates probably are going to be a lot higher than where they are now, just sort of how should we be thinking about maybe potential addition what it means on your part to maybe flatten out the maturity ladder or even extend it further, which you've already done?"

And over the course of this year, we've reduced that by $1.3 billion. So we have flattened out the 2014 maturity significantly. We will continue to look to extend the maturity profile at appropriate points in time. We'll use our strong positive cash flow to continue to reduce the amount of the 2014 as we did here in the third quarter by repaying $300 million. So I actually feel really good about where we stand in the capital structure. Our free cash flow is over $500 million a year with the final preferred dividend that we're making here in the fourth quarter. That will increase our free cash flow by $139 million a year. So I see us with a lot of cash. Robert has talked about the fact that we're not looking to make another strategic acquisition. We're fully committed to reducing our leverage to 3:1 or lower."

So you can see, and as a matter fact, when we first prepaid the $1 billion, I think what we said at the time we felt fairly comfortable at that time that we would generate enough operating cash flow actually to retire the debt itself. So taking the need for this organization to have to tap the market was exactly what we intended not to put ourselves in. So I feel very comfortable that we will continue to generate very strong free cash flows with the continued commitment to de-lever, but I will say at the same time I'm saying that, I wouldn't hesitate in a second to further extend those maturities if the opportunity arises and interest rates continue to be as advantageous as they are and simply give ourselves even more flexibility than what we've already provided ourselves."
