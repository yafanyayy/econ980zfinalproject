I would like to welcome each of you to Marathon Oil Corporation's fourth quarter 2009 earnings web-cast and teleconference.

On the call today are Clarence Cazalot  President and CEO, Janet Clark Executive Vice President and CFO, Gary Heminger Executive Vice President Downstream,  David Roberts Executive Vice President Upstream and Gary Piper, Senior Vice President of Finance and Commercial Services Downstream.  
Slide two contains the forward looking statements and other information related to this presentation.  Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.  In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Privacy and Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st 2008 and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements.
In the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income by quarter for 2008 and 2009.  Preliminary balance sheet information, first quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful.  
Moving onto slide three.  During the fourth quarter out adjusted net income was weaker than the corresponding quarter in 2008.  A significant contributor to this reduction was an almost $280 million swing in the foreign exchange on deferred income tax balances, largely in Canada.  For the fourth quarter 2009, we incurred a $139 million loss while in the same quarter of 2008 we recorded a $138 million gain.  While this is a number rarely if ever taken into account in analysts' estimates, I'd like to take this opportunity to point out that our adjusted net income would have been at the first call analyst average estimate if not for this non-cash swing in deferred tax balances.  And we expect to make a one-time election during the first half of 2010 to begin paying Canadian income tax in U.S. dollars and thus eliminate the largest portion of these fluctuations.
Moving to slide four, and looking at key drivers to the year over year decrease in adjusted net income, we had a significant decrease in our RM&T segment income, driven by weaker refining and wholesale marketing margins as well as weaker retail margins, and lower earnings from our Oil Sands Mining segment.
These unfavorable effects were partially offset by an increase in E&P earnings and the result of a 3% increase in sales volumes and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower natural gas prices  during the quarter.  While about half of the $570 million negative variance from income taxes was a result of the previously discussed affect impact, the other half of the variance was largely the result of adjustments made at the end of 2008 while the year end 2009 adjustments, other than affects were relatively small.
Moving to slide five, the key drivers to the year over year decrease in adjusted net income included significantly lower average realizations in our Upstream businesses and much lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margins in Downstream.  On the positive side, we ran very well across all businesses posting significant increases in safety and reliability.  This helped drive a top-tier increase in E&P production volume sales of 8%  and a mechanical reliability of our refineries of 96.7% based on internal metrics.
Additionally our focus on cost controls resulted in a full year reduction in E&P operating costs per BOE of 15% excluding production taxes and DD&A.  While we also reduced operating cost in the Downstream business, by approximately 9% excluding changes in crude and product purchases depreciation energy prices and certain other variable expenses.
As shown on slide six, E&P segment income for the fourth quarter decreased 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009, largely due to higher income taxes and higher geological and geophysical seismic expenses.  The negative impacts were largely offset by quarter over quarter increases in both price realizations and sales volumes.  
Slide seven shows the average E&P realizations as well as market indicators.  Our average E&P realization per BOE increased $5.(inaudible) quarter over quarter while the same period nine mixed prompt wti (ph) increased $7.89 per barrel.  In the bid week, natural gas prices increased $0.77 per million BTU's.  
E&P production volumes are shown on slide eight.  Fourth quarter compared to the third quarter production sold increased 13% to 413,000 BOE per day, while production available for sale increased 3% from the third quarter 2009 and 4% from the fourth quarter 2008.  The higher sales volume versus available for sale volume was the result of an over-lift of approximately 900,000 BOE for the quarter.  We ended the year with a to-date under-lift position of 3.3 million BOE consisting of 2.6 million BOE of gas storage in Alaska, an under-lift position in EG of about 500,000 barrels and approximately 200,000 under-lift in Norway.
Slide nine shows the trend over the last eight quarters for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses per BOE.  While field level controllable costs were relatively flat on a per BOE basis for the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter, exploration expense increased to $3.30 per BOE primarily as a result of geological and geophysical expenses incurred worldwide.  
Turning to slide ten, compared to the prior quarter, fourth quarter E&P earnings per BOE decreased to $11.55 largely as a result of the higher exploration expense just discussed and higher international taxes partially offset by higher commodity prices that lowered domestic DD&A excluding exploration expense and DD&A, total cost BOE were relatively flat at $9.90.
Turning to slide eleven and Oil Sand Mining, fourth quarter segment income increased over 60% over the fourth quarter of - sorry from the third quarter to $41 million.  The increase reflects positive price and volume gains partially offset by higher expenses.  Production for the quarter was 26,000 barrels per day.  
 
Turning to slide twelve and Integrated Gas, fourth quarter segment income almost tripled compared to the third quarter on stronger LNG prices, while higher LNG volumes and stronger methanol prices also contributed to the increase.  
As noted on slide thirteen, and previously discussed 2009 was a strong operational year for the Upstream businesses.  Production available for sale was up 9% for the year to 405,000 BOE per day.  We exited the year with over 11,000 net BOE per day of production from the Bodkin (ph) and an increase of almost 40% from the 2008 exit rate and we achieved first oil at Boolin (ph) ahead of schedule.  
We announced a number of discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, Norway and Angola and added additional 
licenses in Poland and Canada.  The Upstream business also benefited from high operational reliability at the company operated facilities, and we completed a number of dispositions and announced the sale of 20% interest in Angola block 32, leaving us with a 10% interest in both blocks 31 and 32.  
Moving to our Downstream business, as noted on slide fourteen RM&T's fourth quarter 2009 segment loss totaled $18 million compared to segment income of $325 million in the same quarter last year.  Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business I will compare our fourth quarter 2009 results against the same quarter of 2008.  
Our average wholesale price realizations increased substantially less than the increase in the market refined product prices used in the market based LLS 6321 crack spread calculation in the fourth quarter 2009 versus the same quarter in 2008.  The primary reason for this lower increase was due to the fact that in the fourth quarter 2008 we benefited from the approximately $55 per barrel drop in the price of crude oil during that quarter, versus the fourth quarter of 2009 when crude oil prices increased by approximately $10 per barrel.  Partially offsetting the negative effects, our actual crude oil and other (inaudible) cost increases were slightly lower than the change in the average price of LLS during the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reason for this benefit was the fact that the market was in (inaudible).  
Also manufacturing and other expenses were lower in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower energy and lower turnaround costs.   Total refinery crude oil through-put (ph) averaged 999,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to 952,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year.  Total through-puts were 1,191,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2009 as compared to 1,177,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2008.  
Speedway SuperAmerica's refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $45 million lower in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to 2008.  The majority of this decrease was due to lower gasoline and distill margins which decreased about $0.08 per gallon quarter to quarter.   We did however achieve a 10% quarter to quarter increase in SSA's same store merchandise sales, while same store gasoline volume decreased 2% quarter to quarter.  We estimate demand in SSA's primary market area also decreased by about 2% quarter to quarter. 
Slide fifteen provides historical performance indicators for the downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6321 crack spread.  
Slide sixteen provides preliminary analysis of cash flows for 2009.  Operating cash flow for continuing operations before changes in working capital was $4.8 billion and our cash balance increased by $411 million as a result of working capital changes from continuing operations.  Cash capital expenditures for 2009 were $6.2 billion and we issued $1.5 billion in debt and paid dividends total $679 million and generated proceeds from assets disposed of in the amount of $865 million, and I remind you that the previously discussed $1.3 billion Angola sale is expected to close in the near future and thus is not reflected in last year's cash flows.  
Our year end 2009 cash balance increased by almost $800 million from the balance of year end 2008 to just over $2 billion.  Slide seventeen provides a summary of select financial data.  At the end of the fourth quarter 2009 our cash adjusted debt to total capital ratio was 23% a decrease of two percentage points from the third quarter and as a reminder this debt includes approximately 340 million serviced by U.S. Steel.  
Slide eighteen sets out Marathon's priorities for the year 2010 and while I won't go through the entire list, I would note that we will focus on upstream growth through an increased resource placed footprint and increased exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and Indonesia, along with ramping up production in the  Athabasca Oil Sands project.  
Our RM&T program which is less than half of last year's capital spending for that segment had about 22% of our company wide $5.1 billion 2010 projection includes progressing construction on the Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade facility which is approximately 30% complete.  After extensive turnaround of the base Garyville refinery in the first quarter we anticipate the combined 436,000 barrel per day refinery will turn into a significant cash and earnings contributor starting in the second quarter.  
We also will continue to focus on maintaining financial strength and will link capital spending with cash flow.  In support of that position and turning to slide nineteen, you will find details of the derivative positions we've entered which are designed to manage price rift on anticipated liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and  synthetic crude sales in 2010.  The derivative positions relate to approximately 40% of domestic natural gas sales in the lower 48 and nearly 80% of synthetic crude sales in Canada for the full year of 2010.  Additionally positions taken for only the first half of 2010 relate to approximately 20% of full year crude sales in the U.S. and Norway.  These derivative positions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
We will now open this call to questions.  But please to accommodate all who want to ask questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow up and you may re-prompt for additional questions if time permits.  With that Jeff, I'll give it back to you.

Excluding wall sands (ph) we may pose (inaudible) at about 48%.  I think importantly if you just looked at the liquid hydro carbon side, which is what we invested in on this past year.  That number is close to 95%.  So we took a lot of lumps from the gas side, both in terms of price change revisions and really some of our operating costs in terms of not investing heavily in gases we have in the future.
I think what we’re looking at, Paul, is one of the reasons that we said that we’re going to start focusing on the unconventionally.  We believe we’ve reached a point where that is going to make some sense.  And you’re going to see us exposing more dollars to that.  And I do believe that what we talked about is we have a lot of resource potential.  And the exposure that we have in the unconventional.  And we’re looking for that to be the driver reserves, certainly over the short term.

One of the things that we had said in our presentation is we (inaudible) the well in our Haynesville position.  We believe our efforts in the Haynesville there while a small number certainly, is in the developing fairway in Shelby County.  And I think you’ll see us do two, possible three wells on that acreage.  Again, we’re going to be very judicious as we watch gas price.  Because we’re a little bit concerned about that 
And we’ve got four wells down in the Marcel.  We’ll drill probably a dozen more this year.  We got our first crack away.  And we’re looking at well casts.  And I think you’ll see us pursue that play very similar to how we did the Bach, in terms of being measured, getting our technical data before we get serious about it.  
But early indications are in terms of what we’ve seen from the jobs, we like it.  We have 70,000 acres there and I think we’ll continue to play against that.  So we feel very good about where we are.  
I guess the third one that we talked about is Afadafa (ph) Woodford, or what’s commonly be known as the (inaudible) now in the western part of Oklahoma.  We’ll drill again probably a dozen wells there during the course of this year.  We’ve got our best well to date just completed a little bit over 10 million cubic feet a day.  A well that we have substantial interest in.  So that probably will look like it’s going to continue with that up.  
So as we suggested, we think we have some pretty good exposure and believe that it may be time to move forward in a lot of these plays.  But again, we’ll do it in a way that’s consistent with the current market economics.
Offhand, I think what we would say, and certainly very respectful of Shell (inaudible) what we would say is they’re not herbalizing (ph) what we’ve been saying for some time about this play.  So we’re very happy with the position that we have in Afadafa.  There’s very few fields that we’re aware of that are certainly within the control of western ICs that as this one could produce - pick a figure between 750,000 and a million barrels a day.  But we believe that those future expansions have to be done in an efficient manner.  And we also believe that one of the strengths of partnership between American and Shell and Chevron is the ability to apply technology there to further enhance the economics.
So the rhetoric out of Shell in terms of making sure that we’re making the right investment we’ve choice, we could do very consistent with what we said about let’s utilize the existing capacity to its fullest.  The micro expansion concept.  Let’s improve the reliability, let’s log the economics away, three world class companies like ours should be.  We don’t consider that to be out of the frame of what we’ve been talking about.  This is (inaudible) at all.
The last question Indonesia will drill two wells this year.  The expiration rate that we contracted is product consortium is - soon to be delivered.  We’ll drill our first well probably in April and the second towards the latter part of the year.

And our numbers, we were just under $6 for 2009, looking at a whole basket of crudes versus twice that in 2008.  And your question looking out when do we think that they will widen back out?  Our belief is it’s all depending on diesel demand.  As diesel demand increases around the world, is when you will see (inaudible) desalt to resist spread widen out.  And with that you will have more medium to heavy crudes come back on the market.  More competition for those crudes.  And you should start to see the differential widen out.
We’ve had in the fourth quarter looking at the American Trucking Association, looking at some railroad loadings, you’re starting to see some pick up in diesel.  Our last couple of weeks then it got a little bit soft.  But it all depends on where you are in the regions of the country.  We do expect that as the economy starts to restock we expect to see that more than likely in the second half of the year.  But I say, we believe we’ve hit the allure on the client and diesel demand and are starting to see some improvement.
As far as Detroit, again, your right on target that we’re looking at the Detroit project clearly as a lower feedstock cost into the plants.  That’s what’s driving economics.  It’s not an expansion of the refinery, per say.  We’ll have a little bit of expansion.  But it’s really a drive in the cost.
And what you’re seeing right now across the whole Canadian corridor of crudes, is that you’re seeing the Keystone pipeline soon to be starting to have line fill going in somewhere 80,000-90,000 barrels to day.  
Following that, you’ll have Southern Access, with some line fill that is expected.  And it’s going to be a big haul for the first half of this year on the Canadian oil, either being conventional or none conventional to fill up those pipelines.
That’s what some - as Dave just mentioned, the turnaround we have coming at ALSB, some other producers in the marketplace that have had some difficulty and some operational issues.  You’re seeing a pretty strong market for the oil sands, both bitumen and synthetic today. 
We would expect though, as we get those pipelines filled, then is when you’re going to see the producers and those that have put the barrels into the pipeline looking for a home, looking for a refinery for those barrels.
Again, second half of the year.  I’d say starting the third quarter is when you’re going to start to see that Canadian spread start to widen back out.  Which is right in strategy with our Detroit project.

I'd also like to welcome everyone to Marathon Oil Corporation's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Webcast and Teleconference. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathon.com. On the call today are Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Heminger, Executive Vice President, Downstream; Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Garry Peiffer, Senior Vice President of Finance and Commercial Services, Downstream. 
Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Privacy and Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, second quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data you may find useful.
Slide 3 shows the 38% increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter 2009 and 31% increase from the first quarter 2009, as well as its details, by quarter, since 2007. 
Slide 4 shows the components of the 38% increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase from the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher commodity prices and lower income taxes, partially offset by lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and lower E&P production sold. Pretax earnings decreased in the RM&T, Oil Sands Mining and E&P segments. Income taxes decreased as a result of the lower pretax earnings and the adjustment for foreign currency re-measurement of deferred taxes. The fourth quarter included a $139 million loss on the re-measurement of deferred taxes denominated in foreign currency, while the just completed quarter saw a $33 million gain, netting to the $172 million FX swing shown on the waterfall chart. As explained on the February conference call, because we will make a one-time election to begin paying Canadian income tax in U.S. dollars, which is the largest portion of these fluctuations, the amount of FX on these Canadian balances was significantly reduced in the first quarter and will be eliminated after the second quarter. However, we will continue to have the potential for movements related to deferred tax balances other than Canada, but FX fluctuations should be significantly less than those experienced in the past because our deferred tax liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will be much smaller. 
Slide 5 shows the 14% increase in E&P segment income from $439 million in the fourth quarter to $502 million in the first quarter. The largest impacts were the increase in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and lower income taxes, largely offset by reduced sales volumes as a result of an under lift in the UK, turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea and our normal 6% to 8% per-annum production-decline rate. 
Slide 6 shows our historical realizations and the $3.97 per BOE increase in our average realizations from $49.93 per BOE in the fourth quarter to $53.90 per BOE in the first quarter. Our liquid hydrocarbon realizations increased more than the NYMEX prompt WTI price, as about 60% of our global liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes are priced off of Brent, which outperformed WTI during the quarter. 
Neither our E&P nor our Oil Sands Mining realizations include the gains and losses on our hedging position. Included in the E&P results were $51 million of net pretax gain on these E&P hedges, related to 65,000 bpd of crude-oil hedges, which all roll off at the end of June and $110 billion BTU per day, or approximately $110 million cubic feet per day, of natural gas hedges that run through the end of 2010. Complete details of our hedging positions are included in our 10-K.
Slide 7 shows the production. Volumes sold in the first quarter 2010 were down 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 to 361,000 BOE per day, while production available for sale decreased 10% to 364,000 BOE per day, primarily driven by the planned turnaround in Equatorial Guinea. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an under lift for the quarter of approximately 220,000 BOE, again, primarily in the U.K. 
Turning to Slide 8. While field-level controllable costs were slightly lower from the fourth quarter and exploration expense was down, total expenses per BOE, as shown in Slide 9, increased 6.5% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher DD&A for BOE as a result of volume mix. First quarter E&P segment income was $15.42 per BOE, a 34% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, again primarily due to the higher-commodity price realization and lower exploration expense, partially offset by higher DD&A per BOE and other costs. 
Turning to Slide 10 in Oil Sands Mining. The segment loss for the first quarter was $17 million, declining $58 million from the $41 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2009, largely driven by lower sales volumes as a result of the planned turnaround activity. Operating and blendstock costs increased $17 million, reflecting $30 million of turnaround costs incurred in the first quarter and a decrease in other operating and blendstock costs as a result of the lower volumes. 
Marathon's first quarter 2010 net-synthetic crude production, bitumen, after upgrading, excluding blendstocks, from the AOSP mining operation was up to 21,000 barrels per day compared to 26,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Average realizations, which again do not reflect the gain or loss on hedges, increased $5.27 per barrel from their fourth quarter level. First quarter segment income reflected a $10 million pretax loss from derivative activity, which reflects 25,000 bpd of crude oil hedges at $82.56 and it runs through the end of this year.
Turning to Slide 11 and the Integrated Gas segment. First quarter's segment income was $44 million, up $7 million from the $37 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2009. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to reduced expenses related to the development of natural gas commercialization technologies and higher LNG and methanol price realizations, partially offset by lower LNG sales volumes as a result of the turnaround in Equatorial Guinea. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our first quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009. 
As noted on Slide 12, RM&T's first quarter 2010 segment loss totaled $237 million compared to $159 million segment income earned in the same quarter last year. The majority of the quarter-to-quarter decrease was due to the fact that our crude oil and other feedstock costs were incrementally higher than the change in the average price of our benchmark LLS crude during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reasons for the higher costs were lower sweet/sour differentials and a weaker Contango market structure. 
Also, manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009, primarily due to relatively large plant turnaround and maintenance activities at our Garyville, Louisiana and Texas City, Texas, refineries. Higher depreciation and purchased energy expenses were also factors in the higher manufacturing costs. 
In addition, our average wholesale price realizations increased less than the increase in the average stock market refined product markets used in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread calculation used in the first quarter 2010 versus the same quarter in 2009. Partially offsetting these negative effects were increased returns from ethanol-blending activities due to a wider spread between gasoline and ethanol price and the fact that we've blended about 15% more ethanol during the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009. 
Total refinery crude oil throughput averaged 1,003,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2010 compared to 851,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Total throughputs were 1,100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2010 as compared to 1,071,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2009. 
Speedway SuperAmerica's refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $11 million  in the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate margins, which increased from $10.68 per gallon in the first quarter 2009 to $11.95 per gallon in the first quarter 2010. SSA's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 7% while same-store gasoline volumes were relatively unchanged quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 13 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads. 
Slide 14 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first quarter of 2010. Operating cash flow before changes in our working capital was $829 million. Our cash balance was increased by working-capital changes of $20 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $1.3 billion. Disposable assets were also $1.3 billion and dividends paid totaled $172 million. 
Slide 15 provides a summary of select financial data. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%, a reduction of two percentage points from the fourth quarter 2009. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 53%, in line with the expected effective tax rate for the full year of 2010 between 49% and 54%. 
As we announced in the earnings release this morning, we will no longer issue an interim update. Please remember that on a monthly basis, we update the last page of our Investor Relations packets, which provides the average NYMEX prompt WTI oil price and the 6-3-2-1 crack spread for the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. 
Clarence could not be on the call with us today, as he is in the North Dakota visiting our operations and participating in the Williston Basin Conference, but he wanted me to say that the collective thoughts of the Marathon family go out to those killed and injured on the Deepwater Horizon and the loved ones left behind. We, like most Americans, are focused on the continuing efforts by the private and government sectors to control and contain this spill in the gulf. These are difficult and challenging times for us all. As safety and environmental performance is a core value of our company, this event is a source of sadness but also intense reflections on our own businesses to ensure we remain vigilant and prepared for the unexpected. We have not experienced any significant operational impact from this tragic event, and at this time, do not expect we will, but we will follow the unfolding events closely and take the necessary measures should circumstances change. 
I now turn the call over to Dave and Gary for comments around their respective businesses. Dave?"

As noted in our release and in Howard's remarks, the upstream performed within expectations for the quarter. We continued to improve on our safety performance in 2010, led by a top quartile performance in Equatorial Guinea during a one-month planned maintenance event that occurred in March. We completed all activities scheduled at all three businesses in EG ahead of schedule and within our cost projections. Production was returned to full rates on April 10. 
All of our other conventional business had solid reliability in the quarter, continuing a trend of good performance in this area. Oil Sands Mining met our ranges, but continues to struggle to meet our reliability expectations. The AOSP project began a major turnaround in late March with production expected to resume during the month of May. For the remainder of the year, we have additional maintenance plans at Alpine in August, with an expected duration of 14 days; at Point Aven [ph] also in August, with an expected duration of 30 days and at the AMPCO facility in EG in October, with an expected duration of 35 days. These events have been considered in our guidance for the relevant quarters and for the year and we are exploring methods to mitigate their durations. 
In terms of new production activities that will allow us to meet the expectations of total upstream production of 412,000 to 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010, I'm pleased to report that Volund began regular production at 13,500 gross barrels oil equivalent per day in April and we would expect that to increase to a rate of 25,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day in July. The Alpine complex continues to produce above the rated FPSO capacity at approximately 138,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. All subsea work at Droshky was completed in the first quarter and attention has turned to surface facility completion at Bullwinkle. We expect production in the June to July time frame with Droshky ramping up to 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day rates in the later stages of this year. 
Our current projections are that Droshky will be brought on stream for roughly $400 million below the sanctioned projections of $1.3 billion. We expect this initial phase of activity will access approximately 60% of the 60 million barrels oil equivalent of net resource available with field performance dictating any additional activities required to fully capture the resource potential of the field. 
On the exploration front, drilling continues at Flying Dutchman and Innsbruck, two of our planned Miocene target wells in the Gulf, with Bronco [ph], our third operative prospect, expected to spud in later 2010, dependent on the delivery of the Noble Jim Day rig in the third quarter. The rig's first assignment, after acceptance, will be to complete the single-well Ozona project. The Dutchman has proven to be a challenging well to drill, but remains within our timing and cost projections. Innsbruck has executed to this point with no difficulty. Outside operators will continue to appraise the Freedom discovery in 2010, completing the picture for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. A planned fourth exploration well by an outside operator has been deferred into 2011. 
In Indonesia, and on the Pasangkayu Block, the Bronco well will spud in July, followed by the Romeo well in the October time frame. The rig is in transit to the country and will complete its initial well for another operator prior to moving to our site offshore Sulawesi. 
Finally, in the Bakken, we continue to grow our acreage and our production outlook. We now have 350,000 highly consolidated acres, and our net production is close to 12,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are now projecting a peak 22,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013. As we've mentioned previously, we’ll be running six rigs in the basin by the end of the year up from our current four. We continue to evaluate the play and our technology and are confident in the play and our ability to execute grows daily. In short, the business is performing very well and we're pleased with our activity slate for the remainder of the year and into the future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gary Heminger. Gary?"

A",306,"The first quarter of 2010 was a challenging quarter for us financially, but very successful from an operational standpoint. We were able to complete the integration of all of our Garyville major-expansion operations with the existing Garyville refinery. And I am pleased to report that all the GME units are operating as expected at this time. In addition, as a result of the completion of the GME, we have started to sell some of our increased Garyville light-products production internationally. While disintegration of the GME units was underway during the first quarter, we also completed a significant planned maintenance program at the base Garyville refinery. The centerpiece of this planned maintenance involved a 125,000 barrels-per-day Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit, which recently completed a record seven-year run between turnarounds. While we had the FCCU down for maintenance, we also took this opportunity to do some additional maintenance work on this unit to improve its overall reliability.
In addition to the Garyville maintenance activities, we also completed a planned entire plant turnaround at our Texas City refinery during the quarter. And finally, we also started a major maintenance program at our Catlettsburg refinery in March, which was completed in April, as planned. 
In total, we’ve performed all of these major maintenance activities under budget in the first quarter. And at the current time, all these refineries are operating as expected. 
Turning now to more current events. On the supply and demand front, we have seen improvement in distillate sales throughout our marketing area in March and April. While the increases has been modest, we believe that drop in demand for distillate has bottomed and expect gradual improvement in demand the rest of 2010. Speedway SuperAmerica also has experienced increased same-store gasoline sales for approximately 1% here in April. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back to Howard."

I would think that after we get -- if we get the rate that I've suggested at about 50,000 barrels a day, we'll be able to, on a performance basis, drive those reserve bookings closer to the 60% of the $60 million or somewhere north of $30 million. And so I would expect that the DD&A rates would start to decline at that point. I think what we're looking at, basically, is -- we're going to let the reservoir tell us how quickly to ramp up the production. So I won't speculate on how quickly we're going to get to 50,000. As you'll remember, when we did Alpine, we got to a peak rate very, very quickly. And so we'll certainly try to drive for that. We would expect that rate to be somewhat less than 50,000 barrels a day through 2011. That will be the strongest production year. And then it will decline fairly [ph] rapidly as we go forward as we deplete the reservoir. Not going to speculate on what else we're going to need. I think one of the things -- the reason we say we think we've got about $900 million into this dug is we did take one well out of the program that we didn't think that we were going to need. And as you know, in this compartmentalized reservoirs in the Gulf, we're going to have to see -- these are very complicated wells. Some of them with up to seven take points in them. And so again, the reservoir and how we're draining it will tell us whether or not we need additional wells in order to fully deplete this field that we have here. But I would say that any activity we're looking at in the future would be all drilling based."

No doubt since you've been following this from the time that we made this acquisition almost a decade ago now, there is basically two halves to our Powder River position. One, it's called the Fairway that was impacted here and the remainder of the assets which were really around Sheridan. The section around Sheridan is a more standard type Powder River operation. We're very happy with that. And those operations are going to continue a pace, and in fact, we think that we could produce almost all of the volumes in hedging out of Powder River now just from that section of the play. What really drove this was -- the Fairway section was really dependent on the potential development of what we call the wall coal. And we've been running a pilot there for a number of years and practically just not been successful in getting it dewater, such that it would actually start giving up gas. And I think our view of the technical challenges that were contained in that, particularly with respect to where we see natural gas prices in the Rockies made this an opportunity that we didn't feel like we could further pursue. Hence, the write-down against a bad asset base. So I think that the answer is that we're going to consolidate our activities and operations towards the Sheridan side of the play. It will probably be a less aggressive capital and spending profile in the future and again, for roughly 85% or 90% of the production that we're currently carrying. So it's going to be an improved business. Certainly don't want it to improve businesses in this fashion. But I think we've pursued this as long as we needed to and hence, the change in direction."

Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Privacy and Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, second quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data you may find useful.
Slide 3 shows the 38% increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter 2009 and 31% increase from the first quarter 2009, as well as its details, by quarter, since 2007. 
Slide 4 shows the components of the 38% increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase from the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher commodity prices and lower income taxes, partially offset by lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and lower E&P production sold. Pretax earnings decreased in the RM&T, Oil Sands Mining and E&P segments. Income taxes decreased as a result of the lower pretax earnings and the adjustment for foreign currency re-measurement of deferred taxes. The fourth quarter included a $139 million loss on the re-measurement of deferred taxes denominated in foreign currency, while the just completed quarter saw a $33 million gain, netting to the $172 million FX swing shown on the waterfall chart. As explained on the February conference call, because we will make a one-time election to begin paying Canadian income tax in U.S. dollars, which is the largest portion of these fluctuations, the amount of FX on these Canadian balances was significantly reduced in the first quarter and will be eliminated after the second quarter. However, we will continue to have the potential for movements related to deferred tax balances other than Canada, but FX fluctuations should be significantly less than those experienced in the past because our deferred tax liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will be much smaller. 
Slide 5 shows the 14% increase in E&P segment income from $439 million in the fourth quarter to $502 million in the first quarter. The largest impacts were the increase in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and lower income taxes, largely offset by reduced sales volumes as a result of an under lift in the UK, turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea and our normal 6% to 8% per-annum production-decline rate. 
Slide 6 shows our historical realizations and the $3.97 per BOE increase in our average realizations from $49.93 per BOE in the fourth quarter to $53.90 per BOE in the first quarter. Our liquid hydrocarbon realizations increased more than the NYMEX prompt WTI price, as about 60% of our global liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes are priced off of Brent, which outperformed WTI during the quarter. 
Neither our E&P nor our Oil Sands Mining realizations include the gains and losses on our hedging position. Included in the E&P results were $51 million of net pretax gain on these E&P hedges, related to 65,000 bpd of crude-oil hedges, which all roll off at the end of June and $110 billion BTU per day, or approximately $110 million cubic feet per day, of natural gas hedges that run through the end of 2010. Complete details of our hedging positions are included in our 10-K.
Slide 7 shows the production. Volumes sold in the first quarter 2010 were down 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 to 361,000 BOE per day, while production available for sale decreased 10% to 364,000 BOE per day, primarily driven by the planned turnaround in Equatorial Guinea. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an under lift for the quarter of approximately 220,000 BOE, again, primarily in the U.K. 
Turning to Slide 8. While field-level controllable costs were slightly lower from the fourth quarter and exploration expense was down, total expenses per BOE, as shown in Slide 9, increased 6.5% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher DD&A for BOE as a result of volume mix. First quarter E&P segment income was $15.42 per BOE, a 34% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, again primarily due to the higher-commodity price realization and lower exploration expense, partially offset by higher DD&A per BOE and other costs. 
Turning to Slide 10 in Oil Sands Mining. The segment loss for the first quarter was $17 million, declining $58 million from the $41 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2009, largely driven by lower sales volumes as a result of the planned turnaround activity. Operating and blendstock costs increased $17 million, reflecting $30 million of turnaround costs incurred in the first quarter and a decrease in other operating and blendstock costs as a result of the lower volumes. 
Marathon's first quarter 2010 net-synthetic crude production, bitumen, after upgrading, excluding blendstocks, from the AOSP mining operation was up to 21,000 barrels per day compared to 26,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Average realizations, which again do not reflect the gain or loss on hedges, increased $5.27 per barrel from their fourth quarter level. First quarter segment income reflected a $10 million pretax loss from derivative activity, which reflects 25,000 bpd of crude oil hedges at $82.56 and it runs through the end of this year.
Turning to Slide 11 and the Integrated Gas segment. First quarter's segment income was $44 million, up $7 million from the $37 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2009. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to reduced expenses related to the development of natural gas commercialization technologies and higher LNG and methanol price realizations, partially offset by lower LNG sales volumes as a result of the turnaround in Equatorial Guinea. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our first quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009. 
As noted on Slide 12, RM&T's first quarter 2010 segment loss totaled $237 million compared to $159 million segment income earned in the same quarter last year. The majority of the quarter-to-quarter decrease was due to the fact that our crude oil and other feedstock costs were incrementally higher than the change in the average price of our benchmark LLS crude during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reasons for the higher costs were lower sweet/sour differentials and a weaker Contango market structure. 
Also, manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009, primarily due to relatively large plant turnaround and maintenance activities at our Garyville, Louisiana and Texas City, Texas, refineries. Higher depreciation and purchased energy expenses were also factors in the higher manufacturing costs. 
In addition, our average wholesale price realizations increased less than the increase in the average stock market refined product markets used in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread calculation used in the first quarter 2010 versus the same quarter in 2009. Partially offsetting these negative effects were increased returns from ethanol-blending activities due to a wider spread between gasoline and ethanol price and the fact that we've blended about 15% more ethanol during the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009. 
Total refinery crude oil throughput averaged 1,003,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2010 compared to 851,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Total throughputs were 1,100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2010 as compared to 1,071,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2009. 
Speedway SuperAmerica's refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $11 million  in the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate margins, which increased from $10.68 per gallon in the first quarter 2009 to $11.95 per gallon in the first quarter 2010. SSA's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 7% while same-store gasoline volumes were relatively unchanged quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 13 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads. 
Slide 14 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first quarter of 2010. Operating cash flow before changes in our working capital was $829 million. Our cash balance was increased by working-capital changes of $20 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $1.3 billion. Disposable assets were also $1.3 billion and dividends paid totaled $172 million. 
Slide 15 provides a summary of select financial data. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%, a reduction of two percentage points from the fourth quarter 2009. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 53%, in line with the expected effective tax rate for the full year of 2010 between 49% and 54%. 
As we announced in the earnings release this morning, we will no longer issue an interim update. Please remember that on a monthly basis, we update the last page of our Investor Relations packets, which provides the average NYMEX prompt WTI oil price and the 6-3-2-1 crack spread for the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. 
Clarence could not be on the call with us today, as he is in the North Dakota visiting our operations and participating in the Williston Basin Conference, but he wanted me to say that the collective thoughts of the Marathon family go out to those killed and injured on the Deepwater Horizon and the loved ones left behind. We, like most Americans, are focused on the continuing efforts by the private and government sectors to control and contain this spill in the gulf. These are difficult and challenging times for us all. As safety and environmental performance is a core value of our company, this event is a source of sadness but also intense reflections on our own businesses to ensure we remain vigilant and prepared for the unexpected. We have not experienced any significant operational impact from this tragic event, and at this time, do not expect we will, but we will follow the unfolding events closely and take the necessary measures should circumstances change. 
I now turn the call over to Dave and Gary for comments around their respective businesses. Dave?

As noted in our release and in Howard's remarks, the upstream performed within expectations for the quarter. We continued to improve on our safety performance in 2010, led by a top quartile performance in Equatorial Guinea during a one-month planned maintenance event that occurred in March. We completed all activities scheduled at all three businesses in EG ahead of schedule and within our cost projections. Production was returned to full rates on April 10. 
All of our other conventional business had solid reliability in the quarter, continuing a trend of good performance in this area. Oil Sands Mining met our ranges, but continues to struggle to meet our reliability expectations. The AOSP project began a major turnaround in late March with production expected to resume during the month of May. For the remainder of the year, we have additional maintenance plans at Alpine in August, with an expected duration of 14 days; at Point Aven [ph] also in August, with an expected duration of 30 days and at the AMPCO facility in EG in October, with an expected duration of 35 days. These events have been considered in our guidance for the relevant quarters and for the year and we are exploring methods to mitigate their durations. 
In terms of new production activities that will allow us to meet the expectations of total upstream production of 412,000 to 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010, I'm pleased to report that Volund began regular production at 13,500 gross barrels oil equivalent per day in April and we would expect that to increase to a rate of 25,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day in July. The Alpine complex continues to produce above the rated FPSO capacity at approximately 138,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. All subsea work at Droshky was completed in the first quarter and attention has turned to surface facility completion at Bullwinkle. We expect production in the June to July time frame with Droshky ramping up to 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day rates in the later stages of this year. 
Our current projections are that Droshky will be brought on stream for roughly $400 million below the sanctioned projections of $1.3 billion. We expect this initial phase of activity will access approximately 60% of the 60 million barrels oil equivalent of net resource available with field performance dictating any additional activities required to fully capture the resource potential of the field. 
On the exploration front, drilling continues at Flying Dutchman and Innsbruck, two of our planned Miocene target wells in the Gulf, with Bronco [ph], our third operative prospect, expected to spud in later 2010, dependent on the delivery of the Noble Jim Day rig in the third quarter. The rig's first assignment, after acceptance, will be to complete the single-well Ozona project. The Dutchman has proven to be a challenging well to drill, but remains within our timing and cost projections. Innsbruck has executed to this point with no difficulty. Outside operators will continue to appraise the Freedom discovery in 2010, completing the picture for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. A planned fourth exploration well by an outside operator has been deferred into 2011. 
In Indonesia, and on the Pasangkayu Block, the Bronco well will spud in July, followed by the Romeo well in the October time frame. The rig is in transit to the country and will complete its initial well for another operator prior to moving to our site offshore Sulawesi. 
Finally, in the Bakken, we continue to grow our acreage and our production outlook. We now have 350,000 highly consolidated acres, and our net production is close to 12,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are now projecting a peak 22,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013. As we've mentioned previously, we’ll be running six rigs in the basin by the end of the year up from our current four. We continue to evaluate the play and our technology and are confident in the play and our ability to execute grows daily. In short, the business is performing very well and we're pleased with our activity slate for the remainder of the year and into the future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gary Heminger. Gary?

We were able to complete the integration of all of our Garyville major-expansion operations with the existing Garyville refinery. And I am pleased to report that all the GME units are operating as expected at this time. In addition, as a result of the completion of the GME, we have started to sell some of our increased Garyville light-products production internationally. While disintegration of the GME units was underway during the first quarter, we also completed a significant planned maintenance program at the base Garyville refinery. The centerpiece of this planned maintenance involved a 125,000 barrels-per-day Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit, which recently completed a record seven-year run between turnarounds. While we had the FCCU down for maintenance, we also took this opportunity to do some additional maintenance work on this unit to improve its overall reliability.
In addition to the Garyville maintenance activities, we also completed a planned entire plant turnaround at our Texas City refinery during the quarter. And finally, we also started a major maintenance program at our Catlettsburg refinery in March, which was completed in April, as planned. 
In total, we’ve performed all of these major maintenance activities under budget in the first quarter. And at the current time, all these refineries are operating as expected. 
Turning now to more current events. On the supply and demand front, we have seen improvement in distillate sales throughout our marketing area in March and April. While the increases has been modest, we believe that drop in demand for distillate has bottomed and expect gradual improvement in demand the rest of 2010. Speedway SuperAmerica also has experienced increased same-store gasoline sales for approximately 1% here in April. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back to Howard.

And so I would expect that the DD&A rates would start to decline at that point. I think what we're looking at, basically, is -- we're going to let the reservoir tell us how quickly to ramp up the production. So I won't speculate on how quickly we're going to get to 50,000. As you'll remember, when we did Alpine, we got to a peak rate very, very quickly. And so we'll certainly try to drive for that. We would expect that rate to be somewhat less than 50,000 barrels a day through 2011. That will be the strongest production year. And then it will decline fairly [ph] rapidly as we go forward as we deplete the reservoir. Not going to speculate on what else we're going to need. I think one of the things -- the reason we say we think we've got about $900 million into this dug is we did take one well out of the program that we didn't think that we were going to need. And as you know, in this compartmentalized reservoirs in the Gulf, we're going to have to see -- these are very complicated wells. Some of them with up to seven take points in them. And so again, the reservoir and how we're draining it will tell us whether or not we need additional wells in order to fully deplete this field that we have here. But I would say that any activity we're looking at in the future would be all drilling based.

No doubt since you've been following this from the time that we made this acquisition almost a decade ago now, there is basically two halves to our Powder River position. One, it's called the Fairway that was impacted here and the remainder of the assets which were really around Sheridan. The section around Sheridan is a more standard type Powder River operation. We're very happy with that. And those operations are going to continue a pace, and in fact, we think that we could produce almost all of the volumes in hedging out of Powder River now just from that section of the play. What really drove this was -- the Fairway section was really dependent on the potential development of what we call the wall coal. And we've been running a pilot there for a number of years and practically just not been successful in getting it dewater, such that it would actually start giving up gas. And I think our view of the technical challenges that were contained in that, particularly with respect to where we see natural gas prices in the Rockies made this an opportunity that we didn't feel like we could further pursue. Hence, the write-down against a bad asset base. So I think that the answer is that we're going to consolidate our activities and operations towards the Sheridan side of the play. It will probably be a less aggressive capital and spending profile in the future and again, for roughly 85% or 90% of the production that we're currently carrying. So it's going to be an improved business. Certainly don't want it to improve businesses in this fashion. But I think we've pursued this as long as we needed to and hence, the change in direction.

We challenge ourselves all the time because with the added blend [ph], there’s a lot of splash blending, that being where wholesalers and jobbers buy the base gasoline and then blend it with ethanol themselves, a retailer or a jobber can do his own splash blending and capture that as economics themselves. So when we look at what we sell as our blended price of gasoline, we have to consider that our customers can do a lot of that on their own. So it really gets really complicated to figure out the price that you're getting for the hydrocarbon, in our case, 90% piece versus the 10% ethanol. So it's a challenge. The biggest challenge you also have is what are you comparing it to? Are you comparing it to the 87 octane? Or are you comparing it to the blending components, the blend-grade gasoline that you're using as a blend stock. So I would advise you if you're trying to gather some information on this, you shouldn't be using 87 octane. You should be using a conventional blend-grade gasoline to do it with. And there's starting to be more activity in that grade to give you a better feel for the pricing. But it is a very convoluted, difficult process to get a grasp on. But I think the point you're trying to make is if you look a year ago, gasoline and ethanol with the $0.45 a gallon subsidy, 87 gasoline, that is, we're selling about a parody. This year, there's about a $0.06 spread. Now how much of that we actually capture the rack is very, very difficult for the reasons I just stated.

It's first to invest in the business and value-accretive projects. We will continue to maintain a conservative capital structure, and we recognize that the dividend's an important part of total shareholder return, and as you know, quarterly, our board looks at that.

And then on top of that, we had Texas City completely down and Catlettsburg for March and part of April. So it wasn't just March. It was very, very large turnaround, in fact, the largest turnaround slate that we've ever completed in the company.

Slide 2 contains the discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Privacy and Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors but not necessarily all factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, second quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data you may find useful.
Slide 3 shows the 38% increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter 2009 and 31% increase from the first quarter 2009, as well as its details, by quarter, since 2007. 
Slide 4 shows the components of the 38% increase in adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase from the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher commodity prices and lower income taxes, partially offset by lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and lower E&P production sold. Pretax earnings decreased in the RM&T, Oil Sands Mining and E&P segments. Income taxes decreased as a result of the lower pretax earnings and the adjustment for foreign currency remeasurement of deferred taxes. The fourth quarter included a $139 million loss on the remeasurement of deferred taxes denominated in foreign currency, while the just-completed quarter saw a $33 million gain, netting to the $172 million FX swing shown on the waterfall chart. As explained on the February conference call, because we will make a one-time election to begin paying Canadian income tax in U.S. dollars, which is the largest portion of these fluctuations, the amount of FX on these Canadian balances was significantly reduced in the first quarter and will be eliminated after the second quarter. However, we will continue to have the potential for movements related to deferred tax balances other than Canada, but FX fluctuations should be significantly less than those experienced in the past because our deferred tax liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will be much smaller. 
Slide 5 shows the 14% increase in E&P segment income from $439 million in the fourth quarter to $502 million in the first quarter. The largest impacts were the increase in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and lower income taxes, largely offset by reduced sales volumes as a result of an under lift in the UK, turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea and our normal 6% to 8% per-annum production decline rate. 
Slide 6 shows our historical realizations and the $3.97 per BOE increase in our average realizations from $49.93 per BOE in the fourth quarter to $53.90 per BOE in the first quarter. Our liquid hydrocarbon realizations increased more than the NYMEX prompt WTI price, as about 60% of our global liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes are priced off of Brent, which outperformed WTI during the quarter. 
Neither our E&P nor our Oil Sands Mining realizations include the gains and losses on our hedging position. Included in the E&P results were $51 million of net pretax gain on these E&P hedges, related to 65,000 bpd of crude oil hedges, which all roll off at the end of June, and 110 billion BTU per day, or approximately 110 million cubic feet per day of natural gas hedges that run through the end of 2010. Complete details of our hedging positions are included in our 10-K.
Slide 7 shows the production. Volumes sold in the first quarter 2010 were down 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 to 361,000 BOE per day, while production available for sale decreased 10% to 364,000 BOE per day, primarily driven by the planned turnaround in Equatorial Guinea. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an under lift for the quarter of approximately 220,000 BOE, again, primarily in the U.K. 
Turning to Slide 8. While field-level controllable costs were slightly lower from the fourth quarter and exploration expense was down, total expenses per BOE, as shown on Slide 9, increased 6.5% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher DD&A per BOE as a result of volume mix. First quarter E&P segment income was $15.42 per BOE, a 34% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, again primarily due to the higher-commodity price realization and lower exploration expense, partially offset by higher DD&A per BOE and other costs. 
Turning to Slide 10 in Oil Sands Mining. The segment loss for the first quarter was $17 million, declining $58 million from the $41 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2009, largely driven by lower sales volumes as a result of the planned turnaround activity. Operating and blendstock costs increased $17 million, reflecting $30 million of turnaround costs incurred in the first quarter and a decrease in other operating and blendstock costs as a result of the lower volumes. 
Marathon's first quarter 2010 net-synthetic crude production, bitumen, after upgrading, excluding blendstocks, from the AOSP mining operation was up to 21,000 barrels per day compared to 26,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Average realizations, which again do not reflect the gain or loss on hedges, increased $5.27 per barrel from their fourth quarter level. First quarter segment income reflected a $10 million pretax loss from derivative activity, which reflects 25,000 bpd of crude oil hedges at $82.56 and it runs through the end of this year.
Turning to Slide 11 and the Integrated Gas segment. First quarter's segment income was $44 million, up $7 million from the $37 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2009. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to reduced expenses related to the development of natural gas commercialization technologies and higher LNG and methanol price realizations, partially offset by lower LNG sales volumes as a result of the turnaround in Equatorial Guinea. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our first quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009. 
As noted on Slide 12, RM&T's first quarter 2010 segment loss totaled $237 million compared to $159 million segment income earned in the same quarter last year. The majority of the quarter-to-quarter decrease was due to the fact that our crude oil and other feedstock costs were incrementally higher than the change in the average price of our benchmark LLS crude during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reasons for the higher costs were lower sweet/sour differentials and a weaker Contango market structure. 
Also, manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009, primarily due to relatively large plant turnaround and maintenance activities at our Garyville, Louisiana and Texas City, Texas, refineries. Higher depreciation and purchased energy expenses were also factors in the higher manufacturing costs. 
In addition, our average wholesale price realizations increased less than the increase in the average stock market refined product markets used in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread calculation used in the first quarter 2010 versus the same quarter in 2009. Partially offsetting these negative effects were increased returns from ethanol-blending activities due to a wider spread between gasoline and ethanol price and the fact that we've blended about 15% more ethanol during the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009. 
Total refinery crude oil throughput averaged 1,003,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2010 compared to 851,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Total throughputs were 1,100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2010 as compared to 1,071,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2009. 
Speedway SuperAmerica's refined product and merchandise gross margin was about $11 million  in the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate margins, which increased from $10.68 per gallon in the first quarter 2009 to $11.95 per gallon in the first quarter 2010. SSA's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 7% while same-store gasoline volumes were relatively unchanged quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 13 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads. 
Slide 14 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first quarter of 2010. Operating cash flow before changes in our working capital was $829 million. Our cash balance was increased by working-capital changes of $20 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $1.3 billion. Disposable assets were also $1.3 billion and dividends paid totaled $172 million. 
Slide 15 provides a summary of select financial data. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%, a reduction of two percentage points from the fourth quarter 2009. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 53%, in line with the expected effective tax rate for the full year of 2010 between 49% and 54%. 
As we announced in the earnings release this morning, we will no longer issue an interim update. Please remember that on a monthly basis, we update the last page of our Investor Relations packets, which provides the average NYMEX prompt WTI oil price and the 6-3-2-1 crack spreads for the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. 
Clarence could not be on the call with us today, as he is in North Dakota visiting our operations and participating in the Williston Basin Conference, but he wanted me to say that the collective thoughts of the Marathon family go out to those killed and injured on the Deepwater Horizon and the loved ones left behind. We, like most Americans, are focused on the continuing efforts by the private and government sectors to control and contain this spill in the gulf. These are difficult and challenging times for us all. As safety and environmental performance is a core value of our company, this event is a source of sadness but also intense reflections on our own businesses to ensure we remain vigilant and prepared for the unexpected. We have not experienced any significant operational impact from this tragic event, and at this time, do not expect we will, but we will follow the unfolding events closely and take the necessary measures should circumstances change. 
I now turn the call over to Dave and Gary for comments around their respective businesses. Dave?"

As noted in our release and in Howard's remarks, the upstream performed within expectations for the quarter. We continued to improve on our safety performance in 2010, led by a top quartile performance in Equatorial Guinea during a one-month planned maintenance event that occurred in March. We completed all activities scheduled at all three businesses in EG ahead of schedule and within our cost projections. Production was returned to full rates on April 10. 
All of our other conventional business had solid reliability in the quarter, continuing a trend of good performance in this area. Oil Sands Mining met our ranges, but continues to struggle to meet our reliability expectations. The AOSP project began a major turnaround in late March with production expected to resume during the month of May. For the remainder of the year, we have additional maintenance planned at Alpine in August, with an expected duration of 14 days; at Point Aven [ph] also in August, with an expected duration of 30 days and at the AMPCO facility in EG in October, with an expected duration of 35 days. These events have been considered in our guidance for the relevant quarters and for the year, and we are exploring methods to mitigate their durations. 
In terms of new production activities that will allow us to meet the expectations of total upstream production of 412,000 to 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010, I'm pleased to report that Volund began regular production at 13,500 gross barrels oil equivalent per day in April, and we would expect that to increase to a rate of 25,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day in July. The Alpine complex continues to produce above the rated FPSO capacity at approximately 138,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. All subsea work at Droshky was completed in the first quarter and attention has turned to surface facility completion at Bullwinkle. We expect production in the June to July time frame with Droshky ramping up to 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day rates in the later stages of this year. 
Our current projections are that Droshky will be brought on stream for roughly $400 million below the sanctioned projections of $1.3 billion. We expect this initial phase of activity will access approximately 60% of the 60 million barrels oil equivalent of net resource available with field performance dictating any additional activities required to fully capture the resource potential of the field. 
On the exploration front, drilling continues at Flying Dutchman and Innsbruck, two of our planned Miocene target wells in the Gulf, with Bronco, our third operative prospect, expected to spud in later 2010, dependent on the delivery of the Noble Jim Day rig in the third quarter. The rig's first assignment, after acceptance, will be to complete the single-well Ozona project. The Dutchman has proven to be a challenging well to drill, but remains within our timing and cost projections. Innsbruck has executed to this point with no difficulty. Outside operators will continue to appraise the Freedom discovery in 2010, completing the picture for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. A planned fourth exploration well by an outside operator has been deferred into 2011. 
In Indonesia, and on the Pasangkayu Block, the Bronco well will spud in July, followed by the Romeo well in the October time frame. The rig is in transit to the country and will complete its initial well for another operator prior to moving to our site offshore Sulawesi. 
Finally, in the Bakken, we continue to grow our acreage and our production outlook. We now have 350,000 highly consolidated acres, and our net production is close to 12,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are now projecting a peak 22,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013. As we've mentioned previously, we’ll be running six rigs in the basin by the end of the year up from our current four. We continue to evaluate the play and our technology and are confident in the play and our ability to execute grows daily. In short, the business is performing very well and we're pleased with our activity slate for the remainder of the year and into the future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gary Heminger. Gary?"

We were able to complete the integration of all of our Garyville major-expansion operations with the existing Garyville refinery. And I am pleased to report that all the GME units are operating as expected at this time. In addition, as a result of the completion of the GME, we have started to sell some of our increased Garyville light-products production internationally. While disintegration of the GME units was underway during the first quarter, we also completed a significant planned maintenance program at the base Garyville refinery. The centerpiece of this planned maintenance involved a 125,000 barrels-per-day Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit, which recently completed a record seven-year run between turnarounds. While we had the FCCU down for maintenance, we also took this opportunity to do some additional maintenance work on this unit to improve its overall reliability.
In addition to the Garyville maintenance activities, we also completed a planned entire plant turnaround at our Texas City refinery during the quarter. And finally, we also started a major maintenance program at our Catlettsburg
 refinery in March, which was completed in April, as planned. 
In total, we’ve performed all of these major maintenance activities under budget in the first quarter. And at the current time, all these refineries are operating as expected. 
Turning now to more current events. On the supply and demand front, we have seen improvement in distillate sales throughout our marketing area in March and April. While the increases has been modest, we believe that drop in demand for distillate has bottomed and expect gradual improvement in demand the rest of 2010. Speedway SuperAmerica also has experienced increased same-store gasoline sales for approximately 1% here in April. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back to Howard."

And so I would expect that the DD&A rates would start to decline at that point. I think what we're looking at, basically, is -- we're going to let the reservoir tell us how quickly to ramp up the production. So I won't speculate on how quickly we're going to get to 50,000. As you'll remember, when we did Alpine, we got to a peak rate very, very quickly. And so we'll certainly try to drive for that. We would expect that rate to be somewhat less than 50,000 barrels a day through 2011. That will be the strongest production year. And then it will decline fairly [ph] rapidly as we go forward as we deplete the reservoir. Not going to speculate on what else we're going to need. I think one of the things -- the reason we say we think we've got about $900 million into this dug is we did take one well out of the program that we didn't think that we were going to need. And as you know, in this compartmentalized reservoirs in the Gulf, we're going to have to see -- these are very complicated wells. Some of them with up to seven take points in them. And so again, the reservoir and how we're draining it will tell us whether or not we need additional wells in order to fully deplete this field that we have here.

No doubt since you've been following this from the time that we made this acquisition almost a decade ago now, there is basically two halves to our Powder River position. One, it's called the Fairway that was impacted here and the remainder of the assets which were really around Sheridan. The section around Sheridan is a more standard type Powder River operation. We're very happy with that. And those operations are going to continue a pace, and in fact, we think that we could produce almost all of the volumes in hedging out of Powder River now just from that section of the play. What really drove this was -- the Fairway section was really dependent on the potential development of what we call the wall coal. And we've been running a pilot there for a number of years and practically just not been successful in getting it dewater, such that it would actually start giving up gas. And I think our view of the technical challenges that were contained in that, particularly with respect to where we see natural gas prices in the Rockies made this an opportunity that we didn't feel like we could further pursue. Hence, the write-down against a bad asset base. So I think that the answer is that we're going to consolidate our activities and operations towards the Sheridan side of the play. It will probably be a less aggressive capital and spending profile in the future and again, for roughly 85% or 90% of the production that we're currently carrying. So it's going to be an improved business. Certainly don't want it to improve businesses in this fashion. But I think we've pursued this as long as we needed to and hence, the change in direction."

Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, third quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful. 
Slide 3 provides net income and adjusted net income data, both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our second quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $792 million reflects a 151% increase from the first quarter results of $315 million and a 216% increase from the $251 million earned in the second quarter of 2009.
The waterfall chart on Slide 4 shows the first to second quarter change in pretax income by segment, as well as the subsequent change in income taxes. The increase in RM&T's pretax income, partially offset by income taxes, was the primary reason for the increase in the second quarter adjusted net income as compared to the first quarter. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010. For the second quarter, the effective income tax rate, including special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, was 51%. 
The E&P variance analysis is shown on Slide 5. Compared to the first quarter, the second quarter saw higher liftings, largely offset by lower realization and higher costs. Higher income taxes booked during the second quarter contributed to pushing E&P segment income down 14% from $502 million in the first quarter to $432 million in the quarter just completed. The higher income tax rate in the second quarter is a reflection of the production mix. Second quarter E&P segment income reflects a $29 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $49 million pretax gain in the first quarter. As a reminder, the E&P crude oil contracts expired at the end of June, while the gas contracts continue through the end of this year. 
Slide 6 shows our historical realizations and highlights the $1.29 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, which moved from $53.90 per BOE in the first quarter to $52.61 per BOE in the second quarter. This is largely in line with the $0.83 per barrel drop in WTI and the $1.21 per mcf decrease in bid week natural gas prices, partially offset by $1.87 per barrel increase in the price of Brent. 
Moving to Slide 7. As a result of higher international liftings, our second quarter sales volumes increased 7% to the first quarter to 386,000 BOE per day. During the same period, production available for sale increased 3% to 375,000 BOE per day, primarily a result of the completion of turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea at the end of the first quarter. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an overlift for the quarter of approximately 1 million BOE, primarily in Europe. At the end of the second quarter, our international operations on a cumulative basis were essentially in a net balance lifting position, with an underlift position of approximately 400,000 barrels in EG and a 400,000-barrel overlift balance in Europe. Domestically, we remained 2.5 million BOE underlifted due to gas stored in Alaska, again, on a cumulative or to-date basis.
Turning to Slide 8. Second quarter E&P segment income was $12.32 per BOE, a 20% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower BOE revenues and higher taxes. While total E&P expenses per BOE were relatively flat first quarter to second quarter, E&P expenses, excluding expiration expenses, declined $0.51 per BOE. 
Slide 9 shows the per-BOE trend over the last 10 quarters for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses. Field level controllable cost per BOE increased 5% over the first quarter due to higher international liftings and the related change in production mix compared to the first quarter. The increase in per-BOE exploration expense was largely due to the partial dry haul expense at the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well. 
Turning to Slide 10. The Oils Sands Mining segment lost $60 million in the second quarter compared to a segment loss of $17 million in the first quarter of 2010. The turnaround of both the mine and upgrader at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project decreased net synthetic crude oil sales to 20,000 barrels per day in the second quarter compared to 25,000 barrels per day in the first quarter and increased costs by $39 million compared to the first quarter. The turnaround costs net to Marathon was $99 million, $30 million in the first quarter and $69 million in the second quarter and fell within previous guidance. Realized prices fell from $73.76 per barrel in the first quarter to $65.11 per barrel in the second quarter. Second quarter segment income reflects a $53 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $10 million pretax loss in the first quarter. These contracts continue through the end of this year. The Integrated Gas segment's second quarter income was $24 million, down from $44 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Moving to our Downstream business. As noted on Slide 11, RM&T's second quarter 2010 segment profit totaled $421 million compared to $165 million earned in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our second quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009. Our crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS during the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reason for the relatively lower cost was the substantial increase in the sweet/sour differential from an average of $3.98 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010. Total throughputs were up about 20% quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to the Garyville Major Expansion being online the second quarter 2010. The completion of this expansion, plus some other work we recently completed to improve the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, improved results over the second quarter 2009. Partially offsetting these positive effects was the fact that the relevant blended LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased from approximately $5 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to about $3.20 per barrel last quarter. 
In addition, because of the expanded refinery capacity at Garyville, total manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. However, on a per barrel of total refinery throughput basis, our Refining, Marketing and Transportation expenses, excluding DD&A, energy-related price effects and bank service charges, were down about 12% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Again, primarily due to our expanded Garyville facility, our average data for refinery crude oil throughput increased 28% from the second quarter last year to the second quarter 2002 (sic) [2010] to 1,229,000 barrels per day. And as I previously mentioned, average daily total throughput increased 20% to 1,393,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2010 as compared to 1,158,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2009. Our Refinery and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.1337 per gallon is based on a total consolidated refined products volume sold of 1,610,000 barrels per day or about 6.2 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed in excess of $0.013 to this margin.
Speedway SuperAmerica light product and merchandise gross margin combined was about $43 million higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the second quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to a higher gasoline and diesel margins, which increased from $0.1051 per gallon in the second quarter 2009 to $0.1328 per gallon in the second quarter 2010. Speedway SuperAmerica's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 4%, while same-store gasoline volumes increased 5% quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 13 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. 
Slide 14 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first half of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, before changes in our working capital, was slightly over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes of $202 million. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, and dividends paid totaled $350 million, while asset disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion. And finally, debt was reduced by $625 million. 
As shown on Slide 15, at the end of the second quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt to total capital ratio was 20%. And as a reminder, the net debt to total capital ratio includes about $239 million of debt service by U.S. Steel. Before we open the call to questions, we remind you that to accommodate all who wish to ask questions, you'd please limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits.

Now, we've said consistently this is one of the most valuable provinces in the world because of the fact that it represents one of the most stable and attractive fiscal regimes. And if that changes, then our outlook, relative to that basin, will also have to change because, obviously, we want to protect our shareholders. That being said, we think we continue to believe this is an incredibly important province for the United States in terms of its energy security. We expect whatever hopefully happens out of the government to be reasonable. And our expectation is that we'll continue to be interested in doing business in the Gulf of Mexico, and I wouldn't speculate on what other operators are going to do and what our appetite might be for those opportunities."

The issue is the attached liabilities, should there be some sort of mechanism to limit a company's exposure there unless they are indeed found negligent, in which case, again, the cap doesn't apply. So we're going to watch that very carefully. And I think one of the things that we've been involved in directly with our peers is trying to set up mechanisms whereby the industry can come together to not only work on some of the concerns that the government has in terms of prevention and response in the future, but also making sure that this base scenario remains open to a large number of companies through some sort of shared risk mechanism. We think that's very important because we think not only that supermajors and the majors like Marathon have a lot to offer in this basin but obviously, some of the independents do as well."

We had said previously that we were ramping up in the Bakken. It had nothing to do with the potential reallocation from the Gulf of Mexico. We've added some acreage this year.

On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Heminger, Executive Vice President, Downstream; Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Gary Peiffer, Senior Vice President of Finance and Commercial Services, Downstream. 
Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, third quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful. 
Slide 3 provides net income and adjusted net income data, both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our second quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $792 million reflects a 151% increase from the first quarter results of $315 million and a 216% increase from the $251 million earned in the second quarter of 2009.
The waterfall chart on Slide 4 shows the first to second quarter change in pretax income by segment, as well as the subsequent change in income taxes. The increase in RM&T's pretax income, partially offset by income taxes, was the primary reason for the increase in the second quarter adjusted net income as compared to the first quarter. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010. For the second quarter, the effective income tax rate, including special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, was 51%. 
The E&P variance analysis is shown on Slide 5. Compared to the first quarter, the second quarter saw higher liftings, largely offset by lower realization and higher costs. Higher income taxes booked during the second quarter contributed to pushing E&P segment income down 14% from $502 million in the first quarter to $432 million in the quarter just completed. The higher income tax rate in the second quarter is a reflection of the production mix. Second quarter E&P segment income reflects a $29 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $49 million pretax gain in the first quarter. As a reminder, the E&P crude oil contracts expired at the end of June, while the gas contracts continue through the end of this year. 
Slide 6 shows our historical realizations and highlights the $1.29 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, which moved from $53.90 per BOE in the first quarter to $52.61 per BOE in the second quarter. This is largely in line with the $0.83 per barrel drop in WTI and the $1.21 per mcf decrease in bid week natural gas prices, partially offset by $1.87 per barrel increase in the price of Brent. 
Moving to Slide 7. As a result of higher international liftings, our second quarter sales volumes increased 7% to the first quarter to 386,000 BOE per day. During the same period, production available for sale increased 3% to 375,000 BOE per day, primarily a result of the completion of turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea at the end of the first quarter. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an overlift for the quarter of approximately 1 million BOE, primarily in Europe. At the end of the second quarter, our international operations on a cumulative basis were essentially in a net balance lifting position, with an underlift position of approximately 400,000 barrels in EG and a 400,000-barrel overlift balance in Europe. Domestically, we remained 2.5 million BOE underlifted due to gas stored in Alaska, again, on a cumulative or to-date basis.
Turning to Slide 8. Second quarter E&P segment income was $12.32 per BOE, a 20% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower BOE revenues and higher taxes. While total E&P expenses per BOE were relatively flat first quarter to second quarter, E&P expenses, excluding expiration expenses, declined $0.51 per BOE. 
Slide 9 shows the per-BOE trend over the last 10 quarters for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses. Field level controllable cost per BOE increased 5% over the first quarter due to higher international liftings and the related change in production mix compared to the first quarter. The increase in per-BOE exploration expense was largely due to the partial dry haul expense at the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well. 
Turning to Slide 10. The Oils Sands Mining segment lost $60 million in the second quarter compared to a segment loss of $17 million in the first quarter of 2010. The turnaround of both the mine and upgrader at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project decreased net synthetic crude oil sales to 20,000 barrels per day in the second quarter compared to 25,000 barrels per day in the first quarter and increased costs by $39 million compared to the first quarter. The turnaround costs net to Marathon was $99 million, $30 million in the first quarter and $69 million in the second quarter and fell within previous guidance. Realized prices fell from $73.76 per barrel in the first quarter to $65.11 per barrel in the second quarter. Second quarter segment income reflects a $53 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $10 million pretax loss in the first quarter. These contracts continue through the end of this year. The Integrated Gas segment's second quarter income was $24 million, down from $44 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Moving to our Downstream business. As noted on Slide 11, RM&T's second quarter 2010 segment profit totaled $421 million compared to $165 million earned in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our second quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009. Our crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS during the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reason for the relatively lower cost was the substantial increase in the sweet/sour differential from an average of $3.98 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010. Total throughputs were up about 20% quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to the Garyville Major Expansion being online the second quarter 2010. The completion of this expansion, plus some other work we recently completed to improve the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, improved results over the second quarter 2009. Partially offsetting these positive effects was the fact that the relevant blended LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased from approximately $5 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to about $3.20 per barrel last quarter. 
In addition, because of the expanded refinery capacity at Garyville, total manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. However, on a per barrel of total refinery throughput basis, our Refining, Marketing and Transportation expenses, excluding DD&A, energy-related price effects and bank service charges, were down about 12% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Again, primarily due to our expanded Garyville facility, our average data for refinery crude oil throughput increased 28% from the second quarter last year to the second quarter 2002 (sic) [2010] to 1,229,000 barrels per day. And as I previously mentioned, average daily total throughput increased 20% to 1,393,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2010 as compared to 1,158,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2009. Our Refinery and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.1337 per gallon is based on a total consolidated refined products volume sold of 1,610,000 barrels per day or about 6.2 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed in excess of $0.013 to this margin.
Speedway SuperAmerica light product and merchandise gross margin combined was about $43 million higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the second quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to a higher gasoline and diesel margins, which increased from $0.1051 per gallon in the second quarter 2009 to $0.1328 per gallon in the second quarter 2010. Speedway SuperAmerica's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 4%, while same-store gasoline volumes increased 5% quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 13 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. 
Slide 14 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first half of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, before changes in our working capital, was slightly over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes of $202 million. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, and dividends paid totaled $350 million, while asset disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion. And finally, debt was reduced by $625 million. 
As shown on Slide 15, at the end of the second quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt to total capital ratio was 20%. And as a reminder, the net debt to total capital ratio includes about $239 million of debt service by U.S. Steel. Before we open the call to questions, we remind you that to accommodate all who wish to ask questions, you'd please limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. 
Nancy, with that, we will now open the call to questions.

Now, we've said consistently this is one of the most valuable provinces in the world because of the fact that it represents one of the most stable and attractive fiscal regimes. And if that changes, then our outlook, relative to that basin, will also have to change because, obviously, we want to protect our shareholders. That being said, we think we continue to believe this is an incredibly important province for the United States in terms of its energy security. We expect whatever hopefully happens out of the government to be reasonable. And our expectation is that we'll continue to be interested in doing business in the Gulf of Mexico, and I wouldn't speculate on what other operators are going to do and what our appetite might be for those opportunities.

I think one of the things that we've said is we have always understood that for cleanup costs that there is a little bit of liability today. And so I think that's one of the things that all of the companies understand very clearly. The issue is the attached liabilities, should there be some sort of mechanism to limit a company's exposure there unless they are indeed found negligent, in which case, again, the cap doesn't apply. So we're going to watch that very carefully. And I think one of the things that we've been involved in directly with our peers is trying to set up mechanisms whereby the industry can come together to not only work on some of the concerns that the government has in terms of prevention and response in the future, but also making sure that this base scenario remains open to a large number of companies through some sort of shared risk mechanism. We think that's very important because we think not only that supermajors and the majors like Marathon have a lot to offer in this basin but obviously, some of the independents do as well.

We, obviously, will be watching, and we'll register the appropriate concerns as we see how this moratorium and potential further extension because it might apply. But clearly, from an exploration discovery to development perspective, we were talking about a five- to seven-year period anyway, and so that's certainly something that we can be slightly more sanguine about if these events were interfering in production activities. We had said previously that we were ramping up in the Bakken. It had nothing to do with the potential reallocation from the Gulf of Mexico. We've added some acreage this year. We're going to six rigs. We've added the fifth. We'll see the sixth here in the next quarter.

We're repairing a surface separator on the Bullwinkle Platform that interrupted our flow-back tests. I can tell you that the first well, we saw rates of about 20,000 barrels a day. The second well, we saw 22,000 barrels a day. These are growth numbers, and we've got one more well that we're going to run through the test before we see what we expect will be continuous production by the end of the month. So production area's kind of up and down on a day-to-day basis. The Ozona is a well that's basically drilled and temporarily abandoned. So all we have to go back to do now is set subsea tree, which we expect to have delivery on in the next quarter, and then go back in and actually do the completion work. So there's nothing spectacular that's going to have to happen there. Along the way, before it comes on and till what we're projecting in the third quarter really has to do with some timing issues of rig deliveries and also some of the surface modifications that the host operator has to make on the Auger platform.

Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, third quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful. 
Slide 3 provides net income and adjusted net income data, both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our second quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $792 million reflects a 151% increase from the first quarter results of $315 million and a 216% increase from the $251 million earned in the second quarter of 2009.
The waterfall chart on Slide 4 shows the first to second quarter change in pretax income by segment, as well as the subsequent change in income taxes. The increase in RM&T's pretax income, partially offset by income taxes, was the primary reason for the increase in the second quarter adjusted net income as compared to the first quarter. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010. For the second quarter, the effective income tax rate, including special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, was 51%. 
The E&P variance analysis is shown on Slide 5. Compared to the first quarter, the second quarter saw higher liftings, largely offset by lower realization and higher costs. Higher income taxes booked during the second quarter contributed to pushing E&P segment income down 14% from $502 million in the first quarter to $432 million in the quarter just completed. The higher income tax rate in the second quarter is a reflection of the production mix. Second quarter E&P segment income reflects a $29 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $49 million pretax gain in the first quarter. As a reminder, the E&P crude oil contracts expired at the end of June, while the gas contracts continue through the end of this year. 
Slide 6 shows our historical realizations and highlights the $1.29 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, which moved from $53.90 per BOE in the first quarter to $52.61 per BOE in the second quarter. This is largely in line with the $0.83 per barrel drop in WTI and the $1.21 per mcf decrease in bid week natural gas prices, partially offset by $1.87 per barrel increase in the price of Brent. 
Moving to Slide 7. As a result of higher international liftings, our second quarter sales volumes increased 7% to the first quarter to 386,000 BOE per day. During the same period, production available for sale increased 3% to 375,000 BOE per day, primarily a result of the completion of turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea at the end of the first quarter. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an overlift for the quarter of approximately 1 million BOE, primarily in Europe. At the end of the second quarter, our international operations on a cumulative basis were essentially in a net balance lifting position, with an underlift position of approximately 400,000 barrels in EG and a 400,000-barrel overlift balance in Europe. Domestically, we remained 2.5 million BOE underlifted due to gas stored in Alaska, again, on a cumulative or to-date basis.
Turning to Slide 8. Second quarter E&P segment income was $12.32 per BOE, a 20% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower BOE revenues and higher taxes. While total E&P expenses per BOE were relatively flat first quarter to second quarter, E&P expenses, excluding expiration expenses, declined $0.51 per BOE. 
Slide 9 shows the per-BOE trend over the last 10 quarters for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses. Field level controllable cost per BOE increased 5% over the first quarter due to higher international liftings and the related change in production mix compared to the first quarter. The increase in per-BOE exploration expense was largely due to the partial dry haul expense at the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well. 
Turning to Slide 10. The Oils Sands Mining segment lost $60 million in the second quarter compared to a segment loss of $17 million in the first quarter of 2010. The turnaround of both the mine and upgrader at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project decreased net synthetic crude oil sales to 20,000 barrels per day in the second quarter compared to 25,000 barrels per day in the first quarter and increased costs by $39 million compared to the first quarter. The turnaround costs net to Marathon was $99 million, $30 million in the first quarter and $69 million in the second quarter and fell within previous guidance. Realized prices fell from $73.76 per barrel in the first quarter to $65.11 per barrel in the second quarter. Second quarter segment income reflects a $53 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $10 million pretax loss in the first quarter. These contracts continue through the end of this year. The Integrated Gas segment's second quarter income was $24 million, down from $44 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Moving to our Downstream business. As noted on Slide 11, RM&T's second quarter 2010 segment profit total $421 million compared to $165 million earned in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our second quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009. Our crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS during the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reason for the relatively lower cost was the substantial increase in the sweet/sour differential from an average of $3.98 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter 2010. Total throughputs were up about 20% quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to the Garyville Major Expansion being online the second quarter 2010. The completion of this expansion, plus some other work we recently completed to improve the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, improved results over the second quarter 2009. Partially offsetting these positive effects was the fact that the relevant blended LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased from approximately $5 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to about $3.20 per barrel last quarter. 
In addition, because of the expanded refinery capacity at Garyville, total manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. However, on a per barrel of total refinery throughput basis, our Refining, Marketing and Transportation expenses, excluding DD&A, energy-related price effects and bank service charges, were down about 12% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Again, primarily due to our expanded Garyville facility, our average data refinery crude oil throughput increased 28% from the second quarter last year to the second quarter 2002 (sic) [2010] to 1,229,000 barrels per day. And as I previously mentioned, average daily total throughput increased 20% to 1,393,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2010 as compared to 1,158,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2009. Our Refinery and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.1337 per gallon is based on a total consolidated refined products volume sold of 1,610,000 barrels per day or about 6.2 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed in excess of $0.013 to this margin.
Speedway SuperAmerica's light product and merchandise gross margin combined was about $43 million higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the second quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to a higher gasoline and distillate margins, which increased from $0.1051 per gallon in the second quarter 2009 to $0.1328 per gallon in the second quarter 2010. Speedway SuperAmerica's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 4%, while same-store gasoline volumes increased 5% quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 13 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. 
Slide 14 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first half of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, before changes in our working capital, was slightly over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes of $202 million. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, and dividends paid totaled $350 million, while asset disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion. And finally, debt was reduced by $625 million. 
As shown on Slide 15, at the end of the second quarter of 2010, our cash-adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 20%. And as a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $239 million of debt serviced by U.S. Steel.

I think one of the things that we've said is we have always understood that for cleanup costs that there is a little bit of liability today. And so I think that's one of the things that all of the companies understand very clearly. The issue is the attached liabilities, should there be some sort of mechanism to limit a company's exposure there unless they are indeed found negligent, in which case, again, the cap doesn't apply. So we're going to watch that very carefully. And I think one of the things that we've been involved in directly with our peers is trying to set up mechanisms whereby the industry can come together to not only work on some of the concerns that the government has in terms of prevention and response in the future, but also making sure that this base scenario remains open to a large number of companies through some sort of shared risk mechanism. We think that's very important because we think not only that supermajors and the majors like Marathon have a lot to offer in this basin but obviously, some of the independents do as well."

But clearly, from an exploration discovery to development perspective, we were talking about a five- to seven-year period anyway, and so that's certainly something that we can be slightly more sanguine about if these events were interfering in production activities. We had said previously that we were ramping up in the Bakken. It had nothing to do with the potential reallocation from the Gulf of Mexico. We've added some acreage this year. We're going to six rigs. We've added the fifth. We'll see the sixth here in the next quarter.

So all we have to go back to do now is set subsea tree, which we expect to have delivery on in the next quarter, and then go back in and actually do the completion work. So there's nothing spectacular that's going to have to happen there.

The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathon.com.  
On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Heminger, Executive Vice President, Downstream; Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Garry Peiffer, Senior Vice President of Finance and Commercial Services, Downstream. 
Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, third quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you may find useful. 
Slide 3 provides net income and adjusted net income data, both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our second quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $792 million reflects a 151% increase from the first quarter results of $315 million and a 216% increase from the $251 million earned in the second quarter of 2009.
The waterfall chart on Slide 4 shows the first to second quarter change in pretax income by segment, as well as the subsequent change in income taxes. The increase in RM&T's pretax income, partially offset by income taxes, was the primary reason for the increase in the second quarter adjusted net income as compared to the first quarter. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010. For the second quarter, the effective income tax rate, including special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances, was 51%. 
The E&P variance analysis is shown on Slide 5. Compared to the first quarter, the second quarter saw higher liftings, largely offset by lower realization and higher costs. Higher income taxes booked during the second quarter contributed to pushing E&P segment income down 14% from $502 million in the first quarter to $432 million in the quarter just completed. The higher income tax rate in the second quarter is a reflection of the production mix. Second quarter E&P segment income reflects a $29 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $49 million pretax gain in the first quarter. As a reminder, the E&P crude oil contracts expired at the end of June, while the gas contracts continue through the end of this year. 
Slide 6 shows our historical realizations and highlights the $1.29 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, which moved from $53.90 per BOE in the first quarter to $52.61 per BOE in the second quarter. This is largely in line with the $0.83 per barrel drop in WTI and the $1.21 per mcf decrease in bid week natural gas prices, partially offset by $1.87 per barrel increase in the price of Brent. 
Moving to Slide 7. As a result of higher international liftings, our second quarter sales volumes increased 7% to the first quarter to 386,000 BOE per day. During the same period, production available for sale increased 3% to 375,000 BOE per day, primarily a result of the completion of turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea at the end of the first quarter. The difference in sales volumes and production available for sale was the result of an overlift for the quarter of approximately 1 million BOE, primarily in Europe. At the end of the second quarter, our international operations on a cumulative basis were essentially in a net balance lifting position, with an underlift position of approximately 400,000 barrels in EG and a 400,000-barrel overlift balance in Europe. Domestically, we remained 2.5 million BOE underlifted due to gas stored in Alaska, again, on a cumulative or to-date basis.
Turning to Slide 8. Second quarter E&P segment income was $12.32 per BOE, a 20% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower BOE revenues and higher taxes. While total E&P expenses per BOE were relatively flat first quarter to second quarter, E&P expenses, excluding expiration expenses, declined $0.51 per BOE. 
Slide 9 shows the per-BOE trend over the last 10 quarters for field level controllable costs and exploration expenses. Field level controllable cost per BOE increased 5% over the first quarter due to higher international liftings and the related change in production mix compared to the first quarter. The increase in per-BOE exploration expense was largely due to the partial dry haul expense at the Gulf of Mexico Flying Dutchman well. 
Turning to Slide 10. The Oils Sands Mining segment lost $60 million in the second quarter compared to a segment loss of $17 million in the first quarter of 2010. The turnaround of both the mine and upgrader at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project decreased net synthetic crude oil sales to 20,000 barrels per day in the second quarter compared to 25,000 barrels per day in the first quarter and increased costs by $39 million compared to the first quarter. The turnaround costs net to Marathon was $99 million, $30 million in the first quarter and $69 million in the second quarter and fell within previous guidance. Realized prices fell from $73.76 per barrel in the first quarter to $65.11 per barrel in the second quarter. Second quarter segment income reflects a $53 million pretax gain on derivative activity compared to a $10 million pretax loss in the first quarter. These contracts continue through the end of this year. The Integrated Gas segment's second quarter income was $24 million, down from $44 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Moving to our Downstream business. As noted on Slide 11, RM&T's second quarter 2010 segment profit total $421 million compared to $165 million earned in the same quarter last year. Because of the seasonality of the Downstream business, I will compare our second quarter 2010 results against the same quarter in 2009. Our crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS during the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reason for the relatively lower cost was the substantial increase in the sweet/sour differential from an average of $3.98 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter 2010. Total throughputs were up about 20% quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to the Garyville Major Expansion being online the second quarter 2010. The completion of this expansion, plus some other work we recently completed to improve the efficiency of our fluid catalytic cracking units, improved results over the second quarter 2009. Partially offsetting these positive effects was the fact that the relevant blended LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased from approximately $5 per barrel in the second quarter 2009 to about $3.20 per barrel last quarter. 
In addition, because of the expanded refinery capacity at Garyville, total manufacturing and other expenses were higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same quarter last year. However, on a per barrel of total refinery throughput basis, our Refining, Marketing and Transportation expenses, excluding DD&A, energy-related price effects and bank service charges, were down about 12% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Again, primarily due to our expanded Garyville facility, our average data refinery crude oil throughput increased 28% from the second quarter last year to the second quarter 2002 (sic) [2010] to 1,229,000 barrels per day. And as I previously mentioned, average daily total throughput increased 20% to 1,393,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2010 as compared to 1,158,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2009. Our Refinery and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.1337 per gallon is based on a total consolidated refined products volume sold of 1,610,000 barrels per day or about 6.2 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed in excess of $0.013 to this margin.
Speedway SuperAmerica's light product and merchandise gross margin combined was about $43 million higher in the second quarter 2010 compared to the second quarter 2009. The increase was primarily due to a higher gasoline and distillate margins, which increased from $0.1051 per gallon in the second quarter 2009 to $0.1328 per gallon in the second quarter 2010. Speedway SuperAmerica's same-store merchandise sales increased approximately 4%, while same-store gasoline volumes increased 5% quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 13 provides historical performance indicators for the Downstream business and previously discussed LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. 
Slide 14 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first half of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, before changes in our working capital, was slightly over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes of $202 million. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, and dividends paid totaled $350 million, while asset disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion. And finally, debt was reduced by $625 million. 
As shown on Slide 15, at the end of the second quarter of 2010, our cash-adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 20%. And as a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $239 million of debt serviced by U.S. Steel. Before we open the call to questions, we remind you that to accommodate all who wish to ask questions, you'd please limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. 
Nancy, with that, we will now open the call to questions."

I realize there's a lot of uncertainties in terms of how the regulations and such things will play out. But if smaller or other companies are less interested, is this an area you'd be willing or looking to grow in? Is this an area you want to maintain your presence and your focus elsewhere because risks might be higher? Can you probably comment on how you're thinking about your Gulf of Mexico exposure going forward?"

So until we understand where the regulations are going to go, it's very difficult for us to predict what our response to our own business is going to be. Now, we've said consistently this is one of the most valuable provinces in the world because of the fact that it represents one of the most stable and attractive fiscal regimes. And if that changes, then our outlook, relative to that basin, will also have to change because, obviously, we want to protect our shareholders. That being said, we think we continue to believe this is an incredibly important province for the United States in terms of its energy security. We expect whatever hopefully happens out of the government to be reasonable. And our expectation is that we'll continue to be interested in doing business in the Gulf of Mexico, and I wouldn't speculate on what other operators are going to do and what our appetite might be for those opportunities."

I think one of the things that we've said is we have always understood that for cleanup costs that there is a little bit of liability today. And so I think that's one of the things that all of the companies understand very clearly. The issue is the attached liabilities, should there be some sort of mechanism to limit a company's exposure there unless they are indeed found negligent, in which case, again, the cap doesn't apply. So we're going to watch that very carefully. And I think one of the things that we've been involved in directly with our peers is trying to set up mechanisms whereby the industry can come together to not only work on some of the concerns that the government has in terms of prevention and response in the future, but also making sure that this base scenario remains open to a large number of companies through some sort of shared risk mechanism. We think that's very important because we think not only that supermajors and the majors like Marathon have a lot to offer in this basin but obviously, some of the independents do as well."

We, obviously, will be watching, and we'll register the appropriate concerns as we see how this moratorium and potential further extension because it might apply. But clearly, from an exploration discovery to development perspective, we were talking about a five- to seven-year period anyway, and so that's certainly something that we can be slightly more sanguine about if these events were interfering in production activities. We had said previously that we were ramping up in the Bakken. It had nothing to do with the potential reallocation from the Gulf of Mexico. We've added some acreage this year. We're going to six rigs. We've added the fifth. We'll see the sixth here in the next quarter. We're looking at other opportunities as much as other people are, but that's really a part of our business. But clearly, we are focused on Lower 48 liquid activities."

We're repairing a surface separator on the Bullwinkle Platform that interrupted our flow-back tests. I can tell you that the first well, we saw rates of about 20,000 barrels a day. The second well, we saw 22,000 barrels a day. These are growth numbers, and we've got one more well that we're going to run through the test before we see what we expect will be continuous production by the end of the month. So production area's kind of up and down on a day-to-day basis. The Ozona is a well that's basically drilled and temporarily abandoned. So all we have to go back to do now is set subsea tree, which we expect to have delivery on in the next quarter, and then go back in and actually do the completion work. So there's nothing spectacular that's going to have to happen there. Along the way, before it comes on and till what we're projecting in the third quarter really has to do with some timing issues of rig deliveries and also some of the surface modifications that the host operator has to make on the Auger platform.

Obviously, you only create value if the projects which you're investing in yield a rate of return that makes up your cost of capital. So that's number one in terms of the best use of our cash. But to the extent that we have excess cash beyond that, as said, we want to keep a strong balance sheet. But the dividend, we've always said is a high priority for us. We've got a dividend yield in excess of 3% and it's something that our board revisits every quarter. I don't foresee the stock buyback coming back on the table any time soon."

Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, fourth quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you will find useful.
On Slide 3, you'll see that our third quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $711 million was a 10% decrease from the second quarter of 2010 but a 63% increase from the third quarter of 2009.
The decrease from the second quarter was largely driven by the effect of reduced RM&T segment income. The increase in the year-over-year third quarter earnings reflects improved business results for most segments, the largest of which was the improvement in our Downstream operations as a result of increased refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and higher refining volumes. 
Slide 4 provides details on the changes which resulted in the 10% decrease in second to third quarter adjusted net income. Pretax income increased for all three Upstream segments, while RM&T saw a decrease. Income taxes and other items netted to a nominal negative impact.
As shown on Slide 5, we had an 18% quarter-to-quarter increase in E&P segment income as a result of higher hydrocarbon sales and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A. Higher income from lower tax jurisdictions contributed to the lower E&P effective tax rate of 53% for the third quarter.
Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights the $1.13 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, driven by the $0.73 per barrel decrease in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations increased $0.08 per mcf quarter-to-quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 3% from the second quarter and 9% from the third quarter last year. Third quarter production available for sale increased 8% from the second quarter and over 3% from the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we were underlifted in Europe by 12,000 BOE per day and overlifted in EG by about 4,000 BOE per day. As of the end of the quarter, on a cumulative basis, we were 700,000 BOE underlifted in Europe and 2.4 million BOE underlifted in Alaska, with the rest of our operations being in a relatively balanced position.
Turning to Slide 8, third quarter E&P segment income per BOE increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010, and was down slightly from the year ago quarter.
Slide 9 shows that field level controllable costs per BOE have remained relatively flat for the last several quarters, while exploration expenses per BOE dropped significantly this quarter, primarily driven by lower dry well expense in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, the improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income third quarter to second quarter was primarily a result of higher volumes and lower turnaround costs. The third quarter saw the return of the full quarter of operations at the Muskeg River Mine, as well as production from the Jackpine Mine, which began a phase start-up in the third quarter. The negative $61 million change in derivatives reflects the change from a gain of $53 million in the second quarter to a loss of $8 million in the third quarter. 
For our Downstream business. Starting with Slide 11, I will compare our third quarter results against the same quarter in 2009 because of the seasonality in that business.
Third quarter 2010 segment income increased 80% from the same quarter last year. This was driven by higher margins and volumes, as well as better results at SSA, partially offset by income taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.
Slide 12 provides the details for both volumes and margins in the refining side of this business. The quarter's year-over-year crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS, primarily due to the increase in the sweet/sour differential of $2.44 per barrel. Our total throughputs were up over 21% quarter-over-quarter, primarily because of the Garyville Major Expansion.
Our Refining and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.0921 per gallon is based on the total consolidated refined products sold of 1,681,000 barrels per day or about 6.5 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed approximately $0.011 per gallon to this margin, which is in line with our previous projections based on the  Mars 2-1-1 crack spread. And to finish out segment reporting, the Integrated Gas segment income was $41 million compared to the $24 million recorded in the second quarter 2010.
Slide 13 provides a analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first nine months of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $3.5 billion, which is net of a $240 million pension fund contribution. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes from continuing operations of $560 million, primarily driven by Downstream operations. However, we expect to generate positive cash flow from working capital in the fourth quarter.
Year-to-date, cash capital expenditures have been $3.6 billion, disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion, dividends paid have been $526 million and debt repayments for the year have been $628 million. The cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $1.6 billion.
As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%. And as a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $235 million of debt service by U.S. steel. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010, excluding special items and the effect to foreign currency remeasurements of our tax balances. 
I'll now turn it over to Clarence for some additional comments."

As you now have seen, Marathon's operating and financial performance in the third quarter was strong, registering a 63% increase in adjusted net income over the same quarter of 2009. And while we talk primarily about earnings and margins and volumes, I want to credit our employees for their continued focus on safe, reliable operations and controlling costs.
We are, of course, disappointed by a more rapid and expected production decline in Droshky, and Dave Roberts will address that in some detail with you in just a moment. But I think it's important to view this one disappointment in the context of our overall solid Upstream business which will still achieve our promised 4% compound average growth rate in production from 2008 to 2011.
Although I know some have been concerned about a lack of visibility for our production beyond 2011, we are now able to forecast an additional 5% organic growth, and that's primarily liquids, from 2011 to 2012. And as Dave will tell you in a moment, this growth is from ongoing projects, assets and opportunities in our portfolio. 
But we're not standing still. We continue to build our position for organic growth beyond 2012 in key assets like the Bakken, the Anadarko Woodford and other unconventional liquid plays and in new exploration areas like Poland and Kurdistan.
As for our 2010 capital and exploration spending, we expect to spend our budgeted amount of about $5.2 billion. And while we won't announce our final capital plans for 2011 and beyond until our board approves them in January, I can tell you we expect ongoing CapEx to be in the $5.5 billion per year range that we've outlined for you before.
Consistent with what we've done in the past, we're continuing to high grade our Upstream portfolio, and they sell or joint venture certain assets to reduce risk and/or generate funds for redeployment. And to the extent we generate free cash flow in excess of our spending, our priorities continue to be maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return cash to our shareholders.
And now I'll turn it over to Dave for more details on Droshky and our overall Upstream business."
314842,114672444,84522,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Clarence. The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanction budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. And inherent risk in the produc",929,"Thanks, Clarence. The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanction budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. And inherent risk in the products of this type, reservoir compartmentalization, as well as an apparent lack of aquifer support, have been larger factors than anticipated. 
The Droshky development was modeled based on a nearby analog field, Aspen , that we had direct evidence was in pressure communication with our field. Based on the pressure, flow and aquifer support history at Aspen, we anticipated similar reservoir performance at Droshky.
The analysis we've done and continue to do shows the initial and subsequent engineerings have been carried out in the professional and quality manner, and I'm at present hard-pressed to offer could've-should've-would've scenario for this development.
As our pressures have fallen more rapidly than anticipated, we recognized our recoveries are going to be lower and our volume projections will have to be modified as well. Droshky averaged net 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter and is estimated to average net 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect as reported our full year 2010 Upstream production to be approximately 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a testament, I think, to the overall strength of our global portfolio.
In 2011, Droshky is expected to produce an average of net 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we're guiding to $70 per barrel as a representative of DD&A rate for the remainder of 2010. We'll give further guidance for 2011 as appropriate.
Importantly, however, our portfolio is increasingly robust, and as Clarence said, our ability to sustain our production growth is intact. I have included Slide 15 in the pack to reflect our previous commitment to production growth of at least 4% over the periods 2008 to 2011, a commitment we will meet. 
To address some apparent confusion over this slide, we consistently measure our production projections based on our ongoing business, removing the effects of A&D. This methodology ensures our business remains focused on profitable growth and continued portfolio management for value.
2008 Upstream production, excluding divestitures, was approximately 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with our projected growth, actual gives the CAGR of 4.5% for 2008 through our midpoint 2011 projection.
More importantly, turning to Slide 16, we show that we expect production in 2012 to grow by 5% over 2011, with the majority of this growth being liquids. The production increases will come from our existing positions in Canada, the Bakken and Angola, as well as beginning contributions from new positions we are taking in both existing and new unconventional oil plays in North America. And we're positioning the company for further growth into the future.
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to report that Marathon has in 2010 increased its acreage in the Anadarko Woodford play, mostly in the liquids-rich portion to almost 75,000 acres, with further line of sight to over 100,000 acres in the near term. We've also acquired over 120,000 acres in the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of Colorado and Wyoming. In addition, we've increased our Bakken position to almost 400,000 acres.
As we've said before, one of the attractions of these unconventional plays is the ability to dial up or dial down activity as needed. The large and growing number of future locations we list on this map is a great well stock, one that today we're using eight rigs to prosecute, but we could expect the number to potentially double in the next two years. And as opportunities remain, our acreage acquisitions continue in all of these plays, as well as others in North American unconventional liquids.
We are in many ways transitioning the portfolio, balancing the large projects we have in our international business, and those we expect to deliver from impact exploration with repeatable and sustainable unconventional businesses largely in North America.
Finally, on Slide 18, I highlight our most recent impact exploration play, the Kurdish Region of Iraq. The opportunity offers both near and long-term potential to Marathon. With two wells currently drilling in our licensed areas, the potential for production as early as 2016 is achievable, and we believe a minimum success case could yield 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of this decade, with total exposures for Marathon of over 400 million barrels of net resources.
Also, in the area of impact exploration, many of you will certainly be wondering about our Indonesian program and our progress there. We continue to drill the Bravo prospect, a high risk but large structure on the Pasangkayu block. We have been slowed at first because of mechanical issues on the rig, which have been remedied, and then by geologic challenges, which similarly impacted the Romeo prospect suspended in September. On Bravo, we are now roughly at half the well total depth at this point and expect the conclusion of this well later in this month.
All in, it's a quarter of considerable success tempered by Droshky. What we are most pleased with is the resilience our base of assets provides us in terms of meeting our goals and the continued evolution of our business as we add more exposure to unconventional plays, especially those rich in liquids, and new impact areas in exploration, both of which had confidence to our projection that we can sustain 3% to 5% growth well beyond 2012."

But one of the key things that we watch is the margin associated with these barrels, and then particularly in light of Droshky, if you look at your margin in the U.S. this quarter. It basically traveled some help from exploration, but when asked the margin, Droshky played a part. As you look at your incremental production growth over the next year or so, the top line growth is one thing. But you have a portfolio dominated by very low margin assets, Libya, Norway, EG gas, I guess. What is the top line growth? How does it translate to margin at the bottom line in terms of how you see the contribution from Oil Sands, Angola and so on?"

But obviously, that is going to feature. From 2011 to '12, what we would say is that our top to bottom, the top five growth areas year-to-year are going to be Angola, the Woodford play, Bakken, Ozona and followed lastly by Oil Sands Mining. So four of those five areas we would think are going to be much stronger margin plays. So '10 to '11, I take your point. But '11 to '12 and beyond, particularly, as we view the strength of the liquids unconventional in the United States, we think we're going to have pretty good margin growth as well."

And you've seen this from some of our competitors in the basin in terms of being able to acquire and the cost of services. So we're going to be very prudent about trying to accelerate our growth there. We're pretty happy with the growth that we're getting.

One of the things that we're going to be doing this winter is engaging in a pretty thorough delineation drilling program around our Birchwood assets. So we'll have some information that we'll put into our reservoirs team's hands beginning late the winter spring of next year to determine what we actually have there because we think, a, it's 100%. We think it's a pretty good prospect from what we've seen once we get some of the drilling done. We'll be able to see if that actually is going to feature heavily in our plans on a go-forward basis.

On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Heminger, Executive Vice President, Downstream; Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Garry Peiffer, Senior Vice President of Finance and Commercial Services, Downstream.
Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, fourth quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you will find useful.
On Slide 3, you'll see that our third quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $711 million was a 10% decrease from the second quarter of 2010 but a 63% increase from the third quarter of 2009.
The decrease from the second quarter was largely driven by the effect of reduced RM&T segment income. The increase in the year-over-year third quarter earnings reflects improved business results for most segments, the largest of which was the improvement in our Downstream operations as a result of increased refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and higher refining volumes. 
Slide 4 provides details on the changes which resulted in the 10% decrease in second to third quarter adjusted net income. Pretax income increased for all three Upstream segments, while RM&T saw a decrease. Income taxes and other items netted to a nominal negative impact.
As shown on Slide 5, we had an 18% quarter-to-quarter increase in E&P segment income as a result of higher hydrocarbon sales and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A. Higher income from lower tax jurisdictions contributed to the lower E&P effective tax rate of 53% for the third quarter.
Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights the $1.13 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, driven by the $0.73 per barrel decrease in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations increased $0.08 per mcf quarter-to-quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 3% from the second quarter and 9% from the third quarter last year. Third quarter production available for sale increased 8% from the second quarter and over 3% from the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we were underlifted in Europe by 12,000 BOE per day and overlifted in EG by about 4,000 BOE per day. As of the end of the quarter, on a cumulative basis, we were 700,000 BOE underlifted in Europe and 2.4 million BOE underlifted in Alaska, with the rest of our operations being in a relatively balanced position.
Turning to Slide 8, third quarter E&P segment income per BOE increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010, and was down slightly from the year ago quarter.
Slide 9 shows that field level controllable costs per BOE have remained relatively flat for the last several quarters, while exploration expenses per BOE dropped significantly this quarter, primarily driven by lower dry well expense in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, the improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income third quarter to second quarter was primarily a result of higher volumes and lower turnaround costs. The third quarter saw the return of the full quarter of operations at the Muskeg River Mine, as well as production from the Jackpine Mine, which began a phase start-up in the third quarter. The negative $61 million change in derivatives reflects the change from a gain of $53 million in the second quarter to a loss of $8 million in the third quarter. 
For our Downstream business. Starting with Slide 11, I will compare our third quarter results against the same quarter in 2009 because of the seasonality in that business.
Third quarter 2010 segment income increased 80% from the same quarter last year. This was driven by higher margins and volumes, as well as better results at SSA, partially offset by income taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.
Slide 12 provides the details for both volumes and margins in the refining side of this business. The quarter's year-over-year crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS, primarily due to the increase in the sweet/sour differential of $2.44 per barrel. Our total throughputs were up over 21% quarter-over-quarter, primarily because of the Garyville Major Expansion.
Our Refining and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.0921 per gallon is based on the total consolidated refined products sold of 1,681,000 barrels per day or about 6.5 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed approximately $0.011 per gallon to this margin, which is in line with our previous projections based on the  Mars 2-1-1 crack spread. And to finish out segment reporting, the Integrated Gas segment income was $41 million compared to the $24 million recorded in the second quarter 2010.
Slide 13 provides a analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first nine months of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $3.5 billion, which is net of a $240 million pension fund contribution. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes from continuing operations of $560 million, primarily driven by Downstream operations. However, we expect to generate positive cash flow from working capital in the fourth quarter.
Year-to-date, cash capital expenditures have been $3.6 billion, disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion, dividends paid have been $526 million and debt repayments for the year have been $628 million. The cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $1.6 billion.
As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%. And as a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $235 million of debt service by U.S. steel. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010, excluding special items and the effect to foreign currency remeasurements of our tax balances. 
I'll now turn it over to Clarence for some additional comments.

As you now have seen, Marathon's operating and financial performance in the third quarter was strong, registering a 63% increase in adjusted net income over the same quarter of 2009. And while we talk primarily about earnings and margins and volumes, I want to credit our employees for their continued focus on safe, reliable operations and controlling costs.
We are, of course, disappointed by a more rapid and expected production decline in Droshky, and Dave Roberts will address that in some detail with you in just a moment. But I think it's important to view this one disappointment in the context of our overall solid Upstream business which will still achieve our promised 4% compound average growth rate in production from 2008 to 2011.
Although I know some have been concerned about a lack of visibility for our production beyond 2011, we are now able to forecast an additional 5% organic growth, and that's primarily liquids, from 2011 to 2012. And as Dave will tell you in a moment, this growth is from ongoing projects, assets and opportunities in our portfolio. 
But we're not standing still. We continue to build our position for organic growth beyond 2012 in key assets like the Bakken, the Anadarko Woodford and other unconventional liquid plays and in new exploration areas like Poland and Kurdistan.
As for our 2010 capital and exploration spending, we expect to spend our budgeted amount of about $5.2 billion. And while we won't announce our final capital plans for 2011 and beyond until our board approves them in January, I can tell you we expect ongoing CapEx to be in the $5.5 billion per year range that we've outlined for you before.
Consistent with what we've done in the past, we're continuing to high grade our Upstream portfolio, and they sell or joint venture certain assets to reduce risk and/or generate funds for redeployment. And to the extent we generate free cash flow in excess of our spending, our priorities continue to be maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return cash to our shareholders.
And now I'll turn it over to Dave for more details on Droshky and our overall Upstream business.

And inherent risk in the produc",929,"Thanks, Clarence. The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanction budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. And inherent risk in the products of this type, reservoir compartmentalization, as well as an apparent lack of aquifer support, have been larger factors than anticipated. 
The Droshky development was modeled based on a nearby analog field, Aspen , that we had direct evidence was in pressure communication with our field. Based on the pressure, flow and aquifer support history at Aspen, we anticipated similar reservoir performance at Droshky.
The analysis we've done and continue to do shows the initial and subsequent engineerings have been carried out in the professional and quality manner, and I'm at present hard-pressed to offer could've-should've-would've scenario for this development.
As our pressures have fallen more rapidly than anticipated, we recognized our recoveries are going to be lower and our volume projections will have to be modified as well. Droshky averaged net 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter and is estimated to average net 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect as reported our full year 2010 Upstream production to be approximately 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a testament, I think, to the overall strength of our global portfolio.
In 2011, Droshky is expected to produce an average of net 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we're guiding to $70 per barrel as a representative of DD&A rate for the remainder of 2010. We'll give further guidance for 2011 as appropriate.
Importantly, however, our portfolio is increasingly robust, and as Clarence said, our ability to sustain our production growth is intact. I have included Slide 15 in the pack to reflect our previous commitment to production growth of at least 4% over the periods 2008 to 2011, a commitment we will meet. 
To address some apparent confusion over this slide, we consistently measure our production projections based on our ongoing business, removing the effects of A&D. This methodology ensures our business remains focused on profitable growth and continued portfolio management for value.
2008 Upstream production, excluding divestitures, was approximately 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with our projected growth, actual gives the CAGR of 4.5% for 2008 through our midpoint 2011 projection.
More importantly, turning to Slide 16, we show that we expect production in 2012 to grow by 5% over 2011, with the majority of this growth being liquids. The production increases will come from our existing positions in Canada, the Bakken and Angola, as well as beginning contributions from new positions we are taking in both existing and new unconventional oil plays in North America. And we're positioning the company for further growth into the future.
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to report that Marathon has in 2010 increased its acreage in the Anadarko Woodford play, mostly in the liquids-rich portion to almost 75,000 acres, with further line of sight to over 100,000 acres in the near term. We've also acquired over 120,000 acres in the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of Colorado and Wyoming. In addition, we've increased our Bakken position to almost 400,000 acres.
As we've said before, one of the attractions of these unconventional plays is the ability to dial up or dial down activity as needed. The large and growing number of future locations we list on this map is a great well stock, one that today we're using eight rigs to prosecute, but we could expect the number to potentially double in the next two years. And as opportunities remain, our acreage acquisitions continue in all of these plays, as well as others in North American unconventional liquids.
We are in many ways transitioning the portfolio, balancing the large projects we have in our international business, and those we expect to deliver from impact exploration with repeatable and sustainable unconventional businesses largely in North America.
Finally, on Slide 18, I highlight our most recent impact exploration play, the Kurdish Region of Iraq. The opportunity offers both near and long-term potential to Marathon. With two wells currently drilling in our licensed areas, the potential for production as early as 2016 is achievable, and we believe a minimum success case could yield 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of this decade, with total exposures for Marathon of over 400 million barrels of net resources.
Also, in the area of impact exploration, many of you will certainly be wondering about our Indonesian program and our progress there. We continue to drill the Bravo prospect, a high risk but large structure on the Pasangkayu block. We have been slowed at first because of mechanical issues on the rig, which have been remedied, and then by geologic challenges, which similarly impacted the Romeo prospect suspended in September. On Bravo, we are now roughly at half the well total depth at this point and expect the conclusion of this well later in this month.
All in, it's a quarter of considerable success tempered by Droshky. What we are most pleased with is the resilience our base of assets provides us in terms of meeting our goals and the continued evolution of our business as we add more exposure to unconventional plays, especially those rich in liquids, and new impact areas in exploration, both of which had confidence to our projection that we can sustain 3% to 5% growth well beyond 2012.

But one of the key things that we watch is the margin associated with these barrels, and then particularly in light of Droshky, if you look at your margin in the U.S. this quarter. It basically traveled some help from exploration, but when asked the margin, Droshky played a part. As you look at your incremental production growth over the next year or so, the top line growth is one thing. But you have a portfolio dominated by very low margin assets, Libya, Norway, EG gas, I guess. What is the top line growth?

But obviously, that is going to feature. From 2011 to '12, what we would say is that our top to bottom, the top five growth areas year-to-year are going to be Angola, the Woodford play, Bakken, Ozona and followed lastly by Oil Sands Mining. So four of those five areas we would think are going to be much stronger margin plays. So '10 to '11, I take your point.

And right now, we're very comfortable with the logistics service profile that we have out there in terms of being able to deliver our program. So just building rate is a secondary concern to us.

So you can imagine an unconsolidated formation of fairly large rocks. And this is somewhat unusual to be below the surface. But it's roughly 6,000 feet of depth is where we've encountered this. And that caused us some of our drilling concerns as we move forward. We basically moved off of Romeo, and we will return to that prospect probably in a different wellbore. We believe we're past it in Bravo now, and so we'll be back to normal drilling. The next couple of weeks will tell that tale. We've learned a lot about how to deal with that, and so we'll move forward. For 2011, we have two slots on the rig that we have contracted. One of the things that we'll look at is whether we'll drill additional wells around Bravo, depending on what the results are. We certainly would anticipate going back to Romeo with one of those slots. And we look at getting into Bone Bay either late next year or early 2012.

But I think what we would say is we're hopeful that as companies like Marathon make an entry into this play, that more companies that provide oilfield services and larger companies will flow into this arena, giving operators broader choices and service providers and also cost options. So that's part of the issue around infrastructure, and one that we're not uncomfortable with now but certainly, we would like to see improved just like we do in all the basins we'd like to operate in. I think the key thing is going to be export capacity and how ultimately Kurdistan either accesses the pipelines in broader Iraq or comes up with alternatives that will allow them to secure their own export around. There is no question that all these stuff is going to continue to go north to the Turkish lines that run across. That's been the historic province there. It's certainly one that will be support. But that's going to be the critical issue in terms of developing oil and gas export infrastructure.

Just to give an example, towards the latter part of this year, the new mine up there we think could produce anywhere on a gross basis a bitumen between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. That's a pretty big range just because it's a startup process. And then as the upgrader comes in, the real question is, is how quickly do you step-up to that 100,000 barrels a day there. So I would say that once we get a little bit more clarity on that in the first quarter of next year, my guess is the ranges will start coming in because there's not a lot of other moving parts.

Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, fourth quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you will find useful.
On Slide 3, you'll see that our third quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $711 million was a 10% decrease from the second quarter of 2010 but a 63% increase from the third quarter of 2009.
The decrease from the second quarter was largely driven by the effect of reduced RM&T segment income. The increase in the year-over-year third quarter earnings reflect improved business results for most segments, the largest of which was the improvement in our Downstream operations as a result of increased refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and higher refining volumes. 
Slide 4 provides details on the changes which resulted in the 10% decrease in second to third quarter adjusted net income. Pretax income increased for all three Upstream segments, while RM&T saw a decrease. Income taxes and other items netted to a nominal negative impact.
As shown on Slide 5, we had an 18% quarter-to-quarter increase in E&P segment income as a result of higher hydrocarbon sales and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A. Higher income from lower tax jurisdictions contributed to the lower E&P effective tax rate of 53% for the third quarter.
Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights the $1.13 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, driven by the $0.73 per barrel decrease in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations increased $0.08 per mcf quarter-to-quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 3% from the second quarter and 9% from the third quarter last year. Third quarter production available for sale increased 8% from the second quarter and over 3% from the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we were underlifted in Europe by 12,000 BOE per day and overlifted in EG by about 4,000 BOE per day. As of the end of the quarter, on a cumulative basis, we were 700,000 BOE underlifted in Europe and 2.4 million BOE underlifted in Alaska, with the rest of our operations being in a relatively balanced position.
Turning to Slide 8, third quarter E&P segment income per BOE increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010, and was down slightly from the year ago quarter.
Slide 9 shows that field level controllable costs per BOE have remained relatively flat the last several quarters, while exploration expenses per BOE dropped significantly this quarter, primarily driven by lower dry well expense in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, the improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income third quarter to second quarter was primarily a result of higher volumes and lower turnaround costs. The third quarter saw the return of a full quarter of operations at the Muskeg River Mine, as well as production from the Jackpine Mine, which began a phased start-up in the third quarter. The negative $61 million change in derivatives reflects the change from a gain of $53 million in the second quarter to a loss of $8 million in the third quarter. 
For our Downstream business, starting with Slide 11, I will compare our third quarter results against the same quarter in 2009 because of the seasonality in that business.
Third quarter 2010 segment income increased 80% from the same quarter last year. This was driven by higher margins and volumes, as well as better results at SSA, partially offset by income taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.
Slide 12 provides the details for both volumes and margins in the refining side of this business. The quarter's year-over-year crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS, primarily due to the increase in the sweet/sour differential of $2.44 per barrel. Our total throughputs were up over 21% quarter-over-quarter, primarily because of the Garyville Major Expansion.
Our Refining and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.0921 per gallon is based on the total consolidated refined products sold of 1,681,000 barrels per day or about 6.5 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed approximately $0.011 per gallon to this margin, which is in line with our previous projections based on the Mars 2-1-1 crack spread. And to finish out segment reporting, the Integrated Gas segment income was $41 million compared to the $24 million recorded in the second quarter 2010.
Slide 13 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first nine months of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $3.5 billion, which is net of a $240 million pension fund contribution. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes from continuing operations of $560 million, primarily driven by Downstream operations. However, we expect to generate positive cash flow from working capital in the fourth quarter.
Year-to-date, cash capital expenditures have been $3.6 billion, disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion, dividends paid have been $526 million and debt repayments for the year have been $628 million. The cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $1.6 billion.
As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%. And as a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $235 million of debt serviced by U.S. steel. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances. 
I'll now turn it over to Clarence for some additional comments."

As you now have seen, Marathon's operating and financial performance in the third quarter was strong, registering a 63% increase in adjusted net income over the same quarter of 2009. And while we talk primarily about earnings and margins and volumes, I want to credit our employees for their continued focus on safe, reliable operations and controlling costs.
We are, of course, disappointed by a more rapid than expected production decline at Droshky, and Dave Roberts will address that in some detail with you in just a moment. But I think it's important to view this one disappointment in the context of our overall solid Upstream business which will still achieve our promised 4% compound average growth rate in production from 2008 to 2011.
Although I know some have been concerned about a lack of visibility for our production beyond 2011, we are now able to forecast an additional 5% organic growth, and that's primarily liquids, from 2011 to 2012. And as Dave will tell you in a moment, this growth is from ongoing projects, assets and opportunities in our portfolio. 
But we're not standing still. We continue to build our position for organic growth beyond 2012 in key assets like the Bakken, the Anadarko Woodford and other unconventional liquids plays and in new exploration areas like Poland and Kurdistan.
As for our 2010 capital and exploration spending, we expect to spend our budgeted amount of about $5.2 billion. And while we won't announce our final capital plans for 2011 and beyond until our board approves them in January, I can tell you we expect ongoing CapEx to be in the $5.5 billion per year range that we've outlined for you before.
Consistent with what we've done in the past, we're continuing to high grade our Upstream portfolio, and may sell or joint venture certain assets to reduce risk and/or generate funds for redeployment. And to the extent we generate free cash flow in excess of our spending, our priorities continue to be maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return cash to our shareholders.
And now I'll turn it over to Dave for more details on Droshky and our overall Upstream business."

The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanctioned budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. An inherent risk in a project",927,"Thanks, Clarence. The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanctioned budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. An inherent risk in a project of this type, reservoir compartmentalization, as well as an apparent lack of aquifer support, have been larger factors than anticipated. 
The Droshky development was modeled based on a nearby analog field, Aspen, that we had direct evidence was in pressure communication with our field. Based on the pressure, flow and aquifer support history at Aspen, we anticipated similar reservoir performance at Droshky.
The analysis we've done and continue to do shows the initial and subsequent engineerings have been carried out in a professional and quality manner, and I'm at present hard-pressed to offer a could've-should've-would've scenario for this development.
As our pressures have fallen more rapidly than anticipated, we recognize our recoveries are going to be lower and our volume projections will have to be modified as well. Droshky averaged net 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter and is estimated to average net 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect as reported our full year 2010 Upstream production to be approximately 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a testament, I think, to the overall strength of our global portfolio.
In 2011, Droshky is expected to produce an average of net 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we're guiding to $70 per barrel as a representative of DD&A rate for the remainder of 2010. We'll give further guidance for 2011 as appropriate.
Importantly, however, our portfolio is increasingly robust, and as Clarence said, our ability to sustain our production growth is intact. I have included Slide 15 in the pack to reflect our previous commitment to production growth of at least 4% over the period 2008 to 2011, a commitment we will meet. 
To address some apparent confusion over this slide, we consistently measure our production projections based on our ongoing business, removing the effects of A&D. This methodology ensures our business remains focused on profitable growth and continued portfolio management for value.
2008 Upstream production, excluding divestitures, was approximately 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with our projected growth, actual gives a CAGR of 4 ½% for 2008 through our midpoint 2011 projection.
More importantly, turning to Slide 16, we show that we expect production in 2012 to grow by 5% over 2011, with the majority of this growth being liquids. The production increases will come from our existing positions in Canada, the Bakken and Angola, as well as beginning contributions from new positions we’ve taken in both existing and new unconventional oil plays in North America. And we're positioning the company for further growth into the future.
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to report that Marathon has in 2010 increased its acreage in the Anadarko Woodford play, mostly in the liquids-rich portion to almost 75,000 acres, with further line of sight to over 100,000 acres in the near-term. We've also acquired over 120,000 acres in the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of Colorado and Wyoming. In addition, we've increased our Bakken position to almost 400,000 acres.
As we've said before, one of the attractions of these unconventional plays is the ability to dial up or dial down activity as needed. The large and growing number of future locations we list on this map is a great well stock, one that today we're using eight rigs to prosecute, but we could expect the number to potentially double in the next two years. And as opportunities remain, our acreage acquisitions continue in all these plays, as well as others in North American unconventional liquids.
We are in many ways transitioning the portfolio, balancing the large projects we have in our international business, and those we expect to deliver from impact exploration with repeatable and sustainable unconventional businesses largely in North America.
Finally, on Slide 18, I highlight our most recent impact exploration play, the Kurdish Region of Iraq. The opportunity offers both near- and long-term potential for Marathon. With two wells currently drilling in our licensed areas, the potential for production as early as 2016 is achievable, and we believe a minimum success case could yield 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of this decade, with total exposures for Marathon of over 400 million barrels of net resources.
Also, in the area of impact exploration, many of you will certainly be wondering about our Indonesian program and our progress there. We continue to drill the Bravo prospect, a high risk but large structure on the Pasangkayu block. We have been slowed at first because of mechanical issues on the rig, which have been remedied, and then by geologic challenges, which similarly impacted the Romeo prospect suspended in September. On Bravo, we are now roughly at half the well’s total depth at this point and expect the conclusion of this well later in this month.
All in, it's a quarter of considerable success tempered by Droshky. What we are most pleased with is the resilience our base of assets provides us in terms of meeting our goals and the continued evolution of our business as we add more exposure to unconventional plays, especially those rich in liquids, and new impact areas in exploration, both of which add confidence to our projection that we can sustain 3% to 5% growth well beyond 2012."

The first one is that, I guess as you look at your new production guidance, there really hasn't changed a whole heck of a lot since your strategy, Dave. And the additional color in 2010 is appreciated. But one of the key things that we watch is the margin associated with these barrels, and particularly in light of Droshky, if you look at your margin in the U.S. this quarter. It basically trebled. Some help from exploration, but when as to margin, Droshky played a part. As you look at your incremental production growth over the next year or so, the top line growth is one thing. But you have a portfolio dominated by very low margin assets, Libya, Norway, EG gas, I guess. What is the top line growth? How does it translate to margin at the bottom line in terms of how you see the contribution from Oil Sands, Angola and so on?"

And so you would expect that margin to be a big driver from 2010 to 2011. But we do have substantial growth out of the Bakken as well, which are better margins. But obviously, that is going to feature. From 2011 to '12, what we would say is that our top to bottom, the top five growth areas year-to-year are going to be Angola, the Woodford play, Bakken, Ozona and followed lastly by Oil Sands Mining. So four of those five areas we would think are going to be much stronger margin plays. So '10 to '11, I take your point. But '11 to '12 and beyond, particularly as we view the strength of the liquids, unconventionals, in the United States, we think we're going to have pretty good margin growth as well."

And you've seen this from some of our competitors in the basin in terms of being able to acquire and the cost of services. So we're going to be very prudent about trying to accelerate our growth there. We're pretty happy with the growth that we're getting.

I guess, what we would say without getting into too much technical detail, what we've run into in Indonesia is essentially a rubble field. So you can imagine an unconsolidated formation of fairly large rocks. And this is somewhat unusual to be below the surface. But it's at roughly 6,000 feet of depth is where we've encountered this. And that caused us some of our drilling concerns as we’ve moved forward. We basically moved off of Romeo, and we will return to that prospect probably in a different wellbore. We believe we're past it in Bravo now, and so we'll be back to normal drilling. The next couple of weeks will tell that tale. We've learned a lot about how to deal with that, and so we'll move forward. For 2011, we have two slots on the rig that we have contracted. One of the things that we'll look at is whether we'll drill additional wells around Bravo, depending on what the results are. We certainly would anticipate going back to Romeo with one of those slots. And we look at getting into Bone Bay either late next year or early 2012."

And we remain very upbeat about the potential that we have in that portfolio. We have submitted regional plans to the government to start the process of getting back to work and specific re-permits for Innsbruck, which is the well that we suspended at the start of the moratorium, as well as some of the work that we need to do to permit Ozona because that's obviously something that we need to do in terms of getting that development ready to roll into 2011.

But I think that the critical thing to think about for next year, since it's largely going to be driven by Oil Sands Mining, the real issue is when the upgrader is delivered for the project and when do we get through the shakedown period of time in terms of when that thing actually starts ticking over. Just to give an example, towards the latter part of this year, the new mine up there we think could produce anywhere on a gross basis of bitumen between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. That's a pretty big range just because it's a start-up process. And then as the upgrader comes in, the real question is, is how quickly do you step-up to that 100,000 barrels a day there. So I would say that once we get a little bit more clarity on that in the first quarter of next year, my guess is the ranges will start coming in because there's not a lot of other moving parts."

Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Please note that in the appendix of this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, fourth quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you will find useful.
On Slide 3, you'll see that our third quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $711 million was a 10% decrease from the second quarter of 2010 but a 63% increase from the third quarter of 2009.
The decrease from the second quarter was largely driven by the effect of reduced RM&T segment income. The increase in the year-over-year third quarter earnings reflect improved business results for most segments, the largest of which was the improvement in our Downstream operations as a result of increased refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and higher refining volumes. 
Slide 4 provides details on the changes which resulted in the 10% decrease in second to third quarter adjusted net income. Pretax income increased for all three Upstream segments, while RM&T saw a decrease. Income taxes and other items netted to a nominal negative impact.
As shown on Slide 5, we had an 18% quarter-to-quarter increase in E&P segment income as a result of higher hydrocarbon sales and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A. Higher income from lower tax jurisdictions contributed to the lower E&P effective tax rate of 53% for the third quarter.
Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights the $1.13 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, driven by the $0.73 per barrel decrease in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations increased $0.08 per mcf quarter-to-quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 3% from the second quarter and 9% from the third quarter last year. Third quarter production available for sale increased 8% from the second quarter and over 3% from the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we were underlifted in Europe by 12,000 BOE per day and overlifted in EG by about 4,000 BOE per day. As of the end of the quarter, on a cumulative basis, we were 700,000 BOE underlifted in Europe and 2.4 million BOE underlifted in Alaska, with the rest of our operations being in a relatively balanced position.
Turning to Slide 8, third quarter E&P segment income per BOE increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010, and was down slightly from the year ago quarter.
Slide 9 shows that field level controllable costs per BOE have remained relatively flat the last several quarters, while exploration expenses per BOE dropped significantly this quarter, primarily driven by lower dry well expense in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, the improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income third quarter to second quarter was primarily a result of higher volumes and lower turnaround costs. The third quarter saw the return of a full quarter of operations at the Muskeg River Mine, as well as production from the Jackpine Mine, which began a phased start-up in the third quarter. The negative $61 million change in derivatives reflects the change from a gain of $53 million in the second quarter to a loss of $8 million in the third quarter. 
For our Downstream business, starting with Slide 11, I will compare our third quarter results against the same quarter in 2009 because of the seasonality in that business.
Third quarter 2010 segment income increased 80% from the same quarter last year. This was driven by higher margins and volumes, as well as better results at SSA, partially offset by income taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.
Slide 12 provides the details for both volumes and margins in the refining side of this business. The quarter's year-over-year crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS, primarily due to the increase in the sweet/sour differential of $2.44 per barrel. Our total throughputs were up over 21% quarter-over-quarter, primarily because of the Garyville Major Expansion.
Our Refining and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.0921 per gallon is based on the total consolidated refined products sold of 1,681,000 barrels per day or about 6.5 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed approximately $0.011 per gallon to this margin, which is in line with our previous projections based on the Mars 2-1-1 crack spread. And to finish out segment reporting, the Integrated Gas segment income was $41 million compared to the $24 million recorded in the second quarter 2010.
Slide 13 provides an analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first nine months of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $3.5 billion, which is net of a $240 million pension fund contribution. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes from continuing operations of $560 million, primarily driven by Downstream operations. However, we expect to generate positive cash flow from working capital in the fourth quarter.
Year-to-date, cash capital expenditures have been $3.6 billion, disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion, dividends paid have been $526 million and debt repayments for the year have been $628 million. The cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $1.6 billion.
As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%. And as a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $235 million of debt serviced by U.S. steel. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010, excluding special items and the effect of foreign currency remeasurement of our tax balances. 
I'll now turn it over to Clarence for some additional comments."

And while we talk primarily about earnings and margin",366,"Thank you, Howard. As you now have seen, Marathon's operating and financial performance in the third quarter was strong, registering a 63% increase in adjusted net income over the same quarter of 2009. And while we talk primarily about earnings and margins and volumes, I want to credit our employees for their continued focus on safe, reliable operations and controlling costs.
We are, of course, disappointed by a more rapid than expected production decline at Droshky, and Dave Roberts will address that in some detail with you in just a moment. But I think it's important to view this one disappointment in the context of our overall solid Upstream business which will still achieve our promised 4% compound average growth rate in production from 2008 to 2011.
Although I know some have been concerned about a lack of visibility for our production beyond 2011, we are now able to forecast an additional 5% organic growth, and that's primarily liquids, from 2011 to 2012. And as Dave will tell you in a moment, this growth is from ongoing projects, assets and opportunities in our portfolio. 
But we're not standing still. We continue to build our position for organic growth beyond 2012 in key assets like the Bakken, the Anadarko Woodford and other unconventional liquids plays and in new exploration areas like Poland and Kurdistan.
As for our 2010 capital and exploration spending, we expect to spend our budgeted amount of about $5.2 billion. And while we won't announce our final capital plans for 2011 and beyond until our board approves them in January, I can tell you we expect ongoing CapEx to be in the $5.5 billion per year range that we've outlined for you before.
Consistent with what we've done in the past, we're continuing to high grade our Upstream portfolio, and may sell or joint venture certain assets to reduce risk and/or generate funds for redeployment. And to the extent we generate free cash flow in excess of our spending, our priorities continue to be maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return cash to our shareholders.
And now I'll turn it over to Dave for more details on Droshky and our overall Upstream business."
314842,114672444,84655,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Clarence. The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanctioned budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. An inherent risk in a project",927,"Thanks, Clarence. The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanctioned budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. An inherent risk in a project of this type, reservoir compartmentalization, as well as an apparent lack of aquifer support, have been larger factors than anticipated. 
The Droshky development was modeled based on a nearby analog field, Aspen, that we had direct evidence was in pressure communication with our field. Based on the pressure, flow and aquifer support history at Aspen, we anticipated similar reservoir performance at Droshky.
The analysis we've done and continue to do shows the initial and subsequent engineerings have been carried out in a professional and quality manner, and I'm at present hard-pressed to offer a could've-should've-would've scenario for this development.
As our pressures have fallen more rapidly than anticipated, we recognize our recoveries are going to be lower and our volume projections will have to be modified as well. Droshky averaged net 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter and is estimated to average net 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect as reported our full year 2010 Upstream production to be approximately 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a testament, I think, to the overall strength of our global portfolio.
In 2011, Droshky is expected to produce an average of net 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we're guiding to $70 per barrel as a representative of DD&A rate for the remainder of 2010. We'll give further guidance for 2011 as appropriate.
Importantly, however, our portfolio is increasingly robust, and as Clarence said, our ability to sustain our production growth is intact. I have included Slide 15 in the pack to reflect our previous commitment to production growth of at least 4% over the period 2008 to 2011, a commitment we will meet. 
To address some apparent confusion over this slide, we consistently measure our production projections based on our ongoing business, removing the effects of A&D. This methodology ensures our business remains focused on profitable growth and continued portfolio management for value.
2008 Upstream production, excluding divestitures, was approximately 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with our projected growth, actual gives a CAGR of 4 ½% for 2008 through our midpoint 2011 projection.
More importantly, turning to Slide 16, we show that we expect production in 2012 to grow by 5% over 2011, with the majority of this growth being liquids. The production increases will come from our existing positions in Canada, the Bakken and Angola, as well as beginning contributions from new positions we’ve taken in both existing and new unconventional oil plays in North America. And we're positioning the company for further growth into the future.
Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to report that Marathon has in 2010 increased its acreage in the Anadarko Woodford play, mostly in the liquids-rich portion to almost 75,000 acres, with further line of sight to over 100,000 acres in the near-term. We've also acquired over 120,000 acres in the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of Colorado and Wyoming. In addition, we've increased our Bakken position to almost 400,000 acres.
As we've said before, one of the attractions of these unconventional plays is the ability to dial up or dial down activity as needed. The large and growing number of future locations we list on this map is a great well stock, one that today we're using eight rigs to prosecute, but we could expect the number to potentially double in the next two years. And as opportunities remain, our acreage acquisitions continue in all these plays, as well as others in North American unconventional liquids.
We are in many ways transitioning the portfolio, balancing the large projects we have in our international business, and those we expect to deliver from impact exploration with repeatable and sustainable unconventional businesses largely in North America.
Finally, on Slide 18, I highlight our most recent impact exploration play, the Kurdish Region of Iraq. The opportunity offers both near- and long-term potential for Marathon. With two wells currently drilling in our licensed areas, the potential for production as early as 2016 is achievable, and we believe a minimum success case could yield 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of this decade, with total exposures for Marathon of over 400 million barrels of net resources.
Also, in the area of impact exploration, many of you will certainly be wondering about our Indonesian program and our progress there. We continue to drill the Bravo prospect, a high risk but large structure on the Pasangkayu block. We have been slowed at first because of mechanical issues on the rig, which have been remedied, and then by geologic challenges, which similarly impacted the Romeo prospect suspended in September. On Bravo, we are now roughly at half the well’s total depth at this point and expect the conclusion of this well later in this month.
All in, it's a quarter of considerable success tempered by Droshky. What we are most pleased with is the resilience our base of assets provides us in terms of meeting our goals and the continued evolution of our business as we add more exposure to unconventional plays, especially those rich in liquids, and new impact areas in exploration, both of which add confidence to our projection that we can sustain 3% to 5% growth well beyond 2012."

But one of the key things that we watch is the margin associated with these barrels, and particularly in light of Droshky, if you look at your margin in the U.S. this quarter. It basically trebled. Some help from exploration, but when as to margin, Droshky played a part. As you look at your incremental production growth over the next year or so, the top line growth is one thing. But you have a portfolio dominated by very low margin assets, Libya, Norway, EG gas, I guess. What is the top line growth?

So four of those five areas we would think are going to be much stronger margin plays. So '10 to '11, I take your point.

We have submitted regional plans to the government to start the process of getting back to work and specific re-permits for Innsbruck, which is the well that we suspended at the start of the moratorium, as well as some of the work that we need to do to permit Ozona because that's obviously something that we need to do in terms of getting that development ready to roll into 2011. And we'll follow suit with other permits. And I think the other thing that we would say is the rig that we have under contract is in the Gulf, undergoing acceptance trials. And we'll see how that rig does in terms of its performance. And our view is that we would like to be able to get back to work shortly, but a lot of that depends on how the permitting goes and the acceptance trials of the Noble Jim Day."

But I think that the critical thing to think about for next year, since it's largely going to be driven by Oil Sands Mining, the real issue is when the upgrader is delivered for the project and when do we get through the shakedown period of time in terms of when that thing actually starts ticking over. Just to give an example, towards the latter part of this year, the new mine up there we think could produce anywhere on a gross basis of bitumen between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. That's a pretty big range just because it's a start-up process. And then as the upgrader comes in, the real question is, is how quickly do you step-up to that 100,000 barrels a day there. So I would say that once we get a little bit more clarity on that in the first quarter of next year, my guess is the ranges will start coming in because there's not a lot of other moving parts."

 On the call today are Clarence Cazalot, President and CEO; Janet Clark, Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Heminger, Executive Vice President, Downstream; Dave Roberts, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Garry Peiffer, Senior Vice President of Finance and Commercial Services, Downstream.
 Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our remarks and answers to questions today will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. In accordance with Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Marathon Oil Corporation has included on its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K, cautionary language identifying important factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
 Please note that in the appendix of this presentation, there is a reconciliation of quarterly net income to adjusted net income for 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010, preliminary balance sheet information, fourth quarter and full year 2010 operating estimates and other data that you will find useful.
 On Slide 3, you'll see that our third quarter 2010 adjusted net income of $711 million was a 10% decrease from the second quarter of 2010 but a 63% increase from the third quarter of 2009.
 The decrease from the second quarter was largely driven by the effect of reduced RM&T segment income. The increase in the year-over-year third quarter earnings reflects improved business results for most segments, the largest of which was the improvement in our Downstream operations as a result of increased refining and wholesale marketing gross margin and higher refining volumes.
 Slide 4 provides details on the changes which resulted in the 10% decrease in second to third quarter adjusted net income. Pretax income increased for all three Upstream segments, while RM&T saw a decrease. Income taxes and other items netted to a nominal negative impact.
 As shown on Slide 5, we had an 18% quarter-to-quarter increase in E&P segment income as a result of higher hydrocarbon sales and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A. Higher income from lower tax jurisdictions contributed to the lower E&P effective tax rate of 53% for the third quarter.
 Slide 6 shows our historical E&P realizations and highlights the $1.13 per BOE decrease in our average realizations, driven by the $0.73 per barrel decrease in liquids realizations, while natural gas realizations increased $0.08 per mcf quarter-to-quarter.
 Moving to Slide 7. Production volumes sold in the third quarter increased approximately 3% from the second quarter and 9% from the third quarter last year. Third quarter production available for sale increased 8% from the second quarter and over 3% from the same quarter last year.
 During the quarter, we were underlifted in Europe by 12,000 BOE per day and overlifted in EG by about 4,000 BOE per day. As of the end of the quarter, on a cumulative basis, we were 700,000 BOE underlifted in Europe and 2.4 million BOE underlifted in Alaska, with the rest of our operations being in a relatively balanced position.
 Turning to Slide 8, third quarter E&P segment income per BOE increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010, and was down slightly from the year ago quarter.
 Slide 9 shows that field level controllable costs per BOE have remained relatively flat for the last several quarters, while exploration expenses per BOE dropped significantly this quarter, primarily driven by lower dry well expense in the Gulf of Mexico.
 Turning to Slide 10, the improvement in the Oil Sands Mining segment income third quarter to second quarter was primarily a result of higher volumes and lower turnaround costs. The third quarter saw the return of the full quarter of operations at the Muskeg River Mine, as well as production from the Jackpine Mine, which began a phase start-up in the third quarter. The negative $61 million change in derivatives reflects the change from a gain of $53 million in the second quarter to a loss of $8 million in the third quarter.
 For our Downstream business. Starting with Slide 11, I will compare our third quarter results against the same quarter in 2009 because of the seasonality in that business.
 Third quarter 2010 segment income increased 80% from the same quarter last year. This was driven by higher margins and volumes, as well as better results at SSA, partially offset by income taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.
 Slide 12 provides the details for both volumes and margins in the refining side of this business. The quarter's year-over-year crude oil and other feedstock costs were lower than the change in the average price of LLS, primarily due to the increase in the sweet/sour differential of $2.44 per barrel. Our total throughputs were up over 21% quarter-over-quarter, primarily because of the Garyville Major Expansion.
 Our Refining and Wholesale Marketing gross margin of $0.0921 per gallon is based on the total consolidated refined products sold of 1,681,000 barrels per day or about 6.5 billion gallons for the quarter. We estimate that the Garyville Major Expansion contributed approximately $0.011 per gallon to this margin, which is in line with our previous projections based on the  Mars 2-1-1 crack spread. And to finish out segment reporting, the Integrated Gas segment income was $41 million compared to the $24 million recorded in the second quarter 2010.
 Slide 13 provides a analysis of preliminary cash flows for the first nine months of 2010. Operating cash flow from continuing operations before changes in our working capital was slightly over $3.5 billion, which is net of a $240 million pension fund contribution. Our cash balance was reduced by working capital changes from continuing operations of $560 million, primarily driven by Downstream operations. However, we expect to generate positive cash flow from working capital in the fourth quarter.
 Year-to-date, cash capital expenditures have been $3.6 billion, disposals generated proceeds of $1.4 billion, dividends paid have been $526 million and debt repayments for the year have been $628 million. The cash balance at the end of the third quarter stood at slightly over $1.6 billion.
 As shown on Slide 14, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, our cash adjusted debt-to-total capital ratio was 21%. And as a reminder, the net debt-to-total capital ratio includes about $235 million of debt service by U.S. steel. We expect the overall corporate effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be between 49% and 54% for the full year 2010, excluding special items and the effect to foreign currency remeasurements of our tax balances.
 I'll now turn it over to Clarence for some additional comments.

As you now have seen, Marathon's operating and financial performance in the third quarter was strong, registering a 63% increase in adjusted net income over the same quarter of 2009. And while we talk primarily about earnings and margins and volumes, I want to credit our employees for their continued focus on safe, reliable operations and controlling costs.
 We are, of course, disappointed by a more rapid and expected production decline in Droshky, and Dave Roberts will address that in some detail with you in just a moment. But I think it's important to view this one disappointment in the context of our overall solid Upstream business which will still achieve our promised 4% compound average growth rate in production from 2008 to 2011.
 Although I know some have been concerned about a lack of visibility for our production beyond 2011, we are now able to forecast an additional 5% organic growth, and that's primarily liquids, from 2011 to 2012. And as Dave will tell you in a moment, this growth is from ongoing projects, assets and opportunities in our portfolio.
 But we're not standing still. We continue to build our position for organic growth beyond 2012 in key assets like the Bakken, the Anadarko Woodford and other unconventional liquid plays and in new exploration areas like Poland and Kurdistan.
 As for our 2010 capital and exploration spending, we expect to spend our budgeted amount of about $5.2 billion. And while we won't announce our final capital plans for 2011 and beyond until our board approves them in January, I can tell you we expect ongoing CapEx to be in the $5.5 billion per year range that we've outlined for you before.
 Consistent with what we've done in the past, we're continuing to high grade our Upstream portfolio, and they sell or joint venture certain assets to reduce risk and/or generate funds for redeployment. And to the extent we generate free cash flow in excess of our spending, our priorities continue to be maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return cash to our shareholders.
 And now I'll turn it over to Dave for more details on Droshky and our overall Upstream business.

The success in delivering the Droshky project in July well ahead of our planned dates and 30% under the sanction budget has been tempered by poorer than expected reservoir performance from the development. And inherent risk in the products of this type, reservoir compartmentalization, as well as an apparent lack of aquifer support, have been larger factors than anticipated.
 The Droshky development was modeled based on a nearby analog field, Aspen , that we had direct evidence was in pressure communication with our field. Based on the pressure, flow and aquifer support history at Aspen, we anticipated similar reservoir performance at Droshky.
 The analysis we've done and continue to do shows the initial and subsequent engineerings have been carried out in the professional and quality manner, and I'm at present hard-pressed to offer could've-should've-would've scenario for this development.
 As our pressures have fallen more rapidly than anticipated, we recognized our recoveries are going to be lower and our volume projections will have to be modified as well. Droshky averaged net 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter and is estimated to average net 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect as reported our full year 2010 Upstream production to be approximately 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a testament, I think, to the overall strength of our global portfolio.
 In 2011, Droshky is expected to produce an average of net 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we're guiding to $70 per barrel as a representative of DD&A rate for the remainder of 2010. We'll give further guidance for 2011 as appropriate.
 Importantly, however, our portfolio is increasingly robust, and as Clarence said, our ability to sustain our production growth is intact. I have included Slide 15 in the pack to reflect our previous commitment to production growth of at least 4% over the periods 2008 to 2011, a commitment we will meet.
 To address some apparent confusion over this slide, we consistently measure our production projections based on our ongoing business, removing the effects of A&D. This methodology ensures our business remains focused on profitable growth and continued portfolio management for value.
 2008 Upstream production, excluding divestitures, was approximately 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with our projected growth, actual gives the CAGR of 4.5% for 2008 through our midpoint 2011 projection.
 More importantly, turning to Slide 16, we show that we expect production in 2012 to grow by 5% over 2011, with the majority of this growth being liquids. The production increases will come from our existing positions in Canada, the Bakken and Angola, as well as beginning contributions from new positions we are taking in both existing and new unconventional oil plays in North America. And we're positioning the company for further growth into the future.
 Turning to Slide 17. I'm pleased to report that Marathon has in 2010 increased its acreage in the Anadarko Woodford play, mostly in the liquids-rich portion to almost 75,000 acres, with further line of sight to over 100,000 acres in the near term. We've also acquired over 120,000 acres in the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of Colorado and Wyoming. In addition, we've increased our Bakken position to almost 400,000 acres.
 As we've said before, one of the attractions of these unconventional plays is the ability to dial up or dial down activity as needed. The large and growing number of future locations we list on this map is a great well stock, one that today we're using eight rigs to prosecute, but we could expect the number to potentially double in the next two years. And as opportunities remain, our acreage acquisitions continue in all of these plays, as well as others in North American unconventional liquids.
 We are in many ways transitioning the portfolio, balancing the large projects we have in our international business, and those we expect to deliver from impact exploration with repeatable and sustainable unconventional businesses largely in North America.
 Finally, on Slide 18, I highlight our most recent impact exploration play, the Kurdish Region of Iraq. The opportunity offers both near and long-term potential to Marathon. With two wells currently drilling in our licensed areas, the potential for production as early as 2016 is achievable, and we believe a minimum success case could yield 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of this decade, with total exposures for Marathon of over 400 million barrels of net resources.
 Also, in the area of impact exploration, many of you will certainly be wondering about our Indonesian program and our progress there. We continue to drill the Bravo prospect, a high risk but large structure on the Pasangkayu block. We have been slowed at first because of mechanical issues on the rig, which have been remedied, and then by geologic challenges, which similarly impacted the Romeo prospect suspended in September. On Bravo, we are now roughly at half the well total depth at this point and expect the conclusion of this well later in this month.
 All in, it's a quarter of considerable success tempered by Droshky. What we are most pleased with is the resilience our base of assets provides us in terms of meeting our goals and the continued evolution of our business as we add more exposure to unconventional plays, especially those rich in liquids, and new impact areas in exploration, both of which had confidence to our projection that we can sustain 3% to 5% growth well beyond 2012.

But one of the key things that we watch is the margin associated with these barrels, and then particularly in light of Droshky, if you look at your margin in the U.S. this quarter. It basically traveled some help from exploration, but when asked the margin, Droshky played a part. As you look at your incremental production growth over the next year or so, the top line growth is one thing. But you have a portfolio dominated by very low margin assets, Libya, Norway, EG gas, I guess. What is the top line growth? How does it translate to margin at the bottom line in terms of how you see the contribution from Oil Sands, Angola and so on?

But obviously, that is going to feature. From 2011 to '12, what we would say is that our top to bottom, the top five growth areas year-to-year are going to be Angola, the Woodford play, Bakken, Ozona and followed lastly by Oil Sands Mining. So four of those five areas we would think are going to be much stronger margin plays. So '10 to '11, I take your point. But '11 to '12 and beyond, particularly, as we view the strength of the liquids unconventional in the United States, we think we're going to have pretty good margin growth as well.

We've learned a lot about how to deal with that, and so we'll move forward. For 2011, we have two slots on the rig that we have contracted.

So that's part of the issue around infrastructure, and one that we're not uncomfortable with now but certainly, we would like to see improved just like we do in all the basins we'd like to operate in.

But I think that the critical thing to think about for next year, since it's largely going to be driven by Oil Sands Mining, the real issue is when the upgrader is delivered for the project and when do we get through the shakedown period of time in terms of when that thing actually starts taking over. Just to give an example, towards the latter part of this year, the new mine up there we think could produce anywhere on a gross basis a bitumen between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. That's a pretty big range just because it's a startup process. And then as the upgrader comes in, the real question is, is how quickly do you step-up to that 100,000 barrels a day there. So I would say that once we get a little bit more clarity on that in the first quarter of next year, my guess is the ranges will start coming in because there's not a lot of other moving parts.
