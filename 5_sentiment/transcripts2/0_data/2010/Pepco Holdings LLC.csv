And good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today.2009 was a year of both successes and challenges. Our earnings were significantly driven by lower energy commodity prices and narrow generations spreads, pressuring Conectiv Energy's margin throughout the year. Additionally, reduced demand for power resulted in lower run time for our generation fleet. At Power Delivery, as mentioned in prior calls, we incurred higher pension expenses, as well as higher capital costs, principally incurred to support growth and were [ph] based not yet fully reflected in regulated rates. However, we made steady progress on our key growth initiatives most notably, relating to our Blueprint for the Future and regulatory activities.Consolidated earnings for the year were $235 million, compared to $300 million in 2008. In 2009, we realized after-tax gains of $24 million relating to the remaining balance of the proceeds from the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized an $11 million of Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the accounting in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. In 2008, we took charges to earnings totaling $93 million due to a change in our assessment of our tax position associated with our cross-border energy lease investments. We view these items as not being representative of the company's ongoing business operations. Excluding these special items, earnings for 2009 would've been $200 million compared to $393 million in 2008.Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail including the results for the fourth quarter. But first, I'll address some topics of interest. Our vision of a smart grid is becoming a reality, as we make great strides in implementing our Blueprint for the Future. Most notably in November, we began the full-scale installation of advanced meters or our  Delaware electric and gas customers. The deployment has gone well, and we expect to complete the meter exchanges for Delaware customers by the end of 2010. The Delaware Public Service Commission has approved the creation of a regulatory asset to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related cost between rate cases.The U.S. Department of Energy announced in October that PHI had been awarded $168 million in federal stimulus funds to help finance the build out of our smart grid projects in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Pepco's Maryland service territory. The awards have allowed us to accelerate the building of Advanced Metering Infrastructure, distribution automation and demand response technologies.Late last year, the District of Columbia approved Pepco's request to implement AMI and to establish a regulatory asset to capture the costs related to the deployment. We expect meter deployment to begin during the third quarter of 2010 for our customers in the district.Maryland has established an expedited process to address AMI, which we expect will conclude the spring. By accelerating the build out of the Smart Grid, we can deliver the benefits of these technologies faster, allowing our customers access to timely usage information and make informed choices on energy use, lower their energy bills and experience improved system reliability.  I'm also pleased that both the Maryland and District of Columbia Commissions have approved several demand-side management and energy efficiency programs, which will help our customers reduce energy costs. The cost of these programs will be recovered through surcharge mechanisms.Now turning to sales, we know our customers are focused on energy efficiency and conservation, especially in light of the weak economy. Growth in the number of customers was about a half of a percent, while weather-adjusted kilowatt hour sales were down almost 2% as compared to 2008. A portion of the impact of the lower sales was offset by the revenue decoupling mechanisms we have in place, demonstrating the effectiveness of this great design.  With decoupling in place in Maryland, approximately 40% of the distribution revenue was decoupled from consumption. With the addition of the implementation of a decoupling mechanism in the District of Columbia, effective November 2009, approximately 65% of the distribution revenue is now decoupled.A decoupling method was approved in concept by the Delaware Public Service Commission, and we expect decoupling to be implemented for electric distribution in Delmarva Power's pending base rate  case. Implementation in Delaware would increase the percentage of decoupled distribution revenue to approximately 80%. A revenue decoupling mechanism is also under consideration in New Jersey.2009 was a very busy year in the regulatory front with the filing of five distribution-based rate cases and a decision received in the first of these cases. In Maryland, the commission approved an $8 million annual increase in Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rates, effective December 2, 2009 based on a 10% return on equity. Note that the commission's decision generally reflected adherence to important regulatory precedents. Four distribution rate cases are still pending. In may, Pepco filed a distribution base rate case in the District of Columbia, requesting a $50 million annual rate increase. The decision in this case is expected shortly. In August, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution based rate case in New Jersey, reflecting a $54 million annual rate increase. If a revenue decoupling method is approved, the request in increase would be reduced to a $52 million, and hearings are scheduled to begin on May 24. In September, Delmarva Power filed an electric distribution base rate case in Delaware, seeking approval of an annual rate increase of $28 million. Delmarva Power put an annual rate increase of $2.5 million into effect on a temporary basis on November 17 subject to refund. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power expects to place the remaining $25.5 million of the requested increase into effect in April 2010, again subject to refund.  Hearings are scheduled to begin April 15, with a decision expected in July 2010.  In December, Pepco filed a distribution base rate case in Maryland requesting a $40 million annual rate increase. Hearings are scheduled to begin May 10, with a decision expected by late July of this year. As we announced last month, we requested the Maryland Public Service Commission to suspend the procedural schedule in the preceding for the approval of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project. This request was made to allow for the completion of PJM's annual Regional Transmission Expansion Plan, which evaluates the region's overall transmission needs.  This study is scheduled to be completed this June and will determine any impact on the current 2014 in-service date for the MAPP project. Our request was granted by the hearing examiner. While no formal proceedings will be held until June, we'll continue to define the line to  150-mile route and to complete environmental studies. We have revised our planned capital expenditures for the MAPP project to reflect this delay in schedule. We expect to spend $24 million in capital in 2010 and $246 million in capital in 2011. Before I leave the topic of MAPP, I would like to discuss our pursuit of federally-backed funds for a portion of the cost of this project.Early in 2009, we submitted an application the application to the U.S. Department of Energy under Title 17 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Our application, which was accepted subject to due diligence seeks low-cost funding in an amount of $684 million primarily for the Calvert Cliff to Indian River segment of the MAPP project. The total project cost remains estimated at $1.2 billion. We expect the loan or loan guarantee, if received, would be in place prior to the construction of the Calvert Cliff to Indian river segment. In addition to the MAPP project, we expect to spend $1.2 billion on transmission infrastructure over the next five years to improve the liability. Our transmission assets are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and the transmission rates are set under a formula rate process. These assets are under return on equity of either 11.3% or 12.8%.  We also expect to spend $3 billion on electric distribution, gas delivery and our Blueprint for the Future initiatives over this time period. These investments are aimed at improving reliability, meeting load growth, enhancing customer service and implementing AMI.Now I'll turn to our Competitive Energy businesses. Conectiv Energy's Cumberland plant was placed in service on June 1 in Cumberland County, New Jersey. This 100-megawatt combustion turbine was completed on time and came in $3 million under budget. The 545-megawatt combined cycle delta project in Southeastern Pennsylvania is within budget and is on track to become operational during the second quarter of 2011. These additions will enhance the value of Conectiv Energy's generation fleet while providing needed capacity in the PJM region. Conectiv Energy's solar project in Vineland, New Jersey became operational with 2 megawatts energized in September and the remaining 2 megawatts energized in December. This project supports our initiative to increase our renewable energy portfolio. Tony will review Conectiv Energy financial results, but I want to make a few comments on Conectiv Energy's performance.  The economic recession, the mild weather have clearly lowered demand and dampened volatility. Decreased demand combined with low fuel prices have displaced coal generation and compressed margins. Our 2009 coal fleet capacity factor was approximately 21% compared to 56% in 2008, and generation energy margins were down 57% as compared to 2008.While Conectiv Energy was certainly challenged in 2009, the key value drivers for the business remain in place, great assets and an advantageous location in PJM. As Tony will address shortly, we expect a higher contribution from Conectiv Energy in 2010 due to higher capacity prices and improved forward energy margins and hedging execution.In December, we announced our plans to exit Pepco Energy Services' Retail Energy Supply business through an orderly wind down. This time last year, we faced significant collateral requirements for this business. Beginning in late March, we were able to reduce the collateral exposure of the business by entering into a credit intermediation agreement. Among the factors considered when conducting our strategic review of the Retail Energy Supply business was the return eared when investing capital in this business as compared to alternative investments.Pepco Energy Services will continue to fulfill its obligation under its existing contracts. We expect the business to remain profitable through 2012 based on an existing contract backlog and its hedged position with minimal losses beyond that date through 2014, the expected completion date of the wind down.  Pepco Energy Services also provides energy savings performance contracting services, principally to government and institutional customers. This business will not be affected by the wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business. Since 1995, Pepco Energy Services has evolved to become one of the leading providers of energy savings and sustainable energy products and services. We believe the current political and social climates provide growth opportunities for this business given the focus on energy efficiency and renewables.Before I turn it over to Tony, I want to address the impact of the recent storms that hit our service territories. Earlier this month, we were hit by two severe winter storms, within days of each other that resulted in extreme weather conditions, including heavy snowfall, ice and high winds. We currently estimate the cost of system restoration will range between $30 million and $35 million, with 1/2 to 2/3 being expensed and the balance being charged to capital. We will pursue recovery of these cost through rate cases.Storm damage is expected as part of Utility business, and these restoration costs will be included in our first quarter operating results. To put this level of expense in perspective, the cost restoration for the previous three largest storms over the past five years averaged less than $6 million. The cost of restoration due to the recent storms is clearly above what we have historically experienced, and therefore, we view this level of expense as significantly higher than what would be expected in a typical year. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick."

We'll then open the call to your questions.Consolidated earnings in 2009 were $235 million or $1.06 a s",887,"Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our consolidated earnings and then address our performance by operating segment. We'll then open the call to your questions.Consolidated earnings in 2009 were $235 million or $1.06 a share compared to $300 million or $1.47 per share in 2008. Excluding the special items that Joe referred to, earnings would've been $200 million or $0.91 per share in 2009 compared to $393 million or $1.93 per share in 2008.Dilution, primarily from our November stock offering negatively affected earnings per share by about $0.09. Lower benefits from income tax adjustments as compared to 2008 reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. These items impact all the lines of business. Consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter were $41 million or $0.18 per share, compared to $67 million or $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. There were no special items in either period. For the Power Delivery operating segment, earnings in 2009 were $0.90 per share compared to $1.23 per share in 2008. Excluding special items in 2009, earnings would've been $0.75 per share. The biggest driver of the year-over-year decrease was higher O&M expenses, which lowered earnings by $0.15 per share. Early last year, we set a target of $757 million for 2009 Power Delivery operation and maintenance expenses. For the year, Power Delivery O&M came in at $752 million. We are pleased with the management of O&M expenses during the year, especially given the increase in pension and other post-retirement benefits expenses as compared to 2008.For 2010, we estimate the pension and other post-retirement benefits expense to be approximately $116 million across PHI as compared to $149 million in 2009. Historically, about 70% of this expenses reflected in our operating expenses, with the balance charged to capital. Additionally, although we project there will be no minimum funding requirement in 2010 under the Pension Protection Act in accordance with our policy, we currently plan to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution in 2010 of approximately $100 million to bring the planned assets to at least the full funding level under the Pension Protection Act. The utilities subsidiaries obligation for funding the plan is expected to be approximately 80% of this contribution. We made a $300 million contribution to the pension in 2009.Also contributing to the decrease in Power Delivery earnings year-over-year were higher capital costs of $0.08 per share, which were incurred in 2009 principally to support growth and rate base not yet fully reflected in regulated rates. Higher depreciation expense lowered earnings by about $0.04 per share due to higher planned service balances.For the fourth quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.14 per share, compared to $0.24 per share for the 2008 period. The biggest factor that led to a decrease in earnings quarter-over-quarter was higher operation and maintenance expense.As Joe discussed, Conectiv Energy managed through a challenging year. Earnings were down significantly, especially as compared to the very strong results in 2008. Conectiv Energy's 2009 earnings were $0.07 per share, compared to $0.60 per share in 2008. Mild weather and weak economic conditions reduced the demand for power in eastern PJM, with load in this region down 3.5% year-over-year. Lower energy commodity prices and narrow generation spreads also pressured margins throughout the year.  The primary drivers for the earning decrease were lower generation output and reduced spark spreads and dark spreads.  Conectiv Energy's own degeneration output was down 27% for the year, and the average spark spreads and dark spreads for our generation fleet declined 57%. These factors decreased earnings by about $0.39 per share versus the prior year.Also contributing to the earnings decline in 2009 was the performance of economic fuel hedges that were favorable due to rising fuel prices in the first half of 2008 and unfavorable due to falling fuel prices throughout 2009. Key factors that drove the hedged performance were lower-than-expected load service volumes and degeneration output. The impact of the economic fuel hedges was an earnings decrease of about $0.31 per share. A favorable factor that increased earnings by about $0.19 per share was higher capacity margins due to the higher RPM clearing prices in the eastern part of PJM. Looking ahead, we are confirming the forecasted gross margin ranges of $340 million to $410 million for 2010, and $380 million to $480 million for 2011. These ranges incorporate the current forward energy market prices and volatilities and include expected capacity margins of $225 million in 2010 and $195 million in 2011, as well as the impact of the delta-generating plant becoming operational in 2011. For the fourth quarter, Conectiv Energy's earnings were $0.02 per share, which were flat when compared to the earnings in the 2008 period.Pepco Energy Services 2009 earnings were $0.18 per share, compared to $0.19 per share in 2008. Retail Energy Supply gross margin increased year-over-year due to the lower electric and gas supply costs, lower capacity charges and the higher capacity revenues. These increases were more than offset by higher capital costs associated with the credit and collateral facilities as well as dilution. For the fourth quarter, Pepco Energy Services earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.05 per share in 2008. The earnings decrease was driven by higher capital costs.  Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

So it kind of flows through and makes our physical energy and ancillary services numbers, energies numbers, look a lot worse than they actually are.

And good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today.2009 was a year of both successes and challenges. Our earnings were significantly driven by lower energy commodity prices and narrow generations spreads, pressuring Conectiv Energy's margin throughout the year. Additionally, reduced demand for power resulted in lower run time for our generation fleet. At Power Delivery, as mentioned in prior calls, we incurred higher pension expenses, as well as higher capital costs, principally incurred to support growth in rate base not yet fully reflected in regulated rates. However, we made steady progress on our key growth initiatives most notably, relating to our Blueprint for the Future and regulatory activities.Consolidated earnings for the year were $235 million, compared to $300 million in 2008. In 2009, we realized after-tax gains of $24 million relating to the remaining balance of the proceeds from the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized an $11 million of Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the accounting in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. In 2008, we took charges to earnings totaling $93 million due to a change in our assessment of our tax position associated with our cross-border energy lease investments. We view these items as not being representative of the company's ongoing business operations. Excluding these special items, earnings for 2009 would've been $200 million compared to $393 million in 2008.Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail including the results for the fourth quarter. But first, I'll address some topics of interest. Our vision of a smart grid is becoming a reality, as we make great strides in implementing our Blueprint for the Future. Most notably in November, we began the full-scale installation of advanced meters or our  Delaware electric and gas customers. The deployment has gone well, and we expect to complete the meter exchanges for Delaware customers by the end of 2010. The Delaware Public Service Commission has approved the creation of a regulatory asset to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related cost between rate cases.The U.S. Department of Energy announced in October that PHI had been awarded $168 million in federal stimulus funds to help finance the build out of our smart grid projects in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Pepco's Maryland service territory. The awards have allowed us to accelerate the building of advanced metering infrastructure, distribution automation and demand response technologies.Late last year, the District of Columbia approved Pepco's request to implement AMI and to establish a regulatory asset to capture the costs related to the deployment. We expect meter deployment to begin during the third quarter of 2010 for our customers in the district.Maryland has established an expedited process to address AMI, which we expect will conclude this spring. By accelerating the build out of the smart grid, we can deliver the benefits of these technologies faster, allowing our customers to access to timely usage information and make informed choices on energy use, lower their energy bills and experience improved system reliability.  I'm also pleased that both the Maryland and District of Columbia Commissions have approved several demand-side management and energy efficiency programs, which will help our customers reduce energy costs. The cost of these programs will be recovered through surcharge mechanisms.Now turning to sales, we know our customers are focused on energy efficiency and conservation, especially in light of the weak economy. Growth in the number of customers was about a half of a percent, while weather-adjusted kilowatt hour sales were down almost 2% as compared to 2008. A portion of the impact of the lower sales was offset by the revenue decoupling mechanisms we have in place, demonstrating the effectiveness of this rate design.  With decoupling in place in Maryland, approximately 40% of the distribution revenue was decoupled from consumption. With the addition of the implementation of a decoupling mechanism in the District of Columbia, effective November 2009, approximately 65% of the distribution revenue is now decoupled.A decoupling method was approved in concept by the Delaware Public Service Commission, and we expect decoupling to be implemented for electric distribution in Delmarva Power's pending base rate  case. Implementation in Delaware would increase the percentage of decoupled distribution revenue to approximately 80%. A revenue decoupling mechanism is also under consideration in New Jersey.2009 was a very busy year in the regulatory front with the filing of five distribution-based rate cases and a decision received in the first of these cases. In Maryland, the Commission approved an $8 million annual increase in Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rates, effective December 2, 2009 based on a 10% return on equity. Note that the Commission's decision generally reflected adherence to important regulatory precedents. Four distribution rate cases are still pending. In May, Pepco filed a distribution base rate case in the District of Columbia, requesting a $50 million annual rate increase. The decision in this case is expected shortly. In August, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution based rate case in New Jersey, reflecting a $54 million annual rate increase. If a revenue decoupling method is approved, the request in increase would be reduced to $52 million, and hearings are scheduled to begin on May 24. In September, Delmarva Power filed an electric distribution base rate case in Delaware, seeking approval of an annual rate increase of $28 million. Delmarva Power put an annual rate increase of $2.5 million into effect on a temporary basis on November 17 subject to refund. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power expects to place the remaining $25.5 million of the requested increase into effect in April 2010, again subject to refund.  Hearings are scheduled to begin April 15, with the decision expected in July 2010. In December, Pepco filed a distribution base rate case in Maryland requesting a $40 million annual rate increase. Hearings are scheduled to begin May 10, with a decision expected by late July of this year. As we announced last month, we requested the Maryland Public Service Commission to suspend the procedural schedule in the proceeding for the approval of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project. This request was made to allow for the completion of PJM's annual Regional Transmission Expansion Plan, which evaluates the region's overall transmission needs. This study is scheduled to be completed this June and will determine any impact on the current 2014 in-service date for the MAPP project. Our request was granted by the hearing examiner. While no formal proceedings will be held until June, we'll continue to define the line to  150-mile route and to complete environmental studies. We have revised our planned capital expenditures for the MAPP project to reflect this delay in schedule. We expect to spend $24 million in capital in 2010 and $246 million in capital in 2011. Before I leave the topic of MAPP, I would like to discuss our pursuit of federally-backed funds for a portion of the cost of this project.Early in 2009, we submitted an application to the U.S. Department of Energy under Title 17 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Our application, which was accepted subject to due diligence seeks low-cost funding in an amount of $684 million primarily for the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment of the MAPP project. The total project cost remains estimated at $1.2 billion. We expect the loan or loan guarantee, if received, would be in place prior to the construction of the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. In addition to the MAPP project, we expect to spend $1.2 billion on transmission infrastructure over the next five years to improve the liability. Our transmission assets are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and the transmission rates are set under a formula rate process. These assets earn a return on equity of either 11.3% or 12.8%. We also expect to spend $3 billion on electric distribution, gas delivery and our Blueprint for the Future initiatives over this time period. These investments are aimed at improving reliability, meeting load growth, enhancing customer service and implementing AMI.Now I'll turn to our Competitive Energy businesses. Conectiv Energy's Cumberland plant was placed in service on June 1 in Cumberland County, New Jersey. This 100-megawatt combustion turbine was completed on time and came in $3 million under budget. The 545-megawatt combined cycle delta project in Southeastern Pennsylvania is within budget and is on track to become operational during the second quarter of 2011. These additions will enhance the value of Conectiv Energy's generation fleet while providing needed capacity in the PJM region. Conectiv Energy's solar project in Vineland, New Jersey became operational with 2 megawatts energized in September and the remaining 2 megawatts energized in December. This project supports our initiative to increase our renewable energy portfolio. Tony will review Conectiv Energy's financial results, but I want to make a few comments on Conectiv Energy's performance. The economic recession, the mild weather have clearly lowered demand and dampened volatility. Decreased demand combined with low fuel prices have displaced coal generation and compressed margins. Our 2009 coal fleet capacity factor was approximately 21% compared to 56% in 2008, and generation energy margins were down 57% as compared to 2008.While Conectiv Energy was certainly challenged in 2009, the key value drivers for the business remain in place, great assets and an advantageous location in PJM. As Tony will address shortly, we expect a higher contribution from Conectiv Energy in 2010 due to higher capacity prices and improved forward energy margins and hedging execution.In December, we announced our plans to exit Pepco Energy Services' Retail Energy Supply business through an orderly wind down. This time last year, we faced significant collateral requirements for this business. Beginning in late March, we were able to reduce the collateral exposure of the business by entering into a credit intermediation agreement. Among the factors considered when conducting our strategic review of the Retail Energy Supply business was the return earned when investing capital in this business as compared to alternative investments.Pepco Energy Services will continue to fulfill its obligation under its existing contracts. We expect the business to remain profitable through 2012 based on an existing contract backlog and its hedged position with minimal losses beyond that date through 2014, the expected completion date of the wind down. Pepco Energy Services also provides energy savings performance contracting services, principally to government and institutional customers. This business will not be affected by the wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business. Since 1995, Pepco Energy Services has evolved to become one of the leading providers of energy savings and sustainable energy products and services. We believe the current political and social climates provide growth opportunities for this business given the focus on energy efficiency and renewables.Before I turn it over to Tony, I want to address the impact of the recent storms that hit our service territories. Earlier this month, we were hit by two severe winter storms, within days of each other that resulted in extreme weather conditions, including heavy snowfall, ice and high winds. We currently estimate the cost of system restoration will range between $30 million and $35 million, with 1/2 to 2/3 being expensed and the balance being charged to capital. We will pursue recovery of these cost through rate cases.Storm damage is expected as part of the Utility business, and these restoration costs will be included in our first quarter operating results. To put this level of expense in perspective, the cost of restoration for the previous three largest storms over the past five years averaged less than $6 million. The cost of restoration due to the recent storms is clearly above what we have historically experienced and therefore, we view this level of expense as significantly higher than what would be expected in a typical year. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick."

I'll recap our consolidated earnings and then address our performance by operating segment. We'll then open the call to your questions.Consolidated earnings in 2009 were $235 million or $1.06 a share compared to $300 million or $1.47 per share in 2008. Excluding the special items that Joe referred to, earnings would've been $200 million or $0.91 per share in 2009, compared to $393 million or $1.93 per share in 2008.Dilution, primarily from our November stock offering negatively affected earnings per share by about $0.09. Lower benefits from income tax adjustments as compared to 2008 reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. These items impact all of the lines of business. Consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter were $41 million or $0.18 per share, compared to $67 million or $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. There were no special items in either period. For the Power Delivery operating segment, earnings in 2009 were $0.90 per share compared to $1.23 per share in 2008. Excluding special items in 2009, earnings would've been $0.75 per share. The biggest driver of the year-over-year decrease was higher O&M expenses, which lowered earnings by $0.15 per share. Early last year, we set a target of $757 million for 2009 Power Delivery operation and maintenance expenses. For the year, Power Delivery O&M came in at $752 million. We are pleased with the management of O&M expenses during the year, especially given the increase in pension and other post-retirement benefits expenses as compared to 2008.For 2010, we estimate the pension and other post-retirement benefits expense to be approximately $116 million across PHI as compared to $149 million in 2009. Historically, about 70% of this expenses reflected in our operating expenses, with the balance charged to capital. Additionally, although we project there will be no minimum funding requirement in 2010 under the Pension Protection Act in accordance with our policy, we currently plan to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution in 2010 of approximately $100 million to bring the planned assets to at least the full funding level under the Pension Protection Act. The utilities subsidiaries obligation for funding the plan is expected to be approximately 80% of this contribution. We made a $300 million contribution to the pension in 2009.Also contributing to the decrease in Power Delivery earnings year-over-year were higher capital costs of $0.08 per share, which were incurred in 2009 principally to support growth and rate base not yet fully reflected in regulated rates. Higher depreciation expense lowered earnings by about $0.04 per share due to higher planned service balances.For the fourth quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.14 per share, compared to $0.24 per share for the 2008 period. The biggest factor that led to a decrease in earnings quarter-over-quarter was higher operation and maintenance expense.As Joe discussed, Conectiv Energy managed through a challenging year. Earnings were down significantly, especially as compared to the very strong results in 2008. Conectiv Energy's 2009 earnings were $0.07 per share, compared to $0.60 per share in 2008. Mild weather and weak economic conditions reduced the demand for power in eastern PJM, with load in this region down 3.5% year-over-year. Lower energy commodity prices and narrow generation spreads also pressured margins throughout the year.  The primary drivers for the earning decrease were lower generation output and reduced spark spreads and dark spreads.  Conectiv Energy's own degeneration output was down 27% for the year, and the average spark spreads and dark spreads for our generation fleet declined 57%. These factors decreased earnings by about $0.39 per share versus the prior year.Also contributing to the earnings decline in 2009 was the performance of economic fuel hedges that were favorable due to rising fuel prices in the first half of 2008 and unfavorable due to falling fuel prices throughout 2009. Key factors that drove the hedged performance were lower-than-expected load service volumes and degeneration output. The impact of the economic fuel hedges was an earnings decrease of about $0.31 per share. A favorable factor that increased earnings by about $0.19 per share was higher capacity margins due to the higher RPM clearing prices in the eastern part of PJM. Looking ahead, we are confirming the forecasted gross margin ranges of $340 million to $410 million for 2010, and $380 million to $480 million for 2011. These ranges incorporate the current forward energy market prices and volatilities and include expected capacity margins of $225 million in 2010 and $195 million in 2011, as well as the impact of the delta-generating plant becoming operational in 2011. For the fourth quarter, Conectiv Energy's earnings were $0.02 per share, which were flat when compared to the earnings in the 2008 period.Pepco Energy Services 2009 earnings were $0.18 per share, compared to $0.19 per share in 2008. Retail Energy Supply gross margin increased year-over-year due to the lower electric and gas supply costs, lower capacity charges and the higher capacity revenues. These increases were more than offset by higher capital costs associated with the credit and collateral facilities as well as dilution. For the fourth quarter, Pepco Energy Services earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.05 per share in 2008. The earnings decrease was driven by higher capital costs.  Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

And good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today.2009 was a year of both successes and challenges. Our earnings were significantly driven by lower energy commodity prices and narrow generations spreads, pressuring Conectiv Energy's margin throughout the year. Additionally, reduced demand for power resulted in lower run time for our generation fleet. At Power Delivery, as mentioned in prior calls, we incurred higher pension expenses, as well as higher capital costs, principally incurred to support growth in rate base not yet fully reflected in regulated rates. However, we made steady progress on our key growth initiatives most notably, relating to our Blueprint for the Future and regulatory activities.Consolidated earnings for the year were $235 million, compared to $300 million in 2008. In 2009, we realized after-tax gains of $24 million relating to the remaining balance of the proceeds from the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized an $11 million of Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the accounting in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. In 2008, we took charges to earnings totaling $93 million due to a change in our assessment of our tax position associated with our cross-border energy lease investments. We view these items as not being representative of the company's ongoing business operations. Excluding these special items, earnings for 2009 would've been $200 million compared to $393 million in 2008.Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail including the results for the fourth quarter. But first, I'll address some topics of interest. Our vision of a smart grid is becoming a reality, as we make great strides in implementing our Blueprint for the Future. Most notably in November, we began the full-scale installation of advanced meters or our  Delaware electric and gas customers. The deployment has gone well, and we expect to complete the meter exchanges for Delaware customers by the end of 2010. The Delaware Public Service Commission has approved the creation of a regulatory asset to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related cost between rate cases.The U.S. Department of Energy announced in October that PHI had been awarded $168 million in federal stimulus funds to help finance the build out of our smart grid projects in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Pepco's Maryland service territory. The awards have allowed us to accelerate the building of advanced metering infrastructure, distribution automation and demand response technologies.Late last year, the District of Columbia approved Pepco's request to implement AMI and to establish a regulatory asset to capture the costs related to the deployment. We expect meter deployment to begin during the third quarter of 2010 for our customers in the district.Maryland has established an expedited process to address AMI, which we expect will conclude this spring. By accelerating the build out of the smart grid, we can deliver the benefits of these technologies faster, allowing our customers to access to timely usage information and make informed choices on energy use, lower their energy bills and experience improved system reliability.  I'm also pleased that both the Maryland and District of Columbia Commissions have approved several demand-side management and energy efficiency programs, which will help our customers reduce energy costs. The cost of these programs will be recovered through surcharge mechanisms.Now turning to sales, we know our customers are focused on energy efficiency and conservation, especially in light of the weak economy. Growth in the number of customers was about a half of a percent, while weather-adjusted kilowatt hour sales were down almost 2% as compared to 2008. A portion of the impact of the lower sales was offset by the revenue decoupling mechanisms we have in place, demonstrating the effectiveness of this rate design.  With decoupling in place in Maryland, approximately 40% of the distribution revenue was decoupled from consumption. With the addition of the implementation of a decoupling mechanism in the District of Columbia, effective November 2009, approximately 65% of the distribution revenue is now decoupled.A decoupling method was approved in concept by the Delaware Public Service Commission, and we expect decoupling to be implemented for electric distribution in Delmarva Power's pending base rate  case. Implementation in Delaware would increase the percentage of decoupled distribution revenue to approximately 80%. A revenue decoupling mechanism is also under consideration in New Jersey.2009 was a very busy year in the regulatory front with the filing of five distribution-based rate cases and a decision received in the first of these cases. In Maryland, the Commission approved an $8 million annual increase in Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rates, effective December 2, 2009 based on a 10% return on equity. Note that the Commission's decision generally reflected adherence to important regulatory precedents. Four distribution rate cases are still pending. In May, Pepco filed a distribution base rate case in the District of Columbia, requesting a $50 million annual rate increase. The decision in this case is expected shortly. In August, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution based rate case in New Jersey, reflecting a $54 million annual rate increase. If a revenue decoupling method is approved, the request in increase would be reduced to $52 million, and hearings are scheduled to begin on May 24. In September, Delmarva Power filed an electric distribution base rate case in Delaware, seeking approval of an annual rate increase of $28 million. Delmarva Power put an annual rate increase of $2.5 million into effect on a temporary basis on November 17 subject to refund. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power expects to place the remaining $25.5 million of the requested increase into effect in April 2010, again subject to refund.  Hearings are scheduled to begin April 15, with the decision expected in July 2010. In December, Pepco filed a distribution base rate case in Maryland requesting a $40 million annual rate increase. Hearings are scheduled to begin May 10, with a decision expected by late July of this year. As we announced last month, we requested the Maryland Public Service Commission to suspend the procedural schedule in the proceeding for the approval of the Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP project. This request was made to allow for the completion of PJM's annual Regional Transmission Expansion Plan, which evaluates the region's overall transmission needs. This study is scheduled to be completed this June and will determine any impact on the current 2014 in-service date for the MAPP project. Our request was granted by the hearing examiner. While no formal proceedings will be held until June, we'll continue to define the line to  150-mile route and to complete environmental studies. We have revised our planned capital expenditures for the MAPP project to reflect this delay in schedule. We expect to spend $24 million in capital in 2010 and $246 million in capital in 2011. Before I leave the topic of MAPP, I would like to discuss our pursuit of federally-backed funds for a portion of the cost of this project.Early in 2009, we submitted an application to the U.S. Department of Energy under Title 17 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Our application, which was accepted subject to due diligence seeks low-cost funding in an amount of $684 million primarily for the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment of the MAPP project. The total project cost remains estimated at $1.2 billion. We expect the loan or loan guarantee, if received, would be in place prior to the construction of the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. In addition to the MAPP project, we expect to spend $1.2 billion on transmission infrastructure over the next five years to improve the liability. Our transmission assets are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and the transmission rates are set under a formula rate process. These assets earn a return on equity of either 11.3% or 12.8%. We also expect to spend $3 billion on electric distribution, gas delivery and our Blueprint for the Future initiatives over this time period. These investments are aimed at improving reliability, meeting load growth, enhancing customer service and implementing AMI.Now I'll turn to our Competitive Energy businesses. Conectiv Energy's Cumberland plant was placed in service on June 1 in Cumberland County, New Jersey. This 100-megawatt combustion turbine was completed on time and came in $3 million under budget. The 545-megawatt combined cycle delta project in Southeastern Pennsylvania is within budget and is on track to become operational during the second quarter of 2011. These additions will enhance the value of Conectiv Energy's generation fleet while providing needed capacity in the PJM region. Conectiv Energy's solar project in Vineland, New Jersey became operational with 2 megawatts energized in September and the remaining 2 megawatts energized in December. This project supports our initiative to increase our renewable energy portfolio. Tony will review Conectiv Energy's financial results, but I want to make a few comments on Conectiv Energy's performance. The economic recession, the mild weather have clearly lowered demand and dampened volatility. Decreased demand combined with low fuel prices have displaced coal generation and compressed margins. Our 2009 coal fleet capacity factor was approximately 21% compared to 56% in 2008, and generation energy margins were down 57% as compared to 2008.While Conectiv Energy was certainly challenged in 2009, the key value drivers for the business remain in place, great assets and an advantageous location in PJM. As Tony will address shortly, we expect a higher contribution from Conectiv Energy in 2010 due to higher capacity prices and improved forward energy margins and hedging execution.In December, we announced our plans to exit Pepco Energy Services' Retail Energy Supply business through an orderly wind down. This time last year, we faced significant collateral requirements for this business. Beginning in late March, we were able to reduce the collateral exposure of the business by entering into a credit intermediation agreement. Among the factors considered when conducting our strategic review of the Retail Energy Supply business was the return earned when investing capital in this business as compared to alternative investments.Pepco Energy Services will continue to fulfill its obligation under its existing contracts. We expect the business to remain profitable through 2012 based on an existing contract backlog and its hedged position with minimal losses beyond that date through 2014, the expected completion date of the wind down. Pepco Energy Services also provides energy savings performance contracting services, principally to government and institutional customers. This business will not be affected by the wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business. Since 1995, Pepco Energy Services has evolved to become one of the leading providers of energy savings and sustainable energy products and services. We believe the current political and social climates provide growth opportunities for this business given the focus on energy efficiency and renewables.Before I turn it over to Tony, I want to address the impact of the recent storms that hit our service territories. Earlier this month, we were hit by two severe winter storms, within days of each other that resulted in extreme weather conditions, including heavy snowfall, ice and high winds. We currently estimate the cost of system restoration will range between $30 million and $35 million, with 1/2 to 2/3 being expensed and the balance being charged to capital. We will pursue recovery of these cost through rate cases.Storm damage is expected as part of the Utility business, and these restoration costs will be included in our first quarter operating results. To put this level of expense in perspective, the cost of restoration for the previous three largest storms over the past five years averaged less than $6 million. The cost of restoration due to the recent storms is clearly above what we have historically experienced and therefore, we view this level of expense as significantly higher than what would be expected in a typical year. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick."

I'll recap our consolidated earnings and then address our performance by operating segment. We'll then open the call to your questions.Consolidated earnings in 2009 were $235 million or $1.06 a share compared to $300 million or $1.47 per share in 2008. Excluding the special items that Joe referred to, earnings would've been $200 million or $0.91 per share in 2009, compared to $393 million or $1.93 per share in 2008.Dilution, primarily from our November stock offering negatively affected earnings per share by about $0.09. Lower benefits from income tax adjustments as compared to 2008 reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. These items impact all of the lines of business. Consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter were $41 million or $0.18 per share, compared to $67 million or $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. There were no special items in either period. For the Power Delivery operating segment, earnings in 2009 were $0.90 per share compared to $1.23 per share in 2008. Excluding special items in 2009, earnings would've been $0.75 per share. The biggest driver of the year-over-year decrease was higher O&M expenses, which lowered earnings by $0.15 per share. Early last year, we set a target of $757 million for 2009 Power Delivery operation and maintenance expenses. For the year, Power Delivery O&M came in at $752 million. We are pleased with the management of O&M expenses during the year, especially given the increase in pension and other post-retirement benefits expenses as compared to 2008.For 2010, we estimate the pension and other post-retirement benefits expense to be approximately $116 million across PHI as compared to $149 million in 2009. Historically, about 70% of this expenses reflected in our operating expenses, with the balance charged to capital. Additionally, although we project there will be no minimum funding requirement in 2010 under the Pension Protection Act in accordance with our policy, we currently plan to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution in 2010 of approximately $100 million to bring the planned assets to at least the full funding level under the Pension Protection Act. The utilities subsidiaries obligation for funding the plan is expected to be approximately 80% of this contribution. We made a $300 million contribution to the pension in 2009.Also contributing to the decrease in Power Delivery earnings year-over-year were higher capital costs of $0.08 per share, which were incurred in 2009 principally to support growth and rate base not yet fully reflected in regulated rates. Higher depreciation expense lowered earnings by about $0.04 per share due to higher planned service balances.For the fourth quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.14 per share, compared to $0.24 per share for the 2008 period. The biggest factor that led to a decrease in earnings quarter-over-quarter was higher operation and maintenance expense.As Joe discussed, Conectiv Energy managed through a challenging year. Earnings were down significantly, especially as compared to the very strong results in 2008. Conectiv Energy's 2009 earnings were $0.07 per share, compared to $0.60 per share in 2008. Mild weather and weak economic conditions reduced the demand for power in eastern PJM, with load in this region down 3.5% year-over-year. Lower energy commodity prices and narrow generation spreads also pressured margins throughout the year.  The primary drivers for the earning decrease were lower generation output and reduced spark spreads and dark spreads.  Conectiv Energy's own degeneration output was down 27% for the year, and the average spark spreads and dark spreads for our generation fleet declined 57%. These factors decreased earnings by about $0.39 per share versus the prior year.Also contributing to the earnings decline in 2009 was the performance of economic fuel hedges that were favorable due to rising fuel prices in the first half of 2008 and unfavorable due to falling fuel prices throughout 2009. Key factors that drove the hedged performance were lower-than-expected load service volumes and degeneration output. The impact of the economic fuel hedges was an earnings decrease of about $0.31 per share. A favorable factor that increased earnings by about $0.19 per share was higher capacity margins due to the higher RPM clearing prices in the eastern part of PJM. Looking ahead, we are confirming the forecasted gross margin ranges of $340 million to $410 million for 2010, and $380 million to $480 million for 2011. These ranges incorporate the current forward energy market prices and volatilities and include expected capacity margins of $225 million in 2010 and $195 million in 2011, as well as the impact of the delta-generating plant becoming operational in 2011. For the fourth quarter, Conectiv Energy's earnings were $0.02 per share, which were flat when compared to the earnings in the 2008 period.Pepco Energy Services 2009 earnings were $0.18 per share, compared to $0.19 per share in 2008. Retail Energy Supply gross margin increased year-over-year due to the lower electric and gas supply costs, lower capacity charges and the higher capacity revenues. These increases were more than offset by higher capital costs associated with the credit and collateral facilities as well as dilution. For the fourth quarter, Pepco Energy Services earnings were $0.03 per share compared to $0.05 per share in 2008. The earnings decrease was driven by higher capital costs.  Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

When you look at that PJM capacity margin for generation activities, that does not include all the net hedges we have against capacity. When we serve load, we have to designate some of that capacity against those load obligations, and those negative hedges are not in that number. So it kind of flows through and makes our physical energy and ancillary services numbers, energies numbers, look a lot worse than they actually are. In 2010, we reiterated or confirmed the range that we've previously stated and have taken a stance on hedging against spark spreads going forward around our generation fleet.

Consolidated earnings for the quarter were $36 million compared to $45 million in the 2009 quarter. In the first quarter of last year, we recognized an $8 million after-tax gain when the District of Columbia Public Service Commission approved Pepco's customer sharing proposal for the remaining balance of the proceeds from the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We view this as not being representative of the company's ongoing business operations. Excluding this gain, earnings for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $37 million.
Our first quarter results for this year include the impact of some of the worst winter storms on record in our service territories. In February, we were hit by two severe winter storms within days of each other that resulted in heavy snowfall, ice and high winds. In the days that followed the storms, we restored service to more than 500,000 customers or about one in every four of our electric customers. Extreme weather conditions and magnitude of the outages and downed power lines made restoration difficult and costly. An estimated $19 million of storm-related costs were capitalized in the first quarter for future rate-base recovery. In addition, our first quarter operating results reflect incremental storm restoration expenses that we estimate were approximately $9 million after tax or about $0.04 per share. Although included in our operating results, the cost of restoration is clearly above what we have historically experienced. Therefore, we view this level of expense as significantly higher than what would be expected in a typical year. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail. But first, I'll address some topics of interest.
We continue to be very active on the regulatory front with three distribution base-rate cases currently pending, and a decision received on March 2 in Pepco's District of Columbia case. In the District, the commission approved a $20 million annual increase in Pepco's distribution base rates based on a 9.625 Return On Equity. The new rates were effective March 23. 
The commission also authorized a change in depreciation rates that results in a $2 million reduction in pretax annual depreciation expense. While we view the general hearings to regulatory precedents in the commission’s order as a positive, we view the Return On Equity that was authorized as being inadequate. On March 23, Pepco filed with the commission a request for reconsideration of certain issues, including the level of ROE authorized in the commission’s order.
Pepco's distribution base rate case in Maryland is proceeding according to schedule. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $32 million based on a request of Return On Equity of 10.75%. Hearings are scheduled to begin on Monday, May 10, and a decision is expected by the end of July 2010. Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case in Delaware, hearings are substantially complete. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $26 million based on a 10.75% Return On Equity. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested base-rate increase into effect in November 2009, subject to refund. 
Delaware law also permits the full requested increase to go into effect seven months following the filing date of the case. Accordingly, Delmarva placed the remaining $23.7 million of its requested rate increase into effect on April 19 on a temporary basis subject to refund and pending final commission approval, which is expected in the third quarter of 2010.
Also in the Delaware case, all of the parties to the proceeding reached a settlement regarding the implementation of a decoupling mechanism for electric customers at the conclusion of the rate-case proceeding. Delmarva Power's application for the implementation of decoupling for gas customers is still pending. 
On April 28, Atlantic City Electric entered into a settlement with all parties to its distribution base rate case in New Jersey. The settlement, which we consider to be fair and reasonable, provides for an annual rate increase of $20 million for service rendered on or after June 1, 2010. The stated Return On Equity is 10.3%. Earlier this week, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision ordering the parties to comply with the settlement terms. The settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the Board of Public Utilities. The matter will be considered at the BPU’s next agenda meeting currently scheduled for May 12. 
We continue to make very good progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Installation of advanced meters for our Delaware electric and gas customers has gone well. We currently expect to complete all the meter exchanges in Delaware, including commercial customers, by the end of the first quarter of 2011. We also remain on track to begin the deployment of meters to our customers in the District of Columbia in the fourth quarter of this year. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related costs between rate cases. 
Another key component of our Blueprint for the Future initiative is the implementation of dynamic pricing for our customers. Recently, we made filings in the District of Columbia and Delaware requesting approval to implement dynamic pricing. The filings request approval to begin phasing in dynamic pricing in Delaware in 2011 and in the District in 2012.
Delmarva Power and Pepco have previously made filings in Maryland that are still pending. The plan would reward customers for lowering their energy use during times when energy demand is high and consequently, the cost of supplying power is higher. The proposed rate design was formulated from the experience gained from a Smart Meter Pilot Program in the District of Columbia, which demonstrated that the use of a financial reward to prompt customers to conserve during period of high energy prices was effective. 
Last month, we signed agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy for three American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grants, formalizing the award of $168 million in federal stimulus funds to help finance the build-out of our Smart Grid projects in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Pepco's Maryland service territory. The awards have allowed us to accelerate the building of advanced metering infrastructure, distribution automation and demand response technologies. We were also pleased to be awarded an additional $4 million in federal stimulus funds as part of the Smart Grid Workforce Training Grant. By accelerating the build-out of the Smart Grid, we can deliver the benefits of these technologies faster, allowing our customers to access timely usage information and make informed choices on energy use, lower their energy bills and experience improved system reliability. 
Now I'll turn to our competitive businesses. The Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business that continues to be on track, and we are making good progress on our efforts to ramp up the Energy Services business. We will provide a detailed review of our Energy Services business at our Analyst Conference next week. 
As we announced last month, we have entered into an agreement to sell Conectiv Energy's wholesale power generation assets to Calpine Corporation for $1.7 billion, including the market value of the fuel inventory at closing, which is estimated to be $50 million. The sale is expected to close by the end of June 2010. The sale does not include Conectiv Energy's load service supply contracts, energy hedging portfolio, certain tolling agreements and several other non-core assets. We expect to liquidate these remaining assets and contracts within the next 12 months.
The estimated proceeds associated with the sale of Calpine and the liquidation of the remaining contracts and assets combined with the return of collateral posted under the contracts is expected to result in funds of approximately $2 billion, or approximately $1.75 billion, net of $300 million of estimated taxes on the sale and liquidation of the assets. We expect to use $1.75 billion of net funds primarily for parent company debt reduction. 
Sale of Conectiv Energy will reposition PHI as fundamentally a regulated utility company. We believe this sale provides many benefits to PHI and will clarify our strategic vision and value proposition. Upon the completion of the sale, approximately 90% to 95% of PHI's operating income will be generated by the regulated utility business. While Conectiv Energy has been an important component of PHI's energy mix, I believe this is the right strategic decision for PHI. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our consolidated earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call up to your questions.
Consolidated earnings for the first quarter were $36 million or $0.16 per share compared to $45 million or $0.21 per share for the first quarter of last year. Excluding the special item related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, earnings for the 2009 quarter would have been $37 million or $0.17 per share. The net impact of several tax adjustments lowered earnings by $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter.
For the first quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.09 per share compared to $0.19 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special item, earnings would have been $0.15 per share for the 2009 quarter. The tax adjustments that I just discussed decreased Power Delivery earnings by $0.05 per share as compared to the first quarter of last year. Another large factor that did decrease Power Delivery earnings period-over-period was higher operation and maintenance expense, which lowered Power Delivery earnings by $0.03 per share. Excluding the $0.04 per share of incremental storm restoration costs that Joe referred to, other O&M expense effectively decreased by about $0.01 per share quarter-over-quarter, largely due to lower regulatory and pension-related expenses.
Lower weather-related sales versus the prior period decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. Heating degree days were down by 5%. The impact of the sales decrease was more than offset by the impact of higher electric revenue driven by base-rate increases, decoupling adjustments and customer growth, which together increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represent approximately 66% of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption. 
Conectiv Energy's first quarter earnings were $0.04 per share compared to $0.02 per share for the first quarter of last year. The increase in earnings due to higher capacity prices in PJM more than offset the effective economic fuel hedges that were adversely impacted by falling commodity prices. Given our decision to sell Conectiv Energy's power generation assets and exit the merchant power business, beginning in the second quarter, the results of Conectiv Energy will be accounted for as discontinued operations and the financial results of PHI for prior periods will be reclassified to reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Pepco Energy Services’ first quarter earnings were $0.06 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the 2009 period. Higher-capacity revenue and lower-capacity charges associated with its generating facilities drove the earnings increase. 
Now I'll turn to our recent financing activities starting with the activity at the parent company. On April 20, Pepco Holdings entered into a $450 million unsecured bridge loan facility. Two draws can be made under the facility at any time prior to or on June 1, 2010. We expect to draw on the facility to repay Pepco Holdings $200 million of 4%-notes due May 15, 2010, and $250 million of floating-rate notes due June 1, 2010. We will apply a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Conectiv Energy's power generation assets to repay the loans.
On March 9, Atlantic City Electric completed the sale of $23 million in tax-exempt bonds. The bonds bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 4.875% and are due on June 1, 2029. Atlantic City Electric repurchased the bonds in 2008 in response to the disruption in the municipal auction rate securities market. The proceeds of the sale reimbursed the company for the purchase price of the bonds. 
On April 1, Delmarva Power completed the $78 million financing of 5.4% tax-exempt bonds due February 1, 2031. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to re-fund a like amount of tax-exempt bonds, repurchased by Delmarva Power in 2008, again in response to the disruption in the municipal auction rate securities market. As the owner of the bonds, Delmarva Power received the proceeds from the bond re-funding to be used for general corporate purposes.
 Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

Consolidated earnings for the quarter were $36 million compared to $45 million in the 2009 quarter. In the first quarter of last year, we recognized an $8 million after-tax gain when the District of Columbia Public Service Commission approved Pepco's customer sharing proposal for the remaining balance of the proceeds from the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We view this as not being representative of the company's ongoing business operations. Excluding this gain, earnings for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $37 million.
Our first quarter results for this year include the impact of some of the worst winter storms on record in our service territories. In February, we were hit by two severe winter storms within days of each other that resulted in heavy snowfall, ice and high winds. In the days that followed the storms, we restored service to more than 500,000 customers or about one in every four of our electric customers. The extreme weather conditions and magnitude of the outages and downed power lines made restoration difficult and costly. An estimated $19 million of storm-related costs were capitalized in the first quarter for future rate base recovery. 
In addition, our first quarter operating results reflect incremental storm restoration expenses that we estimate were approximately $9 million after tax or about $0.04 per share. Although included in our operating results, the cost of restoration is clearly above what we have historically experienced. Therefore, we view this level of expense as significantly higher than what would be expected in a typical year. Tony will discuss the financial results and our operating segment performance in more detail. But first, I'll address some topics of interest.
We continue to be very active on the regulatory front with three distribution base rate cases currently pending, and a decision received on March 2 in Pepco's District of Columbia case. In the District, the commission approved a $20 million annual increase in Pepco's distribution base rates based on a 9.625% return on equity. The new rates were effective March 23. 
The commission also authorized a change in depreciation rates that results in a $2 million reduction in pretax annual depreciation expense. 
While we view the general hearings to regulatory precedents in the commission’s order as a positive, we view the return on equity that was authorized as being inadequate. On March 23, Pepco filed with the commission, a request for reconsideration of certain issues including the level of ROE authorized in the commission’s order.
Pepco's distribution base rate case in Maryland is proceeding according to schedule. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $32 million based on a request to the return on equity of 10.75%. Hearings are scheduled to begin on Monday, May 10, and a decision is expected by the end of July 2010. 
Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case in Delaware, hearings are substantially complete. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $26 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested base rate increase into effect in November 2009, subject to refund. 
Delaware law also permits the full requested increase to go into effect seven months following the filing date of the case. Accordingly, Delmarva placed the remaining $23.7 million of its requested rate increase into effect on April 19 on a temporary basis subject to refund and pending final commission approval, which is expected in the third quarter of 2010.
Also in the Delaware case, all of the parties to the proceeding reached a settlement regarding the implementation of a decoupling mechanism for electric customers at the conclusion of the rate case proceeding. Delmarva Power's application for the implementation of decoupling for gas customers is still pending. 
On April 28, Atlantic City Electric entered into a settlement with all parties to its distribution base rate case in New Jersey. The settlement, which we consider to be fair and reasonable, provides for an annual rate increase of $20 million for service rendered on or after June 1, 2010. The stated return on equity is 10.3%. 
Earlier this week, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision ordering the parties to comply with the settlement terms. The settlement agreement is subject to final review and approval by the Board of Public Utilities. The matter will be considered at the BPU’s next agenda meeting currently scheduled for May 12. 
We continue to make very good progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Installation of advanced meters for our Delaware electric and gas customers has gone well. We currently expect to complete all the meter exchanges in Delaware, including commercial customers, by the end of the first quarter of 2011. We also remain on track to begin the deployment of meters to our customers in the District of Columbia in the fourth quarter of 
this year. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related costs between rate cases. 
Another key component of our Blueprint for the Future initiative is the implementation of dynamic pricing for our customers. Recently, we made filings in the District of Columbia and Delaware requesting approval to implement dynamic pricing. The filings request approval to begin phasing in dynamic pricing in Delaware in 2011 and in the District in 2012.
Delmarva Power and Pepco have previously made filings in Maryland that are still pending. The plan would reward customers for lowering their energy use during times when energy demand is high and consequently, the cost of supplying power is higher. The proposed rate design was formulated from the experience gained from a Smart Meter Pilot Program in the District of Columbia, which demonstrated that the use of a financial reward to prompt customers to conserve during period of high energy prices was 
effective. 
Last month, we signed agreements with the U.S.  Department of Energy for three American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grants, formalizing the award of $168 million in federal stimulus funds to help finance the build-out of our Smart Grid projects in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Pepco's Maryland service territory. The awards have allowed us to accelerate the building of advanced metering infrastructure, distribution automation and demand response technologies. 
We were also pleased to be awarded an additional $4 million in federal stimulus funds as part of the Smart Grid Workforce Training Grant. By accelerating the build-out of the Smart Grid, we can deliver the benefits of these technologies faster, allowing our customers to access timely usage information and make informed choices on energy use, lower their energy bills and experience improved system reliability. 
Now I'll turn to our competitive businesses. At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business that continues to be on track, and we are making good progress on our efforts to ramp up the Energy Services business. We will provide a detailed review of our Energy Services business at our Analyst Conference next week. 
As we announced last month, we have entered into an agreement to sell Conectiv Energy's wholesale power generation assets to Calpine Corporation for $1.7 billion, including the market value of the fuel inventory at closing, which is estimated to be $50 million. The sale is expected to close by the end of June 2010. The sale does not include Conectiv Energy's load service supply contracts, energy hedging portfolio, certain tolling agreements and several other non-core assets. We expect to liquidate these remaining assets and contracts within the next 12 months.
The estimated proceeds associated with the sale of Calpine and the liquidation of the remaining contracts and assets combined with the return of collateral posted under the contracts is expected to result in funds of approximately $2 billion, or approximately $1.75 billion, net of $300 million of estimated taxes on the sale and liquidation of the assets. We expect to use $1.75 billion of net funds primarily for parent company debt reduction. 
Sale of Conectiv Energy will reposition PHI as fundamentally a regulated utility company. We believe this sale provides many benefits to PHI and will clarify our strategic vision and value proposition. Upon the completion of the sale, approximately 90% to 95% of PHI's operating income will be generated by the regulated utility business. While Conectiv Energy has been an important component of PHI's energy mix, I believe this is the right strategic decision for PHI. 
At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

I'll recap our consolidated earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call up to your questions.
Consolidated earnings for the first quarter were $36 million or $0.16 per share compared to $45 million or $0.21 per share for the first quarter of last year. Excluding the special item related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, earnings for the 2009 quarter would have been $37 million or $0.17 per share. The net impact of several tax adjustments lowered earnings by $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter.
For the first quarter, Power Delivery earnings were $0.09 per share compared to $0.19 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special item, earnings would have been $0.15 per share for the 2009 quarter. The tax adjustments that I just discussed decreased Power Delivery earnings by $0.05 per share as compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Another large factor that did decrease Power Delivery earnings period-over-period was higher operation and maintenance expense, which lowered Power Delivery earnings by $0.03 per share. Excluding the $0.04 per share of incremental storm restoration costs that Joe referred to, other O&M expense effectively decreased by about $0.01 per share quarter-over-quarter, largely due to lower regulatory and pension-related expenses.
Lower weather-related sales versus the prior period decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. Heating degree days were down by 5%. The impact of the sales decrease was more than offset by the impact of higher electric revenue driven by base-rate increases, decoupling adjustments and customer growth, which together increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represent approximately 66% of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption. 
Conectiv Energy's first quarter earnings were $0.04 per share compared to $0.02 per share for the first quarter of last year. The increase in earnings due to higher capacity prices in PJM more than offset the effective economic fuel hedges that were adversely impacted by falling commodity prices. Given our decision to sell Conectiv Energy's power generation assets and exit the merchant power business, beginning in the second quarter, the results of Conectiv Energy will be accounted for as discontinued operations and the financial results of PHI for prior periods will be reclassified to reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Pepco Energy Services’ first quarter 
earnings were $0.06 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the 2009 period. Higher-capacity revenue and lower-capacity charges associated with its generating facilities drove the earnings increase. 
Now I'll turn to our recent financing activities starting with the activity at the parent company.  On April 20, Pepco Holdings entered into a $450 million unsecured bridge loan facility. Two draws can be made under the facility at any time prior to or on June 1, 2010. We expect to draw on the facility to repay Pepco Holdings $200 million of 4%-notes due May 15, 2010, and $250 million of floating-rate notes due June 1, 2010. We will apply a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Conectiv Energy's power generation assets to repay the loans.
On March 9, Atlantic City Electric completed the sale of $23 million in tax-exempt bonds. The bonds bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 4.875% and are due on June 1, 2029. Atlantic City Electric repurchased the bonds in 2008 in response to the disruption in the municipal auction rate securities market. The proceeds of the sale reimbursed the company for the purchase price of the bonds. 
On April 1, Delmarva Power completed the $78 million financing of 5.4% tax-exempt bonds due February 1, 2031. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to re-fund a like amount of tax-exempt bonds, repurchased by Delmarva Power in 2008, again in response to the disruption in the municipal auction rate securities market. As the owner of the bonds, Delmarva Power received the proceeds from the bond re-funding to be used for general corporate purposes.
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some 
closing remarks."

297660,109779698,72775,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-06-2010",2010-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $76 million compared to $39 million in the 2009 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong",1225,"Thanks, Donna, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank you for joining us today. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $76 million compared to $39 million in the 2009 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and our progress towards reducing regulatory lag. 
Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect Conectiv Energy's results as a discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results for both continuing operations and discontinued operations, as well as our operating segment performance. But first, I'd like to address some topics of interest.
I'll begin with the status of Pepco's distribution base rate case in Maryland. Last week, we requested that the Maryland Commission delay the issuance of the rate order. Prior to our request, our service territories experienced a major storm with high winds and lightning that caused significant damage to the electric system. 
Approximately 350,000 customers were without power at the height of the storm, with the vast majority of the outages occurring in Pepco's service territory. Given these circumstances, we determined that requesting a short delay in the issuance of the order as we complete the restoration work was prudent.
Turning to our cases in Delaware, in Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case. The hearing examiners report a schedule to be issued on August 30, with the commission decision expected on or about September 21. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $24 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. 
As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested rate increase into effect in November 2009 and the remainder of the requested amount into effect on April 19 of this year. The increase was put into effect on a temporary basis, pending final commission approval, and is subject to refund. 
On July 2, Delmarva Power filed a natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of $12 million based on a requested return on equity of 11%, assuming approval of the implementation of revenue decoupling. A decision by the Delaware Public Service Commission is expected in early 2011. Delmarva Power plans to implement an interim rate increase of $2.5 million effective August 31 subject to refund. 
We continue to make good progress on our Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Over 155,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers. And several thousands of the meters have been activated to provide real life testing on the various elements of functionality. This testing has gone very well and has included functions, such as: remote meter reading; billing, turn-on, turn-off capability; and customer Internet access to hourly usage data. 
We expect to complete all of the meter exchanges in Delaware, including commercial customers, by the end of the first quarter of 2011. We also remain on track to begin the deployment of advanced meters in the District of Columbia in the fourth quarter of this year, with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011.
The installation of a communication device that's necessary to support the deployment of the advanced meters in the district is underway. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets had been created to assure recovery of, and a return on, AMI-related costs between rate cases. 
In Maryland, we are awaiting the decision from the Public Service Commission on the AMI plans filed by Pepco and Delmarva Power. As you are likely aware, in June, the commission denied Baltimore Gas and Electric's AMI proposal. And BG&E [BGE] has since filed a revised proposal with the commission. We note, however, that there are significant differences between our proposal and BG&E's initial proposal. 
Specifically, Pepco and Delmarva Power proposed cost recovery through a regulatory asset and base rates rather than the surcharge, and voluntary rather than mandatory time-of-use rates for residential customers. As we have previously reported, PJM is in the process of reassessing reliability requirements under its annual Regional Transmission Expansion Plan, which evaluates the region's overall transmission needs. 
On July 14, PJM announced its determination that additional transmission capacity is needed in the Eastern Mid-Atlantic region for reliability, and that MAPP [Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway] is the most robust transmission alternative. The PJM process is expected to be completed this summer, with additional updates and recommendations regarding the transmission alternatives presented to PJM's Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee at its next meeting, which is scheduled for August 11. 
The outcome of the review process will determine the impact of the current 2014 in-service date for the MAPP project. We continue to expect the project to move forward, but with a likely one- or two-year delay in the in-service date. During the review process, we have continued our work to define the lines 150-mile route and to complete the required environmental studies.
On July 1, 2010, we completed the sale of Conectiv Energy's Power Generation business to Calpine Corporation. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, several adjustments were made to the $1.65 billion sales price, including a $49 million increase for the value of the fuel inventory at the time of closing and a $60 million reduction due to the lower-than-anticipated capital expenditures incurred on the delta project. 
After giving effect to these adjustments, $1.63 billion of proceeds were received at closing. The proceeds were used to reduce Pepco Holdings' debt, as Tony will discuss in more detail. We are in the process of liquidating Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and contracts and are on track to complete the liquidation by year-end. 
Coincident with the sale of Conectiv Energy, we began a comprehensive organizational review to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and achieve reductions in corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to Conectiv Energy. The organization review is still underway, and we are in the final stages of developing a detailed plan identifying headcount reductions and other cost-reduction opportunities that will result in the elimination of at least $20 million in annual corporate overhead costs. Full realization of the cost reductions is expected for the full year 2011 and is reflected in our 2011 earnings outlook.
We also expect to incur employees' severance and other restructuring costs associated with the reduction of corporate overhead. However, estimates of these costs will not be available until the detailed plan has been finalized. Our earnings guidance range for 2010 excludes the impact of these restructuring costs. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track, and we are making good progress on our efforts to ramp up the Energy Services business. As an example, Pepco Energy Services recently signed a fourth comprehensive energy savings performance contract with the Prince George's County Maryland Public Schools. Under the contract, Pepco Energy Services will provide 103 county school system facilities with approximately $35 million in new energy infrastructure, including: Heating and cooling equipment; lighting and building improvements; as well as water conservation, energy controls and renewable energy systems. Construction will begin shortly and is expected to be completed by the end of 2011. 
And now at this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"
297660,109779698,72775,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-06-2010",2010-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I will recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We'll then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-da",1366,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I will recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We'll then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. 
Year-to-date, Pepco Holdings has incurred an after-tax loss of $122 million from discontinued operations. Included in this loss is a $67 million after-tax write-down of the wholesale generation assets that were sold to Calpine. The year-to-date loss also includes $50 million of after-tax, unrealized losses on derivative instruments associated with Conectiv Energy's Load Service business that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
These unrealized losses have been reclassified into income as a result of the intention to liquidate the Load Service supply contracts and related hedges. We expect these losses will be partially offset over the remainder of the year by gains in the liquidation of the load supply contracts and other remaining assets. Upon completion of this liquidation, we currently expect the overall after-tax loss on the Conectiv Energy disposition to be in the range of $75 million to $100 million.
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.37 per share compared to $0.18 per share for the second quarter of last year. For the year-to-date period, earnings from continuing operations were $0.47 per share compared to $0.37 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special item related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, earnings from continuing operations for the 2009 year-to-date period would have been $0.33 per share.
Power Delivery earnings were $0.29 per share in the second quarter compared to $0.14 per share for the 2009 period. There were several factors that led to the increase in earnings period-over-period. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.04 per share of the earnings increase. Of the $0.04 per share, $0.03 were due to a true-up of transmission revenues for the 2009-2010 rate year. 
Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of rate decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware, as Joe discussed earlier.
Higher weather-related sales versus prior year increased quarterly earnings by $0.03 per share. Cooling degree days were up by 77%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represent approximately 66% of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption and, therefore, is not impacted by weather.
Another factor that increased earnings quarter-over-quarter was the impact of unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. Under New Jersey regulation, ACE is entitled to recover from its customers all costs providing default service. Any differences between the total revenue and the total cost of providing the service are deferred for future recovery from customers or returned to customers. However, unbilled revenue is not included in the deferred calculation and, therefore, can impact earnings.
Typically, the earnings impact is negligible. However, given the much warmer weather in June of this year as compared to June of 2009, we realized a positive impact of $0.04 per share. Over the last few years on an annual basis, we have experienced minimal earnings impact from unbilled revenue.
Other positive factors for the quarter were higher distribution revenue resulting from the growth in the number of customers, as well as lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to lower pension expense. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings were $0.38 per share in 2010 compared to $0.33 per share for the six months ended June 2009. Excluding the special item related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, 2009 earnings would have been $0.29 per share.
Most of the quarterly drivers apply to the year-to-date period as well. The higher earnings were due to higher transmission revenue, higher distribution revenue due to higher rates and growth in the number of customers, as well as the unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. 
Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year increased earnings by $0.01 per share. Partially offsetting factors in the year-to-date period were higher depreciation expense as the result of Utility plan investment and higher operation and maintenance expense, driven by the winter storms, partially offset by lower pension expense and cost-reduction efforts.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we currently estimate the cost of system restoration, incurred after the recent severe storm that Joe referred to, will range between $10 million and $13 million, with 1/2 to 2/3 being expensed and the balance being charged to capital. The actual costs of this system restoration may vary from this estimate because a large portion of the cost relates to services provided by outside contractors and other utilities that have not yet submitted bills.
Pepco Energy Services' second quarter earnings were $0.05 per share and were unchanged from earnings in the 2009 quarter. Higher generation output, driven by warmer weather, offset lower Retail Energy Supply gross margins due to the expiration of supply contracts in connection with the wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business. 
Year-to-date, Pepco Energy Services' earnings were $0.11 per share compared to $0.08 per share for the 2009 period. The increase in earnings is due to higher generation output and lower capacity charges, partially offset by lower Retail Energy Supply gross margin.
In our Corporate and Other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate overhead costs, earnings improved by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. We incurred higher capital costs due to the $450 million bridge loan facility Pepco Holdings entered into in April, which I'll discuss further in a few minutes. The higher capital costs were more than offset by a $0.04 per share favorable state income tax effect resulting from the restructuring of certain PHI entities. Year-to-date, earnings improved by $0.03 per share. The quarterly drivers apply to the year-to-date period as well.
We are reaffirming our 2010 guidance range of $0.80 per share to $0.95 per share for ongoing operations. Given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we believe it is likely that earnings per share will be above the midpoint of that range. We are also reaffirming our 2011 outlook range of $1.10 per share to $1.30 per share. 
I'll now turn to our recent financing activity. The sale of Conectiv Energy's Power Generation business to Calpine was completed on July 1. Approximately $1.63 billion of proceeds were received at closing and were used to retire Pepco Holdings' debt. The details of the debt reduction can be found in our earnings release. 
In summary, on July 1, we paid off the $450 million bridge loan facility put in place in April to repay $200 million of notes due in May and $250 million of notes due in June. In July, we retired $750 million of notes due 2012, $129 million of notes due in 2017 and $65 million of notes due in 2032. In total, an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion of PHI long-term debt was retired at a cost, including premiums, of $1.5 billion. The balance of the proceeds received was used to pay down short-term debt.
As a result of the debt repurchases, two charges to earnings will be recorded in the third quarter of 2010: the first is an after-tax loss of $70 million for debt extinguishment costs; the second is an after-tax loss of $9 million related to losses on rate locks that will now be reclassified to income. We expect to treat these charges as special items.
Looking ahead, we plan to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf that expires later this month. As we have done in the past, we will register debt and equity securities for Pepco Holdings and debt securities for the utility subsidiaries. As we have previously communicated, with the exception of equity issued through our dividend reinvestment plan, we do not expect a need for additional equity until at least 2012. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $76 million compared to $39 million in 2009 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong power delivery earnings that reflect the positive impact of our infrastructure investments and our progress towards reducing regulatory lag. 
Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect Conectiv Energy's results as a discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results for both continuing operations and discontinued operations as well as our operating segment performance. But first I would like to address some topics of interest. 
I'll begin with the status of Pepco's distribution base rate case in Maryland. Last week we requested that the Maryland commission delay the issuance of the rate order. Prior to our request, our service territories experienced a major storm with high winds and lightening, that cost significant damage to the electric system. Approximately 350,000 customers were without power at the height of the storm with the vast majority of the outages occurring in Pepco's service territory. Given these circumstances, we determine that requesting a short delay in the issuance of the order as we complete the restoration work was prudent. 
Turning to our cases in Delaware and Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case, the hearing examiner's report is schedule to be issued on August 30, with a commission decision expected on or about September 21st. The filing seats approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $24 million based on a 10.75% return on equity. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested rate increase into effect in November 2009 and the remainder of the requested amount into effect on April 19 of this year. 
The increase was put into effect on a temporary basis pending final commission approval and is subject to refund. On July 2, Delmarva Power filed a natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware for filing six approval of an annual rate increase of $12 million based on a requested return on equity of 11% assuming the approval of the implementation of revenue de-coupling, a decision by the Delaware public service commission is expected in early 2011. Delmarva Power plans to implement an interim rate increase of $2.5 million effective August 31st subject to refund. 
We continue to make good progress on our blue print for the future initiatives. Over 155,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers and several thousand of the meters have been activated to provide real life testing on the various elements of functionality. Discussing has gone very well and has included functions such as meter reading, billing, turn-on, turn-off capability and customer internet access to hourly usage data. We expect to complete all of the meter exchanges in Delaware including commercial customers by the end of the first quarter of 2011. We also remain on track to begin the deployment of advanced meters in the District of Columbia in the fourth quarter of this year with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. 
The installation of the communication device is necessary to support the deployment of the advanced meters in the district is underway. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to show recovery up and a return on AMI related costs between rate cases. In Maryland we are waiting the decision from the public service commission when the AMI plans followed by Pepco and Delmarva Power.
As you are likely aware, in June the commission decline Baltimore Gas and Electric's AMI proposal and BG&E has since filed a revised proposal with the commission. We note however, that there are significant differences between our proposal and BG&E's initial proposal. 
Specifically, Pepco and Delmarva Power proposed cost recovery to a regulatory asset and base rates rather than a surcharge and voluntary rather than mandatory time of use rates for residential customers. 
As we have previously reported, PJM is in the process of reassessing reliability requirements under its annual regional transmission expansion plan which evaluates the region's overall transmission needs. On July 14 (inaudible) announced its determination that additional transmission capacity is needed in the Eastern mid-Atlantic region for reliability and that map is the most robust transmission alternative. 
The PJM process is expected to be completed this summer with additional updates and recommendations regarding the transmission alternatives presented at PJMs transmission expansion advisory community at its next meeting which is scheduled for August 11. The outcome of the review process will determine the impact of the current 2014 in-service date for the MAPP project.
We continue to expect the project to move forward, but with the likely one or two year delay in the inservice date. During the review process, we have continued our work to define the lines 150 mile route and to complete the required environmental studies. On July 1 2010 we completed the sale of Conectiv Energy's power generation business to Calpine Corporation. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, several adjustments where made to the $1.65 billion sales price including the $49 million increase for the value of the fuel inventory at the time of closing and a $60 million reduction due to the lower than anticipating capital expenditures incurred on the Delta project. After giving effect to these adjustments $1.63 billion of proceeds were received at closing. The proceeds were used to reduce Pepco Holdings debt as Tony will discuss in more detail.
We are in the process of liquidating Conectiv Energy's remaining assets and contracts are in track to complete the liquidation by year-end. Coincident with the sale of Conectiv Energy, we began a comprehensive organizational review, to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and achieved reductions in corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to Conectiv Energy. The organizational review is still underway and we are in the final stages of developing a detailed plan identifying headcount reductions and other cost reduction opportunities, that will result in the elimination of at least $20 million and annual corporate overhead costs.
Realization of the cost reductions is expected for the full year of 2011 and is reflected in our 2011 earning's outlook. We also expect to incur employee severance and other restructuring costs associated with the reduction of the corporate overhead. However estimates of these costs will not be available until the detailed plan has been finalized, our earning's guidance range for 2010 excludes the impact of these restructuring costs. 
Our Pepco Energy Services, the profitable line down of the retail energy supply business continues to be on track and we are making good progress on our efforts to ramp up the Energy Services business. As an example, Pepco Energy Services recently signed a fourth comprehensive energy savings performance contract with the Prince George's County, Maryland Public Schools. Under the contract, Pepco Energy Services will provide 103 County School system facilities with approximately $35 million in new energy infrastructure, including eating and cooling equipment, lightning and building improvements as well as water conservation, energy controls and renewable energy systems. Construction will began shortly and is expected to be completed by the end of 2011. And now at this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick, Tony?

I will recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We'll then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-dat",1386,"Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I will recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We'll then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Year-to-date Pepco Holdings has incurred an after tax loss of $122 million from discontinued operations. Included in this loss is a $67 million after-tax write-down of the wholesale generation assets that were sold to Calpine.
The year-to-date loss also includes $50 million of after tax unrealized losses on derivative instruments associated with Conectiv Energy's load service business that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These unrealized losses have been reclassified into income as a result of the intention to liquidate the load service supply contracts and related hedges. We expect these losses will be partially offset over the remainder of the year by gaining some of the liquidation of the load supply contracts and other remaining assets. Upon completion of this liquidation, we currently expect the overall after tax loss on the Conectiv Energy disposition to be in the range of $75 million to $100 million. 
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.37 per share compared to $0.18 per share for the second quarter of last year. For the year-to-date period earnings from continuing operations were $0.47 per share compared to $0.37 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special item related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, earnings from continuing operations for the 2009 year-to-date period would have been $0.33 per share.
Power Delivery earnings were $0.29 per share in the second quarter compared to $0.14 per share for the 2009 period. There were several factors that led to the increase in earnings period-over-period. Higher transmission revenue drove $0.04 per share of the earnings increase. Of the $0.04 per share, $0.03 were due to a true-up of transmission revenues for the 2009, 2010 rate year.
Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of rate decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware as Joe discussed earlier. Higher weather related sales verses prior year increased quarterly earnings by $0.03 per share. Cooling degree days were up by 77%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the district of Colombia which represent approximately 66% of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by weather.
Another factor that increased earnings quarter-over-quarter was the impact of unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. Under New Jersey regulation, ACE is entitled to recover from its customers all costs of providing default device. Any differences between the total revenue and the total cost of providing the service are deferred for future recovery from customers or return to customers. However, unbilled revenue is now included in the deferred calculation and therefore can impact earnings.
Typically, the earnings impact is negligible. However, given the much longer weather in June of this year as compared to June of 2009, we realized a positive impact of $0.04 per share. Over the last few years on an annual basis, we have experienced minimal earnings impact from unbilled revenue. Other positive factors for the quarter were higher at distribution revenue resulting from the growth in the number of customers, as well as lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to lower pension expense.
Year-to-date Power Delivery earnings were $0.38 per share in 2010 compared to $0.33 per share for the six months ended June 2009. Excluding the special item related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, 2009 earnings would have been $0.29 per share. Most of the quarterly drivers applied to the year to date period as well. The higher earnings were due to transmission revenue.
The higher earnings were due to higher transmission revenue, higher distribution revenue due to higher rates and growth in the number of customers, as well as the unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. Higher weather related sales versus the prior year increased earnings by $0.01 per share. Partially offsetting factors in the year to date period where higher depreciation expense as a result of utility plant investment and higher operation in maintenance expense driven by the winter storms partially offset by lower pension expense in cost reduction efforts.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we currently estimate the cost of system restoration incurred after the recent severe storm that Joe referred to, will range between $10 million and $13 million with one half to two-thirds being expensed and balance being charged capital. The actual cost of system restoration may vary from this estimate because a large portion of the cost relates to services provided by outside contractors and other utilities that have not yet submitted bills.
Pepco Energy Services second quarter earnings were $0.05 per share and were unchanged from earnings in 2009 quarter. Higher generation output driven by warmer weather offset lower retail energy supply gross margins to the expiration of supply contracts in connection wind down of the retail energy supply business. Year-to-date, Pepco Energy Services earnings were $0.11 per share compared to $0.08 per share for 2009 period.
The increase in earnings is due to higher generation output and lower capacity charges, partially offset by lower retail energy supply gross margin. In our corporate and other segments, which is primarily un-allocated cooperate overhead costs. Earnings improved by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. We incurred higher capital cost due to the $450 million bridge loan facility. Pepco holdings entered into in April which I will discuss further in a few minutes. The higher capital costs were more than offset by a $0.04 per share favorable state income tax effect resulting from the restructuring of certain PHI entities.
Year-to-date earnings improved by $0.03 per share, the quarterly drivers apply to the year-to-date period as well. We are reaffirming our 2010 guidance range of $0.80 per share to $0.95 per share for ongoing operations. Given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we believe it is likely that earnings per share will be above the midpoint of that range.
We are also reaffirming our 2011 outlook range of $1.10 per share to $1.30 per share. I will now turn to our recent financing activity. The sale of Conectiv Energy's power generation business to Calpine was completed on July 1st approximately $1.63 billion of proceeds were received at closing and were used to retire Pepco Holdings' debt. The details of the debt reduction can be found in our earnings release. 
In summary, on July 1st we paid off the $450 million bridge loan facility put in place in April to repay $200 million of notes due in May and $250 million of notes due in June. In July, we retired $750 million of notes due 2012, a $129 million of notes due in 2017 and $65 million of notes due in 2032. In total an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion of PHI long-term debt was retired at a cost including premiums of $1.5 billion. 
The balance of the proceeds received was used to pay down short-term debt. As a result of the debt repurchases, two charges to earnings will be recorded in the third quarter of 2010. The first is an after tax loss of $70 million for debt extinguishment costs. The second is an after tax loss of $9 million related to losses on rate blocks that will now be reclassified to income. We expect to treat these charges as special items. Looking ahead, we plan to file our shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf that expires later this month.
As we have done in the past, we will register debt in equity securities for Pepco Holdings and debt securities for the utility subsidiaries. As we have previously communicated, with the exception of equity issued to our dividend reinvestment plan, we do not expect a need for additional equity until at least 2012. Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks.

And we believe we have made very good progress on our strategic initiatives that position us for longer term earnings growth. We remain ahead of curve on implementing the smart grid and we continue to demonstrate the strong competency in a regulatory arena. Sale of Conectiv Energy was completed consistent with our timeline and has repositioned PHI as fundamentally regulated utility company has lowered our capital requirements, strengthened our credit profile and supports our commitment to the current dividend. So all-in-all it was a good quarter.
With that, we would like to open the call to your questions.

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $21 million compared to $104 million in 2009 quarter. Excluding special items for both periods, earnings would have been $116 million in the 2010 quarter compared to $77 million for the 2009 quarter.
Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings which reflects positive impacts of our infrastructure investments, regulatory outcomes and higher sales due to the hot summer weather. Lower interest expense resulting from the pay down of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy’s generation asset sale proceeds also boosted earnings after income tax adjustments.
Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect Conectiv Energy’s results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results for both continuing operations and discontinued operations as well as our operating segment performance. But first I would like to address some topics of interest.
We continued to be very active in the regulated front with two distribution base case currently pending and a decision received on August 6 in Pepco’s Maryland case. In Maryland, the Commission approved an $8 million annual increase in Pepco’s distribution base rates based on the 9.83% return on equity. The details of the order can be seen on slide 2. The new rates were effective as of July 29. The commission’s decision felt short of our expectations. Not only do we view the return on equity that was authorized as being inadequate, we feel several of the commission’s rate making adjustment decisions make it challenging for Pepco to earn that authorized rate of return.
On September 2, we filed with the Commission an application for rehearing in which we are contesting several elements of the order. In our application we requested reconsideration of our request for $2.3 million of post test year reliability expenditures and for $1.5 million of enhanced vegetation management costs which the Commission presumed would be offset by savings. We also requested corrections to formulas which the Commission mandated that Pepco use in calculating its annual cost of removal accrual.
The corrections would increase depreciation expense by $4.7 million but will be offset by related cost recovery. Slides 3 and 4 summarize the current states of our two cases in Delaware. In Delmarva Power’s electric distribution base rate case, our filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $24 million based on the 10.75% return on equity, assuming the implementation of revenue decoupling. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested rate increase into effect in November 2009 and the remainder of the requested amount into effect on April 19 of this year.
These increases were put into effect on a temporary basis pending final Commission approval and are subject to refund. On October 1, the hearing Commissioner issued her report to the Commission, which recommends an increase of approximately $6 million based on an 8.5% return on equity with the implementation of revenue decoupling. We found the hearing examiners report very disappointing and that several recommendations are contrary to Commission President and the recommended return on equity is well below those granted in other electric utilities across the country.
Our exception to hearing examiners report were filed with the Commission on October 25. And the Commission is expected to consider the case at its leading schedule for November 10 at which time the parties will be given the opportunity to further address these issues. On July 2, Delmarva Power filed a natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of $10 million based on the requested return on equity of 11%, assuming approval of the implementation of revenue decoupling.
Hearings are scheduled for January 18 and 19 and a decision by the Public Service Commission is expected in April 2011. Delmarva Power implemented an interim rate increase of $2.5 million effective August 31 subject to refund. The remainder of the requested rate increase may be implemented at the end of the statutory period which is February 2, 2011 again subject to refund. Looking ahead to our next round of cases, as you can see on slide 5, we currently expect to file in Maryland in late 2010 or early 2011 for Delmarva Power and in the spring of 2011 for Pepco.
Next summer, we expect Pepco to file in the district Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey and Delmarva Power to file an electric case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and maybe impacted by financial projections or other considerations. We also plan to aggressively pursue on our rate case filings, a more comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects.
Given our plans to make significant and necessary investments in our utilities, it is crucial that our regulators and other stakeholders into regulatory process understand the causes and consequences of regulatory lag. Our filings will include proposals for methods to minimize lag. Earlier this month, the PJM Board reaffirmed the need for a Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP transmission project with a one year delay in the in-service date.
Without MAPP, PJM’s analysis shows significant violations of reliability criteria in the MAC and East MAC regions of PJM in 2015. The PJM Board directed us to adopt project schedule to meet an in-service date of June 1, 2015. We plan to file an updated application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission before the end of this year. While the project was being reviewed by PJM, we put in place agreements for all new rider and converter station locations, and have been moving forward with the environmental permitting and engineering design.
While the project cost remains an estimated $1.2 billion, we have revised our annual construction expenditure forecasts due to the change with the in-service date. The revised forecast can be seen on slide six. You can see that the near-term impact is a shifting of $83 million of capital from 2011 to later years. Also note that in the current forecasts, $183 million of capital has shifted from Delmarva Power to Pepco as a result of the final route selected for the Chesapeake Bay crossing.
We continue to make good progress on our blue print for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen on slide 7. Over 190,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers and we expect to complete all the meter exchanges in Delaware by the end of the first quarter 2011. Meter activation will occur in stages. We began activating meters this month and plan to have all Delaware meters activated by June 2011.
The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, billing and outage notification. In the District of Columbia, we began the deployment of the advanced meters earlier this month with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the Commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and a return on AMI related costs between rate cases.
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters for Pepco customers subject to the implementation of a Commission approved, customer education and communication plan. We recently submitted this plan to the Commission and stakeholders for review. The Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI related costs with cost recovery in a base rate proceeding. Would currently plan to meter installations in mid-2011, for Pepco’s Maryland customers.
For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of an amended business case. We plan to file this business case with the Commission in mid-November. During the quarter, Pepco announced reliability enhancement plans for Maryland and the District of Columbia. The six point reliability plan advances work on existing programs as well as initiates new activities.
The programs include enhanced vegetation management, priority feeder upgrades, load growth, distribution automation, underground residential cable replacement and selective undergrounding. By focusing on these six areas, Pepco plans to increase the reliability of the distribution system by reducing both the frequency and duration of power outages. The total incremental cost of these reliability improvements is estimated to be $100 million in Maryland and $90 million in the District of Columbia over the next five years.
We are currently in the process of updating our five year capital plan and we’ll determine by the end of this year, the impact that these additional reliability improvements may have on the total capital budget. We expect to initiate similar programs in our other jurisdictions in the near future. At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the retail energy supply business continues to be on tract and we are making progress on our efforts to ramp-up the Energy Services business.
Although, during the first half of this year, we had seen a slowing of contract signings, since July, PES has signed $90 million of new contracts. For example as seen on slide 8, Pepco Energy Services recently signed an energy savings and renewable energy performance contract with the Maryland Aviation Administration. The $21 million project includes the design and implementation of energy conservation measures that will improve the overall efficiency of more than 30 airport buildings including the main terminal at the BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport.
Pepco Energy Services will also install more than one acre of solar power generation equipment on the roof of the parking garage. Construction began in September, and is scheduled to be completed in December 2011. As we look ahead, we are lowering our longer term growth estimate and are now targeting an annual earnings of approximately $0.15 per share for Pepco Energy Services by 2014, down from $0.20 per share. PES has fewer federal projects currently under development than originally anticipated due to the governments focus on implementing the stimulus program at the expense of energy performance contracted.
We expect the focus to shift back to performance contract in over the coming year, but given the lengthy sales cycle, we have shifted the growth of the business to later in the planning horizon.
As we discussed last quarter, earlier this year, we began a comprehensive organizational review to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and achieve reduction in corporate overhead costs that were previously attributed to Conectiv Energy. We began the implementation of the restructuring plan during the third quarter and we expect to complete the execution of the plan by the end of this year.
The reduction in annual corporate overhead cost is currently estimated to be at least   $20 million for realization of the cost reductions is expected in 2011 and is reflected in our 2011 earnings outlook. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?

I will recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-d",1438,"Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I will recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy’s results as discontinued operations. Year-to-date Pepco Holdings has incurred an after-tax loss of $126 million from discontinued operations. We expect this loss will be partially offset over the remainder of the year by gains from the liquidation of the load service supply contracts and other remaining Conectiv Energy assets.
Upon completion of this liquidation, we currently expect the overall after-tax loss on the Connective Energy disposition will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million. Slide 9 summarizes our earnings for the quarter and year-to-date period. Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter were $21 million or $0.09 per share compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the third quarter of last year. There were three special items recorded in the 2010 period. The first is an $81 million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment costs that were incurred due to the earlier redemption of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Connectiv Energy generation asset sale.
The second is an $8 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the organizational review that Joe just discussed. And the third is a $6 million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Columbia related to Pepco’s divestiture of its generating assets in the year 2000. Note that we have recently filed an appeal of this order.
In the 2009 period we recognized after-tax gains related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized the Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would have been a $116 million or $0.52 per share compared to $77 million or $0.35 per share in the 2009 period.
For the year-to-date period, earnings from continuing operations were $125 million or $0.56 per share compared to $184 million or $0.84 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special items I just referred to, earnings from continuing operations for 2000 - for the 2010 year-to-date period would have been $220 million or $0.99 per share compared to $149 million or $0.68 per share in the 2009 period.
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on slide 10. Power Delivery earnings excluding special items were $0.41 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.31 per share for the 2009 quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of rate case decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware.
Higher weather related sales verses prior year also increased quarterly earnings by $0.04 per share. Cooling degree days were up by 36%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Colombia which represent approximately two-thirds of total distribution revenue is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by weather.
Higher transmission revenue contributed $0.03 per share of the earnings increase due to higher transmission rates in effect. Partially offsetting these increases, was higher operation and maintenance expense which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. This increase was driven by the higher storm activity in 2010, partially offset by lower pension expense.
Year-to-date Power Delivery earnings excluding special items were $0.79 per share in 2010 compared to $0.60 per share for the nine months ended September 2009. The higher earnings were due to higher distribution revenue due to higher rates, growth in the number of customers and higher customer usage. Other drivers of the increase were higher transmission revenue, higher weather related sales versus the prior year, and higher earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric’s basic generation service.
As we have previously discussed, under New Jersey regulation, Atlantic city Electric is entitle to recover from its customer all costs providing default service. Any difference between the total revenue and the total cost providing this service are deferred for future recovery from customers or returned to customers. However unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral is not included in the deferral calculation and therefore can impact earnings.
Typically the earnings impact is negligible. However given the much normal weather this year as compared to 2009, we realized a positive impact of $0.04 per share period-over-period. Over the last few years on an annual basis, we have experienced minimal earnings impact from unbilled revenue, partially offsetting factors in the year-to-date period were the negative impact of tax adjustments due to interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, higher depreciation expense as a result of utility plan investment and higher operation and maintenance expense driven by severe storms.
Pepco Energy Service’s third quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.06 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings was due to the cost to repair a distribution pipe leak of the thermal services business. Higher costs of operating a customer’s cogeneration plant and lower gross margins in the retail natural gas supply business. Year-to-date Pepco Energy Service’s earnings were $0.14 per share compared to $0.15 per share for the 2009 period. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the retail electricity supply business, partially offset by higher generation output.
In our corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.09 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulting from the restructuring of certain PHI entities as well as lower interest expense due to the pay down of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Connectiv Energy generation asset sale.
Year-to-date earnings improved by $0.14 per share driven by favorable state income tax adjustments. Turning to slide 11, given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our 2010 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations to $1.00 to $1.10 per share from the previous range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. The revised guidance range reflects strong Power Delivery operating results including the impact of hot summer weather on electric distribution revenue in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by the effects of a much higher level of storm activity in 2010 compared to 2009.
The revised guidance range also considers the anticipated reversal of $0.07 per share of our year-to-date earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric’s basic generation service as well as incremental operation and maintenance expense associated with Pepco’s reliability enhancement plans.
We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings outlook range of $1.10 to $1.30 per share. We expect to convert the 2011 earnings outlook range to more refined earnings guidance range in the first quarter of 2011. Now I’ll turn to slide 12 to review our recent financing activity. On October 1, Pepco Holdings issued $250 million of 2.7% notes due in 2015. A portion of the proceeds was used on October 13 to repurchase $40 million of 6.125% notes due in 2017. The remaining proceeds along with other funds will be used in November to redeem $200 million of 6% notes due in 2019 and $10 million of 5.9% notes due in 2016.
This debt refunding will result in lower annual interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share beginning in 2011. Our refinancing combined with the pay down of parent company debt that I referred to earlier has significantly lowered interest expense and resulted in a very - and resulted in a very manageable debt redemption schedule as you can see from the slide.
On the credit side, earlier this week, Pepco Holdings closed on two 364 day credit facilities totaling $200 million to replace the $400 million, 364 day credit facility that expired in October 2010 and the $50 million, 18 months facility that expires in November 2010. The size of the new facilities is $250 million, less than the expiring facilities due to lower liquidity and collateral requirements as a result of the continued exit of the retail energy business and the disposal of the Connectiv Energy segment.
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks.

And frankly, as I mentioned in my comments that the last two cases have been very disappointing and part of what are our assignment is going into 2011 and beyond is to kind of change the dialog with the regulator and have them understand that, in a moment where there is very necessary infrastructure investment putting us in this position is not good for anybody, certainly not good for the customer in the long-term. So having different mechanisms in place whether they’re writers, trackers, formulas is really going to be a win all around because it obviously mutes the impact on the customer bill. It’s going to provide the kind of reliability our customers want, there is a tremendous amount of our spend that is focused frankly on helping our customers lower their overall cost.
And what we want as a result of that is a reasonable chance to earn our allowed return. So we are where we are. We have significant growth ahead of us, but I think we’re also needing to have a different dialog with our regulators and Tony and his team and all of us, that’s a significant area of focus for us.

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $21 million compared to $104 million in the 2009 quarter. Excluding special items for both periods, earnings would have been $160 million in the 2010 quarter compared to $77 million for the 2009 quarter. Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings, which reflect positive impact of our infrastructure investments regulatory outcomes and higher sales due to hot summer weather. Lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds also boosted earnings after income tax adjustments. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results for both continuing operations and discontinued operations, as well as our operating segment performance, but first I'd like to address some topics of interest. We continue to be very active in the regulated front with 2 distribution base case currently pending and a decision received on August 6 in Pepco's Maryland case. In Maryland, the commission approved the $8 million annual increase in Pepco's distribution base rates based on a 9.83% return on equity. The details of the order can be seen on Slide 2. The new rates were effective as of July 29. Commission's decision fell short of our expectations. Not only do we view the return on equity that was authorized as being inadequate, we feel several the commissions rate making adjustment decisions make it challenging for Pepco to earn the authorized rate of return. On September 2, we filed with the commission and application for a hearing in which we are contesting several elements of the order. In our application, we requested reconsideration of our request for $2.3 million of post-test year reliability expenditures and for $1.5 million of enhanced vegetation management cost, which the commission presumed would be offset by savings. We also requested corrections to formulas, which the Commission mandated that Pepco use in calculating its annual cost of removal accrual. The corrections would increased depreciation expense by $4.7 million but will be offset by related cost recovery.
Slides 3 and 4 summarize the current status of our 2 cases in Delaware. In Delmarva Power electric distribution base rate case, our filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $24 million based on the 10.75% return on equity, assuming the implementation of revenue decoupling. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested rate increase into effect in November 2009, and the remainder of the request amounted into effect on April 19 of this year. These increases were put into effect on a temporary basis, pending final commission approval and are subject to refund. On October 1, the hearing commissioner issued a report to the commission, which recommends an increase of approximately $6 million based on 8.5% return on equity with the implementation of revenue decoupling. We found a the hearing examiner's report very disappointing and that several recommendations are contrary to commission President and the recommended return on equity is well below those granted in other electric utilities across the country. Our exception to hearing examiner's report were filed with the Commission on October 25 and the commission is expected to consider the case at its meeting scheduled for November 10, at which time the parties will be given the opportunity to further address these issues. On July 2, Delmarva Power filed a natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of $10 million based on the requested return on equity of 11% assuming approval of the implementation of revenue decoupling. Hearings are scheduled for January 18 and 19 and a decision by the Public Service Commission is expected in April 2011. Delmarva Power implemented an interim rate increase of $2.5 million effective August 31, subject to refund. The remainder of the requested rate increase may be implemented at the end of the statutory period, which is February 2, 2011, again, subject to refund. 
Looking ahead to our next round of cases, as you can see on Slide 5, we currently expect to file in Maryland in late 2010 or early 2011 for Delmarva Power and in spring of 2011 for Pepco. Next summer, we expect Pepco to file in the district, Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey and Delmarva Power to file an electric case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and may be impacted by financial projections or other considerations. We also plan to aggressively pursue on our rate case filings a more comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. Given our plans to make significant and necessary investments in our utilities, it is crucial that our regulators and other stakeholders in the regulatory process understand the causes and consequences of regulatory lag. Our filings will include proposals or methods to minimize lag. Earlier this month, the PJM Board reaffirmed the need for a Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP transmission project with the 1-year delay in the in-service date. Without MAPP, PJM's analysis shows significant violations of reliability criteria in the MAPP and East MAPP regions of PJM in 2015. The PJM Board directed us to adopt a project schedule to meet an in-service date of June 1, 2015. We plan to file an updated application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission before the end of this year. While the project was being reviewed by PJM, we put in place agreements for all new right of way and converter station locations and have been moving forward with the environmental permitting and engineering design. While the project cost remains an estimated $1.2 billion, we have revised our annual Construction Expenditure Forecast due to the change with the in-service date. The revised forecast can be seen on Slide 6. You can see that the near-term impact is a shifting of $83 million of capital from 2011 to later years. Also note that in the current forecasts, $183 million of capital has shifted from the Delmarva Power to Pepco as a result of the final route selected for the Chesapeake Bay Crossing. We continue to make good progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen a Slide 7. Over 190,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers and we expect to complete all the meter exchanges in Delaware by the end of the first quarter of 2011. Meter activation will occur in stages. We began activating meters this month and plan to have all Delaware meters activated by June 2011. The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, building an outage notification. In the District of Colombia, we began the deployment of advanced meters earlier this month with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Colombia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related cost between rate cases. In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters for Pepco customers subject to the implementation of the commission approved customer education and communication plan. We recently submitted this plan to the commission and stakeholders for review. The commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related cost with cost recovery in the base-rate preceding. We currently plan to begin meter installations in mid-2011 for Pepco's Maryland customers. For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters pending review and approval of unamended business case. We plan to file this business case with the Commission in mid-November. 
During the quarter, Pepco announced reliability enhancements plans for Maryland and the District of Colombia. The 6-point reliability plan advances work on existing programs as well as initiates new activities.
These programs include enhanced vegetation management, priority feeder upgrades, load growth, distribution automation, underground residential cable replacement and selective underground. By focusing on these 6 areas, Pepco plans to increase the reliability of the distribution system by reducing both the frequency and duration of power outages. The total incremental cost of these reliability improvements is estimated to be $100 million in Maryland and $90 million in the District of Colombia over the next 5 years. We are currently in the process of updating our 5-year capital plan and will determine by the end of this year the impact that these additional reliability improvements may have on the total capital budget. We expect to initiate similar programs in our other jurisdictions in the near future. 
At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track and we are making progress on our efforts to ramp up the Energy Services business. Although during the first half of this year, we had seen a slowing of contract signings. Since July, PES has signed $90 million of new contracts. For example, as seen on Slide 8, Pepco Energy Services recently signed an energy savings and renewable energy performance contract with the Maryland Aviation Administration. The $21 million project includes the design and implementation of energy conservation measures that will improve the overall efficiency of more than 30 airports buildings, including the main terminal at the BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport. Pepco Energy Services will also install more than 1 acre of solar power generation equipment on the roof of the parking garage. Construction began in September and is scheduled to be completed in December, 2011. As we look ahead, we are lowering our longer-term growth estimate and are now targeting an annual earnings of approximately $0.15 per share for Pepco Energy Services by 2014, down from $0.20 per share. PES has fewer federal projects currently under development than originally anticipated due to the government's focus on implementing the stimulus program at the expense of energy performance contracting. We expect the focus to shift back to performance contracting over the coming year but given lengthy sales cycle, we have shifted the growth of the business to later in the planning horizon. 
As we discussed last quarter, earlier this year, we began a comprehensive organizational review to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and achieve reduction in corporate overhead cost that were previously attributed to Conectiv Energy. We began the implementation of the restructuring plan during the third quarter and we expect to complete the execution of the plan by the end of this year. The reduction in annual corporate overhead cost is currently estimated to be at least $20 million. Full realization of the cost reductions is expected in 2011 and is reflected in our 2011 earnings outlook. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"

Our results for both the quarter and year-to-da",1413,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Year-to-date, Pepco Holdings has incurred an after-tax loss of $126 million from discontinued operations. We expect this loss will be partially offset over the remainder of the year by gains from the liquidation of the Load Service supply contracts and other remaining Conectiv Energy assets. Upon completion of this liquidation, we currently expect the overall after-tax loss on the Conectiv Energy disposition will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million. 
Slide 9 summarizes our earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter were $21 million or $0.09 per share, compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the third quarter of last year. There were 3 special items recorded in the 2010 period. The first is an $81 million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment cost that were encouraged due to the early redemption of parent company debt with the proceeds from Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. The second is an $8 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the organizational review that Joe just discussed. And the third is a $6 million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Colombia related to Pepco's divestiture of its generating assets in the year 2000. Note that we have recently filed an appeal of this order. 
In the 2009 period, we recognized after-tax gains related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognize the Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would've been $116 million or $0.52 per share, compared to $77 million or $0.35 per share in the 2009 period. For the year-to-date period, earnings from continuing operations were $125 million or $0.56 per share, compared to $184 million or $0.84 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special items I just referred to, earnings from continuing operations for the 2010 year-to-date period would've been to $220 million or $0.99 per share, compared to $149 million or $0.68 per share in the 2009 period. A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 10.
Power Delivery earnings, excluding special items, were $0.41 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.40 per share in the 2009 quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of rate case decisions for Pepco in the District of Colombia, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim reins put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware.
Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year also increased quarterly earnings by $0.04 per share. Cooling degree days were up by 36%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Colombia, which represent approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue is decoupled for consumption and therefore is not impacted by weather. Higher transmission revenue contributed to $0.03 per share of the earnings increase due to higher transmission rates in effect. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. This increase was driven by the higher storm activity in 2010, partially offset by lower pension expense. Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings excluding special items were $0.79 per share in 2010 compared to $0.60 per share for the 9 months ended September, 2009. The higher earnings were due to higher distribution revenue due to higher rates, growth in the number of customers and higher customer usage. Other drivers of the increase were higher transmission revenue, higher weather-related sales versus the prior year and higher earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City electric basic generation service. As we have previously discussed, under New Jersey regulation, Atlantic City Electric is entitled to recover from its customer all cost of providing default service. Any difference between the total revenue and the total cost in providing the service are deferred for future recovery from customers or returned to customers. However, unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation and therefore can impact earnings. Typically the earnings impact is negligible. However, given the much warmer weather this year as compared to 2009, we realized the positive impact of $0.04 per share, period-over-period. Over the last few years on an annual basis, we've experienced minimal earnings impact from unbilled revenue. Partially offsetting factors in the year-to-date period were the negative impact of tax adjustments due to interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, higher depreciation expense as a result of utility plant investment, and higher operation and maintenance expense driven by severe storms. Pepco Energy Services third quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.06 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings was due to the cost to repair a distribution pipe leak for the thermal services business, higher cost of operating a customer's cogeneration plant and lower gross margins in the retail natural gas supply business. Year-to-date, Pepco Energy Services earnings were $0.14 per share, compared to $0.15 per share from the 2009 period. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind-down of the retail electricity supply business partially offset by higher generation outlook. There are corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs. Earnings improved by $0.09 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulted from the restructuring of certain PHI entities as well as lower interest expense due to the paydown of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. Year-to-date, earnings improved by $0.14 per share driven by favorable state income tax adjustments.
Turning to Slide 11, given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our 2010 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations to $1 to $1.10 per share from the previous range from $0.80 to $0.95 per share. The revised guidance range reflect strong Power Delivery operating results including the impact of hot summer weather on electric distribution revenue in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by the effects of a much higher level of storm activity in 2010 compared to 2009.
The revised guidance range also considers the anticipated reversal of $0.07 per share of our year-to-date earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City electric's basic generation service as well as incremental operation and maintenance expense associated with Pepco's reliability enhancement investment plans. We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings outlook range of $1.10 to $1.30 per share. We expect to convert the 2011 earnings outlook range to more refined earnings guidance range in the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 12 to review our recent financing activity. On October 1, Pepco Holdings issued $250 million of 2.7% notes due in 2015. A portion of the proceeds was used on October 13 to repurchase $40 million of 6.125% notes due in 2017. The remaining proceeds along with other funds will be used in November to redeem $200 million of 6% notes during 2019 and $10 million of 5.9% notes due in 2016. This debt refunding will result in lower annual interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share beginning in 2011. Our refinancing, combined with the paydown of parent company debt that I referred to earlier, has significantly lower interest expense and resulted a very manageable debt redemption schedule as you can see from the Slide. On the credit side earlier this week, Pepco Holdings closed on 2 364-day credit facilities totaling $200 million to replaced the $400 million, 364-day credit facility that expired in October, 2010. And the $50 million, 18-month facility that expires in November 2010. The size of the new facilities is $250 million, less than the expiring facilities due to lower liquidity and collateral requirements as a result of the continued exit of the retail energy business and the disposal of the Conectiv Energy segment.

So having different mechanisms in place whether they're writers, trackers, formulas is really going to be a win all around because it obviously mutes the impact on the customer bill.

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $21 million compared to $104 million in the 2009 quarter. Excluding special items for both periods, earnings would have been $160 million in the 2010 quarter compared to $77 million for the 2009 quarter. 
Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings, which reflect positive impact of our infrastructure investments, regulatory outcomes and higher sales due to hot summer weather. Lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds also boosted earnings after income tax adjustments. 
Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results for both continuing operations and discontinued operations, as well as our operating segment performance, but first I'd like to address some topics of interest. 
We continue to be very active on the regulated front, with 2 distribution base case currently pending and a decision received on August 6 in Pepco's Maryland case. In Maryland, the Commission approved the $8 million annual increase in Pepco's distribution base rates based on a 9.83% return on equity. The details of the order can be seen on Slide 2. The new rates were effective as of July 29. The Commission's decision fell short of our expectations. Not only do we view the return on equity that was authorized as being inadequate, we feel several the Commission's ratemaking adjustment decisions make it challenging for Pepco to earn the authorized rate of return. 
On September 2, we filed with the Commission an application for rehearing in which we are contesting several elements of the order. In our application, we requested reconsideration of our request for $2.3 million of post-test year reliability expenditures and for $1.5 million of enhanced vegetation management cost, which the Commission presumed would be offset by savings. We also requested corrections to formulas, which the Commission mandated that Pepco use in calculating its annual cost of removal accrual. 
The corrections would increase depreciation expense by $4.7 million but will be offset by related cost recovery. Slides 3 and 4 summarize the current status of our 2 cases in Delaware. In Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case, our filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $24 million based on the 10.75% return on equity, assuming the implementation of revenue decoupling. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested rate increase into effect in November 2009, and the remainder of the requested amount into effect on April 19 of this year. 
These increases were put into effect on a temporary basis, pending final commission approval and are subject to refund. On October 1, the hearing commissioner issued her report to the Commission, which recommends an increase of approximately $6 million based on 8.5% return on equity with the implementation of revenue decoupling. We found the hearing examiner's report very disappointing and that several recommendations are contrary to commission president, and the recommended return on equity is well below those granted in other electric utilities across the country. 
Our exception to hearing examiner's report were filed with the Commission on October 25, and the Commission is expected to consider the case at its meeting scheduled for November 10, at which time the parties will be given the opportunity to further address these issues. On July 2, Delmarva Power filed a natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of $10 million based on the requested return on equity of 11%, assuming approval of the implementation of revenue decoupling. 
Hearings are scheduled for January 18 and 19, and a decision by the Public Service Commission is expected in April 2011. Delmarva Power implemented an interim rate increase of $2.5 million effective August 31, subject to refund. The remainder of the requested rate increase may be implemented at the end of the statutory period, which is February 2, 2011, again, subject to refund. Looking ahead to our next round of cases, as you can see on Slide 5, we currently expect to file in Maryland in late 2010 or early 2011 for Delmarva Power and in the spring of 2011 for Pepco. 
Next summer, we expect Pepco to file in the district, Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey and Delmarva Power to file an electric case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and may be impacted by financial projections or other considerations. We also plan to aggressively pursue on our rate case filings a more comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. 
Given our plans to make significant and necessary investments in our utilities, it is crucial that our regulators and other stakeholders in the regulatory process understand the causes and consequences of regulatory lag. Our filings will include proposals for methods to minimize lag. Earlier this month, the PJM Board reaffirmed the need for a Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP transmission project, with a 1-year delay in the in-service date. 
Without MAPP, PJM's analysis shows significant violations of reliability criteria in the MAAC and East MAAC regions of PJM in 2015. The PJM Board directed us to adopt project schedule to meet an in-service date of June 1, 2015. We plan to file an updated application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission before the end of this year. While the project was being reviewed by PJM, we put in place agreements for all new right-of-way and converter station locations and have been moving forward with the environmental permitting and engineering design. 
While the project cost remains an estimated $1.2 billion, we have revised our annual Construction Expenditure Forecast due to the change with the in-service date. The revised forecast can be seen on Slide 6. You can see that the near-term impact is a shifting of $83 million of capital from 2011 to later years. Also note that in the current forecast, $183 million of capital has shifted from Delmarva Power to Pepco as a result of the final route selected for the Chesapeake Bay crossing. 
We continue to make good progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen a Slide 7. Over 190,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers, and we expect to complete all the meter exchanges in Delaware by the end of the first quarter of 2011. Meter activation will occur in stages. We began activating meters this month and plan to have all Delaware meters activated by June 2011. 
The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, billing and outage notification. In the District of Columbia, we began the deployment of advanced meters earlier this month with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related costs between rate cases. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters for Pepco customers subject to the implementation of a commission-approved customer education and communication plan. We recently submitted this plan to the Commission and stakeholders for review. The Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related costs with cost recovery in a base rate preceding. We currently plan to begin meter installations in mid-2011 for Pepco's Maryland customers. 
For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters, pending review and approval of an amended business case. We plan to file this business case with the Commission in mid-November. During the quarter, Pepco announced reliability enhancements plans for Maryland and the District of Columbia. The 6-point reliability plan advances work on existing programs, as well as initiates new activities.
These programs include enhanced vegetation management, priority feeder upgrades, load growth, distribution automation, underground residential cable replacement and selective undergrounding. By focusing on these 6 areas, Pepco plans to increase the reliability of the distribution system by reducing both the frequency and duration of power outages. The total incremental cost of these reliability improvements is estimated to be $100 million in Maryland and $90 million in the District of Columbia over the next 5 years. 
We are currently in the process of updating our 5-year capital plan, and we'll determine by the end of this year the impact that these additional reliability improvements may have on the total capital budget. We expect to initiate similar programs in our other jurisdictions in the near future. At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track, and we are making progress on our efforts to ramp up the Energy Services business. 
Although during the first half of this year we had seen a slowing of contract signings, since July, PES has signed $90 million of new contracts. For example, as seen on Slide 8, Pepco Energy Services recently signed an energy savings and renewable energy performance contract with the Maryland Aviation Administration. The $21 million project includes the design and implementation of energy conservation measures that will improve the overall efficiency of more than 30 airport buildings, including the main terminal at the BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport. 
Pepco Energy Services will also install more than 1 acre of solar power generation equipment on the roof of the parking garage. Construction began in September and is scheduled to be completed in December 2011. As we look ahead, we are lowering our longer-term growth estimate and are now targeting an annual earnings of approximately $0.15 per share for Pepco Energy Services by 2014, down from $0.20 per share. PES has fewer federal projects currently under development than originally anticipated due to the government's focus on implementing the stimulus program at the expense of energy performance contracting. 
We expect the focus to shift back to performance contracting over the coming year but given the lengthy sales cycle, we have shifted the growth of the business to later in the planning horizon. 
As we discussed last quarter, earlier this year, we began a comprehensive organizational review to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and achieve reduction in corporate overhead costs that were previously attributed to Conectiv Energy. We began the implementation of the restructuring plan during the third quarter, and we expect to complete the execution of the plan by the end of this year. 
The reduction in annual corporate overhead costs is currently estimated to be at least $20 million. Full realization of the cost reductions is expected in 2011 and is reflected in our 2011 earnings outlook. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"
297660,114725826,144769,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-da",1414,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date period show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Year-to-date, Pepco Holdings has incurred an after-tax loss of $126 million from discontinued operations. We expect this loss will be partially offset over the remainder of the year by gains from the liquidation of the Load Service supply contracts and other remaining Conectiv Energy assets. 
Upon completion of this liquidation, we currently expect the overall after-tax loss on the Conectiv Energy disposition will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million. Slide 9 summarizes our earnings for the quarter and year-to-date period. Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter were $21 million or $0.09 per share, compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the third quarter of last year. There were 3 special items recorded in the 2010 period. The first is an $81 million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment costs that were incurred due to the early redemption of parent company debt with the proceeds from Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. 
The second is an $8 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the organizational review that Joe just discussed. And the third is a $6 million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Columbia related to Pepco's divestiture of its generating assets in the year 2000. Note that we have recently filed an appeal of this order. 
In the 2009 period, we recognized after-tax gains related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized the Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $116 million or $0.52 per share, compared to $77 million or $0.35 per share in the 2009 period. 
For the year-to-date period, earnings from continuing operations were $125 million or $0.56 per share, compared to $184 million or $0.84 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special items I just referred to, earnings from continuing operations for the 2010 year-to-date period would have been $220 million or $0.99 per share, compared to $149 million or $0.68 per share in the 2009 period. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 10. Power Delivery earnings, excluding special items, were $0.41 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.31 per share for the 2009 quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of rate case decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware.
Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year also increased quarterly earnings by $0.04 per share. Cooling degree days were up by 36%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by weather. 
Higher transmission revenue contributed $0.03 per share of the earnings increase due to higher transmission rates in effect. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. This increase was driven by the higher storm activity in 2010, partially offset by lower pension expense. 
Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings, excluding special items, were $0.79 per share in 2010 compared to $0.60 per share for the 9 months ended September 2009. The higher earnings were due to higher distribution revenue due to higher rates, growth in the number of customers and higher customer usage. Other drivers of the increase were higher transmission revenue, higher weather-related sales versus the prior year and higher earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. 
As we have previously discussed, under New Jersey regulation, Atlantic City Electric is entitled to recover from its customer all costs providing default service. Any difference between the total revenue and the total cost providing this service are deferred for future recovery from customers or returned to customers. However, unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation and therefore can impact earnings. 
Typically, the earnings impact is negligible. However, given the much warmer weather this year as compared to 2009, we realized the positive impact of $0.04 per share period-over-period. Over the last few years on an annual basis, we have experienced minimal earnings impact from unbilled revenue. Partially offsetting factors in the year-to-date period were the negative impact of tax adjustments due to interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, higher depreciation expense as a result of utility plant investment and higher operation and maintenance expense driven by severe storms. 
Pepco Energy Services' third quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.06 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings was due to the cost to repair a distribution pipe leak for the thermal services business, higher costs of operating a customer's cogeneration plant and lower gross margins in the retail natural gas supply business. Year-to-date, Pepco Energy Services' earnings were $0.14 per share compared to $0.15 per share for the 2009 period. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind-down of the retail electricity supply business partially offset by higher generation outcome. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.09 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulting from the restructuring of certain PHI entities, as well as lower interest expense due to the paydown of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. 
Year-to-date, earnings improved by $0.14 per share driven by favorable state income tax adjustments. Turning to Slide 11, given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our 2010 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations to $1 to $1.10 per share from the previous range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. The revised guidance range reflects strong Power Delivery operating results, including the impact of hot summer weather on electric distribution revenue in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by the effects of the much higher level of storm activity in 2010 compared to 2009.
The revised guidance range also considers the anticipated reversal of $0.07 per share of our year-to-date earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service, as well as incremental operation and maintenance expense associated with Pepco's reliability enhancement plans. We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings outlook range of $1.10 to $1.30 per share. We expect to convert the 2011 earnings outlook range to a more refined earnings guidance range in the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 12 to review our recent financing activity. On October 1, Pepco Holdings issued $250 million of 2.7% notes due in 2015. A portion of the proceeds was used on October 13 to repurchase $40 million of 6.125% notes due in 2017. The remaining proceeds, along with other funds, will be used in November to redeem $200 million of 6% notes due in 2019 and $10 million of 5.9% notes due in 2016. 
This debt refunding will result in lower annual interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share beginning in 2011. Our refinancing, combined with the paydown of parent company debt that I referred to earlier, has significantly lowered interest expense and resulted in a very manageable debt redemption schedule as you can see from the slide. 
On the credit side, earlier this week, Pepco Holdings closed on 2 364-day credit facilities totaling $200 million to replace the $400 million, 364-day credit facility that expired in October 2010, and the $50 million, 18-month facility that expires in November 2010. The size of the new facilities is $250 million less than the expiring facilities due to lower liquidity and collateral requirements as a result of the continued exit of the Retail Energy business and the disposal of the Conectiv Energy segment. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

So having different mechanisms in place, whether they're writers, trackers, formulas, is really going to be a win all around because it obviously mutes the impact on the customer bill. It's going to provide the kind of reliability our customers want. There's a tremendous amount of our spend that is focused frankly on helping our customers lower their overall cost.

Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $21 million compared to $104 million in the 2009 quarter. Excluding special items for both periods, earnings would have been $160 million in the 2010 quarter compared to $77 million for the 2009 quarter. 
Our operating results were driven by strong Power Delivery earnings, which reflect positive impact of our infrastructure investments, regulatory outcomes and higher sales due to the hot summer weather. Lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of parent company debt with Conectiv Energy's generation asset sale proceeds also boosted earnings as did income tax adjustments. 
Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Tony will discuss the financial results for both continuing operations and discontinued operations, as well as our operating segment performance, but first I'd like to address some topics of interest. 
We continue to be very active on the regulated front, with 2 distribution base case currently pending and a decision received on August 6 in Pepco's Maryland case. In Maryland, the Commission approved the $8 million annual increase in Pepco's distribution base rates based on a 9.83% return on equity. The details of the order can be seen on Slide 2. The new rates were effective as of July 29. The Commission's decision fell short of our expectations. Not only do we view the return on equity that was authorized as being inadequate, we feel several of the Commission's ratemaking adjustment decisions make it challenging for Pepco to earn the authorized rate of return. 
On September 2, we filed with the Commission an application for rehearing in which we are contesting several elements of the order. In our application, we requested reconsideration of our request for $2.3 million of post-test year reliability expenditures and for $1.5 million of enhanced vegetation management cost, which the Commission presumed would be offset by savings. We also requested corrections to formulas, which the Commission mandated that Pepco use in calculating its annual cost of removal accrual. 
The corrections would increase depreciation expense by $4.7 million but will be offset by related cost recovery. Slides 3 and 4 summarize the current status of our 2 cases in Delaware. In Delmarva Power's electric distribution base rate case, our filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of approximately $24 million based on a 10.75% return on equity, assuming the implementation of revenue decoupling. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power put $2.5 million of its requested rate increase into effect in November 2009, and the remainder of the requested amount into effect on April 19 of this year. 
These increases were put into effect on a temporary basis, pending final commission approval and are subject to refund. On October 1, the hearing commissioner issued her report to the Commission, which recommends an increase of approximately $6 million based on an 8.5% return on equity with the implementation of revenue decoupling. We found the hearing examiner's report very disappointing and that several recommendations are contrary to commission precedent, and the recommended return on equity is well below those granted in other electric utilities across the country. 
Our exception to hearing examiner's report were filed with the Commission on October 25, and the Commission is expected to consider the case at its meeting scheduled for November 10, at which time the parties will be given the opportunity to further address these issues. On July 2, Delmarva Power filed a natural gas delivery base rate case in Delaware. The filing seeks approval of an annual rate increase of $10 million based on the requested return on equity of 11%, assuming approval of the implementation of revenue decoupling. 
Hearings are scheduled for January 18 and 19, and a decision by the Public Service Commission is expected in April 2011. Delmarva Power implemented an interim rate increase of $2.5 million effective August 31, subject to refund. The remainder of the requested rate increase may be implemented at the end of the statutory period, which is February 2, 2011, again, subject to refund. Looking ahead to our next round of cases, as you can see on Slide 5, we currently expect to file in Maryland in late 2010 or early 2011 for Delmarva Power and in the spring of 2011 for Pepco. 
Next summer, we expect Pepco to file in the District, Atlantic City Electric to file in New Jersey and Delmarva Power to file an electric case in Delaware. Note that this filing schedule is tentative and may be impacted by financial projections or other considerations. We also plan to aggressively pursue on our rate case filings a more comprehensive discussion on the topic of regulatory lag and its negative effects. 
Given our plans to make significant and necessary investments in our utilities, it is crucial that our regulators and other stakeholders in the regulatory process understand the causes and consequences of regulatory lag. Our filings will include proposals for methods to minimize lag. Earlier this month, the PJM Board reaffirmed the need for a Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway or MAPP transmission project, with a 1-year delay in the in-service date. 
Without MAPP, PJM's analysis shows significant violations of reliability criteria in the MAAC and East MAAC regions of PJM in 2015. The PJM Board directed us to adopt project schedule to meet an in-service date of June 1, 2015. We plan to file an updated application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Maryland Public Service Commission before the end of this year. While the project was being reviewed by PJM, we put in place agreements for all new right-of-way and converter station locations and have been moving forward with the environmental permitting and engineering design. 
While the project cost remains an estimated $1.2 billion, we have revised our annual Construction Expenditure Forecast due to the change with the in-service date. The revised forecast can be seen on Slide 6. You can see that the near-term impact is a shifting of $83 million of capital from 2011 to later years. Also note that in the current forecast, $183 million of capital has shifted from Delmarva Power to Pepco as a result of the final route selected for the Chesapeake Bay crossing. 
We continue to make good progress on our blueprint for the future initiatives. The status by jurisdiction can be seen a Slide 7. Over 190,000 advanced meters have been installed in Delaware for our electric and gas customers, and we expect to complete all the meter exchanges in Delaware by the end of the first quarter of 2011. Meter activation will occur in stages. We began activating meters this month and plan to have all Delaware meters activated by June 2011. 
The initial functionality includes remote meter reading, billing and outage notification. In the District of Columbia, we began the deployment of advanced meters earlier this month with the goal of having the installations completed by the end of 2011. As approved by the commissions in Delaware and the District of Columbia, regulatory assets have been created to assure recovery of and a return on AMI-related costs between rate cases. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the deployment of advanced meters for Pepco customers subject to the implementation of a commission-approved customer education and communication plan. We recently submitted this plan to the Commission and stakeholders for review. The Commission also approved the creation of a regulatory asset for AMI-related costs with cost recovery in a base rate preceding. We currently plan to begin meter installations in mid-2011 for Pepco's Maryland customers. 
For Delmarva Power, the Maryland Commission deferred its decision on the deployment of advanced meters, pending review and approval of an amended business case. We plan to file this business case with the Commission in mid-November. During the quarter, Pepco announced reliability enhancements plans for Maryland and the District of Columbia. The 6-point reliability plan advances work on existing programs, as well as initiates new activities.
These programs include enhanced vegetation management, priority feeder upgrades, load growth, distribution automation, underground residential cable replacement and selective undergrounding. By focusing on these 6 areas, Pepco plans to increase the reliability of the distribution system by reducing both the frequency and duration of power outages. The total incremental cost of these reliability improvements is estimated to be $100 million in Maryland and $90 million in the District of Columbia over the next 5 years. 
We are currently in the process of updating our 5-year capital plan, and we'll determine by the end of this year the impact that these additional reliability improvements may have on the total capital budget. We expect to initiate similar programs in our other jurisdictions in the near future. At Pepco Energy Services, the profitable wind down of the Retail Energy Supply business continues to be on track, and we are making progress on our efforts to ramp up the Energy Services business. 
Although during the first half of this year we had seen a slowing of contract signings, since July, PES has signed $90 million of new contracts. For example, as seen on Slide 8, Pepco Energy Services recently signed an energy savings and renewable energy performance contract with the Maryland Aviation Administration. The $21 million project includes the design and implementation of energy conservation measures that will improve the overall efficiency of more than 30 airport buildings, including the main terminal at the BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport. 
Pepco Energy Services will also install more than 1 acre of solar power generation equipment on the roof of the parking garage. Construction began in September and is scheduled to be completed in December 2011. As we look ahead, we are lowering our longer-term growth estimate and are now targeting an annual earnings of approximately $0.15 per share for Pepco Energy Services by 2014, down from $0.20 per share. PES has fewer federal projects currently under development than originally anticipated due to the government's focus on implementing the stimulus program at the expense of energy performance contracting. 
We expect the focus to shift back to performance contracting over the coming year but given the lengthy sales cycle, we have shifted the growth of the business to later in the planning horizon. 
As we discussed last quarter, earlier this year, we began a comprehensive organizational review to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and achieve reduction in corporate overhead costs that were previously attributed to Conectiv Energy. We began the implementation of the restructuring plan during the third quarter, and we expect to complete the execution of the plan by the end of this year. 
The reduction in annual corporate overhead costs is currently estimated to be at least $20 million. Full realization of the cost reductions is expected in 2011 and is reflected in our 2011 earnings outlook. At this point, let me turn it over to Tony Kamerick. Tony?"
297660,114725826,144877,"Pepco Holdings, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Pepco Holdings LLC","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-da",1415,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll recap our earnings, address our performance by operating segment and review our recent financing activity. We will then open the call to your questions. Our results for both the quarter and year-to-date period show Conectiv Energy's results as discontinued operations. Year-to-date, Pepco Holdings has incurred an after-tax loss of $126 million from discontinued operations. We expect this loss will be partially offset over the remainder of the year by gains from the liquidation of the Load Service supply contracts and other remaining Conectiv Energy assets. 
Upon completion of this liquidation, we currently expect the overall after-tax loss on the Conectiv Energy disposition will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million. Slide 9 summarizes our earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter were $21 million or $0.09 per share, compared to $104 million or $0.47 per share for the third quarter of last year. There were 3 special items recorded in the 2010 period. The first is an $81 million after-tax charge for debt extinguishment costs that were incurred due to the early redemption of parent company debt with the proceeds from the  Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. 
The second is an $8 million after-tax restructuring charge related to the organizational review that Joe just discussed. And the third is a $6 million after-tax charge due to the issuance of an order in the District of Columbia related to Pepco's divestiture of its generating assets in the year 2000. Note that we have recently filed an appeal of this order. 
In the 2009 period, we recognized after-tax gains related to the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. We also recognized the Maryland state income tax benefit due to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Excluding the special items, earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $116 million or $0.52 per share, compared to $77 million or $0.35 per share in the 2009 period. 
For the year-to-date period, earnings from continuing operations were $125 million or $0.56 per share, compared to $184 million or $0.84 per share for the 2009 period. Excluding the special items I just referred to, earnings from continuing operations for the 2010 year-to-date period would have been $220 million or $0.99 per share, compared to $149 million or $0.68 per share in the 2009 period. 
A summary of the drivers of our financial results can be found on Slide 10. Power Delivery earnings, excluding special items, were $0.41 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.31 per share for the 2009 quarter. Higher distribution rates during the quarter increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The higher rates reflect the impact of rate case decisions for Pepco in the District of Columbia, Delmarva Power in Maryland and for Atlantic City Electric. The higher rates also reflect the interim rates put in place for Delmarva Power in Delaware.
Higher weather-related sales versus the prior year also increased quarterly earnings by $0.04 per share. Cooling degree days were up by 36%. Keep in mind that our distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which represents approximately 2/3 of total distribution revenue, is decoupled from consumption and therefore is not impacted by weather. 
Higher transmission revenue contributed $0.03 per share of the earnings increase due to higher transmission rates in effect. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operation and maintenance expense which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. This increase was driven by the higher storm activity in 2010, partially offset by lower pension expense. 
Year-to-date, Power Delivery earnings, excluding special items, were $0.79 per share in 2010 compared to $0.60 per share for the 9 months ended September 2009. The higher earnings were due to higher distribution revenue due to higher rates, growth in the number of customers and higher customer usage. Other drivers of the increase were higher transmission revenue, higher weather-related sales versus the prior year and higher earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service. 
As we have previously discussed, under New Jersey regulation, Atlantic City Electric is entitled to recover from its customer all costs providing default service. Any difference between the total revenue and the total cost providing this service are deferred for future recovery from customers or returned to customers. However, unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation and therefore can impact earnings. 
Typically, the earnings impact is negligible. However, given the much warmer weather this year as compared to 2009, we realized a positive impact of $0.04 per share period-over-period. Over the last few years on an annual basis, we have experienced minimal earnings impact from unbilled revenue. Partially offsetting factors in the year-to-date period were the negative impact of tax adjustments due to interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, higher depreciation expense as a result of utility plant investment and higher operation and maintenance expense driven by severe storms. 
Pepco Energy Services' third quarter earnings were $0.03 per share as compared to $0.06 per share for the 2009 quarter. The decrease in earnings was due to the cost to repair a distribution pipe leak for the thermal services business, higher costs of operating a customer's cogeneration plant and lower gross margins in the retail natural gas supply business. Year-to-date, Pepco Energy Services' earnings were $0.14 per share compared to $0.15 per share for the 2009 period. The decrease in earnings was due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind-down of the retail electricity supply business partially offset by higher generation outcome. 
In our corporate and other segment, which is primarily unallocated corporate costs, earnings improved by $0.09 per share quarter-over-quarter. The earnings improvement is due to the favorable state income tax effect resulting from the restructuring of certain PHI entities, as well as lower interest expense due to the paydown of parent company debt with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy generation asset sale. 
Year-to-date, earnings improved by $0.14 per share driven by favorable state income tax adjustments. Turning to Slide 11, given the year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our 2010 earnings guidance range for ongoing operations to $1 to $1.10 per share from the previous range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. The revised guidance range reflects strong Power Delivery operating results, including the impact of hot summer weather on electric distribution revenue in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by the effects of the much higher level of storm activity in 2010 compared to 2009.
The revised guidance range also considers the anticipated reversal of $0.07 per share of our year-to-date earnings from unbilled revenue related to Atlantic City Electric's basic generation service, as well as incremental operation and maintenance expense associated with Pepco's reliability enhancement plans. We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings outlook range of $1.10 to $1.30 per share. We expect to convert the 2011 earnings outlook range to a more refined earnings guidance range in the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 12 to review our recent financing activity. On October 1, Pepco Holdings issued $250 million of 2.7% notes due in 2015. A portion of the proceeds was used on October 13 to repurchase $40 million of 6.125% notes due in 2017. The remaining proceeds, along with other funds, will be used in November to redeem $200 million of 6% notes due in 2019 and $10 million of 5.9% notes due in 2016. 
This debt refunding will result in lower annual interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share beginning in 2011. Our refinancing, combined with the paydown of parent company debt that I referred to earlier, has significantly lowered interest expense and resulted in a very manageable debt redemption schedule as you can see from the slide. 
On the credit side, earlier this week, Pepco Holdings closed on 2 364-day credit facilities totaling $200 million to replace the $400 million, 364-day credit facility that expired in October 2010, and the $50 million, 18-month facility that expires in November 2010. The size of the new facilities is $250 million less than the expiring facilities due to lower liquidity and collateral requirements as a result of the continued exit of the Retail Energy business and the disposal of the Conectiv Energy segment. 
Now let me turn it back to Joe Rigby for some closing remarks."

That's kind of how we think about the situation we're in that we're going to be flying below the allowed return. And frankly, as I mentioned in my comments, that the last 2 cases have been very disappointing. And part of what our assignment is going into 2011 and beyond is to kind of change the dialogue with the regulator and have them understand that in a moment where there is very necessary infrastructure investment, putting us in this position is not good for anybody, certainly not good for the customer in the long-term. So having different mechanisms in place, whether they're writers, trackers, formulas, is really going to be a win all around because it obviously mutes the impact on the customer bill. It's going to provide the kind of reliability our customers want. There's a tremendous amount of our spend that is focused frankly on helping our customers lower their overall cost. And what we want as a result of that is a reasonable chance to earn our allowed return. So we are where we are. We have significant growth ahead of us, but I think we're also needing to have a different dialogue with our regulators and Tony and his team and all of us. That's a significant area of focus for us. And I do expect that we're going to get some real good traction in 2011 on that."

Do you see that really as a philosophical change in their mind on your risk profile?

One is I absolutely agree with your premise that I think this is reflective of some of the recent, the kind of the current economic condition, and obviously a very difficult situation our regulators would be in. I also think that what you're seeing is somewhat of an impact of implementing decoupling in a sense that there's been a change in the risk profile. So what we have seen is -- our position going in is to suggest a 25 basis point change in the allowed ROE, and the Commission is taking 50 basis points. So that's -- that in combination, I think, with this pressure to react to the current economic condition is what's pushing these things below double digits."
