So as a result, Time Warner is better positioned today than ever. We've got strong operational and financial momentum, and there's increasing evidence that industry trends are going our way. And now, I think we're structured to run our businesses more aggressively than ever. We delivered very strong adjusted earnings per share growth last year, despite the worst recession in most of our lives. Our Networks and Film businesses posted record profits, driven largely by the strength of our content. And that performance underscores two things that we have discussed before. Demand is growing for the kind of high quality content that we make, as consumers enjoy more choices. It also shows how our unique combination of scale, brands and talent enables us to institutionalize success in hit-driven businesses. In 2009, we approved the efficiency and productivity of our businesses. By reallocating resources, we substantially raised our investment in her programming and production. And that's critical to drive our revenue and extend our competitive position. And we still increase margins by significantly reducing overhead expense. While we were doing that, we strengthened our balance sheet last year as well, while doubling our return of capital to shareholders. Free cash flow totaled almost $3 billion. And we returned over $2 billion of that, or more than 70%, to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also spun off Time Warner Cable and AOL, and that allowed us to focus all our energy and resources on what we do best, making and distributing the most compelling branded content on traditional and emerging platforms, and monetizing it better than anyone else. In 2010 and beyond, we'll build on this foundation. As you saw in this morning's outlook release, we expect to grow our Adjusted EPS mid-teens in 2010. We'll do that by executing even more aggressively on the four operational priorities that I've discussed with you before. The first is leveraging our scale and brands to create the highest quality content and monetize it better than anyone else. Second, make our operations more efficient by allocating resources to the best and most productive use. Third, we're going to keep expanding internationally. And fourth, we're developing new business models that capitalize on changes in consumer usage and technology, while at the same time ensuring when possible that they're additive and not cannibalistic. We're going to talk more about that. In practice, this means that we will again spend more on programming and production in 2010. We'll invest more in new digital initiatives and extend our brands internationally. And we'll do that while keeping our overall expenses relatively flat. And I'd like to expand on what that means in each of our four divisions.So I'll start with Turner. We made considerable investments in original programming last year to make sure that our networks become even more attractive for our viewers, our advertisers and our affiliates. We have a lot of successes. Last year, TNT original dramas grew ratings in the same time slots by over 50% over the prior year. And three of it's new original series ranked in cable's top five. Just to pick one of them, TBS debuted the Lopez Tonight Show to double-digit gains in it's time slot. And in it's first few weeks, it outdelivered most other late-night talk shows in valuable 18 to 30 demo. However, not every new original or acquired series worked or connected with viewers as much as we would have liked. We're making changes where necessary, and I remain confident, as we have been, that we'll attract growing audience over the long term. In 2010, just to give you a view of that, we'll bring back hit shows like The Closer and Leverage to TNT, while developing new original dramas such as the new series from Steven Spielberg and George Clooney. We'll also expand our original programming lineup on TBS. I'd like to point out that we expect our entertainment networks to grow ad revenue for the year, even without a major rebound in ratings trends, which we will be working on to do as well. At CNN, we invest tremendous resources on news gathering to deliver the most comprehensive, non-partisan news and analysis in the industry, and do it across all platforms. If you've watched CNN during the tragedy in Haiti, you know that the depth and breadth of our coverage is unparalleled. CNN's ratings vary depending on the news environment. We typically outperform our peers significantly during major news events, as more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. And we have lower ratings when the news cycle is slow. But CNN's position as the premium, biggest reach, multi-platform brand in the news business enables us to consistently command premium pricing from advertisers. In fact, despite ratings declines, this last year compared to the record performance in the 2008 election year, CNN again grew it's profits by double digits in 2009. This year, we expect another year of strong profit growth at CNN.HBO. The performance at HBO last year illustrates that it's value proposition has never been better. It aired four of the six highest-rated shows in it's entire history, and it grew it's subscriber base for the year despite the recession. This year, HBO is bringing back the next season of our highest-rated shows, including True Blood, Entourage, Hung and Big Love. We'll debut The Pacific, the highly anticipated miniseries from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. That's the companion to Band of Brothers. And we'll premiere Martin Scorsese's Boardwalk Empire, with it poised to HBO's next breakout hit show. Both Turner and HBO will keep expanding internationally this year too. Turner's International business currently operates more than 100 feeds across 200 countries. We'll expand organically by launching new feeds in new markets and adding new distributors. We'll also make acquisitions where it makes sense. For example, we recently agreed to acquire NDTV Imagine, which is a general entertainment network in India, that will significantly increase our presence and scale in that region. HBO has over 33 million subscribers internationally, that at HBO Latin America, HBO Asia and HBO Central Europe. And it's the leading pay-TV provider in each of these markets. We plan to extend this lead as we rollout new features like On Demand. Altogether, we expect our International Cable Networks business and related content sales to generate more than $400 million of adjusted OIBDA in 2010. And they're set to grow even faster than our domestic networks. In TV, as in film and magazines, we're leading the charge to digital business models that enhance the value of our content both for us and for consumers. In 2010, both Turner and HBO will continue to pioneer the industry-wide TV Everywhere initiative, which is basically TV on demand and on broadband. Turner will be in trials or commercial launch with every major distributor this year, cable, satellite and telco. And you'll soon hear more about HBO's rollout of it's streaming service, HBO Go, which will offer three times the content of what's on HBO On Demand today.Now let's move over to our studio. Warner Bros. performed phenomenally last year too, shattering records everywhere it turned. It broke the all-time global box office record with more than $4 billion in sales. Seven films crossed the $100 million mark domestic box-office in 2009, that's also a record, including the latest in the Harry Potter franchise, Sherlock Holmes, The Blind Side and The Hangover. The Hangover was the best selling R-rated comedy ever at the box office and on home video. Even with declines in the Home Video category industry-wide, this performance helped power Warner Bros. to it's most profitable year ever, roughly $1.5 billion in adjusted OIBDA. And even after a record 2009 slate, we are very optimistic about this year's film slate. 10 fall releases include the seventh Harry Potter; Sex and the City 2; Inception, a film from Christopher Nolan, who directed The Dark Knight; Due Date from Todd Phillips, who gave us the Hangover; Clash of the Titans and Guardians of Ga'Hoole, which is a 3D CGI film based on the popular young adult book series. In the next few months, you'll also hear more about our plans to mine more aggressively the deep catalog of DC comics characters across Warner Bros. theatrical, home video, TV and games divisions, and across our other divisions as well.Turning to the Television Production business, very important business. As you may know, in most years, Warner TV Production contributes as much as half the profits in our filmed entertainment division. This year, Warner will continue to develop and foster the relationships with A-list writers and directors that's made us the number one provider of broadcast TV programming for 18 of the past 23 years. And that's enabled us produce hits like Two and A Half Men and Big Bang Theory, which are the two top comedies on TV right now. We see encouraging secular dynamics this year and over the next several years, with recent signs that broadcasters may be able to secure our cash carriage fees, and NBC's recent decision to resume broadcasting scripted programming at 10 p.m., and the robust marketplace for both original and off-network programming on cable. Demand for high-quality scripted programming seems to be going up, and that is right in Warner TV's sweet spot. Last year, we parlayed our leading position at the box office and on TV into the number one share in the Home Video business for the ninth consecutive year. That included Warner's being number one in every category, standard definition, Blu-Ray high def, VOD and electronic sell-through. In 2010, we'll continue to lead the transition of the Home Video business to digital, which carries higher gross profits for us than physical DVDs. We're also actively working with distributors to make sure that we can offer consumers convenience and a compelling value proposition, while ensuring that we're appropriately compensated for our intellectual property. Overall, due to the strength in our film slate, our expectations for another strong year in TV production and our progress in the Home Video business, we believe that Warner Bros. is set to deliver another year of very strong profits coming up in 2010.On the Time Inc., we recently announced that we and several other publishers have formed a consortium to develop common technology standards for reading print content on tablets and on other e-Reader devices. We view these devices as a key way to transition the dual revenue stream Print business model to digital. And as these readers grow in popularity, they are proving that consumers will pay for quality content, and these readers enhance the kind of content that we can deliver. And as they improve functionality, they hold increasing promise as an advertising medium. Just as in our TV and Film business, we intend to lead the way in determining how Digital business models will evolve here to. Operationally, timing faced a pretty challenging advertising climate last year, but there were clean signs of improvement in the fourth quarter. And testifying to the strength of Time's content and brands, in 2009, Time Inc. grew it's share of advertising and grew it's share of readership. This year, Time Inc. will continue to reduce it's cost structure. The restructuring that we undertook in the fourth quarter should generate about $100 million in savings on a run-rate basis in 2010 and years after. And at the same time that we're building that in, Time Inc. will continue to distance itself from it's competitors by investing in it's biggest brands and in high-quality editorial content. Now John, in a minute, will talk more to you about our financial performance in 2009, and our plans for 2010 and our balance sheet. But before I handed it off to John, I'd like to touch on how we're approaching our capital management this year.Philosophically, I think one of our most important jobs is to actively manage our capital, to enhance the organic returns of our businesses and maintain a strong balance sheet, as we go along. In line with this goal, our board has increased our dividend, and authorized the increase in the remaining stock repurchase authorization to $3 billion. As a result, we now provide, by far, the highest dividend payout ratio and the highest yield of any of our peers in media, and we're on pace to return even more capital in 2010 than we did last year. These steps reflect our confidence, confidence in the future of high-quality content over the long term, confidence in our strategic and competitive position and confidence that we can deliver steady, superior returns to stockholders year-by-year and over the long term. We think that the more you know about today's Time Warner, the more you'll share this confidence. And we're looking forward to talking more with you about this in detail across each of our businesses at our Investor Day that we've scheduled in late May. We'll be sending out details soon. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John."

And let me begin by saying that there are slides that are now available on our website to help you follow along with my comments. And beginning on the first slide, you'll see some brief highlights and observations, some of which Jeff has made already. Despite the difficult environment, we had a number of important financial achievements in 2009, and we did accomplish all of our objectives. First, we delivered strong financial performance. Next, we completed the spins of both Time Warner Cable and AOL. And further, we maintained a very strong balance sheet, while both investing fully in our businesses and increasing direct returns to shareholders. Our fourth quarter results allowed us to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.83 for the year, and that compares to our full-year adjusted EPS outlook of at least $1.75. This EPS figure was also a significant improvement over 2008. We also continued to generate significant levels of free cash flow, with a very high full-year conversion ratio of 15% of adjusted OIBDA. And this enabled us to return $2.1 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and that represented over 70% of our free cash. And as Jeff mentioned, our board authorized both an increase in the annual dividend to $0.85 a share, and an increase in our remaining share repurchase program to about $3 billion. And as we look ahead, we are very, very encouraged by both improving macroeconomic trends and the strong competitive positions of our businesses. And we intend to maintain their leadership position by further improving our operating efficiency and by allocating resources towards areas of higher growth and better returns. This year, we'll use our balance sheet strength to fund even more investment in our businesses, we'll improve our capital efficiency and we're on course to return even capital directly to shareholders. This is all reflected in this morning's outlook.This next slide shows our consolidated fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Fourth quarter revenues increased 2%, as higher content and subscription revenues more than offset an 8% decline in advertising revenues. And while advertising was down for the quarter, this did represent a sequential improvement from the 10% drop in the third quarter of 2009 and it did represent the smallest decline that we saw for the entire year. It's also the first quarter of overall revenue growth this since the second quarter of 2008, so we're quite pleased with that.Adjusted OIBDA was up very nicely in the fourth quarter, and our film studio was a big driver of the growth. Now you do see some pretty large year-over-year profit growth variances in our fourth quarter reported results. Please remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we incurred an approximately $270 million legal charge related to the sale of our winter sports teams. Over the course of the past year, we talked to you also about the impact that we've experienced from higher pension expense, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the impact that those have had on our results. For the full year, pension and FX taken together were an almost 600 basis point drag on our adjusted OIBDA growth.Operating expenses, which include cost to revenues and SG&A, fell by an approximately $1 billion last year for the full year. Margins climbed more than 200 basis points, and were higher at three out of our four operating divisions. This reflects our continued cost efforts across the entire company. Full-year adjusted EPS was up almost 30% over the year-ago results. And now, let me turn to our segment highlights. And we're going to begin with a discussion at our networks.We did have another very strong year at both HBO and Turner, and they each recorded their highest annual profits ever. The Network segment represented nearly 60% of the company's profits in the quarter and almost 70% of the profits for the full year. Adjusted OIBDA grew 29% in the quarter and 15% for the year. And keep in mind these comparisons reflect the legal charge from a year ago that I just mentioned. And in this year, they also reflect the $100 million programming write-down to Turner, and the consolidation of HBO Latin America. Now let me briefly expand on the programming write-down for a moment. This was a management decision to take one show off the programming schedule. And while programming decisions like this are an ongoing way of doing business here, we don't anticipate incurring any more write-downs of anything close to this size for the foreseeable future. As expected, advertising revenue decline modestly in the quarter at the networks, they were down 4%. And although the scatter market was very strong for us, the decline resulted from difficult comparisons at our news division, and that's against last year's U.S. presidential election, as well as the impact of lower CPMs in the 2009/2010 upfront, and to a lesser extent, lower ratings at the domestic entertainment networks. Looking at the first quarter, scatter pricing is very much above upfront levels. We expect advertising revenues at the networks to be up in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, and that's despite continued tough comparisons at CNN against the inauguration in last year.Subscription revenue growth of 11% in the quarter and 10% for the full year reflected the consolidation of HBO Latin America, and rate increases at both Turner and HBO. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO finished the year with it's highest year-end domestic subscriber base ever. The decline in content revenue the quarter was due to lower video and syndication revenue at HBO's original programming, including Sex and the City and the Sopranos. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic that HBO's slate of original programming will lead the growth in content revenue, and that's going to begin this year. Before I move on, I do want to note, as Jeff said, that we did recently agree to acquire the majority stake in NDTV Imagine, it's one of the leading general entertainment networks in India. India is a country where we see significant opportunity in the coming years. And as Jeff described, NDTV should help our competitive position there significantly. For 2010 however, NDTV is expected to be a drag on our OIBDA profits of about $40 million. Not withstanding that, or despite this, we anticipate our international cable networks will be a driver of growth in 2010, as we anticipate ad markets to improve.Moving over to film, Warner Brothers had an absolutely amazing year, setting a record for full-year profits. This was the seventh straight quarter of adjusted OIBDA growth at our other filmed entertainment division. Adjusted OIBDA rose 41% in the fourth quarter, driven by the successful home video releases of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Hangover, and the strong theatrical performances of The Blind Side and Sherlock Holmes. Our Games business within that division was also a contributor to growth in the quarter, and we expect to continue in the coming years. Games now generates for us over $500 million annually in revenue, and it has healthy margins. Thanks to our continued efforts to streamline costs, margins climbed over 200 basis points for the year. And heading into this year, we no doubt have difficult comparisons in this division against the very strong performance last year, just to point out a couple of things. One item affecting our 2010 comparisons would be the impact of our decision to self distribute New Line films overseas instead of pre-selling the rights, which is what New Line used to do. This should enable us to realize increased profits overtime. But for timing and accounting reasons, it's going to result in a drag of more than $100 million on our OIBDA this year. In addition, 2009's results included approximately $75 million of combined benefits related to a true up, or participation expense in the resolution of an international tax matter, and we wouldn't anticipate similar benefits to recur in 2010. Now having said all that, and despite this, let me reiterate what Jeff said, which is that we do expect Warner Bros. to once again deliver very, very strong profit levels again in 2010, and here's why. First, we're optimistic about the strength and the quality of the film slate this year. Second, while we expect sales of standard definition DVDs to remain somewhat challenged, we expect continued growth of higher-margin Blu-Ray, VOD and electronic sell-through to help offset this pressure, and we'll be releasing a greater number of titles into home video this year. And lastly, we expect our TV business have another very, very strong year in 2010, helped by a growing TV syndication pipeline. We really didn't have any significant new availabilities of syndicated programming last year in 2009, but we will have several in 2010, including Two and a Half Men on cable, New Adventures of Old Christine, The Closer and Supernatural. And we'll also continue to take a hard line on costs in this division.Looking at our Publishing division on the next slide, Time Inc.'s fourth quarter was affected by the tough ad environment, with advertising down 12% in the quarter. This did represent however a significant sequential improvement rather in year-over-year trends. Domestic advertising revenues were down 9%, and most of this decline was due to the fewer ad pages, with ad rates down only in the low single digits. As you know, Time Inc.'s domestic magazines are operated in three units. And just wanted to note that the style and entertainment unit was our strongest performer in the fourth quarter, with revenue growth that People Magazine helping keep ad revenue for the group essentially flat. Most of the advertising softness in the quarter was concentrated in our News segment. Looking ahead to the first quarter, print advertising trends have improved, and that's relative to the fourth quarter and it's being largely driven by higher volumes. Our style and entertainment group remains our strongest performer, and is tracking up solidly for the quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in subscription trends in the fourth quarter, and that was primarily in newsstand. Although subscription renewal rates improved in the last few quarters, our year-over-year growth rates are still being affected by the lower renewals at the height of the credit the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted OIBDA at our publishing unit increased 27% in the quarter, as lower revenues and higher pension costs were more than offset by cost-saving initiatives and lower restructuring charges. On the cost side of the equation, we expect, as Jeff mentioned, that the restructurings that we took last year should generate about $100 million of cost savings this year.Turning next to our 2010 outlook on the next slide, overall, we expect to return to revenue growth in 2010 due to an improved ad environment, steady and healthy subscription revenue trends and a promising content slate. We will increase investments in programming and production that will drive our growth this year and over the long term. To help fund these increased investments in these businesses, we'll remain focused on containing overhead expenses and that should definitely benefit operating margins. This is all reflected in the outlook we released this morning. And as you saw on the release, we expect full year adjusted OIBDA to increase in the mid-teens over the base of $1.83. For modeling purposes, let me just add that we do expect our book tax rate to move back up to closer to the 38% range. And it's also worth noting that beginning in the first quarter of this year, our intention is to shift away from adjusted OIBDA as being the primary key profit measure for the company and we'll be focusing more and more on adjusted operating income. We believe that adjusted operating income will be a more meaningful metric for the company going forward. And it's also consistent with our increased focus on return on invested capital. And it mirrors the shift that we've been making and we've made internally for purposes of measuring our own performance.Turning next to the next slide, we delivered nearly $3 billion in free cash last year, and our conversion ratio was 50%. This is lower than the year-ago period. We did expect that. And that's as a result of higher cash taxes and fluctuations in working capital, offset by lower net cash interest; or cash taxes increased due to higher taxable income and the runoff of tax attributes that benefited us in the past. Recall that our working capital benefited in 2008 from lower TV and film production spending, and that was due in part to the writers' strike that was going on at the time. Our reduced cash interest is due principally to lower debt levels in 2009. And I'd ask you to move to the last slide, which just shows a roll forward of our net debt balances. We ended the year with a little over $10.5 billion in net debt. That's about half the level that we had at the beginning of 2008. And it was, more or less, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, our free cash flow generation was offset by continuing returns to shareholders through our regular dividend and ongoing share repurchases. We ended the year with about $4.8 billion in cash on hand. That's a significant reduction from the $7 billion that we had as of the end of September. And the reduction was principally due to the retirement of a $2 billion debt maturity in November, as well as our continued dividend and share buyback programs. In 2009, we significantly enhanced our balance sheet strength, and that allowed us to meet three key objectives. First, we increased investments in programming production in CapEx by more than 15%.  Second, we more than doubled the returns to shareholders. And third, we maintained strategic flexibility. As we look ahead, our philosophy on balance sheet management has not changed and will not change, but our objectives will evolve somewhat. In 2010, we intend to invest even more in our businesses to bolster their competitive position and drive long-term growth. At the same time, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet through further reduction of cash balances and by carefully managing our debt maturities. And we're making a greater commitment to provide direct returns to stockholders. This is evident in the board's decision to raise the dividend and increase the share repurchase program. We also believe it's important to maintain strategic flexibility. And now that we have completed the AOL separation, our leverage ratio is about 2x, and that's closer to our long-term target of about 2.5x. We plan to maintain this long-term leverage target at the 2.5x level, as we believe a strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage. So that concludes my remarks. Thanks for listening, and I will turn it over to Doug. We'll start the Q&A portion."

The outlook for affiliate position at both HBO and Turner is pretty strong and has been strong. And I think you have to look at comparisons in any year-to-year basis; depends on where somebody starts at. And if they have lower base rates, they're in a bit of a different situation. We basically have the strongest suite of networks across HBO and Turner in the television world and majority of our revenue under both HBO and Turner is under multi-year contracts built in escalators [ph]. Our strategy, as we've been discussing, has been to invest heavily to make the networks compelling value propositions. I think that's equally true of HBO as Turner. Turner with the strength in programming and its reach across CNN Headline, truTV, Cartoon Network, TNT and TBS, is in a very good position to capture the economic upside, let's say, as all those networks become more important and the reach and the success of their programming continues to be successful. So we're very confident about our rate moves going forward, including in relation to competition. And we do think that the moves towards TV Everywhere will simply support the growth in affiliate fee revenue as well."

We did experience nice margin improvements this year. And notwithstanding the fact that we anticipate increasing our investment programming, which we think is critically important, the order of magnitude of that increase is not going to be overwhelmingly significant. And we're going to continue to try to reallocate funds from SG&A or overhead to be able to fund the programming investments. And while we don't have a crystal ball exactly to what the advertising environment is going to do, because that obviously will ultimately affect margins, we would anticipate that the trends that we've been seeing in the business, which has been margin increases, should continue."

So basically, as you look at -- and you can do history or the current future at HBO. Everytime you put in an enhancement, multiplex then VOD [video on demand], then high-def and now HBO Go on broadband, you strengthen the consumer satisfaction usage in demand for HBO and you support the ability of the entire distribution structure to appropriately capture that; whether they do it in across the base pricing, or whether they do it in some other form of price capture. So from a consumer point of view, we think it's important and has increased the strength and position of HBO that consumers get all these enhancements without discrete charges for certain aspects of HBO. What that then translates to is very strong pricing power for HBO at the affiliate level. And if you look right now, this year or last year, '09, 2010, it will be the same, very strong sub-growth in pricing and marketing growth of HBO through telcos who understand the power of what premium can do. And I think cable operators are going to refocus there efforts on premium TV categories and putting out these enhancements in order to remain competitive. So what it all translates to is very strong across-the-board revenue growth for HBO, both subscriber growth and pricing growth at wholesale. What you then do is take the platform that provides to create an ever-larger budget for regional programming, which you see in HBO's current slate, and it turns it into a successful -- it will be The Pacific, Boardwalk Empire, Hung, True Blood, et cetera, which will then resume a long-term growth in content revenue. So the overall architecture is a fairly powerful one."

But having said that, I'm happy to share with you some observations of expectations. The first is, and this is probably the most difficult thing for us to forecast, the specifics on working capital, because it can vary quite a bit. We do have a long history, I think, of managing working capital very tightly and efficiently. And we don't see anything in this year that would make us assume that anything is going to change. And, in fact, I would anticipate that the free cash flow that is being generated from our divisions is very likely going to go up, even year-over-year. And what's embedded in that also, you asked specifically about CapEx, we don't have a very capital-intensive company. CapEx represents only a very, very small percentage of our overall revenue. And having said that, our goal is going to be to keep that CapEx as flat as possible this year as we've done in the past. The one area where we do anticipate cash usage to go up is cash taxes, where we're not anticipating that we're going to get as much benefit from tax planning and certain state tax law changes that we got this year. So that number could be up. And overall, like I said, we're not giving guidance -- I don't think the numbers' going to be materially different from where we were this year."

Generally, I'm very happy with where we are competitively on all three of those. The question on ratings, let's get into, because they're not the only thing but, of course, they're important. They're a bit of a blunt measurement, and the number of things besides ratings that play into ad revenue and competitive position and affiliate revenue: Mix of programming, how much original versus acquired in any given month or quarter; the mix of scatter versus upfront sales that work their way into the numbers; the level of guarantees on advertising sellout levels that vary depending how we're looking at economic trends, as we saw a lot of variability this year; sponsorships and integrated ad buys online and what part that plays, which changes quarter-to-quarter, depending what the programming is. And then you go through the different categories. Let's take news. We had a huge year in '08. Not as good in prime time in '09, but some pretty good numbers in other parts of the schedules and a great performance in news online. So when you to take that and put it to money ad sales and pricing, with clients it's pretty good and profits were very good. So, of course, you'd rather take all those things and add to those benefits even higher ratings, and we will work on doing that. But there is a bit of a difference in what CNN tries to do as a news service on all of its platforms, 24 hours a day, versus what some of our ""cable news competitors"" try to do. At the end of the day, we're interested, of course, in having a strong branch in the long term and having it produce earnings more than ratings. If you go to entertainment, basically very strong success, as I tried to described in my upfront remarks on originals. Originals are a pretty important part of the branding and the future of all these networks, as they move beyond the TV, when you're dialing to VOD, and international on TV Everywhere and so forth. So that kind of success with key shows and franchises at TNT and TBS, and even at Adult Swim and truTV, is very positive for the long run and shows that the management is focused on the right thing. One of the important drivers, I think at least to these questions, is acquired programming. It's a big part of big-reach cable network economics. And so in a period like we had this fall, where some of our acquired programming didn't work so well, that -- and you make a lot of money on acquired programming. So when that's not totally hitting, then you need to move the line up a little, which we are doing. I don't think it's significant. I'm not complacent about it. But we think we know how to fix it. In the case of TBS, which had two series that didn't work as well as we thought, it'll take a little longer to rotate out. But I don't think it's a ""structural problem"" for the success at the Turner Network."

Basically, on VOD, which is the highest yield in terms of margin of the conversions, when you go off of sale DVD -- so it's better than Netflix and Redbox. We essentially released all of our titles day and date on VOD in the United States in 2009. It certainly was the reason that we ranked number one in VOD, but it didn't hurt us in terms of ranking number one in physical DVD sale, rental, basically every category. So we think that we're hopefully providing an example of what can work in putting out rational windows. We want to make our titles available to consumers in the highest quality, earliest windows, most conveniently to them; whether they buy them or rent or them on every meetings. They buy it physical, they rent them electronically and so forth. And what we're doing is basically setting up all the appropriate ways to do that, taking the lowest margin approaches that would be something like very low-priced rental, and putting it in window terms after the higher margin ones. Because of the litigation with Redbox, I can't really talk too much about what we are discussing with them. But as with all emerging platforms, whether it's TV, film or publishing, we want to provide consumers with the best choices. And we want to do it in a way that gives us fair economics. I think it's pretty clear as an example that the deal that Warner struck with Netflix, which puts them into a win-win position and which also, however, allows the early window for higher margin distributors, is a pretty good example of how this works when it's working the right way. If you go to your question on DC, we're going to have a fairly interesting set of announcements and presentations pretty soon, like in a manner of weeks, I think, about our plans for DC. And basically, if you look across the whole bin of hits, whether it's Batman, The Dark Knight, Green Lantern coming up, Superman, there been a huge number of franchise films that have been part of the Warner ten-pole strategy that's been the reason for Warner's unparalleled high and consistent earnings advantage over the other studios. And DC is already been a part of that, and we are now going to outline an even more expansive plan for that in the coming months."

So as a result, Time Warner is better positioned today than ever. We've got strong operational and financial momentum, and there's increasing evidence that industry trends are going our way. And now, I think we're structured to run our businesses more aggressively than ever. We delivered very strong adjusted earnings per share growth last year, despite the worst recession in most of our lives. Our Networks and Film businesses posted record profits, driven largely by the strength of our content. And that performance underscores two things that we have discussed before. Demand is growing for the kind of high quality content that we make, as consumers enjoy more choices. It also shows how our unique combination of scale, brands and talent enables us to institutionalize success in hit-driven businesses. In 2009, we approved the efficiency and productivity of our businesses. By reallocating resources, we substantially raised our investment in her programming and production. And that's critical to drive our revenue and extend our competitive position. And we still increase margins by significantly reducing overhead expense. While we were doing that, we strengthened our balance sheet last year as well, while doubling our return of capital to shareholders. Free cash flow totaled almost $3 billion. And we returned over $2 billion of that, or more than 70%, to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also spun off Time Warner Cable and AOL, and that allowed us to focus all our energy and resources on what we do best, making and distributing the most compelling branded content on traditional and emerging platforms, and monetizing it better than anyone else. In 2010 and beyond, we'll build on this foundation. As you saw in this morning's outlook release, we expect to grow our Adjusted EPS mid-teens in 2010. We'll do that by executing even more aggressively on the four operational priorities that I've discussed with you before. The first is leveraging our scale and brands to create the highest quality content and monetize it better than anyone else. Second, make our operations more efficient by allocating resources to the best and most productive use. Third, we're going to keep expanding internationally. And fourth, we're developing new business models that capitalize on changes in consumer usage and technology, while at the same time ensuring when possible that they're additive and not cannibalistic. We're going to talk more about that. In practice, this means that we will again spend more on programming and production in 2010. We'll invest more in new digital initiatives and extend our brands internationally. And we'll do that while keeping our overall expenses relatively flat. And I'd like to expand on what that means in each of our four divisions.So I'll start with Turner. We made considerable investments in original programming last year to make sure that our networks become even more attractive for our viewers, our advertisers and our affiliates. We have a lot of successes. Last year, TNT original dramas grew ratings in the same time slots by over 50% over the prior year. And three of it's new original series ranked in cable's top five. Just to pick one of them, TBS debuted the Lopez Tonight Show to double-digit gains in it's time slot. And in it's first few weeks, it outdelivered most other late-night talk shows in valuable 18 to 30 demo. However, not every new original or acquired series worked or connected with viewers as much as we would have liked. We're making changes where necessary, and I remain confident, as we have been, that we'll attract growing audience over the long term. In 2010, just to give you a view of that, we'll bring back hit shows like The Closer and Leverage to TNT, while developing new original dramas such as the new series from Steven Spielberg and George Clooney. We'll also expand our original programming lineup on TBS. I'd like to point out that we expect our entertainment networks to grow ad revenue for the year, even without a major rebound in ratings trends, which we will be working on to do as well. At CNN, we invest tremendous resources on news gathering to deliver the most comprehensive, non-partisan news and analysis in the industry, and do it across all platforms. If you've watched CNN during the tragedy in Haiti, you know that the depth and breadth of our coverage is unparalleled. CNN's ratings vary depending on the news environment. We typically outperform our peers significantly during major news events, as more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. And we have lower ratings when the news cycle is slow. But CNN's position as the premium, biggest reach, multi-platform brand in the news business enables us to consistently command premium pricing from advertisers. In fact, despite ratings declines, this last year compared to the record performance in the 2008 election year, CNN again grew it's profits by double digits in 2009. This year, we expect another year of strong profit growth at CNN.HBO. The performance at HBO last year illustrates that it's value proposition has never been better. It aired four of the six highest-rated shows in it's entire history, and it grew it's subscriber base for the year despite the recession. This year, HBO is bringing back the next season of our highest-rated shows, including True Blood, Entourage, Hung and Big Love. We'll debut The Pacific, the highly anticipated miniseries from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. That's the companion to Band of Brothers. And we'll premiere Martin Scorsese's Boardwalk Empire, with it poised to HBO's next breakout hit show. Both Turner and HBO will keep expanding internationally this year too. Turner's International business currently operates more than 100 feeds across 200 countries. We'll expand organically by launching new feeds in new markets and adding new distributors. We'll also make acquisitions where it makes sense. For example, we recently agreed to acquire NDTV Imagine, which is a general entertainment network in India, that will significantly increase our presence and scale in that region. HBO has over 33 million subscribers internationally, that at HBO Latin America, HBO Asia and HBO Central Europe. And it's the leading pay-TV provider in each of these markets. We plan to extend this lead as we rollout new features like On Demand. Altogether, we expect our International Cable Networks business and related content sales to generate more than $400 million of adjusted OIBDA in 2010. And they're set to grow even faster than our domestic networks. In TV, as in film and magazines, we're leading the charge to digital business models that enhance the value of our content both for us and for consumers. In 2010, both Turner and HBO will continue to pioneer the industry-wide TV Everywhere initiative, which is basically TV on demand and on broadband. Turner will be in trials or commercial launch with every major distributor this year, cable, satellite and telco. And you'll soon hear more about HBO's rollout of it's streaming service, HBO Go, which will offer three times the content of what's on HBO On Demand today.Now let's move over to our studio. Warner Bros. performed phenomenally last year too, shattering records everywhere it turned. It broke the all-time global box office record with more than $4 billion in sales. Seven films crossed the $100 million mark domestic box-office in 2009, that's also a record, including the latest in the Harry Potter franchise, Sherlock Holmes, The Blind Side and The Hangover. The Hangover was the best selling R-rated comedy ever at the box office and on home video. Even with declines in the Home Video category industry-wide, this performance helped power Warner Bros. to it's most profitable year ever, roughly $1.5 billion in adjusted OIBDA. And even after a record 2009 slate, we are very optimistic about this year's film slate. 10 fall releases include the seventh Harry Potter; Sex and the City 2; Inception, a film from Christopher Nolan, who directed The Dark Knight; Due Date from Todd Phillips, who gave us the Hangover; Clash of the Titans and Guardians of Ga'Hoole, which is a 3D CGI film based on the popular young adult book series. In the next few months, you'll also hear more about our plans to mine more aggressively the deep catalog of DC comics characters across Warner Bros. theatrical, home video, TV and games divisions, and across our other divisions as well.Turning to the Television Production business, very important business. As you may know, in most years, Warner TV Production contributes as much as half the profits in our filmed entertainment division. This year, Warner will continue to develop and foster the relationships with A-list writers and directors that's made us the number one provider of broadcast TV programming for 18 of the past 23 years. And that's enabled us to produce hits like Two and A Half Men and Big Bang Theory, which are the two top comedies on TV right now. We see encouraging secular dynamics this year, and over the next several years, with recent signs that broadcasters may be able to secure cash carriage fees, and NBC's recent decision to resume broadcasting scripted programming at 10 p.m., and the robust marketplace for both original and off-network programming on cable. Demand for high-quality scripted programming seems to be going up, and that is right in Warner TV's sweet spot. Last year, we parlayed our leading position at the box office and on TV into the number one share in the Home Video business for the ninth consecutive year. That included Warner's being number one in every category, standard definition, Blu-Ray high def, VOD and electronic sell-through. In 2010, we'll continue to lead the transition of the Home Video business to digital, which carries higher gross profits for us than physical DVDs. We're also actively working with distributors to make sure that we can offer consumers convenience, and a compelling value proposition, while ensuring that we're appropriately compensated for our intellectual property. Overall, due to the strength in our film slate, our expectations for another strong year in TV production and our progress in the Home Video business, we believe that Warner Bros. is set to deliver another year of very strong profits coming up in 2010.On to Time Inc., we recently announced that we, and several other publishers have formed a consortium to develop common technology standards for reading print content on tablets and on other e-Reader devices. We view these devices as a key way to transition the dual revenue stream print business model to digital. And as these readers grow in popularity, they are proving that consumers will pay for quality content, and these readers enhance the kind of content that we can deliver. And as they improve functionality, they hold increasing promise as an advertising medium. Just as in our TV and Film business, we intend to lead the way in determining how digital business models evolve here to. Operationally, Time Inc. faced a pretty challenging advertising climate last year, but there were clean signs of improvement in the fourth quarter. And testifying to the strength of Time's content and brands, in 2009, Time Inc. grew its share of advertising, and grew its share of readership. This year, Time Inc. will continue to reduce its cost structure. The restructuring that we undertook in the fourth quarter should generate about $100 million in savings on a run-rate basis in 2010 and years after. And at the same time that we're building that in, Time Inc. will continue to distance itself from its competitors by investing in its biggest brands, and in high-quality editorial content. Now John, in a minute, will talk more to you about our financial performance in 2009, and our plans for 2010 and our balance sheet. But before I hand it off to John, I'd like to touch on how we're approaching our capital management this year.Philosophically, I think one of our most important jobs is to actively manage our capital, to enhance the organic returns of our businesses and maintain a strong balance sheet, as we go along. In line with this goal, our board has increased our dividend, and authorized an increase in our remaining stock repurchase authorization to $3 billion. As a result, we now provide, by far, the highest dividend payout ratio and the highest yield of any of our peers in media, and we're on pace to return even more capital in 2010 than we did last year. These steps reflect our confidence, confidence in the future of high-quality content over the long term, confidence in our strategic and competitive position and confidence that we can deliver steady, superior returns to stockholders year-by-year and over the long term. We think that the more you know about today's Time Warner, the more you'll share this confidence. And we're looking forward to talking more with you about this in detail across each of our businesses at our Investor Day that we've scheduled in late May. We'll be sending out details soon. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John."

And let me begin by saying that there are slides that are now available on our website to help you follow along with my comments. And beginning on the first slide, you'll see some brief highlights and observations, some of which Jeff has made already. Despite the difficult environment, we had a number of important financial achievements in 2009, and we did accomplish all of our objectives. First, we delivered strong financial performance. Next, we completed the spins of both Time Warner Cable and AOL. And further, we maintained a very strong balance sheet, while both investing fully in our businesses and increasing direct returns to shareholders. Our fourth quarter results allowed us to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.83 for the year, and that compares to our full-year adjusted EPS outlook of at least $1.75. This EPS figure was also a significant improvement over 2008. We also continued to generate significant levels of free cash flow, with a very high full-year conversion ratio of 15% of adjusted OIBDA. And this enabled us to return $2.1 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and that represented over 70% of our free cash. And as Jeff mentioned, our board authorized both an increase in the annual dividend to $0.85 a share, and an increase in our remaining share repurchase program to about $3 billion. And as we look ahead, we are very, very encouraged by both improving macroeconomic trends and the strong competitive positions of our businesses. And we intend to maintain their leadership position by further improving our operating efficiency and by allocating resources towards areas of higher growth and better returns. This year, we'll use our balance sheet strength to fund even more investment in our businesses, we'll improve our capital efficiency and we're on course to return even capital directly to shareholders. This is all reflected in this morning's outlook.This next slide shows our consolidated fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Fourth quarter revenues increased 2%, as higher content and subscription revenues more than offset an 8% decline in advertising revenues. And while advertising was down for the quarter, this did represent a sequential improvement from the 10% drop in the third quarter of 2009 and it did represent the smallest decline that we saw for the entire year. It's also the first quarter of overall revenue growth this since the second quarter of 2008, so we're quite pleased with that.Adjusted OIBDA was up very nicely in the fourth quarter, and our film studio was a big driver of the growth. Now you do see some pretty large year-over-year profit growth variances in our fourth quarter reported results. Please remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we incurred an approximately $270 million legal charge related to the sale of our winter sports teams. Over the course of the past year, we talked to you also about the impact that we've experienced from higher pension expense, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the impact that those have had on our results. For the full year, pension and FX taken together were an almost 600 basis point drag on our adjusted OIBDA growth.Operating expenses, which include cost to revenues and SG&A, fell by an approximately $1 billion last year for the full year. Margins climbed more than 200 basis points, and were higher at three out of our four operating divisions. This reflects our continued cost efforts across the entire company. Full year adjusted EPS was up almost 30% over the year-ago results. And now, let me turn to our segment highlights. And we're going to begin with a discussion at our networks.We did have another very strong year at both HBO and Turner, and they each recorded their highest annual profits ever. The Network segment represented nearly 60% of the company's profits in the quarter and almost 70% of the profits for the full year. Adjusted OIBDA grew 29% in the quarter and 15% for the year. And keep in mind these comparisons reflect the legal charge from a year ago that I just mentioned. And in this year, they also reflect the $100 million programming write-down to Turner, and the consolidation of HBO Latin America. Now let me briefly expand on the programming write-down for a moment. This was a management decision to take one show off the programming schedule. And while programming decisions like this are an ongoing way of doing business here, we don't anticipate incurring any more write-downs of anything close to this size for the foreseeable future. As expected, advertising revenue decline modestly in the quarter at the networks, they were down 4%. And although the scatter market was very strong for us, the decline resulted from difficult comparisons at our news division, and that's against last year's U.S. presidential election, as well as the impact of lower CPMs in the 2009/2010 upfront, and to a lesser extent, lower ratings at the domestic entertainment networks. Looking at the first quarter, scatter pricing is very much above upfront levels. We expect advertising revenues at the networks to be up in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, and that's despite continued tough comparisons at CNN against the inauguration in last year.Subscription revenue growth of 11% in the quarter and 10% for the full year reflected the consolidation of HBO Latin America, and rate increases at both Turner and HBO. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO finished the year with it's highest year-end domestic subscriber base ever. The decline in content revenue the quarter was due to lower video and syndication revenue at HBO's original programming, including Sex and the City and the Sopranos. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic that HBO's slate of original programming will lead the growth in content revenue, and that's going to begin this year. Before I move on, I do want to note, as Jeff said, that we did recently agree to acquire the majority stake in NDTV Imagine, it's one of the leading general entertainment networks in India. India is a country where we see significant opportunity in the coming years. And as Jeff described, NDTV should help our competitive position there significantly. For 2010, however, NDTV is expected to be a drag on OIBDA profits of about $40 million. Notwithstanding that, or despite this, we anticipate our international cable networks will be a driver of growth in 2010, as we anticipate ad markets to improve.Moving over to film, Warner Brothers had an absolutely amazing year, setting a record for full-year profits. This was the seventh straight quarter of adjusted OIBDA growth at our filmed entertainment division. Adjusted OIBDA rose 41% in the fourth quarter, driven by the successful home video releases of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Hangover, and the strong theatrical performances of The Blind Side and Sherlock Holmes. Our Games business within that division was also a contributor to growth in the quarter, and we expect it to continue in the coming years. Games now generates for us over $500 million annually in revenue, and it has healthy margins. Thanks to our continued efforts to streamline costs, margins climbed over 200 basis points for the year. And heading into this year, we no doubt have difficult comparisons in this division against a very strong performance last year, just to point out a couple of things. One item affecting our 2010 comparisons would be the impact of our decision to self distribute New Line films overseas instead of pre-selling the rights, which is what New Line used to do. This should enable us to realize increased profits over time. But for timing and accounting reasons, it's going to result in a drag of more than $100 million on OIBDA this year. In addition, 2009's results included approximately $75 million of combined benefits related to a true up, or participation expense in the resolution of an international tax matter, and we wouldn't anticipate similar benefits to recur in 2010. Now having said all that, and despite this, let me reiterate what Jeff said, which is that we do expect Warner Bros. to once again deliver very, very strong profit levels again in 2010, and here's why. First, we're optimistic about the strength and the quality of the film slate this year. Second, while we expect sales of standard definition DVDs to remain somewhat challenged, we expect continued growth of higher-margin Blu-Ray, VOD and electronic sell-through to help offset this pressure, and we'll be releasing a greater number of titles into home video this year. And lastly, we expect our TV business to have another very, very strong year in 2010, helped by a growing TV syndication pipeline. We really didn't have any significant new availabilities of syndicated programming last year in 2009, but we will have several in 2010, including Two and a Half Men on cable, New Adventures of Old Christine, The Closer and Supernatural. And we'll also continue to take a hard line on costs in this division.Looking at our Publishing division on the next slide, Time Inc.'s fourth quarter was affected by the tough ad environment, with advertising down 12% in the quarter. This did represent, however, a significant sequential improvement rather in year-over-year trends. Domestic advertising revenues were down 9%, and most of this decline was due to fewer ad pages, with ad rates down only in the low single digits. As you know, Time Inc.'s domestic magazines are operated in three units. And just wanted to note that the style and entertainment unit was our strongest performer in the fourth quarter, with revenue growth that People Magazine helping keep ad revenue for the group essentially flat. Most of the advertising softness in the quarter was concentrated in our News segment. Looking ahead to the first quarter, print advertising trends have improved, and that's relative to the fourth quarter and it's being largely driven by higher volumes. Our style and entertainment group remains our strongest performer, and is tracking up solidly for the quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in subscription trends in the fourth quarter, and that was primarily at newsstand. Although subscription renewal rates improved in the last few quarters, our year-over-year growth rates are still being affected by the lower renewals at the height of the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted OIBDA at our publishing unit increased 27% in the quarter, as lower revenues and higher pension costs were more than offset by cost-saving initiatives and lower restructuring charges. On the cost side of the equation, we expect, as Jeff mentioned, that the restructurings that we took last year should generate about $100 million of cost savings this year.Turning next to our 2010 outlook on the next slide, overall, we expect to return to revenue growth in 2010 due to an improved ad environment, steady and healthy subscription revenue trends and a promising content slate. We will increase investments in programming and production that will drive our growth this year and over the long term. To help fund these increased investments in these businesses, we'll remain focused on containing overhead expenses and that should definitely benefit operating margins. This is all reflected in the outlook we released this morning. And as you saw on the release, we expect full year adjusted OIBDA to increase in the mid-teens over the base of $1.83. For modeling purposes, let me just add that we do expect our book tax rate to move back up to closer to the 38% range. And it's also worth noting that beginning in the first quarter of this year, our intention is to shift away from adjusted OIBDA as being the primary key profit measure for the company and we'll be focusing more and more on adjusted operating income. We believe that adjusted operating income will be a more meaningful metric for the company going forward. And it's also consistent with our increased focus on return on invested capital. And it mirrors the shift that we've been making and we've made internally for purposes of measuring our own performance.Turning next to the next slide, we delivered nearly $3 billion in free cash last year, and our conversion ratio was 50%. This is lower than the year-ago period. We did expect that. And that's as a result of higher cash taxes and fluctuations in working capital, offset by lower net cash interest; or cash taxes increased due to higher taxable income and the runoff of tax attributes that benefited us in the past. Recall that our working capital benefited in 2008 from lower TV and film production spending, and that was due in part to the writers' strike that was going on at the time. Our reduced cash interest is due principally to lower debt levels in 2009. And I'd ask you to move to the last slide, which just shows a roll forward of our net debt balances. We ended the year with a little over $10.5 billion in net debt. That's about half the level that we had at the beginning of 2008. And it was, more or less, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, our free cash flow generation was offset by continuing returns to shareholders through our regular dividend and ongoing share repurchases. We ended the year with about $4.8 billion in cash on hand. That's a significant reduction from the $7 billion that we had as of the end of September. And the reduction was principally due to the retirement of a $2 billion debt maturity in November, as well as our continued dividend and share buyback programs. In 2009, we significantly enhanced our balance sheet strength, and that allowed us to meet three key objectives. First, we increased investments in programming production in CapEx by more than 15%.  Second, we more than doubled the returns to shareholders. And third, we maintained strategic flexibility. As we look ahead, our philosophy on balance sheet management has not changed and will not change, but our objectives will evolve somewhat. In 2010, we intend to invest even more in our businesses to bolster their competitive position and drive long-term growth. At the same time, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet through further reduction of cash balances and by carefully managing our debt maturities. And we're making a greater commitment to provide direct returns to stockholders. This is evident in the board's decision to raise the dividend and increase the share repurchase program. We also believe it's important to maintain strategic flexibility. And now that we have completed the AOL separation, our leverage ratio is about 2x, and that's closer to our long-term target of about 2.5x. We plan to maintain this long-term leverage target at the 2.5x level, as we believe a strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage. So that concludes my remarks. Thanks for listening, and I will turn it over to Doug. We'll start the Q&A portion."

And then for John, just on cable margins, given the investment in programming you talked about, should we expect cable margins to be up in 2010, excluding the programming write-down in the fourth quarter?"

The outlook for affiliate position at both HBO and Turner is pretty strong and has been strong. And I think you have to look at comparisons in any year-to-year basis; depends on where somebody starts at. And if they have lower base rates, they're in a bit of a different situation. We basically have the strongest suite of networks across HBO and Turner in the television world and majority of our revenue under both HBO and Turner is under multi-year contracts built in escalators [ph]. Our strategy, as we've been discussing, has been to invest heavily to make the networks compelling value propositions. I think that's equally true of HBO as Turner. Turner with the strength in programming and its reach across CNN Headline, truTV, Cartoon Network, TNT and TBS, is in a very good position to capture the economic upside, let's say, as all those networks become more important and the reach and the success of their programming continues to be successful. So we're very confident about our rate moves going forward, including in relation to competition. And we do think that the moves towards TV Everywhere will simply support the growth in affiliate fee revenue as well."

And notwithstanding the fact that we anticipate increasing our investment programming, which we think is critically important, the order of magnitude of that increase is not going to be overwhelmingly significant. And we're going to continue to try to reallocate funds from SG&A or overhead to be able to fund the programming investments. And while we don't have a crystal ball exactly to what the advertising environment is going to do, because that obviously will ultimately affect margins, we would anticipate that the trends that we've been seeing in the business, which has been margin increases, should continue."

So basically, as you look at -- and you can do history or the current future at HBO. Everytime you put in an enhancement, multiplex then VOD [video on demand], then high-def and now HBO Go on broadband, you strengthen the consumer satisfaction usage in demand for HBO and you support the ability of the entire distribution structure to appropriately capture that; whether they do it in across the base pricing, or whether they do it in some other form of price capture. So from a consumer point of view, we think it's important and has increased the strength and position of HBO that consumers get all these enhancements without discrete charges for certain aspects of HBO. What that then translates to is very strong pricing power for HBO at the affiliate level. And if you look right now, this year or last year, '09, 2010, it will be the same, very strong sub-growth in pricing and marketing growth of HBO through telcos who understand the power of what premium can do. And I think cable operators are going to refocus their efforts on premium TV categories and putting out these enhancements in order to remain competitive. So what it all translates to is very strong across-the-board revenue growth for HBO, both subscriber growth and pricing growth at wholesale. What you then do is take the platform that provides to create an ever-larger budget for regional programming, which you see in HBO's current slate, and it turns it into a successful -- it will be The Pacific, Boardwalk Empire, Hung, True Blood, et cetera, which will then resume long-term growth in content revenue. So the overall architecture is a fairly powerful one."

But having said that, I'm happy to share with you some observations of expectations. The first is, and this is probably the most difficult thing for us to forecast, the specifics on working capital, because they can vary quite a bit. We do have a long history, I think, of managing working capital very tightly and efficiently. And we don't see anything in this year that would make us assume that anything is going to change. And, in fact, I would anticipate that the free cash flow that is being generated from our divisions is very likely going to go up, even year-over-year. And what's embedded in that also, you asked specifically about CapEx, we don't have a very capital-intensive company. CapEx represents only a very, very small percentage of our overall revenue. And having said that, our goal is going to be to keep that CapEx as flat as possible this year as we've done in the past. The one area where we do anticipate cash usage to go up is cash taxes, where we're not anticipating that we're going to get as much benefit from tax planning, and certain state tax law changes that we got this year. So that number could be up. And overall, like I said, we're not giving guidance. I don't think the number is going to be materially different from where we were this year."

Generally, I'm very happy with where we are competitively on all three of those. The question on ratings, let's get into, because they're not the only thing but, of course, they're important. They're a bit of a blunt measurement, and there a number of things besides ratings that play into ad revenue and competitive position and affiliate revenue: Mix of programming, how much original versus acquired in any given month or quarter; the mix of scatter versus upfront sales that work their way into the numbers; the level of guarantees on advertising; sellout levels that vary depending how we're looking at economic trends, as we saw a lot of variability this year; sponsorships and integrated ad buys; online and what part that plays, which changes quarter-to-quarter, depending what the programming is. And then you go through the different categories. Let's take news. We had a huge year in '08. Not as good in prime time in '09, but some pretty good numbers in other parts of the schedules and a great performance in news online. So when you to take that and put it to money ad sales and pricing, with clients it's pretty good and profits were very good. So, of course, you'd rather take all those things and add to those benefits even higher ratings, and we will work on doing that. But there is a bit of a difference in what CNN tries to do as a news service on all of its platforms, 24 hours a day, versus what some of our ""cable news competitors"" try to do. At the end of the day, we're interested, of course, in having a strong branch in the long term and having it produce earnings more than ratings. If you go to entertainment, basically very strong success, as I tried to described in my upfront remarks on originals. Originals are a pretty important part of the branding and the future of all these networks, as they move beyond the TV, when you're dialing to VOD, and international on TV Everywhere and so forth. So that kind of success with key shows and franchises at TNT and TBS, and even at Adult Swim and truTV, is very positive for the long run and shows that the management is focused on the right thing. One of the important drivers, I think at least to these questions, is acquired programming. It's a big part of big-reach cable network economics. And so in a period like we had this fall, where some of our acquired programming didn't work so well, that -- and you make a lot of money on acquired programming. So when that's not totally hitting, then you need to move the line up a little, which we are doing. I don't think it's significant. I'm not complacent about it. But we think we know how to fix it. In the case of TBS, which had two series that didn't work as well as we thought, it'll take a little longer to rotate out. But I don't think it's a ""structural problem"" for the success at the Turner Network."

Basically, on VOD, which is the highest yield in terms of margin of the conversions, when you go off of sale DVD -- so it's better than Netflix and Redbox. We essentially released all of our titles day and date on VOD in the United States in 2009. It certainly was the reason that we ranked number one in VOD, but it didn't hurt us in terms of ranking number one in physical DVD sale, rental, basically every category. So we think that we're hopefully providing an example of what can work in putting out rational windows. We want to make our titles available to consumers in the highest quality, earliest windows, most conveniently to them; whether they buy them or rent or them on every meetings. They buy it physical, they rent them electronically and so forth. And what we're doing is basically setting up all the appropriate ways to do that, taking the lowest margin approaches that would be something like very low-priced rental, and putting it in window terms after the higher margin ones. Because of the litigation with Redbox, I can't really talk too much about what we are discussing with them. But as with all emerging platforms, whether it's TV, film or publishing, we want to provide consumers with the best choices. And we want to do it in a way that gives us fair economics. I think it's pretty clear as an example that the deal that Warner struck with Netflix, which puts them into a win-win position and which also, however, allows the early window for higher margin distributors, is a pretty good example of how this works when it's working the right way. If you go to your question on DC, we're going to have a fairly interesting set of announcements and presentations pretty soon, like in a manner of weeks, I think, about our plans for DC. And basically, if you look across the whole bin of hits, whether it's Batman, The Dark Knight, Green Lantern coming up, Superman, there been a huge number of franchise films that have been part of the Warner tent pole strategy that's been the reason for Warner's unparalleled high, and consistent earnings advantage over the other studios. And DC has already been a part of that, and we are now going to outline an even more expansive plan for that in the coming months."

So as a result, Time Warner is better positioned today than ever. We've got strong operational and financial momentum, and there's increasing evidence that industry trends are going our way. And now, I think we're structured to run our businesses more aggressively than ever. We delivered very strong adjusted earnings per share growth last year, despite the worst recession in most of our lives. Our Networks and Film businesses posted record profits, driven largely by the strength of our content. And that performance underscores two things that we have discussed before. Demand is growing for the kind of high quality content that we make, as consumers enjoy more choices. It also shows how our unique combination of scale, brands and talent enables us to institutionalize success in hit-driven businesses. In 2009, we approved the efficiency and productivity of our businesses. By reallocating resources, we substantially raised our investment in her programming and production. And that's critical to drive our revenue and extend our competitive position. And we still increase margins by significantly reducing overhead expense. While we were doing that, we strengthened our balance sheet last year as well, while doubling our return of capital to shareholders. Free cash flow totaled almost $3 billion. And we returned over $2 billion of that, or more than 70%, to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also spun off Time Warner Cable and AOL, and that allowed us to focus all our energy and resources on what we do best, making and distributing the most compelling branded content on traditional and emerging platforms, and monetizing it better than anyone else. In 2010 and beyond, we'll build on this foundation. As you saw in this morning's outlook release, we expect to grow our Adjusted EPS mid-teens in 2010. We'll do that by executing even more aggressively on the four operational priorities that I've discussed with you before. The first is leveraging our scale and brands to create the highest quality content and monetize it better than anyone else. Second, make our operations more efficient by allocating resources to the best and most productive use. Third, we're going to keep expanding internationally. And fourth, we're developing new business models that capitalize on changes in consumer usage and technology, while at the same time ensuring when possible that they're additive and not cannibalistic. We're going to talk more about that. In practice, this means that we will again spend more on programming and production in 2010. We'll invest more in new digital initiatives and extend our brands internationally. And we'll do that while keeping our overall expenses relatively flat. And I'd like to expand on what that means in each of our four divisions.So I'll start with Turner. We made considerable investments in original programming last year to make sure that our networks become even more attractive for our viewers, our advertisers and our affiliates. We have a lot of successes. Last year, TNT original dramas grew ratings in the same time slots by over 50% over the prior year. And three of it's new original series ranked in cable's top five. Just to pick one of them, TBS debuted the Lopez Tonight Show to double-digit gains in it's time slot. And in it's first few weeks, it outdelivered most other late-night talk shows in valuable 18 to 30 demo. However, not every new original or acquired series worked or connected with viewers as much as we would have liked. We're making changes where necessary, and I remain confident, as we have been, that we'll attract growing audience over the long term. In 2010, just to give you a view of that, we'll bring back hit shows like The Closer and Leverage to TNT, while developing new original dramas such as the new series from Steven Spielberg and George Clooney. We'll also expand our original programming lineup on TBS. I'd like to point out that we expect our entertainment networks to grow ad revenue for the year, even without a major rebound in ratings trends, which we will be working on to do as well. At CNN, we invest tremendous resources on news gathering to deliver the most comprehensive, non-partisan news and analysis in the industry, and do it across all platforms. If you've watched CNN during the tragedy in Haiti, you know that the depth and breadth of our coverage is unparalleled. CNN's ratings vary depending on the news environment. We typically outperform our peers significantly during major news events, as more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. And we have lower ratings when the news cycle is slow. But CNN's position as the premium, biggest reach, multi-platform brand in the news business enables us to consistently command premium pricing from advertisers. In fact, despite ratings declines, this last year compared to the record performance in the 2008 election year, CNN again grew it's profits by double digits in 2009. This year, we expect another year of strong profit growth at CNN.HBO. The performance at HBO last year illustrates that it's value proposition has never been better. It aired four of the six highest-rated shows in it's entire history, and it grew it's subscriber base for the year despite the recession. This year, HBO is bringing back the next season of our highest-rated shows, including True Blood, Entourage, Hung and Big Love. We'll debut The Pacific, the highly anticipated miniseries from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. That's the companion to Band of Brothers. And we'll premiere Martin Scorsese's Boardwalk Empire, with it poised to HBO's next breakout hit show. Both Turner and HBO will keep expanding internationally this year too. Turner's International business currently operates more than 100 feeds across 200 countries. We'll expand organically by launching new feeds in new markets and adding new distributors. We'll also make acquisitions where it makes sense. For example, we recently agreed to acquire NDTV Imagine, which is a general entertainment network in India, that will significantly increase our presence and scale in that region. HBO has over 33 million subscribers internationally, that at HBO Latin America, HBO Asia and HBO Central Europe. And it's the leading pay-TV provider in each of these markets. We plan to extend this lead as we rollout new features like On Demand. Altogether, we expect our International Cable Networks business and related content sales to generate more than $400 million of adjusted OIBDA in 2010. And they're set to grow even faster than our domestic networks. In TV, as in film and magazines, we're leading the charge to digital business models that enhance the value of our content both for us and for consumers. In 2010, both Turner and HBO will continue to pioneer the industry-wide TV Everywhere initiative, which is basically TV on demand and on broadband. Turner will be in trials or commercial launch with every major distributor this year, cable, satellite and telco. And you'll soon hear more about HBO's rollout of it's streaming service, HBO Go, which will offer three times the content of what's on HBO On Demand today.Now let's move over to our studio. Warner Bros. performed phenomenally last year too, shattering records everywhere it turned. It broke the all-time global box office record with more than $4 billion in sales. Seven films crossed the $100 million mark domestic box-office in 2009, that's also a record, including the latest in the Harry Potter franchise, Sherlock Holmes, The Blind Side and The Hangover. The Hangover was the best selling R-rated comedy ever at the box office and on home video. Even with declines in the Home Video category industry-wide, this performance helped power Warner Bros. to it's most profitable year ever, roughly $1.5 billion in adjusted OIBDA. And even after a record 2009 slate, we are very optimistic about this year's film slate. 10 fall releases include the seventh Harry Potter; Sex and the City 2; Inception, a film from Christopher Nolan, who directed The Dark Knight; Due Date from Todd Phillips, who gave us the Hangover; Clash of the Titans and Guardians of Ga'Hoole, which is a 3D CGI film based on the popular young adult book series. In the next few months, you'll also hear more about our plans to mine more aggressively the deep catalog of DC comics characters across Warner Bros. theatrical, home video, TV and games divisions, and across our other divisions as well.Turning to the Television Production business, very important business. As you may know, in most years, Warner TV Production contributes as much as half the profits in our filmed entertainment division. This year, Warner will continue to develop and foster the relationships with A-list writers and directors that's made us the number one provider of broadcast TV programming for 18 of the past 23 years. And that's enabled us to produce hits like Two and A Half Men and Big Bang Theory, which are the two top comedies on TV right now. We see encouraging secular dynamics this year, and over the next several years, with recent signs that broadcasters may be able to secure cash carriage fees, and NBC's recent decision to resume broadcasting scripted programming at 10 p.m., and the robust marketplace for both original and off-network programming on cable. Demand for high-quality scripted programming seems to be going up, and that is right in Warner TV's sweet spot. Last year, we parlayed our leading position at the box office and on TV into the number one share in the Home Video business for the ninth consecutive year. That included Warner's being number one in every category, standard definition, Blu-Ray high def, VOD and electronic sell-through. In 2010, we'll continue to lead the transition of the Home Video business to digital, which carries higher gross profits for us than physical DVDs. We're also actively working with distributors to make sure that we can offer consumers convenience, and a compelling value proposition, while ensuring that we're appropriately compensated for our intellectual property. Overall, due to the strength in our film slate, our expectations for another strong year in TV production and our progress in the Home Video business, we believe that Warner Bros. is set to deliver another year of very strong profits coming up in 2010.On to Time Inc., we recently announced that we, and several other publishers have formed a consortium to develop common technology standards for reading print content on tablets and on other e-Reader devices. We view these devices as a key way to transition the dual revenue stream print business model to digital. And as these readers grow in popularity, they are proving that consumers will pay for quality content, and these readers enhance the kind of content that we can deliver. And as they improve functionality, they hold increasing promise as an advertising medium. Just as in our TV and Film business, we intend to lead the way in determining how digital business models evolve here to. Operationally, Time Inc. faced a pretty challenging advertising climate last year, but there were clean signs of improvement in the fourth quarter. And testifying to the strength of Time's content and brands, in 2009, Time Inc. grew its share of advertising, and grew its share of readership. This year, Time Inc. will continue to reduce its cost structure. The restructuring that we undertook in the fourth quarter should generate about $100 million in savings on a run-rate basis in 2010 and years after. And at the same time that we're building that in, Time Inc. will continue to distance itself from its competitors by investing in its biggest brands, and in high-quality editorial content. Now John, in a minute, will talk more to you about our financial performance in 2009, and our plans for 2010 and our balance sheet. But before I hand it off to John, I'd like to touch on how we're approaching our capital management this year.Philosophically, I think one of our most important jobs is to actively manage our capital, to enhance the organic returns of our businesses and maintain a strong balance sheet, as we go along. In line with this goal, our board has increased our dividend, and authorized an increase in our remaining stock repurchase authorization to $3 billion. As a result, we now provide, by far, the highest dividend payout ratio and the highest yield of any of our peers in media, and we're on pace to return even more capital in 2010 than we did last year. These steps reflect our confidence, confidence in the future of high-quality content over the long term, confidence in our strategic and competitive position and confidence that we can deliver steady, superior returns to stockholders year-by-year and over the long term. We think that the more you know about today's Time Warner, the more you'll share this confidence. And we're looking forward to talking more with you about this in detail across each of our businesses at our Investor Day that we've scheduled in late May. We'll be sending out details soon. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John."

And let me begin by saying that there are slides that are now available on our website to help you follow along with my comments. And beginning on the first slide, you'll see some brief highlights and observations, some of which Jeff has made already. Despite the difficult environment, we had a number of important financial achievements in 2009, and we did accomplish all of our objectives. First, we delivered strong financial performance. Next, we completed the spins of both Time Warner Cable and AOL. And further, we maintained a very strong balance sheet, while both investing fully in our businesses and increasing direct returns to shareholders. Our fourth quarter results allowed us to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.83 for the year, and that compares to our full-year adjusted EPS outlook of at least $1.75. This EPS figure was also a significant improvement over 2008. We also continued to generate significant levels of free cash flow, with a very high full-year conversion ratio of 15% of adjusted OIBDA. And this enabled us to return $2.1 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and that represented over 70% of our free cash. And as Jeff mentioned, our board authorized both an increase in the annual dividend to $0.85 a share, and an increase in our remaining share repurchase program to about $3 billion. And as we look ahead, we are very, very encouraged by both improving macroeconomic trends and the strong competitive positions of our businesses. And we intend to maintain their leadership position by further improving our operating efficiency and by allocating resources towards areas of higher growth and better returns. This year, we'll use our balance sheet strength to fund even more investment in our businesses, we'll improve our capital efficiency and we're on course to return even capital directly to shareholders. This is all reflected in this morning's outlook.This next slide shows our consolidated fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Fourth quarter revenues increased 2%, as higher content and subscription revenues more than offset an 8% decline in advertising revenues. And while advertising was down for the quarter, this did represent a sequential improvement from the 10% drop in the third quarter of 2009 and it did represent the smallest decline that we saw for the entire year. It's also the first quarter of overall revenue growth this since the second quarter of 2008, so we're quite pleased with that.Adjusted OIBDA was up very nicely in the fourth quarter, and our film studio was a big driver of the growth. Now you do see some pretty large year-over-year profit growth variances in our fourth quarter reported results. Please remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we incurred an approximately $270 million legal charge related to the sale of our winter sports teams. Over the course of the past year, we talked to you also about the impact that we've experienced from higher pension expense, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the impact that those have had on our results. For the full year, pension and FX taken together were an almost 600 basis point drag on our adjusted OIBDA growth.Operating expenses, which include cost to revenues and SG&A, fell by an approximately $1 billion last year for the full year. Margins climbed more than 200 basis points, and were higher at three out of our four operating divisions. This reflects our continued cost efforts across the entire company. Full year adjusted EPS was up almost 30% over the year-ago results. And now, let me turn to our segment highlights. And we're going to begin with a discussion at our networks.We did have another very strong year at both HBO and Turner, and they each recorded their highest annual profits ever. The Network segment represented nearly 60% of the company's profits in the quarter and almost 70% of the profits for the full year. Adjusted OIBDA grew 29% in the quarter and 15% for the year. And keep in mind these comparisons reflect the legal charge from a year ago that I just mentioned. And in this year, they also reflect the $100 million programming write-down to Turner, and the consolidation of HBO Latin America. Now let me briefly expand on the programming write-down for a moment. This was a management decision to take one show off the programming schedule. And while programming decisions like this are an ongoing way of doing business here, we don't anticipate incurring any more write-downs of anything close to this size for the foreseeable future. As expected, advertising revenue decline modestly in the quarter at the networks, they were down 4%. And although the scatter market was very strong for us, the decline resulted from difficult comparisons at our news division, and that's against last year's U.S. presidential election, as well as the impact of lower CPMs in the 2009/2010 upfront, and to a lesser extent, lower ratings at the domestic entertainment networks. Looking at the first quarter, scatter pricing is very much above upfront levels. We expect advertising revenues at the networks to be up in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, and that's despite continued tough comparisons at CNN against the inauguration in last year.Subscription revenue growth of 11% in the quarter and 10% for the full year reflected the consolidation of HBO Latin America, and rate increases at both Turner and HBO. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO finished the year with it's highest year-end domestic subscriber base ever. The decline in content revenue the quarter was due to lower video and syndication revenue at HBO's original programming, including Sex and the City and the Sopranos. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic that HBO's slate of original programming will lead the growth in content revenue, and that's going to begin this year. Before I move on, I do want to note, as Jeff said, that we did recently agree to acquire the majority stake in NDTV Imagine, it's one of the leading general entertainment networks in India. India is a country where we see significant opportunity in the coming years. And as Jeff described, NDTV should help our competitive position there significantly. For 2010, however, NDTV is expected to be a drag on OIBDA profits of about $40 million. Notwithstanding that, or despite this, we anticipate our international cable networks will be a driver of growth in 2010, as we anticipate ad markets to improve.Moving over to film, Warner Brothers had an absolutely amazing year, setting a record for full-year profits. This was the seventh straight quarter of adjusted OIBDA growth at our filmed entertainment division. Adjusted OIBDA rose 41% in the fourth quarter, driven by the successful home video releases of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Hangover, and the strong theatrical performances of The Blind Side and Sherlock Holmes. Our Games business within that division was also a contributor to growth in the quarter, and we expect it to continue in the coming years. Games now generates for us over $500 million annually in revenue, and it has healthy margins. Thanks to our continued efforts to streamline costs, margins climbed over 200 basis points for the year. And heading into this year, we no doubt have difficult comparisons in this division against a very strong performance last year, just to point out a couple of things. One item affecting our 2010 comparisons would be the impact of our decision to self distribute New Line films overseas instead of pre-selling the rights, which is what New Line used to do. This should enable us to realize increased profits over time. But for timing and accounting reasons, it's going to result in a drag of more than $100 million on OIBDA this year. In addition, 2009's results included approximately $75 million of combined benefits related to a true up, or participation expense in the resolution of an international tax matter, and we wouldn't anticipate similar benefits to recur in 2010. Now having said all that, and despite this, let me reiterate what Jeff said, which is that we do expect Warner Bros. to once again deliver very, very strong profit levels again in 2010, and here's why. First, we're optimistic about the strength and the quality of the film slate this year. Second, while we expect sales of standard definition DVDs to remain somewhat challenged, we expect continued growth of higher-margin Blu-Ray, VOD and electronic sell-through to help offset this pressure, and we'll be releasing a greater number of titles into home video this year. And lastly, we expect our TV business to have another very, very strong year in 2010, helped by a growing TV syndication pipeline. We really didn't have any significant new availabilities of syndicated programming last year in 2009, but we will have several in 2010, including Two and a Half Men on cable, New Adventures of Old Christine, The Closer and Supernatural. And we'll also continue to take a hard line on costs in this division.Looking at our Publishing division on the next slide, Time Inc.'s fourth quarter was affected by the tough ad environment, with advertising down 12% in the quarter. This did represent, however, a significant sequential improvement rather in year-over-year trends. Domestic advertising revenues were down 9%, and most of this decline was due to fewer ad pages, with ad rates down only in the low single digits. As you know, Time Inc.'s domestic magazines are operated in three units. And just wanted to note that the style and entertainment unit was our strongest performer in the fourth quarter, with revenue growth that People Magazine helping keep ad revenue for the group essentially flat. Most of the advertising softness in the quarter was concentrated in our News segment. Looking ahead to the first quarter, print advertising trends have improved, and that's relative to the fourth quarter and it's being largely driven by higher volumes. Our style and entertainment group remains our strongest performer, and is tracking up solidly for the quarter. We also saw sequential improvement in subscription trends in the fourth quarter, and that was primarily at newsstand. Although subscription renewal rates improved in the last few quarters, our year-over-year growth rates are still being affected by the lower renewals at the height of the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted OIBDA at our publishing unit increased 27% in the quarter, as lower revenues and higher pension costs were more than offset by cost-saving initiatives and lower restructuring charges. On the cost side of the equation, we expect, as Jeff mentioned, that the restructurings that we took last year should generate about $100 million of cost savings this year.Turning next to our 2010 outlook on the next slide. Overall, we expect to return to revenue growth in 2010 due to an improved ad environment, steady and healthy subscription revenue trends and a promising content slate. We will increase investments in programming and production that will drive our growth this year and over the long term. To help fund these increased investments in the businesses, we'll remain focused on containing overhead expenses, and that should definitely benefit operating margins. This is all reflected in the outlook we released this morning. And as you saw on the release, we expect full year adjusted OIBDA to increase in the mid-teens over the base of $1.83. For modeling purposes, let me just add that we do expect our book tax rate to move back up to closer to the 38% range. And it's also worth noting that beginning in the first quarter of this year, our intention is to shift away from adjusted OIBDA as being the primary key profit measure for the company and we'll be focusing more and more on adjusted operating income. We believe that adjusted operating income will be a more meaningful metric for the company going forward, and it's also consistent with our increased focus on return on invested capital, and it mirrors the shift that we've been making and we've made internally for purposes of measuring our own performance.Turning next to the next slide, we delivered nearly $3 billion in free cash last year, and our conversion ratio was 50%. This is lower than the year-ago period. We did expect that. And that's as a result of higher cash taxes and fluctuations in working capital, offset by lower net cash interest, or cash taxes increased due to higher taxable income and the runoff of tax attributes that benefited us in the past. Recall that our working capital benefited in 2008 from lower TV and film production spending, and that was due in part to the writers' strike that was going on at the time. Our reduced cash interest is due principally to lower debt levels in 2009. And I'd ask you to move to the last slide which just shows a roll forward of our net debt balances. We ended the year with a little over $10.5 billion in net debt. That's about half the level that we had at the beginning of 2008. And it was more or less unchanged from the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, free cash flow generation was offset by continuing returns to shareholders through our regular dividend and ongoing share repurchases. We ended the year with about $4.8 billion in cash on hand. That's a significant reduction from the $7 billion that we had as of the end of September. And the reduction was principally due to the retirement of a $2 billion debt maturity in November, as well as our continued dividend and share buyback programs. In 2009, we significantly enhanced our balance sheet strength, and that allowed us to meet three key objectives: First, we increased investments in programming production in CapEx by more than 15%; second, we more than doubled the returns to shareholders; and third, we maintained strategic flexibility. As we look ahead, our philosophy on balance sheet management has not changed and will not change, but our objectives will evolve somewhat. In 2010, we intend to invest even more in our businesses to bolster their competitive position and drive long-term growth. At the same time, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet through further reduction of cash balances and by carefully managing our debt maturities. And we're making a greater commitment to provide direct returns to stockholders. This is evident in the board's decision to raise the dividend and increase the share repurchase program. We also believe it's important to maintain strategic flexibility. And now that we have completed the AOL separation, our leverage ratio is about 2x, and that's closer to our long-term target of about 2.5x. We plan to maintain this long-term leverage target at the 2.5x level, as we believe a strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage. So that concludes my remarks. Thanks for listening, and I will turn it over to Doug. We'll start the Q&A portion."

The outlook for affiliate position at both HBO and Turner is pretty strong and has been strong. And I think you have to look at comparisons in any year-to-year basis; depends on where somebody starts at. And if they have lower base rates, they're in a bit of a different situation. We basically have the strongest suite of networks across HBO and Turner in the television world, and majority of our revenue under both HBO and Turner is under multi-year contracts built in escalators [ph] (1:31:57). Our strategy, as we've been discussing, has been to invest heavily to make the networks compelling value propositions. I think that's equally true of HBO as Turner. Turner, with the strength in programming and its reach across CNN Headline, truTV, Cartoon Network, TNT and TBS, is in a very good position to capture the economic upside, let's say, as all those networks become more important and the reach and the success of their programming continues to be successful. So we're very confident about our rate moves going forward, including in relation to competition. And we do think that the moves towards TV Everywhere will simply support the growth in affiliate fee revenue as well."

So basically, as you look at -- and you can do history or of the current future at HBO. Every time you put in an enhancement, multiplex, then VOD [video on demand], then high-def and now HBO Go on broadband, you strengthen the consumer satisfaction usage in demand for HBO and you support the ability of the entire distribution structure to appropriately capture that, whether they do it in across the base pricing or whether they do it in some other form of price capture. So from a consumer point of view, we think it's important and has increased the strength and position of HBO that consumers get all these enhancements without discrete charges for certain aspects of HBO. What that then translates to is very strong pricing power for HBO at the affiliate level. And if you look right now, this year or last year, '09, 2010, it will be the same, very strong sub-growth in pricing and marketing growth of HBO through telcos who understand the power of what premium can do. And I think cable operators are going to refocus their efforts on premium TV categories and putting out these enhancements in order to remain competitive. So what it all translates to is very strong across-the-board revenue growth for HBO, both subscriber growth and pricing growth at wholesale. What you then do is take the platform that provides to create an ever-larger budget for regional programming, which you see in HBO's current slate, and it turns it into a successful -- it will be The Pacific, Boardwalk Empire, Hung, True Blood, et cetera, which will then resume long-term growth in content revenue. So the overall architecture is a fairly powerful one."

But having said that, I'm happy to share with you some observations of expectations. The first is, and this is probably the most difficult thing for us to forecast, the specifics on working capital, because they can vary quite a bit. We do have a long history, I think, of managing working capital very tightly and efficiently. And we don't see anything in this year that would make us assume that anything is going to change. And, in fact, I would anticipate that the free cash flow that is being generated from our divisions is very likely going to go up, even year-over-year. And what's embedded in that also, you asked specifically about CapEx, we don't have a very capital-intensive company. CapEx represents only a very, very small percentage of our overall revenue. And having said that, our goal is going to be to keep that CapEx as flat as possible this year as we've done in the past. The one area where we do anticipate cash usage to go up is cash taxes, where we're not anticipating that we're going to get as much benefit from tax planning, and certain state tax law changes that we got this year. So that number could be up. And overall, like I said, we're not giving guidance. I don't think the number is going to be materially different from where we were this year."

Generally, I'm very happy with where we are competitively on all three of those. The question on ratings, let's get into, because they're not the only thing but, of course, they're important. They're a bit of a blunt measurement, and there a number of things besides ratings that play into ad revenue and competitive position and affiliate revenue: Mix of programming, how much original versus acquired in any given month or quarter; the mix of scatter versus upfront sales that work their way into the numbers; the level of guarantees on advertising; sellout levels that vary depending how we're looking at economic trends, as we saw a lot of variability this year; sponsorships and integrated ad buys; online and what part that plays, which changes quarter-to-quarter depending what the programming is. And then you go through the different categories. Let's take news. We had a huge year in '08. Not as good in prime time in '09, but some pretty good numbers in other parts of the schedules and a great performance in news online. So when you take that and put it to money, ad sales and pricing with clients is pretty good and profits were very good. So, of course, you'd rather take all those things and add to those benefits even higher ratings, and we will work on doing that. But there is a bit of a difference in what CNN tries to do as a news service on all of its platforms 24 hours a day versus what some of our ""cable news competitors"" try to do. At the end of the day, we're interested, of course, in having a strong branch to the long term and having it produce earnings more than ratings. If you go to entertainment, basically, very strong success as I tried to described in my upfront remarks on originals. Originals are a pretty important part of the branding and the future of all these networks, as they move beyond the TV, when you're dialing to VOD, and international on TV Everywhere and so forth. So that kind of success with key shows and franchises at TNT and TBS, and even at Adult Swim and truTV, is very positive for the long run and shows that the management is focused on the right thing. One of the important drivers, I think at least to these questions, is acquired programming. It's a big part of big-reach cable network economics. And so in a period like we had this fall where some of our acquired programming didn't work so well, that -- and you make a lot of money on acquired programming. So when that's not totally hitting, then you need to move the line up a little, which we are doing. I don't think it's significant. I'm not complacent about it. But we think we know how to fix it. In the case of TBS which had two series that didn't work as well as we thought, it'll take a little longer to rotate out. But I don't think it's a ""structural problem"" for the success at the Turner Network."

It was actually up a little bit. Looking into the first quarter -- and again, it's still early in the quarter if we caveat that.

Basically, on VOD, which is the highest yield in terms of margin of the conversions when you go off of sale DVD. So it's better than Netflix and Redbox. We essentially released all of our titles, day and date on VOD in the United States in 2009. It certainly was the reason that we ranked number one in VOD, but it didn't hurt us in terms of ranking number one in physical DVD sale, rental, basically every category. So we think that we're hopefully providing an example of what can work in putting out rational windows. We want to make our titles available to consumers in the highest quality, earliest windows, most conveniently to them, whether they buy them or rent or them, on every meetings. They buy it physical, they rent them electronically and so forth. And what we're doing is basically setting up all the appropriate ways to do that, taking the lowest margin approaches, that would be something like very low-priced rental, and putting it in window terms after the higher margin ones. Because of the litigation with Redbox, I can't really talk too much about what we are discussing with them. But as with all emerging platforms, whether it's TV, film or publishing, we want to provide consumers with the best choices. And we want to do it in a way that gives us fair economics. I think it's pretty clear as an example that the deal that Warner struck with Netflix, which puts them into a win-win position and which also, however, allows the early window for higher margin distributors, is a pretty good example of how this works when it's working the right way. If you go to your question on DC, we're going to have a fairly interesting set of announcements and presentations pretty soon, like in a manner of weeks, I think, about our plans for DC. And basically, if you look across the whole bin of hits, whether it's Batman, The Dark Knight, Green Lantern coming up, Superman, there been a huge number of franchise films that have been part of the Warner tent pole strategy that's been the reason for Warner's unparalleled high, and consistent earnings advantage over the other studios.

Any deal, if we were to do one, would need to provide strategic benefits and a strong return in relation to other choices that we have. And you'd have to figure risk in figuring out what any returns would be on an acquisition. On the second question, I love that question, over the top, the people that are going to go over the top is us and not really them. And I think it's really important to emphasize, and we've said this in so many ways across our networks, our film division and our Publishing company that we're going to make our content available to consumers in the brands they love, the way they like to use them, in every manner of interactive and on-demand method. And in most cases, we're going to be doing that without incremental charges for making those things available digital to our subscribers. Now if you talk about new, I think you used the phrase digital, whatever, distributors, we love new distributors. The ones you mentioned are not distributors. They are device manufacturers. And what we're very interested in is harnessing every kind of distributor that can get our content to consumers. And we think it's great when people come up with new devices and screens on which our consumers and readers and viewers can watch their favorite media. But if they're not distributors, they are not particularly powerful in the chain."

As you all know, we'll be talking with you at length in a few weeks at our investor meeting, so I'll keep it fairly brief today. It was a great quarter for us and a great start to the year. We po",1071,"Thanks, Doug. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. As you all know, we'll be talking with you at length in a few weeks at our investor meeting, so I'll keep it fairly brief today. It was a great quarter for us and a great start to the year. We posted our best revenue growth in almost two years and the most profitable quarter in our history. Our margins were up across the company, driving adjusted operating income up almost 40% and adjusted earnings per share climbed over 60%. Remember that's off a big increase last year. 
So it was a record quarter fueled by a healthy advertising environment, strong performance of our content and continued cost controls. Even though there's still uncertainty about the health of the economy, we're seeing demand come back across key advertising categories at both our Networks and our publishing company. Last quarter had Turner scatter pricing was 20% to 30% above the upfront and it remains strong in the second quarter, including right now, as we go out in the quarter. Our ratings are not yet where we want them to be at all of Turner's Networks, but we've made some real progress lately, particularly at TNT, where ratings were up in the quarter. truTV continues to deliver great numbers, placing it among the top 10 cable networks in prime time for the first time. And we see trends at TBS improving as the year progresses. Ratings do remain down at CNN and we're working to fix that. 
With all that said, Turner posted very strong Advertising growth in the quarter, up 9%. This performance was a testament to the strength of our brands, the quality of the sales force and our ability to take advantage of the favorable environment. 
At Time Inc., advertising rose 5%. It was the first quarter of ad growth in more than two years. Our film content is also delivering. Warner Bros. posted its eighth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income growth, driven by strong home video and theatrical releases like The Blind Side, Sherlock Holmes and Valentine's Day. After the quarter ended, we released Clash of the Titans, which exceeded our expectations passing $400 million at the global box office. That also underscored consumers' healthy appetite for 3D. We recently announced that all of our future event films, our superhero titles and special effects-driven releases will be produced in 3D. And this year, that will apply to four more films, including the next installment of Harry Potter and soon to be a legend, a new title called, the Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole. I hope that becomes familiar to all of you in the future.
Beyond 3D, we're enthusiastic about the rest of this year's movie slate. And we're confident that we'll have another strong pick-up season in our TV and Production business at this year's upfront. We're moving slightly but staying with our content. This quarter, HBO premiered The Pacific, a 10-part miniseries that's the companion piece to Band of Brothers. It debuted to outstanding critical acclaim and is now averaging 9 million viewers per episode. In addition to our operational performance, we also made important strategic progress. As you know, in terms of our long-term goals, we'd basically got four key goals: First, leverage our scale and brands to deliver compelling content; second, develop business models that benefit both consumers and our economics; third, expand internationally; and fourth, maintain a relentless focus on cost and capital efficiency. 
Here are some examples. Two weeks ago, Turner and CBS reached a deal with the NCAA to secure the exclusive U.S. television online and mobile rights March Madness for the next 14 years. Over time, 65% of the programming from NCAA, including the Final Four and the championship game will be on our networks. In today's TV marketplace, this kind of marquee must-have programming is absolutely critical. It's a game changer for Turner and it will dramatically increase the appeal of TNT, TBS and truTV with viewers, advertisers and affiliates. And we'll achieve all that for what we consider to be a relatively modest annual cost, which is locked in over a very long period of time.
Also in April, we signed a deal to bring Conan O'Brien to TBS, starts this November. That step will help cement TBS' position as TV's number one comedy network. With Conan, George Lopez and the strength of Adult Swim, Turner will essentially own late-night television. When we combine all that with all of our other great programming and the strength of our brand, it makes us very optimistic heading into this year's upfront. We're also looking for ways to develop business models that are good for consumers and good for us. Warner Bros. recently reached agreements with Netflix and Redbox that established a 28-day window between our home video releases and their availability through these distributors. And through these deals, they should have enough product to satisfy their customers. While at the same time, we expect to increase demand for DVD sale-through and Video-on-Demand.
Keep in mind that we typically sell 75% of our DVDs in those first four weeks after release. And VOD carries much higher margins for us than other rental outlets. In a similar vein, in February, HBO launched its online video offering called HBO Go. On Verizon's file service, HBO Go is a great example of our TV Everywhere initiative to providing 600 hours of on-demand programming to HBO subscribers on demand on their broadband devices at no additional cost.
Turning to our international expansion, this quarter we brought out our partners at HBO Central Europe and we increased our stake in HBO Latin America to more than 80%. These steps give us greater economic exposure to these fast-growing businesses. We'll also be able to rollout product extensions in these regions and expand in additional territories more aggressively.
So wrapping up, we achieved a lot in just the last few months. I'm increasingly confident about our how we're positioned for the remainder of this year and the years beyond that. We're looking forward to talking more with you about this, our strategy, our competitive position and our growth opportunities in depth across our businesses in the next couple of weeks from now. I think the more you know about Time Warner, the more you'll share in our confidence. With that, I'll turn it over to John."

As usual, there are slides available on our website that I will refer to during my prepared remarks. And getting right in to it beginning on the first slide, which contains some highlights for the quarter, you can see from the highlights that we're off to a great start to the year. As the operating environment improves, we're seeing the benefits from both the business investments we've made and the cost-savings initiatives we've put in place over the past couple of years. 
During the first quarter, we saw very healthy top line revenue trends and we maintained focus on costs. That led to very strong adjusted operating income growth, meaningful margin expansion of 500 basis points and more than 60% adjusted EPS growth. The first quarter had the highest revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008 and adjusted operating income increased 37%. That's better frankly than we expected going into the quarter. And while some of these outperformance was due to timing, as Jeff described, much of it was due to a better-than-expected advertising environment, terrific film slate performance and ongoing cost controls. 
Free cash flow, which is typically strong for us in the first quarter was also up over last year. And we returned over $750 million in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. So just a terrific start to the year and I'd ask you to move to the next slide, which shows our consolidated income statement highlights. 
Revenues were up 5%. Subscription revenues continue to be a very consistent growth drivers for us, up 7% and Advertising was up 8% in the quarter. This is the first quarter of Advertising growth at Time Warner since the third quarter of 2008, and it represented a significant improvement from the 8% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income was up nearly $400 million in the quarter. As I said, margins climbed 500 basis points, they expanded across all four of our operating divisions, reaching the highest levels ever for our company.
Operating expenses declined modestly, as compared to the first quarter of last year and that was due to, as I mentioned, all of the cost initiatives that we put in place, as well as some favorable timing, primarily in our program expenses, and I'll speak to that in a couple of moments. 
Turning next to our segment highlights. And we're going to begin at our Networks division where we had our highest quarterly profit ever at this division, more than $1.1 billion. That's up 22% over last year. Both Turner and HBO saw growth of adjusted operating income well into the double digits year-over-year. 
Advertising grew 9% and here, our Domestic Entertainment Networks grew advertising in the low-double digits and international was also up significantly. And these more than offset declines at domestic news. The improvement at our domestic entertainment networks was due primarily to very strong scatter pricing and yield management. And underlying growth at our international networks was in the mid-teens. Our international results also included the impact from several transactions, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to total Advertising growth in the quarter. And these are transactions that we expect strong growth from in the future. Looking ahead, scatter pricing remains vibrant, still up better than 20% over the upfront and we expect continued strong advertising growth into the second quarter. Subscription revenues grew 7%, and that reflects higher rates at both Turner and HBO, as well as international growth and expansion.
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter and margins expanded 400 basis points year-over-year to 39%. Total expenses were only up modestly here with programming cost down slightly. A quick note in margins, keep in mind that margins typically decline sequentially for us in the second quarter when we realize a meaningful proportion of annual sports rights amortization. I'll also point out that investing in high-quality content remains a critical part of our strategy. Based on our original programming schedule, we plan for programming expenses to be up in both the second quarter and the full year. But to be clear, we fully expect margins at our Networks division to expand for the full year 2010 versus 2009. So that's good. But we wouldn't expect a similar level margin expansion for the rest of the year that we saw in the first quarter.
Moving to our Film division. Warner Bros. once again, had a great start to the year and a great quarter. Operating income was up 43%. Warner Bros. took advantage of healthy box office trends and maintained its number one position in home video across every format. Despite some continuing challenges in the broader Home Video category, our Home Video revenue was up 34% due to stronger titles, including The Blindside and Sherlock Holmes, as well as more releases. Last year, we had only five title releases and that compared to 10 titles released this year in the first quarter. 
Margin trends at the studio remained positive with margins up to 300 basis points over last year. Looking ahead, the theatrical performance of Clash and (sic) [of] the Titans, as Jeff said, has already exceeded our own expectations, and we're very optimistic about the rest of this year's release slate includes Sex and the City 2, Inception, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. And we're confident we'll have another great TV pilot season. We also have a significant pipeline of syndication revenue going in later this year, as well as several exciting video game releases including two new LEGO titles. 
Moving on now to Publishing. Time Inc.'s ad revenues improved nicely in the quarter, up 5%. This is the first quarter of advertising growth in this division since the fourth quarter of 2007. So it's quite encouraging as it's been a while since we've been up in advertising. Time Inc.'s top seven advertiser categories were all up. And that was led by Domestic Auto, Beauty and Financial. And online revenues were up more than 20% here in the quarter. 
Looking across Time Inc.'s three operating units, our Style and Entertainment unit was again our strongest performer. It grew advertising double digits led by strong growth at People, Entertainment Weekly and In Style. Trends at the Lifestyle and News units also improved with total ad revenues for both up modestly in the quarter.
Looking ahead, train advertising trends remain positive into the second quarter, and we once again expect total advertising to be up here in Q2. Subscription revenues improved modestly year-over-year, largely as a result of some favorable foreign currency translation. Domestic circulation trends, however, do remain somewhat challenged. 
Total expenses at Time Inc. were down almost $90 million in the quarter over last year. That reflects continued cost savings initiatives that were put into place at the end of last year, as well as lower marketing and pension expenses. As you know, we have moved very aggressively at this business to rightsize the cost base during the economic downturn, and we absolutely expect cost to remain lower than they were last year in this division for the remainder of 2010.
Let me move to the next slide, which contains our new updated outlook. And here, our current forecasts reflect more optimism versus where we were at the beginning of the year, so that's good. As you saw on our release, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to grow at least mid-teens over the base of $1.83. We think this updated outlook may prove to be conservative in the fullness of time. And it's not like we're seeing anything bad out there. But we're mindful that it's still early in the year. And as we look ahead, visibility in advertising remains somewhat limited and that's a macro-environment point. We do have a number of big film releases ahead of us. And as I mentioned just a minute ago, we don't expect the same degree of market expansion at our Networks division for the full year as we saw in the first quarter. 
But all in all, we remain extremely encouraged by both the improving macroeconomic environment and the trends there, as well as our own a strong operating performance. We think 2010 will prove to be another year of strong growth at Time Warner. And as Jeff mentioned, we're growing off of what was a record year of profits in 2009, so that makes us somewhat unique.
Lastly, I'll finish up with a brief look at our free cash flow and our capital plan. Focusing on free cash flow, we delivered $1.3 billion in the quarter. That's also a very strong start to the year for us. The first quarter is typically strong. But we were up nearly 20% against the strong first quarter we had last year. Free cash flow grew due to the underlying growth in adjusted operating income, as well as lower capital spending. And that was somewhat offset by an increase in working capital, higher cash and interest expense and higher cash taxes. I would note that capital spending was only $89 million in the quarter, that's down 12%. And capital spending represents only 1.4% of our revenues.
The last slide is a net debt roll forward. We ended the quarter with about $11.5 billion in net debt. That's flat compared to the end of 2009. In the quarter, free cash flow generation was offset by the nearly $500 million in investment and acquisition spending and continued direct returns to shareholders. The significant majority of our acquisition spending in the quarter or about 90% of it was on international cable networks and video game developers. This is consistent with our continued focus on tuck-in opportunities in cable networks and video game companies with a lot of them occurring outside of the U.S. 
Coming into the year, we laid out for you our balance sheet priorities, and so far, we are right on track to achieve all of them. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to strengthen their competitive positions and drive long-term growth, and I don't see any better example than that than our recent commitment to NCAA. Second, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet by reducing cash balances over time and carefully managing our debt maturities. And during the quarter, hopefully, you saw that we took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment. And we extended debt maturities of close to $2 billion, while also the same time, reducing ongoing interest costs. 
Third, we're making an even greater commitment to provide direct returns to stockholders, and this was evident through our increased regular dividend, which we announced last quarter, as well as ongoing share repurchases. As I mentioned earlier during the quarter, we returned over $750 million to shareholders, including over $500 million in share repurchases. And that's fairly consistent with our pace from each of the prior two quarters. We also believe it's important to maintain a strategic flexibility, our leverage ratio today is about two times, which is closer but still somewhat shy of our long-term target of 2.5x. And for now, we continue to remain comfortable operating at levels that are a little bit low than our stated target leverage, as we believe a strong balance sheet is a real competitive advantage. So that concludes my prepared remarks. And we'd be happy to -- I'll return the call over to Doug. We'd be happy to open up for Q&A."

But having gotten off to such a great start with Sherlock Holmes, Valentine's Day and Clash of the Titans, we still have very high hopes for the remainder of 2010. And as John mentioned, with the kind of potential in releases is like Sex and the City 2, Inception, which could be a big film due date, Legend of the Guardians and then Harry Potter. There's a lot in the pipeline. So on the high side, if that does very well, we can have a very strong year. And then we will also benefit this year from some television syndication sales, Two and a half Men is coming open for cable. Closer is available for both cable and weekend syndication. Old Christine is going into syndication. So we have all those things in the pipeline. We do not have the same level of restructuring charges that we had last year in 2009. So while the comps are tough for the second half, we do expect another strong year in terms of profits. So I hope I gave you enough of a view there.

I think from an absolute net debt level, as I said, we've closed in considerably towards our stated target. But if you look at the capital structure break out between debt and cash, I would say all other things being equal, we'd probably have more cash than we need at this moment in time, roughly about $5 billion at the end of March. That is substantially down, however, from the nearly $10 billion that we had just about a year ago when we completed the Time Warner Cable spin. So I don't want you to think that we haven't already been working hard on it. And we're going to continue to evaluate the alternative uses of cash relative to opportunities that may present themselves over time. But having said that, hopefully, you all can see that we are dedicated to returning capital to shareholders. That is one of levers at our disposal. We believe direct returns should be a very significant component of our total return. In 2009, for example, we returned over 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders, and we increased the dividend more than 13% this year already. Our dividend yield, I think right now is sitting somewhere around 2.5x. I think that's 2x to 3x higher than most of our peers. And we have an ongoing share repurchase program. So we're on track to return more capital this year than we did last year. And as I said, that's one of the levers. We'll continue to evaluate the absolute level of that going forward."

We normally, as you all know, don't comment on potential deals. And it's worth saying again that we feel very comfortable with our current strategic positioning and scale. So we don't need to do anything. Any deal that we do needs to provide strategic benefits after taking account of adequate execution risk and provide us an adequate risk-adjusted return in relation to alternatives that we have. So we have and we will continue to be very disciplined as we look at acquisitions. As you get to the question of MGM specifically, it could make sense but only at the right price to hit those hurdles I just mentioned. And I think it's fair for us to point out, we've walked away from this asset before when it didn't meet those criteria. We're well aware of the question of the wisdom and what you need to have as positives in order to put more capital into the Film business beyond what we're already doing in Production. As you know, we've got a pretty robust Production business going, both on the TV and the Film side. We're already scale. So we don't need to increase capital into the business. But having said all that, if there's a compelling opportunity for returns and strategic enhancement that presents itself and if MGM would fit that given the success we've got and the kind of distribution lineup we can add some of those assets to, we're averse to putting capital to work if, again, we get what we have to be pretty confident is a strong return.

On the question of a structural partnership of some kind",634,"Let me give you what we can say about structural change, whether it's with CBS or any other network on news, and then talk about the CNN general economics, which are much better than people realize. On the question of a structural partnership of some kind [ph]  (38:00), it's no secret that we talked to other news organizations in the past, basically about taking the advantage of CNN's efficiency and quality in newsgathering and alleviating the cost problems that the broadcast news operations have. We've got capability, global reach and some real economies of scale in newsgathering that the old broadcast news operations don't have. So we have long been in discussions with, really, all of the candidates to see if there's a way to create rationale improvements for both parties. We can't and don't have any -- we don't have anything definitive to tell you about that now. But in your question on the motivation, it's not because of a CNN issue, it's really more because of imperatives at the broadcast news companies. CNN has very strong financial performance. It's the fastest earnings growth in the Turner's network portfolio over the last five years, and we expect another record year of earnings this year at CNN. And so the thing that gets a lot of attention is the ratings. Let me just say, we're not happy with the current ratings. We're working to fix that while remaining committed to non-partisan journalism. But for perspective, the ratings, while they have a decent amount of importance, were increasingly selling broader product than the competition can match. There's a premium brand at CNN that expresses itself financially in our CPM advantage, selling ads, and in our carriage piece to affiliates. CNN also still has the biggest reach, more viewers turning in. The issue really is, that our viewers, even though there are more of them, they tune in for shorter periods. And so what we need to work on is making the news broadcast more compelling, to increase the time spent viewing. There's huge success going on right now on the viewing side in Multiplatform; in other words, CNN online [cnn.com] and CNN International. So as we perfectly intend to improve the ratings, that'll be good, and it will help. But there's a lot of financial strength at CNN that essentially puts us in a pretty good position, offering a solution to the cost problems and the profit squeeze that go on in network news. You had a question on Netflix and Redbox. We're pretty pleased with the recent Netflix and Redbox agreements. And keep in mind, remember that I said, 75% of the DVD sell-through occurs in the first four weeks. So those deals kick in after that. Still pretty early, but the results indicate that, that strategy is working. Two major releases have come out from Warner's since those deals were completed with Netflix and Redbox; The Blind Side was one, Sherlock Holmes was the other. We think that the results for both have benefited from the delayed rental window in terms of holding up the higher-priced first month and then providing an efficient buy [ph] (41:20) for consumers at Netflix, Redbox in the second month. And don't forget the joint cable studio marketing programs driving [ph] (41:29) VOD is underway. And as VOD gets more important, that's going to be a bigger part of this equation, not just the kiosk and mail delivery of films. As far as we know, others studios are following our lead and have now entered into similar 28-day window deals, couple of them in the last quarter. So it seems to us that the structure is getting put into place in a very reasonable way for consumers and in a way that optimizes economics for the production studios."

First, just to go back and begin, with slightly repeating what I said already, we had a great quarter in home video against the backdrop of a down macro environment. Although the macro environment there even seems to be stabilizing somewhat. And if you think about the trends in that business, the trends that we experienced last year are continuing into this year, which is that we're seeing decline or a more challenged environment, physical and very, very strong growth in the newer formats, including Blu-ray, as well as Digital. And so for us, just to give you some context in the quarter, our EST [electronic sell-through] revenues were up 29% year-over-year. And VOD, because I think you had a VOD borrowing [ph] (44:17) question, those were up 40%. And in sum -- and I think we're number one share in VOD, and in part, I think it relates to the day-and-date strategy that we've been employing now for some time. So we're quite pleased. It's one of the reason quarters why Warner's got out in the lead, and we're going to continue to drive leadership to grow these new digital revenue streams. And as we've been saying now for a considerable amount of time, on a like-for-like basis, every digital transaction for us means more money to the studio than the comparable physical transaction. So we see the benefit going forward by continuing to drive those revenue streams. In terms of the ad, I think you asked for me to repeat the advertising growth rates. Overall, 9%, it was low double-digit growth at the domestic entertainment networks and strong growth internationally. Internationally was a combination of very strong organic growth of about mid-teens, coupled with some acquisitions that we've made coming online for the first time in the quarter. That represented -- the impact to the acquisitions alone represented somewhere around 200 basis points to the overall growth numbers. So hopefully that helps."

And I think as the advertiser categories come back, we think we can add something there. Because we have adult swim at night, we really ought to mention because it's the other part of that equation, the Adult Swim network, which has the leading 18 to 34-year-old.

And the reason is, you had big declines in retail shelf space last year due to some of the bankruptcies of the retail distributors that came about during the economic downturn. And there was less retail foot traffic also cyclical due to the downturn. If you then put to that and say, is that right, prove it, basically, as we look at our company as the leader, we were up in DVD in a down market. So that has more to do with some of the timing and slate mix-based things. We had stronger titles. We had a larger number of releases. And so as you work that through the various studios of the industry as a whole, you end up with a fair number of cyclical effects in addition to the downturn, not just secular ones. But the category is still a little challenged on the secular side. We've seen the sell-through decline moderating in the quarter. Sell-through was up in March. The falloff in rental seemed to be caused, as I said, by store closings, that's diminishing or moderating. And digital, not physical, but digital home video has remained strong. VOD transaction increased more than physical rental transactions decreased. And Blu-ray and electronic sell-through were continuing strong. So we basically think if everybody, and Warner's going to do this, continue to execute on the strategy, grow the higher-margin formats of high-def, VOD and electronic sell-through and try to improve the rental economies with the discount kiosk and mail order businesses in the right place, tightly manage the cost base and focus on tent poles that have been outperforming, really, across all of these home video methods. That seems to be the answer, and we think that'll lead to an uptrend, not a down trend."

As you all know, we'll be talking with you at length in a few weeks at our investor meeting, so I'll keep it fairly brief today. It was a great quarter for us and a great start to the year. We po",1071,"Thanks, Doug. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. As you all know, we'll be talking with you at length in a few weeks at our investor meeting, so I'll keep it fairly brief today. It was a great quarter for us and a great start to the year. We posted our best revenue growth in almost two years and the most profitable quarter in our history. Our margins were up across the company, driving adjusted operating income up almost 40% and adjusted earnings per share climbed over 60%. Remember that's off a big increase last year. 
So it was a record quarter fueled by a healthy advertising environment, strong performance of our content and continued cost controls. Even though there's still uncertainty about the health of the economy, we're seeing demand come back across key advertising categories at both our Networks and our publishing company. Last quarter had Turner scatter pricing was 20% to 30% above the upfront and it remains strong in the second quarter, including right now, as we go out in the quarter. Our ratings are not yet where we want them to be at all of Turner's Networks, but we've made some real progress lately, particularly at TNT, where ratings were up in the quarter. truTV continues to deliver great numbers, placing it among the top 10 cable networks in prime time for the first time. And we see trends at TBS improving as the year progresses. Ratings do remain down at CNN and we're working to fix that. 
With all that said, Turner posted very strong Advertising growth in the quarter, up 9%. This performance was a testament to the strength of our brands, the quality of the sales force and our ability to take advantage of the favorable environment. 
At Time Inc., advertising rose 5%. It was the first quarter of ad growth in more than two years. Our film content is also delivering. Warner Bros. posted its eighth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income growth, driven by strong home video and theatrical releases like The Blind Side, Sherlock Holmes and Valentine's Day. After the quarter ended, we released Clash of the Titans, which exceeded our expectations passing $400 million at the global box office. That also underscored consumers' healthy appetite for 3D. We recently announced that all of our future event films, our superhero titles and special effects-driven releases will be produced in 3D. And this year, that will apply to four more films, including the next installment of Harry Potter and soon to be a legend, a new title called, the Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole. I hope that becomes familiar to all of you in the future.
Beyond 3D, we're enthusiastic about the rest of this year's movie slate. And we're confident that we'll have another strong pick-up season in our TV and Production business at this year's upfront. We're moving slightly but staying with our content. This quarter, HBO premiered The Pacific, a 10-part miniseries that's the companion piece to Band of Brothers. It debuted to outstanding critical acclaim and is now averaging 9 million viewers per episode. In addition to our operational performance, we also made important strategic progress. As you know, in terms of our long-term goals, we'd basically got four key goals: First, leverage our scale and brands to deliver compelling content; second, develop business models that benefit both consumers and our economics; third, expand internationally; and fourth, maintain a relentless focus on cost and capital efficiency. 
Here are some examples. Two weeks ago, Turner and CBS reached a deal with the NCAA to secure the exclusive U.S. television online and mobile rights March Madness for the next 14 years. Over time, 65% of the programming from NCAA, including the Final Four and the championship game will be on our networks. In today's TV marketplace, this kind of marquee must-have programming is absolutely critical. It's a game changer for Turner and it will dramatically increase the appeal of TNT, TBS and truTV with viewers, advertisers and affiliates. And we'll achieve all that for what we consider to be a relatively modest annual cost, which is locked in over a very long period of time.
Also in April, we signed a deal to bring Conan O'Brien to TBS, starts this November. That step will help cement TBS' position as TV's number one comedy network. With Conan, George Lopez and the strength of Adult Swim, Turner will essentially own late-night television. When we combine all that with all of our other great programming and the strength of our brand, it makes us very optimistic heading into this year's upfront. We're also looking for ways to develop business models that are good for consumers and good for us. Warner Bros. recently reached agreements with Netflix and Redbox that established a 28-day window between our home video releases and their availability through these distributors. And through these deals, they should have enough product to satisfy their customers. While at the same time, we expect to increase demand for DVD sale-through and Video-on-Demand.
Keep in mind that we typically sell 75% of our DVDs in those first four weeks after release. And VOD carries much higher margins for us than other rental outlets. In a similar vein, in February, HBO launched its online video offering called HBO Go. On Verizon's file service, HBO Go is a great example of our TV Everywhere initiative to providing 600 hours of on-demand programming to HBO subscribers on demand on their broadband devices at no additional cost.
Turning to our international expansion, this quarter we brought out our partners at HBO Central Europe and we increased our stake in HBO Latin America to more than 80%. These steps give us greater economic exposure to these fast-growing businesses. We'll also be able to rollout product extensions in these regions and expand in additional territories more aggressively.
So wrapping up, we achieved a lot in just the last few months. I'm increasingly confident about our how we're positioned for the remainder of this year and the years beyond that. We're looking forward to talking more with you about this, our strategy, our competitive position and our growth opportunities in depth across our businesses in the next couple of weeks from now. I think the more you know about Time Warner, the more you'll share in our confidence. With that, I'll turn it over to John.

As usual, there are slides available on our website that I will refer to during my prepared remarks. And getting right in to it beginning on the first slide, which contains some highlights for the quarter, you can see from the highlights that we're off to a great start to the year. As the operating environment improves, we're seeing the benefits from both the business investments we've made and the cost-savings initiatives we've put in place over the past couple of years. 
During the first quarter, we saw very healthy top line revenue trends and we maintained focus on costs. That led to very strong adjusted operating income growth, meaningful margin expansion of 500 basis points and more than 60% adjusted EPS growth. The first quarter had the highest revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008 and adjusted operating income increased 37%. That's better frankly than we expected going into the quarter. And while some of these outperformance was due to timing, as Jeff described, much of it was due to a better-than-expected advertising environment, terrific film slate performance and ongoing cost controls. 
Free cash flow, which is typically strong for us in the first quarter was also up over last year. And we returned over $750 million in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. So just a terrific start to the year and I'd ask you to move to the next slide, which shows our consolidated income statement highlights. 
Revenues were up 5%. Subscription revenues continue to be a very consistent growth drivers for us, up 7% and Advertising was up 8% in the quarter. This is the first quarter of Advertising growth at Time Warner since the third quarter of 2008, and it represented a significant improvement from the 8% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income was up nearly $400 million in the quarter. As I said, margins climbed 500 basis points, they expanded across all four of our operating divisions, reaching the highest levels ever for our company.
Operating expenses declined modestly, as compared to the first quarter of last year and that was due to, as I mentioned, all of the cost initiatives that we put in place, as well as some favorable timing, primarily in our program expenses, and I'll speak to that in a couple of moments. 
Turning next to our segment highlights. And we're going to begin at our Networks division where we had our highest quarterly profit ever at this division, more than $1.1 billion. That's up 22% over last year. Both Turner and HBO saw growth of adjusted operating income well into the double digits year-over-year. 
Advertising grew 9% and here, our Domestic Entertainment Networks grew advertising in the low-double digits and international was also up significantly. And these more than offset declines at domestic news. The improvement at our domestic entertainment networks was due primarily to very strong scatter pricing and yield management. And underlying growth at our international networks was in the mid-teens. Our international results also included the impact from several transactions, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to total Advertising growth in the quarter. And these are transactions that we expect strong growth from in the future. Looking ahead, scatter pricing remains vibrant, still up better than 20% over the upfront and we expect continued strong advertising growth into the second quarter. Subscription revenues grew 7%, and that reflects higher rates at both Turner and HBO, as well as international growth and expansion.
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter and margins expanded 400 basis points year-over-year to 39%. Total expenses were only up modestly here with programming cost down slightly. A quick note in margins, keep in mind that margins typically decline sequentially for us in the second quarter when we realize a meaningful proportion of annual sports rights amortization. I'll also point out that investing in high-quality content remains a critical part of our strategy. Based on our original programming schedule, we plan for programming expenses to be up in both the second quarter and the full year. But to be clear, we fully expect margins at our Networks division to expand for the full year 2010 versus 2009. So that's good. But we wouldn't expect a similar level margin expansion for the rest of the year that we saw in the first quarter.
Moving to our Film division. Warner Bros. once again, had a great start to the year and a great quarter. Operating income was up 43%. Warner Bros. took advantage of healthy box office trends and maintained its number one position in home video across every format. Despite some continuing challenges in the broader Home Video category, our Home Video revenue was up 34% due to stronger titles, including The Blindside and Sherlock Holmes, as well as more releases. Last year, we had only five title releases and that compared to 10 titles released this year in the first quarter. 
Margin trends at the studio remained positive with margins up to 300 basis points over last year. Looking ahead, the theatrical performance of Clash and (sic) [of] the Titans, as Jeff said, has already exceeded our own expectations, and we're very optimistic about the rest of this year's release slate includes Sex and the City 2, Inception, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. And we're confident we'll have another great TV pilot season. We also have a significant pipeline of syndication revenue going in later this year, as well as several exciting video game releases including two new LEGO titles. 
Moving on now to Publishing. Time Inc.'s ad revenues improved nicely in the quarter, up 5%. This is the first quarter of advertising growth in this division since the fourth quarter of 2007. So it's quite encouraging as it's been a while since we've been up in advertising. Time Inc.'s top seven advertiser categories were all up. And that was led by Domestic Auto, Beauty and Financial. And online revenues were up more than 20% here in the quarter. 
Looking across Time Inc.'s three operating units, our Style and Entertainment unit was again our strongest performer. It grew advertising double digits led by strong growth at People, Entertainment Weekly and In Style. Trends at the Lifestyle and News units also improved with total ad revenues for both up modestly in the quarter.
Looking ahead, train advertising trends remain positive into the second quarter, and we once again expect total advertising to be up here in Q2. Subscription revenues improved modestly year-over-year, largely as a result of some favorable foreign currency translation. Domestic circulation trends, however, do remain somewhat challenged. 
Total expenses at Time Inc. were down almost $90 million in the quarter over last year. That reflects continued cost savings initiatives that were put into place at the end of last year, as well as lower marketing and pension expenses. As you know, we have moved very aggressively at this business to rightsize the cost base during the economic downturn, and we absolutely expect cost to remain lower than they were last year in this division for the remainder of 2010.
Let me move to the next slide, which contains our new updated outlook. And here, our current forecasts reflect more optimism versus where we were at the beginning of the year, so that's good. As you saw on our release, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to grow at least mid-teens over the base of $1.83. We think this updated outlook may prove to be conservative in the fullness of time. And it's not like we're seeing anything bad out there. But we're mindful that it's still early in the year. And as we look ahead, visibility in advertising remains somewhat limited and that's a macro-environment point. We do have a number of big film releases ahead of us. And as I mentioned just a minute ago, we don't expect the same degree of market expansion at our Networks division for the full year as we saw in the first quarter. 
But all in all, we remain extremely encouraged by both the improving macroeconomic environment and the trends there, as well as our own a strong operating performance. We think 2010 will prove to be another year of strong growth at Time Warner. And as Jeff mentioned, we're growing off of what was a record year of profits in 2009, so that makes us somewhat unique.
Lastly, I'll finish up with a brief look at our free cash flow and our capital plan. Focusing on free cash flow, we delivered $1.3 billion in the quarter. That's also a very strong start to the year for us. The first quarter is typically strong. But we were up nearly 20% against the strong first quarter we had last year. Free cash flow grew due to the underlying growth in adjusted operating income, as well as lower capital spending. And that was somewhat offset by an increase in working capital, higher cash and interest expense and higher cash taxes. I would note that capital spending was only $89 million in the quarter, that's down 12%. And capital spending represents only 1.4% of our revenues.
The last slide is a net debt roll forward. We ended the quarter with about $11.5 billion in net debt. That's flat compared to the end of 2009. In the quarter, free cash flow generation was offset by the nearly $500 million in investment and acquisition spending and continued direct returns to shareholders. The significant majority of our acquisition spending in the quarter or about 90% of it was on international cable networks and video game developers. This is consistent with our continued focus on tuck-in opportunities in cable networks and video game companies with a lot of them occurring outside of the U.S. 
Coming into the year, we laid out for you our balance sheet priorities, and so far, we are right on track to achieve all of them. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to strengthen their competitive positions and drive long-term growth, and I don't see any better example than that than our recent commitment to NCAA. Second, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet by reducing cash balances over time and carefully managing our debt maturities. And during the quarter, hopefully, you saw that we took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment. And we extended debt maturities of close to $2 billion, while also the same time, reducing ongoing interest costs. 
Third, we're making an even greater commitment to provide direct returns to stockholders, and this was evident through our increased regular dividend, which we announced last quarter, as well as ongoing share repurchases. As I mentioned earlier during the quarter, we returned over $750 million to shareholders, including over $500 million in share repurchases. And that's fairly consistent with our pace from each of the prior two quarters. We also believe it's important to maintain a strategic flexibility, our leverage ratio today is about two times, which is closer but still somewhat shy of our long-term target of 2.5x. And for now, we continue to remain comfortable operating at levels that are a little bit low than our stated target leverage, as we believe a strong balance sheet is a real competitive advantage. So that concludes my prepared remarks. And we'd be happy to -- I'll return the call over to Doug. We'd be happy to open up for Q&A.

But having gotten off to such a great start with Sherlock Holmes, Valentine's Day and Clash of the Titans, we still have very high hopes for the remainder of 2010. And as John mentioned, with the kind of potential in releases is like Sex and the City 2, Inception, which could be a big film due date, Legend of the Guardians and then Harry Potter. There's a lot in the pipeline. So on the high side, if that does very well, we can have a very strong year. And then we will also benefit this year from some television syndication sales, Two and a half Men is coming open for cable. Closer is available for both cable and weekend syndication. Old Christine is going into syndication. So we have all those things in the pipeline. We do not have the same level of restructuring charges that we had last year in 2009. So while the comps are tough for the second half, we do expect another strong year in terms of profits. So I hope I gave you enough of a view there. But there is some variability possible on the upside and on the flatter side, depending how these big titles perform.

I think from an absolute net debt level, as I said, we've closed in considerably towards our stated target. But if you look at the capital structure break out between debt and cash, I would say all other things being equal, we'd probably have more cash than we need at this moment in time, roughly about $5 billion at the end of March. That is substantially down, however, from the nearly $10 billion that we had just about a year ago when we completed the Time Warner Cable spin. So I don't want you to think that we haven't already been working hard on it. And we're going to continue to evaluate the alternative uses of cash relative to opportunities that may present themselves over time. But having said that, hopefully, you all can see that we are dedicated to returning capital to shareholders. That is one of levers at our disposal. We believe direct returns should be a very significant component of our total return. In 2009, for example, we returned over 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders, and we increased the dividend more than 13% this year already. Our dividend yield, I think right now is sitting somewhere around 2.5x. I think that's 2x to 3x higher than most of our peers. And we have an ongoing share repurchase program. So we're on track to return more capital this year than we did last year. And as I said, that's one of the levers. We'll continue to evaluate the absolute level of that going forward.

We normally, as you all know, don't comment on potential deals. And it's worth saying again that we feel very comfortable with our current strategic positioning and scale. So we don't need to do anything. Any deal that we do needs to provide strategic benefits after taking account of adequate execution risk and provide us an adequate risk-adjusted return in relation to alternatives that we have. So we have and we will continue to be very disciplined as we look at acquisitions. As you get to the question of MGM specifically, it could make sense but only at the right price to hit those hurdles I just mentioned. And I think it's fair for us to point out, we've walked away from this asset before when it didn't meet those criteria. We're well aware of the question of the wisdom and what you need to have as positives in order to put more capital into the Film business beyond what we're already doing in Production. As you know, we've got a pretty robust Production business going, both on the TV and the Film side. We're already scale. So we don't need to increase capital into the business. But having said all that, if there's a compelling opportunity for returns and strategic enhancement that presents itself and if MGM would fit that given the success we've got and the kind of distribution lineup we can add some of those assets to, we're averse to putting capital to work if, again, we get what we have to be pretty confident is a strong return. So we really can't say more. I know I've said a lot there about MGM. And the reason I said a lot is so we don't keep getting asked about it.

On the question of a structural partnership of some kind",634,"Let me give you what we can say about structural change, whether it's with CBS or any other network on news, and then talk about the CNN general economics, which are much better than people realize. On the question of a structural partnership of some kind [ph]  (38:00), it's no secret that we talked to other news organizations in the past, basically about taking the advantage of CNN's efficiency and quality in newsgathering and alleviating the cost problems that the broadcast news operations have. We've got capability, global reach and some real economies of scale in newsgathering that the old broadcast news operations don't have. So we have long been in discussions with, really, all of the candidates to see if there's a way to create rationale improvements for both parties. We can't and don't have any -- we don't have anything definitive to tell you about that now. But in your question on the motivation, it's not because of a CNN issue, it's really more because of imperatives at the broadcast news companies. CNN has very strong financial performance. It's the fastest earnings growth in the Turner's network portfolio over the last five years, and we expect another record year of earnings this year at CNN. And so the thing that gets a lot of attention is the ratings. Let me just say, we're not happy with the current ratings. We're working to fix that while remaining committed to non-partisan journalism. But for perspective, the ratings, while they have a decent amount of importance, were increasingly selling broader product than the competition can match. There's a premium brand at CNN that expresses itself financially in our CPM advantage, selling ads, and in our carriage piece to affiliates. CNN also still has the biggest reach, more viewers turning in. The issue really is, that our viewers, even though there are more of them, they tune in for shorter periods. And so what we need to work on is making the news broadcast more compelling, to increase the time spent viewing. There's huge success going on right now on the viewing side in Multiplatform; in other words, CNN online [cnn.com] and CNN International. So as we perfectly intend to improve the ratings, that'll be good, and it will help. But there's a lot of financial strength at CNN that essentially puts us in a pretty good position, offering a solution to the cost problems and the profit squeeze that go on in network news. You had a question on Netflix and Redbox. We're pretty pleased with the recent Netflix and Redbox agreements. And keep in mind, remember that I said, 75% of the DVD sell-through occurs in the first four weeks. So those deals kick in after that. Still pretty early, but the results indicate that, that strategy is working. Two major releases have come out from Warner's since those deals were completed with Netflix and Redbox; The Blind Side was one, Sherlock Holmes was the other. We think that the results for both have benefited from the delayed rental window in terms of holding up the higher-priced first month and then providing an efficient buy [ph] (41:20) for consumers at Netflix, Redbox in the second month. And don't forget the joint cable studio marketing programs driving [ph] (41:29) VOD is underway. And as VOD gets more important, that's going to be a bigger part of this equation, not just the kiosk and mail delivery of films. As far as we know, others studios are following our lead and have now entered into similar 28-day window deals, couple of them in the last quarter. So it seems to us that the structure is getting put into place in a very reasonable way for consumers and in a way that optimizes economics for the production studios.

First, just to go back and begin, with slightly repeating what I said already, we had a great quarter in home video against the backdrop of a down macro environment. Although the macro environment there even seems to be stabilizing somewhat. And if you think about the trends in that business, the trends that we experienced last year are continuing into this year, which is that we're seeing decline or a more challenged environment, physical and very, very strong growth in the newer formats, including Blu-ray, as well as Digital. And so for us, just to give you some context in the quarter, our EST [electronic sell-through] revenues were up 29% year-over-year. And VOD, because I think you had a VOD borrowing [ph] (44:17) question, those were up 40%. And in sum -- and I think we're number one share in VOD, and in part, I think it relates to the day-and-date strategy that we've been employing now for some time. So we're quite pleased. It's one of the reason quarters why Warner's got out in the lead, and we're going to continue to drive leadership to grow these new digital revenue streams. And as we've been saying now for a considerable amount of time, on a like-for-like basis, every digital transaction for us means more money to the studio than the comparable physical transaction. So we see the benefit going forward by continuing to drive those revenue streams. In terms of the ad, I think you asked for me to repeat the advertising growth rates. Overall, 9%, it was low double-digit growth at the domestic entertainment networks and strong growth internationally. Internationally was a combination of very strong organic growth of about mid-teens, coupled with some acquisitions that we've made coming online for the first time in the quarter. That represented -- the impact to the acquisitions alone represented somewhere around 200 basis points to the overall growth numbers. So hopefully that helps.

And the design changes that we've now implemented, and we're actually changing somewhat even though our approach towards managing the plan assets, our goal would be to make as few future contributions into the pension plan as possible, almost making it down to zero. So we're hoping to manage the liability going forward through plan asset performance. And so yes, if you look back at the amount of pension contributions we've had to make over the last five years, it's considerable. It's in the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. We would hope, and we wouldn't anticipate having to do any of that going forward.

And TV programming is a significant component of that. So what we had said is, that we expect for the full year, and this remains true, that our overall programming costs should be up in the neighborhood of mid single digits for the year, and that includes all programming across all networks and include sports. So given just the math, our programming costs were down in Q1. We would expect and you should expect that they're going to go up for the remainder of the year.

And the reason is, you had big declines in retail shelf space last year due to some of the bankruptcies of the retail distributors that came about during the economic downturn. And there was less retail foot traffic also cyclical due to the downturn. If you then put to that and say, is that right, prove it, basically, as we look at our company as the leader, we were up in DVD in a down market. So that has more to do with some of the timing and slate mix-based things. We had stronger titles. We had a larger number of releases. And so as you work that through the various studios of the industry as a whole, you end up with a fair number of cyclical effects in addition to the downturn, not just secular ones. But the category is still a little challenged on the secular side. We've seen the sell-through decline moderating in the quarter. Sell-through was up in March. The falloff in rental seemed to be caused, as I said, by store closings, that's diminishing or moderating. And digital, not physical, but digital home video has remained strong. VOD transaction increased more than physical rental transactions decreased. And Blu-ray and electronic sell-through were continuing strong. So we basically think if everybody, and Warner's going to do this, continue to execute on the strategy, grow the higher-margin formats of high-def, VOD and electronic sell-through and try to improve the rental economies with the discount kiosk and mail order businesses in the right place, tightly manage the cost base and focus on tent poles that have been outperforming, really, across all of these home video methods. That seems to be the answer, and we think that'll lead to an uptrend, not a down trend.

As you all know, we'll be talking with you at length in a few weeks at our investor meeting, so I'll keep it fairly brief today. It was a great quarter for us and a great start to the year. We posted our best revenue growth in almost two years and the most profitable quarter in our history. Our margins were up across the company, driving adjusted operating income up almost 40% and adjusted earnings per share climbed over 60%. Remember that's off a big increase last year. 
So it was a record quarter fueled by a healthy advertising environment, strong performance of our content and continued cost controls. Even though there's still uncertainty about the health of the economy, we're seeing demand come back across key advertising categories at both our Networks and our publishing company. Last quarter had Turner scatter pricing was 20% to 30% above the upfront and it remains strong in the second quarter, including right now, as we go out in the quarter. Our ratings are not yet where we want them to be at all of Turner's Networks, but we've made some real progress lately, particularly at TNT, where ratings were up in the quarter. truTV continues to deliver great numbers, placing it among the top 10 cable networks in prime time for the first time. And we see trends at TBS improving as the year progresses. Ratings do remain down at CNN and we're working to fix that. 
With all that said, Turner posted very strong Advertising growth in the quarter, up 9%. This performance was a testament to the strength of our brands, the quality of the sales force and our ability to take advantage of the favorable environment. 
At Time Inc., advertising rose 5%. It was the first quarter of ad growth in more than two years. Our film content is also delivering. Warner Bros. posted its eighth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income growth, driven by strong home video and theatrical releases like The Blind Side, Sherlock Holmes and Valentine's Day. After the quarter ended, we released Clash of the Titans, which exceeded our expectations passing $400 million at the global box office. That also underscored consumers' healthy appetite for 3D. We recently announced that all of our future event films, our superhero titles and special effects-driven releases will be produced in 3D. And this year, that will apply to four more films, including the next installment of Harry Potter and soon to be a legend, a new title called, the Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole. I hope that becomes familiar to all of you in the future.
Beyond 3D, we're enthusiastic about the rest of this year's movie slate. And we're confident that we'll have another strong pick-up season in our TV and Production business at this year's upfront. We're moving slightly but staying with our content. This quarter, HBO premiered The Pacific, a 10-part miniseries that's the companion piece to Band of Brothers. It debuted to outstanding critical acclaim and is now averaging 9 million viewers per episode. In addition to our operational performance, we also made important strategic progress. As you know, in terms of our long-term goals, we'd basically got four key goals: First, leverage our scale and brands to deliver compelling content; second, develop business models that benefit both consumers and our economics; third, expand internationally; and fourth, maintain a relentless focus on cost and capital efficiency. 
Here are some examples. Two weeks ago, Turner and CBS reached a deal with the NCAA to secure the exclusive U.S. television online and mobile rights March Madness for the next 14 years. Over time, 65% of the programming from NCAA, including the Final Four and the championship game will be on our networks. In today's TV marketplace, this kind of marquee must-have programming is absolutely critical. It's a game changer for Turner and it will dramatically increase the appeal of TNT, TBS and truTV with viewers, advertisers and affiliates. And we'll achieve all that for what we consider to be a relatively modest annual cost, which is locked in over a very long period of time.
Also in April, we signed a deal to bring Conan O'Brien to TBS, starts this November. That step will help cement TBS' position as TV's number one comedy network. With Conan, George Lopez and the strength of Adult Swim, Turner will essentially own late-night television. When we combine all that with all of our other great programming and the strength of our brand, it makes us very optimistic heading into this year's upfront. We're also looking for ways to develop business models that are good for consumers and good for us. Warner Bros. recently reached agreements with Netflix and redbox that established a 28-day window between our home video releases and their availability through these distributors. And through these deals, they should have enough product to satisfy their customers. While at the same time, we expect to increase demand for DVD sale-through and Video-on-Demand.
Keep in mind that we typically sell 75% of our DVDs in those first four weeks after release. And VOD carries much higher margins for us than other rental outlets. In a similar vein, in February, HBO launched its online video offering called HBO GO on Verizon's FiOS service. HBO GO is a great example of our TV Everywhere initiative to providing 600 hours of on-demand programming to HBO subscribers on demand on their broadband devices at no additional cost.
Turning to our international expansion, this quarter we bought out our partners at HBO Central Europe and we increased our stake in HBO Latin America to more than 80%. These steps give us greater economic exposure to these fast-growing businesses. We'll also be able to rollout product extensions in these regions and expand in additional territories more aggressively.
So wrapping up, we achieved a lot in just the last few months. I'm increasingly confident about how we're positioned for the remainder of this year and the years beyond that. We're looking forward to talking more with you about this, our strategy, our competitive position and our growth opportunities in depth across our businesses in the next couple of weeks from now. I think the more you know about Time Warner, the more you'll share in our confidence. With that, I'll turn it over to John."

And getting right into it beginning on the first slide, which contains some highlights for the quarter. You could see from the h",1924,"Thanks, and good morning. As usual, there are slides available on our website that I will refer to during my prepared remarks. And getting right into it beginning on the first slide, which contains some highlights for the quarter. You could see from the highlights that we're off to a great start to the year. As the operating environment improves, we're seeing the benefits from both the business investments we've made and the cost-savings initiatives we've put in place over the past couple of years. 
During the first quarter, we saw very healthy top line revenue trends and we maintained focus on costs. That led to very strong adjusted operating income growth, meaningful margin expansion of 500 basis points and more than 60% adjusted EPS growth. The first quarter had the highest revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008 and adjusted operating income increased 37%. That's better frankly than we expected going into the quarter. And while some of these outperformance was due to timing, as Jeff described, much of it was due to a better-than-expected advertising environment, terrific film slate performance and ongoing cost controls. 
Free cash flow, which is typically strong for us in the first quarter was also up over last year. And we returned over $750 million in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. So just a terrific start to the year and I'd ask you to move to the next slide, which shows our consolidated income statement highlights. 
Revenues were up 5%. Subscription revenues continue to be a very consistent growth driver for us, up 7% and Advertising was up 8% in the quarter. This is the first quarter of Advertising growth at Time Warner since the third quarter of 2008, and it represented a significant improvement from the 8% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income was up nearly $400 million in the quarter. As I said, margins climbed 500 basis points. They expanded across all four of our operating divisions, reaching the highest levels ever for our company.
Operating expenses declined modestly as compared to the first quarter of last year, and that was due to, as I mentioned, all of the cost initiatives that we put in place, as well as some favorable timing, primarily in our programming expenses, and I'll speak to that in a couple of moments. 
Turning next to our segment highlights. And we're going to begin at our Networks division where we had our highest quarterly profit ever at this division, more than $1.1 billion. That's up 22% over last year. Both Turner and HBO saw growth of adjusted operating income well into the double digits year-over-year. 
Advertising grew 9% and here, our Domestic Entertainment Networks grew advertising in the low-double digits and international was also up significantly. And these more than offset declines at domestic news. The improvement at our domestic entertainment networks was due primarily to very strong scatter pricing and yield management. And underlying growth at our international networks was in the mid-teens. Our international results also included the impact from several transactions, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to total Advertising growth in the quarter. And these are transactions that we expect strong growth from in the future. Looking ahead, scatter pricing remains vibrant, still up better than 20% over the upfront and we expect continued strong advertising growth into the second quarter. Subscription revenues grew 7%, and that reflects higher rates at both Turner and HBO, as well as international growth and expansion.
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter and margins expanded 400 basis points year-over-year to 39%. Total expenses were only up modestly here with programming cost down slightly. A quick note in margins, keep in mind that margins typically decline sequentially for us in the second quarter when we realize a meaningful proportion of annual sports rights amortization. I'll also point out that investing in high-quality content remains a critical part of our strategy. Based on our original programming schedule, we plan for programming expenses to be up in both the second quarter and the full year. But to be clear, we fully expect margins at our Networks division to expand for the full year 2010 versus 2009. So that's good. But we wouldn't expect a similar level margin expansion for the rest of the year that we saw in the first quarter.
Moving to our Film division. Warner Bros. once again, had a great start to the year and a great quarter. Operating income was up 43%. Warner Bros. took advantage of healthy box office trends and maintained its number one position in home video across every format. Despite some continuing challenges in the broader Home Video category, our Home Video revenue was up 34% due to stronger titles, including The Blindside and Sherlock Holmes, as well as more releases. Last year, we had only five title releases and that compared to 10 titles released this year in the first quarter. 
Margin trends at the studio remained positive with margins up to 300 basis points over last year. Looking ahead, the theatrical performance of Clash and (sic) [of] the Titans, as Jeff said, has already exceeded our own expectations, and we're very optimistic about the rest of this year's release slate includes Sex and the City 2, Inception, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. And we're confident we'll have another great TV pilot season. We also have a significant pipeline of syndication revenue going in later this year, as well as several exciting video game releases including two new LEGO titles. 
Moving on now to Publishing. Time Inc.'s ad revenues improved nicely in the quarter, up 5%. This is the first quarter of advertising growth in this division since the fourth quarter of 2007. So it's quite encouraging as it's been a while since we've been up in advertising. Time Inc.'s top seven advertiser categories were all up. And that was led by Domestic Auto, Beauty and Financial. And online revenues were up more than 20% here in the quarter. 
Looking across Time Inc.'s three operating units, our Style and Entertainment unit was again our strongest performer. It grew advertising double digits led by strong growth at People, Entertainment Weekly and In Style. Trends at the Lifestyle and News units also improved with total ad revenues for both up modestly in the quarter.
Looking ahead, train advertising trends remain positive into the second quarter, and we once again expect total advertising to be up here in Q2. Subscription revenues improved modestly year-over-year, largely as a result of some favorable foreign currency translation. Domestic circulation trends, however, do remain somewhat challenged. 
Total expenses at Time Inc. were down almost $90 million in the quarter over last year. That reflects continued cost savings initiatives that were put into place at the end of last year, as well as lower marketing and pension expenses. As you know, we have moved very aggressively at this business to rightsize the cost base during the economic downturn, and we absolutely expect cost to remain lower than they were last year in this division for the remainder of 2010.
Let me move to the next slide, which contains our new updated outlook. And here, our current forecasts reflect more optimism versus where we were at the beginning of the year, so that's good. As you saw on our release, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to grow at least mid-teens over the base of $1.83. We think this updated outlook may prove to be conservative in the fullness of time. And it's not like we're seeing anything bad out there. But we're mindful that it's still early in the year. And as we look ahead, visibility in advertising remains somewhat limited and that's a macro-environment point. We do have a number of big film releases ahead of us. And as I mentioned just a minute ago, we don't expect the same degree of market expansion at our Networks division for the full year as we saw in the first quarter. 
But all in all, we remain extremely encouraged by both the improving macroeconomic environment and the trends there, as well as our own a strong operating performance. We think 2010 will prove to be another year of strong growth at Time Warner. And as Jeff mentioned, we're growing off of what was a record year of profits in 2009, so that makes us somewhat unique.
Lastly, I'll finish up with a brief look at our free cash flow and our capital plan. Focusing on free cash flow, we delivered $1.3 billion in the quarter. That's also a very strong start to the year for us. The first quarter is typically strong. But we were up nearly 20% against the strong first quarter we had last year. Free cash flow grew due to the underlying growth in adjusted operating income, as well as lower capital spending. And that was somewhat offset by an increase in working capital, higher cash and interest expense and higher cash taxes. I would note that capital spending was only $89 million in the quarter, that's down 12%. And capital spending represents only 1.4% of our revenues.
The last slide is a net debt roll forward. We ended the quarter with about $11.5 billion in net debt. That's flat compared to the end of 2009. In the quarter, free cash flow generation was offset by the nearly $500 million in investment and acquisition spending and continued direct returns to shareholders. The significant majority of our acquisition spending in the quarter or about 90% of it was on international cable networks and video game developers. This is consistent with our continued focus on tuck-in opportunities in cable networks and video game companies with a lot of them occurring outside of the U.S. 
Coming into the year, we laid out for you our balance sheet priorities, and so far, we are right on track to achieve all of them. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to strengthen their competitive positions and drive long-term growth, and I don't see any better example than that than our recent commitment to NCAA. Second, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet by reducing cash balances over time and carefully managing our debt maturities. And during the quarter, hopefully, you saw that we took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment. And we extended debt maturities of close to $2 billion, while also the same time, reducing ongoing interest costs. 
Third, we're making an even greater commitment to provide direct returns to stockholders, and this was evident through our increased regular dividend, which we announced last quarter, as well as ongoing share repurchases. As I mentioned earlier during the quarter, we returned over $750 million to shareholders, including over $500 million in share repurchases. And that's fairly consistent with our pace from each of the prior two quarters. We also believe it's important to maintain a strategic flexibility. Our leverage ratio today is about 2x, which is closer but still somewhat shy of our long-term target of 2.5x. And for now, we continue to remain comfortable operating at levels that are a little bit low than our stated target leverage, as we believe a strong balance sheet is a real competitive advantage. So that concludes my prepared remarks. And we'd be happy to -- I'll turn the call over to Doug. We'd be happy to open up for Q&A."

As you all know, Warner has had a tremendous year in 2009 leading the industry in everything: Box office, DVD, overseas, domestics, et cetera. So it's tough comps. But having gotten off to such a great start with Sherlock Holmes, Valentine's Day and Clash of the Titans, we still have very high hopes for the remainder of 2010. And as John mentioned, with the kind of potential in releases is like Sex and the City 2, Inception, which could be a big film due date, Legend of the Guardians and then Harry Potter. There's a lot in the pipeline. So on the high side, if that does very well, we can have a very strong year. And then we will also benefit this year from some television syndication sales, Two and a half Men is coming open for cable. Closer is available for both cable and weekend syndication. Old Christine is going into syndication. So we have all those things in the pipeline. We do not have the same level of restructuring charges that we had last year in 2009. So while the comps are tough for the second half, we do expect another strong year in terms of profits. So I hope I gave you enough of a view there. But there is some variability possible on the upside and on the flatter side, depending how these big titles perform."

I think from an absolute net debt level, as I said, we've closed in considerably towards our stated target. But if you look at the capital structure break out between debt and cash, I would say all other things being equal, we'd probably have more cash than we need at this moment in time, roughly about $5 billion at the end of March. That is substantially down, however, from the nearly $10 billion that we had just about a year ago when we completed the Time Warner Cable spin. So I don't want you to think that we haven't already been working hard on it. And we're going to continue to evaluate the alternative uses of cash relative to opportunities that may present themselves over time. But having said that, hopefully, you all can see that we are dedicated to returning capital to shareholders. That is one of levers at our disposal. We believe direct returns should be a very significant component of our total return. In 2009, for example, we returned over 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders, and we increased the dividend more than 13% this year already. Our dividend yield, I think right now is sitting somewhere around 2.5x. I think that's 2x to 3x higher than most of our peers. And we have an ongoing share repurchase program. So we're on track to return more capital this year than we did last year. And as I said, that's one of the levers. We'll continue to evaluate the absolute level of that going forward."

We normally, as you all know, don't comment on potential deals. And it's worth saying again that we feel very comfortable with our current strategic positioning and scale. So we don't need to do anything. Any deal that we do needs to provide strategic benefits after taking account of adequate execution risk and provide us an adequate risk-adjusted return in relation to alternatives that we have. So we have and we will continue to be very disciplined as we look at acquisitions. As you get to the question of MGM specifically, it could make sense but only at the right price to hit those hurdles I just mentioned. And I think it's fair for us to point out, we've walked away from this asset before when it didn't meet those criteria. We're well aware of the question of the wisdom and what you need to have as positives in order to put more capital into the Film business beyond what we're already doing in Production. As you know, we've got a pretty robust Production business going, both on the TV and the Film side. We're already scale. So we don't need to increase capital into the business. But having said all that, if there's a compelling opportunity for returns and strategic enhancement that presents itself and if MGM would fit that given the success we've got and the kind of distribution lineup we can add some of those assets to, we're averse to putting capital to work if, again, we get what we have to be pretty confident is a strong return. So we really can't say more. I know I've said a lot there about MGM. And the reason I said a lot is so we don't keep getting asked about it."

On the question of a structural partnership of some kind",630,"Let me give you what we can say about structural change, whether it's with CBS or any other network on news, and then talk about the CNN general economics, which are much better than people realize. On the question of a structural partnership of some kind [ph]  (38:00), it's no secret that we talked to other news organizations in the past, basically about taking the advantage of CNN's efficiency and quality in newsgathering and alleviating the cost problems that the broadcast news operations have. We've got capability, global reach and some real economies of scale in newsgathering that the old broadcast news operations don't have. So we have long been in discussions with, really, all of the candidates to see if there's a way to create rationale improvements for both parties. We can't and don't have any -- we don't have anything definitive to tell you about that now. But in your question on the motivation, it's not because of a CNN issue, it's really more because of imperatives at the broadcast news companies. CNN has very strong financial performance. It's the fastest earnings growth in the Turner's network portfolio over the last five years, and we expect another record year of earnings this year at CNN. And so the thing that gets a lot of attention is the ratings. Let me just say, we're not happy with the current ratings. We're working to fix that while remaining committed to non-partisan journalism. But for perspective, the ratings, while they have a decent amount of importance, were increasingly selling broader product than the competition can match. There's a premium brand at CNN that expresses itself financially in our CPM advantage, selling ads, and in our carriage piece to affiliates. CNN also still has the biggest reach, more viewers turning in. The issue really is, that our viewers, even though there are more of them, they tune in for shorter periods. And so what we need to work on is making the news broadcast more compelling, to increase the time spent viewing. There's huge success going on right now on the viewing side in Multiplatform; in other words, CNN online [cnn.com] and CNN International. So as we perfectly intend to improve the ratings, that'll be good, and it will help. But there's a lot of financial strength at CNN that essentially puts us in a pretty good position, offering a solution to the cost problems and the profit squeeze that go on in network news. You had a question on Netflix and redbox. We're pretty pleased with the recent Netflix and redbox agreements. And keep in mind, remember that I said, 75% of the DVD sell-through occurs in the first four weeks. So those deals kick in after that. Still pretty early, but the results indicate that, that strategy is working. Two major releases have come out from Warner's since those deals were completed with Netflix and redbox; The Blind Side was one, Sherlock Holmes was the other. We think that the results for both have benefited from the delayed rental window in terms of holding up the higher-priced first month and then providing an efficient buy for consumers at Netflix, redbox in the second month. And don't forget the joint cable studio marketing programs driving VOD is underway. And as VOD gets more important, that's going to be a bigger part of this equation, not just the kiosk and mail delivery of films. As far as we know, others studios are following our lead and have now entered into similar 28-day window deals, couple of them in the last quarter. So it seems to us that the structure is getting put into place in a very reasonable way for consumers and in a way that optimizes economics for the production studios."

First, just to go back and begin, with slightly repeating what I said already, we had a great quarter in home video against the backdrop of a down macro environment. Although the macro environment there even seems to be stabilizing somewhat. And if you think about the trends in that business, the trends that we experienced last year are continuing into this year, which is that we're seeing decline or a more challenged environment, physical and very, very strong growth in the newer formats, including Blu-ray, as well as Digital. And so for us, just to give you some context in the quarter, our EST [electronic sell-through] revenues were up 29% year-over-year. And VOD, because I think you had a VOD borrowing [ph] (44:17) question, those were up 40%. And in sum -- and I think we're number one share in VOD, and in part, I think it relates to the day-and-date strategy that we've been employing now for some time. So we're quite pleased. It's one of the reason why Warner's got out in the lead, and we're going to continue to drive leadership to grow these new digital revenue streams. And as we've been saying now for a considerable amount of time, on a like-for-like basis, every digital transaction for us means more money to the studio than the comparable physical transaction. So we see the benefit going forward by continuing to drive those revenue streams. In terms of the ad, I think you asked for me to repeat the advertising growth rates. Overall, 9%, it was low double-digit growth at the domestic entertainment networks and strong growth internationally. Internationally was a combination of very strong organic growth of about mid teens, coupled with some acquisitions that we've made coming online for the first time in the quarter. That represented -- the impact to the acquisitions alone represented somewhere around 200 basis points to the overall growth numbers. So hopefully that helps."

The kids market, generally, we think we're very well positioned. We unveiled some exciting new programming recently. You may not be familiar with it, but Adventure Time was number one on cable and broadcast for kids 6 to 11 and kids 2 to 11. And it was Cartoon Network's number one telecast of the year to date for kids of those two age groups, basically, 2 to 11. And then we have two significant new prime time live action shows, live action unveiled at the upfront, Tower Prep is one and Unnatural History is the other. So in terms of our Cartoon Net progress, we think there's some challenge in some categories like food and beverage advertisers, but we feel good about the programming. And I think as the advertiser categories come back, we think we can add something there. Because we have adult swim at night, we really ought to mention because it's the other part of that equation, the Adult Swim network, which has the leading 18 to 34-year-old. The audience is up 8% in 2009, it was up 13% in the first quarter of 10. So this is the number one network in that age group for the past five years and is holding still in that position for the first quarter. We think we're going to expand the block on adult swim by another hour in 2011. So that's essentially what we're trying to do to get that overall category supported."

That should have the impact of reducing volatility going forward by changing the plan designs of our post-retirement benefits and also have the added benefit of saving the company a considerable amount of money over time. This year, we expect pension expense to be down for two reasons. One is due to the design changes that I just mentioned, and that's somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million; and then also, we're just, year-over-year, we're pacing more favorably on pension expense because of the performance of the plan assets.

And TV programming is a significant component of that. So what we had said is, that we expect for the full year, and this remains true, that our overall programming costs should be up in the neighborhood of mid single digits for the year, and that includes all programming across all networks and include sports.

And the reason is, you had big declines in retail shelf space last year due to some of the bankruptcies of the retail distributors that came about during the economic downturn. And there was less retail foot traffic also cyclical due to the downturn. If you then put to that and say, is that right, prove it, basically, as we look at our company as the leader, we were up in DVD in a down market. So that has more to do with some of the timing and slate mix-based things. We had stronger titles. We had a larger number of releases. And so as you work that through the various studios of the industry as a whole, you end up with a fair number of cyclical effects in addition to the downturn, not just secular ones. But the category is still a little challenged on the secular side. We've seen the sell-through decline moderating in the quarter. Sell-through was up in March. The falloff in rental seemed to be caused, as I said, by store closings, that's diminishing or moderating. And digital, not physical, but digital home video has remained strong. VOD transaction increased more than physical rental transactions decreased. And Blu-ray and electronic sell-through were continuing strong. So we basically think if everybody, and Warner's going to do this, continue to execute on the strategy, grow the higher-margin formats of high-def, VOD and electronic sell-through and try to improve the rental economies with the discount kiosk and mail order businesses in the right place, tightly manage the cost base and focus on tent poles that have been outperforming, really, across all of these home video methods. That seems to be the answer, and we think that'll lead to an uptrend, not a down trend."

So it's all part of managing and optimizing the revenue. As you know, advertising was up more than our ratings, and there's plenty of things that we do in terms of the mix and management that creates that yield. I think the takeaway is two things, which is, if you have a really strong brand position and unique brand identity across a bunch of networks, and you have extremely strong sales force, which we do, you can then create very, very, sometimes surprisingly good, yield management."

We",1070,"Thanks, Doug. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. As you all know, we'll be talking with you at length in a few weeks at our investor meeting, so I'll keep it fairly brief today. 
It was a great quarter for us and a great start to the year. We posted our best revenue growth in almost two years and the most profitable quarter in our history. Our margins were up across the company, driving adjusted operating income up almost 40% and adjusted earnings per share climbed over 60%. Remember that's off a big increase last year. So it was a record quarter fueled by a healthy advertising environment, strong performance of our content and continued cost controls. 
Even though there's still uncertainty about the health of the economy, we're seeing demand come back across key advertising categories at both our Networks and in our publishing company. Last quarter at Turner, scatter pricing was 20% to 30% above the upfront, and it remains strong in the second quarter including right now as we go out in the quarter. 
Our ratings are not yet where we want them to be at all of Turner's Networks, but we've made some real progress lately, particularly at TNT where ratings were up in the quarter. truTV continues to deliver great numbers, placing it among the top 10 cable networks in prime time for the first time, and we see trends at TBS improving as the year progresses. Ratings do remain down at CNN, and we're working to fix that. 
With all that said, Turner posted very strong advertising growth in the quarter, up 9%. This performance was a testament to the strength of our brands, the quality of the sales force and our ability to take advantage of the favorable environment. At Time Inc., advertising rose 5%. It was the first quarter of ad growth in more than two years. 
Our film content is also delivering. Warner Bros. posted its eighth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income growth, driven by strong home video and theatrical releases like The Blind Side, Sherlock Holmes and Valentine's Day. After the quarter ended, we released Clash of the Titans, which exceeded our expectations passing $400 million at the global box office. That also underscored consumers' healthy appetite for 3D. We recently announced that all of our future event films, our superhero titles and special-effects-driven releases will be produced in 3D. And this year, that will apply to four more films, including the next installment of Harry Potter and soon to be a legend, a new title called, the Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole. I hope that becomes familiar to all of you in the future.
Beyond 3D, we're enthusiastic about the rest of this year's movie slate, and we're confident that we'll have another strong pick-up season in our TV and Production business at this year's upfront. We're moving slightly but staying with our content. This quarter, HBO premiered The Pacific, a 10-part miniseries that's the companion piece to Band of Brothers. It debuted to outstanding critical acclaim and is now averaging 9 million viewers per episode. 
In addition to our operational performance, we also made important strategic progress. As you know, in terms of our long-term goals, we basically got four key goals: First, leverage our scale and brands to deliver compelling content; second, develop business models that benefit both consumers and our economics; third, expand internationally; and fourth, maintain a relentless focus on cost and capital efficiency. 
Here are some examples. Two weeks ago, Turner and CBS reached a deal with the NCAA to secure the exclusive U.S. television online and mobile rights to March Madness for the next 14 years. Overtop, 65% of the programming from NCAA, including the Final Four and the championship game will be on our networks. 
In today's TV marketplace, this kind of marquee must-have programming is absolutely critical. It's a game changer for Turner, and it will dramatically increase the appeal of TNT, TBS and truTV with viewers, advertisers and affiliates, and we'll achieve all that for what we consider to be a relatively modest annual cost, which is locked in over a very long period of time.
Also in April, we signed a deal to bring Conan O'Brien to TBS, starts this November. That step will help cement TBS' position as TV's number one comedy network. With Conan, George Lopez and the strength of Adult Swim, Turner will essentially own late-night television. When we combine all that with all of our other great programming and the strength of our brand, it makes us very optimistic heading into this year's upfront. We're also looking for ways to develop business models that are good for consumers and good for us. Warner Bros. recently reached agreements with Netflix and redbox that established a 28-day window between our home video releases and their availability through these distributors. And through these deals, they should have enough product to satisfy their customers. While at the same time, we expect to increase demand for DVD sale-through and Video-on-Demand.
Keep in mind that we typically sell 75% of our DVDs in those first four weeks after release. And VOD carries much higher margins for us than other rental outlets. In a similar vein, in February, HBO launched its online video offering called HBO GO on Verizon's FiOS service. HBO GO is a great example of our TV Everywhere initiative to providing 600 hours of on-demand programming to HBO subscribers on demand on their broadband devices at no additional cost.
Turning to our international expansion, this quarter we bought out our partners at HBO Central Europe and we increased our stake in HBO Latin America to more than 80%. These steps give us greater economic exposure to these fast-growing businesses. We'll also be able to rollout product extensions in these regions and expand in additional territories more aggressively.
So wrapping up, we achieved a lot in just the last few months. I'm increasingly confident about how we're positioned for the remainder of this year and the years beyond that. We're looking forward to talking more with you about this, our strategy, our competitive position and our growth opportunities in depth across our businesses in the next couple of weeks from now. I think the more you know about Time Warner, the more you'll share in our confidence. With that, I'll turn it over to John."

As usual, there are slides available on our website that I will refer to during my prepared remarks. And getting right into it beginning on the first slide, which contains some highlights for the quarter. You could see from the highlights that we're off to a great start to the year. As the operating environment improves, we're seeing the benefits from both the business investments we've made and the cost-savings initiatives we've put in place over the past couple of years. 
During the first quarter, we saw very healthy top line revenue trends and we maintained focus on costs. That led to very strong adjusted operating income growth, meaningful margin expansion of 500 basis points and more than 60% adjusted EPS growth. The first quarter had the highest revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008 and adjusted operating income increased 37%. That's better frankly than we expected going into the quarter. And while some of these outperformance was due to timing, as Jeff described, much of it was due to a better-than-expected advertising environment, terrific film slate performance and ongoing cost controls. 
Free cash flow, which is typically strong for us in the first quarter was also up over last year. And we returned over $750 million in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. So just a terrific start to the year and I'd ask you to move to the next slide, which shows our consolidated income statement highlights. 
Revenues were up 5%. Subscription revenues continue to be a very consistent growth driver for us, up 7% and Advertising was up 8% in the quarter. This is the first quarter of Advertising growth at Time Warner since the third quarter of 2008, and it represented a significant improvement from the 8% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income was up nearly $400 million in the quarter. As I said, margins climbed 500 basis points. They expanded across all four of our operating divisions, reaching the highest levels ever for our company.
Operating expenses declined modestly as compared to the first quarter of last year, and that was due to, as I mentioned, all of the cost initiatives that we put in place as well as some favorable timing, primarily in our programming expenses, and I'll speak to that in a couple of moments. 
Turning next to our segment highlights, and we're going to begin at our Networks division where we had our highest quarterly profit ever at this division, more than $1.1 billion. That's up 22% over last year. Both Turner and HBO saw growth of adjusted operating income well into the double digits year-over-year. 
Advertising grew 9%, and here, our Domestic Entertainment Networks grew advertising in the low-double digits and international was also up significantly, and these more than offset declines at domestic news. The improvement at our domestic entertainment networks was due primarily to very strong scatter pricing and yield management, and underlying growth at our international networks was in the mid-teens. Our international results also included the impact from several transactions, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to total advertising growth in the quarter, and these are transactions that we expect strong growth from in the future. 
Looking ahead, scatter pricing remains vibrant, still up better than 20% over the upfront, and we expect continued strong advertising growth into the second quarter. Subscription revenues grew 7%, and that reflects higher rates at both Turner and HBO, as well as international growth and expansion.
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter, and margins expanded 400 basis points year-over-year to 39%. Total expenses were only up modestly here with programming cost down slightly. 
A quick note on margins. Keep in mind that margins typically decline sequentially for us in the second quarter when we realize a meaningful proportion of annual sports rights amortization. I'll also point out that investing in high-quality content remains a critical part of our strategy. Based on our original programming schedule, we plan for programming expenses to be up in both the second quarter and the full year. But to be clear, we fully expect margins at our Networks division to expand for the full year 2010 versus 2009. So that's good. But we wouldn't expect a similar level margin expansion for the rest of the year that we saw in the first quarter.
Moving to our Film division. Warner Bros. once again had a great start to the year and a great quarter. Operating income was up 43%. Warner Bros. took advantage of healthy box office trends and maintained its number one position in home video across every format. 
Despite some continuing challenges in the broader Home Video category, our Home Video revenue was up 34% due to stronger titles including The Blindside and Sherlock Holmes, as well as more releases. Last year, we had only five title releases, and that compared to 10 titles released this year in the first quarter. 
Margin trends at the studio remained positive with margins up 300 basis points over last year. Looking ahead, the theatrical performance of Clash and (sic) [of] the Titans, as Jeff said, has already exceeded our own expectations, and we're very optimistic about the rest of this year's release slate which include Sex and the City 2, Inception, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and we're confident we'll have another great TV pilot season. We also have a significant pipeline of syndication revenue going in later this year, as well as several exciting video game releases including two new LEGO titles. 
Moving on now to Publishing. Time Inc.'s ad revenues improved nicely in the quarter, up 5%. This is the first quarter of advertising growth in this division since the fourth quarter of 2007. So it's quite encouraging as it's been a while since we've been up in advertising. Time Inc.'s top seven advertiser categories were all up, and that was led by domestic auto, beauty and financial, and online revenues were up more than 20% here in the quarter. 
Looking across Time Inc.'s three operating units, our style and entertainment unit was again our strongest performer. It grew advertising double digits led by strong growth at People, Entertainment Weekly and In Style. Trends at the lifestyle and news units also improved, with total ad revenues for both up modestly in the quarter.
Looking ahead, print advertising trends remain positive into the second quarter, and we once again expect total advertising to be up here in Q2. Subscription revenues improved modestly year-over-year, largely as a result of some favorable foreign currency translation. Domestic circulation trends, however, do remain somewhat challenged. 
Total expenses at Time Inc. were down almost $90 million in the quarter over last year. That reflects continued cost savings initiatives that were put into place at the end of last year, as well as lower marketing and pension expenses. As you know, we have moved very aggressively at this business to rightsize the cost base during the economic downturn, and we absolutely expect cost to remain lower than they were last year in this division for the remainder of 2010.
Let me move to the next slide, which contains our new updated outlook. And here, our current forecasts reflect more optimism versus where we were at the beginning of the year, so that's good. As you saw on our release, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to grow at least mid-teens over the base of $1.83. We think this updated outlook may prove to be conservative in the fullness of time, and it's not like we're seeing anything bad out there, but we're mindful that it's still early in the year. And as we look ahead, visibility in advertising remains somewhat limited and that's a macro-environment point. We do have a number of big film releases ahead of us. And as I mentioned just a minute ago, we don't expect to see the same degree of margin expansion at our Networks division for the full year as we saw in the first quarter. 
But all in all, we remain extremely encouraged by both the improving macroeconomic environment and the trends there, as well as our own strong operating performance. We think 2010 will prove to be another year of strong growth at Time Warner. And as Jeff mentioned, we're growing off of what was a record year of profits in 2009, so that makes us somewhat unique.
Lastly, I'll finish up with a brief look at our free cash flow and our capital plan. Focusing on free cash flow, we delivered $1.3 billion in the quarter. That's also a very strong start to the year for us. The first quarter is typically strong, but we were up nearly 20% against the strong first quarter we had last year. 
Free cash flow grew due to the underlying growth in adjusted operating income, as well as lower capital spending, and that was somewhat offset by an increase in working capital, higher cash and interest expense and higher cash taxes. I would note that capital spending was only $89 million in the quarter, that's down 12%, and capital spending represents only 1.4% of our revenues.
The last slide is a net debt roll forward. We ended the quarter with about $11.5 billion in net debt. That's flat compared to the end of 2009. 
In the quarter, free cash flow generation was offset by the nearly $500 million in investment and acquisition spending and continued direct returns to shareholders. The significant majority of our acquisition spending in the quarter or about 90% of it was on international cable networks and video game developers. This is consistent with our continued focus on tuck-in opportunities in cable networks and video game companies with a lot of them occurring outside of the U.S. 
Coming into the year, we laid out for you our balance sheet priorities, and so far, we are right on track to achieve all of them. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to strengthen their competitive positions and drive long-term growth, and I don't see any better example of that than our recent commitment to the NCAA. 
Second, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet by reducing cash balances over time and carefully managing our debt maturities. And during the quarter, hopefully, you saw that we took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment, and we extended debt maturities of close to $2 billion, while also at the same time, reducing ongoing interest costs. 
Third, we're making an even greater commitment to provide direct returns to stockholders, and this was evident through our increased regular dividend which we announced last quarter, as well as ongoing share repurchases. As I mentioned earlier during the quarter, we returned over $750 million to shareholders including over $500 million in share repurchases, and that's fairly consistent with our pace from each of the prior two quarters. 
We also believe it's important to maintain a strategic flexibility. Our leverage ratio today is about 2x, which is closer but still somewhat shy of our long-term target of 2.5x. And for now, we continue to remain comfortable operating at levels that are a little bit low than our stated target leverage, as we believe a strong balance sheet is a real competitive advantage. 
So that concludes my prepared remarks. And we'd be happy to -- I'll turn the call over to Doug. We'd be happy to open up for Q&A."

But having gotten off to such a great start with Sherlock Holmes, Valentine's Day and Clash of the Titans, we still have very high hopes for the remainder of 2010. And as John mentioned, with the kind of potential in releases is like Sex and the City 2, Inception, which could be a big film due date, Legend of the Guardians and then Harry Potter. There is a lot in the pipeline. So on the high side, if that does very well, we can have a very strong year, and then we will also benefit this year from some television syndication sales, Two and a Half Men is coming open for cable. The Closer is available for both cable and weekend syndication. Old Christine is going into syndication. So we have all those things in the pipeline. We do not have the same level of restructuring charges that we had last year in 2009. So while the comps are tough for the second half, we do expect another strong year in terms of profits. So I hope I gave you enough of a view there. But there is some variability possible on the upside and on the flatter side, depending how these big titles perform."

I think from an absolute net debt level, as I said, we've closed in considerably towards our stated target. But if you look at the capital structure break out between debt and cash, I would say all other things being equal, we probably have more cash than we need at this moment in time, roughly about $5 billion at the end of March. That is substantially down, however, from the nearly $10 billion that we had just about a year ago when we completed the Time Warner Cable spin. So I don't want you to think that we haven't already been working hard on it. And we're going to continue to evaluate the alternative uses of cash relative to opportunities that may present themselves over time. But having said that, hopefully, you all can see that we are dedicated to returning capital to shareholders. That is one of the levers at our disposal. We believe direct returns should be a very significant component of our total return. In 2009, for example, we returned over 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders, and we increased the dividend more than 13% this year already. Our dividend yield, I think right now is sitting somewhere around 2.5x. I think that's 2 to 3x higher than most of our peers, and we have an ongoing share repurchase program. So we're on track to return more capital this year than we did last year. And as I said, that's one of the levers. We'll continue to evaluate the absolute level of that going forward."

So we don't need to do anything. Any deal that we do needs to provide strategic benefits after taking account of adequate execution risk and provide us an adequate risk-adjusted return in relation to alternatives that we have. So we have and we will continue to be very disciplined as we look at acquisitions. As you get to the question of MGM specifically, it could make sense but only at the right price to hit those hurdles I just mentioned. And I think it's fair for us to point out, we've walked away from this asset before when it didn't meet those criteria. We're well aware of the question of the wisdom and what you need to have as positives in order to put more capital into the Film business beyond what we're already doing in production. As you know, we've got a pretty robust Production business going, both on the TV and the film side. We're already scale. So we don't need to increase capital into the business. But having said all that, if there's a compelling opportunity for returns and strategic enhancement that presents itself and if MGM were to fit that given the success we've got and the kind of distribution lineup we can add some of those assets to, we're not averse to putting capital to work if again we get what we have to be pretty confident is a strong return. So we really can't say more. I know I've said a lot there about MGM, and the reason I said a lot is so we don't keep getting asked about it."

On the question of a structural partnership of some kind",624,"Let me give you what we can say about structural change, whether it's with CBS or any other network on news, and then talk about the CNN general economics, which are much better than people realize. On the question of a structural partnership of some kind, it's no secret that we talked to other news organizations in the past, basically about taking the advantage of CNN's efficiency and quality in newsgathering and alleviating the cost problems that the broadcast news operations have. We've got capability, global reach and some real economies of scale in newsgathering that the old broadcast news operations don't have. So we have long been in discussions with, really, all of the candidates to see if there's a way to create rationale improvements for both parties. We can't and we don't have anything definitive to tell you about that now. But in your question on the motivation, it's not because of a CNN issue. It's really more because of imperatives at the broadcast news companies. CNN has very strong financial performance. It's the fastest earnings growth in the Turner's network portfolio over the last five years, and we expect another record year of earnings this year at CNN. And so the thing that gets a lot of attention is the ratings. Let me just say, we're not happy with the current ratings. We're working to fix that while remaining committed to non-partisan journalism. But for perspective, the ratings, while they have a decent amount of importance, were increasingly selling broader product than the competition can match. There's a premium brand at CNN that expresses itself financially in our CPM advantage, selling ads, and in our carriage piece to affiliates. CNN also still has the biggest reach, more viewers tuning in. The issue really is, that our viewers, even though there are more of them, they tune in for shorter periods. And so what we need to work on is making the news broadcast more compelling, to increase the time spent viewing. There's huge success going on right now on the viewing side in multi-platform; in other words, CNN online [cnn.com] and CNN International. So as we perfectly intend to improve the ratings, that'll be good, and it will help. But there's a lot of financial strength at CNN that essentially puts us in a pretty good position, offering a solution to the cost problems and the profit squeeze that go on in network news. You had a question on Netflix and redbox. We're pretty pleased with the recent Netflix and redbox agreements. And keep in mind, remember that I said, 75% of the DVD sell-through occurs in the first four weeks. So those deals kick in after that. Still pretty early, but the results indicate that, that strategy is working. Two major releases have come out from Warner's since those deals were completed with Netflix and redbox; The Blind Side was one, Sherlock Holmes was the other. We think that the results for both have benefited from the delayed rental window in terms of holding up the higher-priced first month and then providing an efficient buy for consumers at Netflix, redbox in the second month. And don't forget the joint cable studio marketing programs driving VOD is underway. And as VOD gets more important, that's going to be a bigger part of this equation, not just the kiosk and mail delivery of films. As far as we know, others studios are following our lead and have now entered into similar 28-day window deals, couple of them in the last quarter. So it seems to us that the structure is getting put into place in a very reasonable way for consumers and in a way that optimizes economics for the production studios."

First, just to go back and begin, with slightly repeating what I said already, we had a great quarter in home video against the backdrop of a down macro environment. Although the macro environment there even seems to be stabilizing somewhat. And if you think about the trends in that business, the trends that we experienced last year are continuing into this year, which is that we're seeing decline or a more challenged environment, physical and very, very strong growth in the newer formats, including Blu-ray, as well as Digital. And so for us, just to give you some context in the quarter, our EST [electronic sell-through] revenues were up 29% year-over-year. And VOD, because I think you had a VOD borrowing [ph] (44:17) question, those were up 40%. And in sum -- and I think we're number one share in VOD, and in part, I think it relates to the day-and-date strategy that we've been employing now for some time. So we're quite pleased. It's one of the reason why Warner's got out in the lead, and we're going to continue to drive leadership to grow these new digital revenue streams. And as we've been saying now for a considerable amount of time, on a like-for-like basis, every digital transaction for us means more money to the studio than the comparable physical transaction. So we see the benefit going forward by continuing to drive those revenue streams. In terms of the ad, I think you asked for me to repeat the advertising growth rates. Overall, 9%, it was low double-digit growth at the domestic entertainment networks and strong growth internationally. Internationally was a combination of very strong organic growth of about mid teens, coupled with some acquisitions that we've made coming online for the first time in the quarter. That represented -- the impact to the acquisitions alone represented somewhere around 200 basis points to the overall growth numbers. So hopefully that helps."

So in terms of our Cartoon Net progress, we think there's some challenge in some categories like food and beverage advertisers, but we feel good about the programming. And I think as the advertiser categories come back, we think we can add something there. Because we have Adult Swim at night, we really ought to mention because it's the other part of that equation, the Adult Swim network, which has the leading 18 to 34 year old. The audience is up 8% in 2009, it was up 13% in the first quarter of '10.

And so as you work that through the various studios of the industry as a whole, you end up with a fair number of cyclical effects in addition to the downturn, not just secular ones. But the category is still a little challenged on the secular side. We've seen the sell-through decline moderating in the quarter. Sell-through was up in March. The falloff in rental seemed to be caused, as I said, by store closings, that's diminishing or moderating. And digital, not physical, but digital home video has remained strong. VOD transaction increased more than physical rental transactions decreased. And Blu-ray and electronic sell-through were continuing strong. So we basically think if everybody, and Warner's going to do this, continue to execute on the strategy, grow the higher-margin formats of high-def, VOD and electronic sell-through and try to improve the rental economies with the discount kiosk and mail order businesses in the right place, tightly manage the cost base and focus on tent poles that have been outperforming, really, across all of these home video methods. That seems to be the answer, and we think that'll lead to an uptrend, not a down trend."

We just completed another very strong quarter, capping off a good first half of the year. 
Our revenue grew 8%, and that's our highest rate in two years, with advertising revenue up 11%, its highest rate in almost six years. Adjusted operating income rose 15%, and our adjusted earnings per share climbed 35%. 
As you saw in this morning's release, we've raised our outlook for the year. We now expect adjusted EPS to increase at least 20% in 2010, up from our prior guidance of at least mid-teens growth. And please keep in mind that, that's after growing adjusted EPS by 29% last year. 
Our results this year have benefited from an improved ad environment, from our continued cost controls and more than anything else, the appeal of our content and the strength of our brands. As I've told you before, one of our key objectives is to leverage our scale and brands, to invest in and create the highest-quality concept. That, in turn, strengthens  our brands, attracts audiences and increases our scale. It's a virtuous circle and a key competitive advantage for Time Warner. Across the company this quarter, you can see our commitment to this strategy, and you can see the payoff. I'll start with our Networks.
There's no doubt that the quality of Turner's content and the appeal of its brands helped drive its 14% advertising growth this quarter, and that's the highest in years. Discounted market was healthy in the quarter, which helped our performance. But our advertising growth was so strong, in large part because advertisers increasingly want to associate their brands and products with ours. Our success at this year's upfront also showed the appeal of our content and brands. 
Turner's Entertainment Networks (sic) [Turner Entertainment Networks] led both their broadcast and cable competitors in pricing gains. And they increased volumes by double digits. In particular, we saw extremely strong demand for Conan O'Brien. In fact, we were able to achieve parity with the broadcast EPS for the show. 
Also, we're especially encouraged by the performance of truTV. As you know, tru recently broke into the ranks of top 10 cable networks. In the second quarter, it delivered more adults, 18 to 49, than MTV, Spike, Sci-fi and Lifetime. And tru was treated like a top 10 network at the upfront, achieving CPM increases comparable with our other large entertainment networks for the first time. 
So advertisers are recognizing the growing value of our programming and brands. We're confident that our affiliates will also recognize this increasing value over time. As we head into the back half of the year, we're feeling very confident about Turner's slate of original programming. One of our new shows, Memphis Beat, premiered in June as the top-rated new cable series of the quarter. 
And last month, in July, another new series, Rizzoli & Isles, launched as the highest-rated, ad-supported premier in the history of cable. And we just brought back The Closer, which remains the number one show week-after-week on cable, and it's up over last year. Other hit shows returning in the next couple of months included Dark Blue, which is premiering tonight, and Ray Romano's, Men of a Certain Age, which is coming back in the fall. And then, of course, we'll launch Conan's show in November. 
This team focused on content and brand as the driving force at HBO. As you know, HBO not only has the best slate of recently released movies, but it also has the best original programming on TV. Just a few weeks ago, for example, HBO received 101 Emmy nominations, the most in any network for the 10th year in a row. Viewers agree with the critics. 
For instance, we recently debuted the third season of True Blood to a 40% bigger audience than last season's premier. It's now averaging about 13 million viewers per episode, rivaling the final season of The Sopranos. HBO subscribers love our unmatched selection of movies as much as ever. But our consumer research shows that original programming is an increasingly important factor in their decision to subscribe. We're working hard to build on this momentum with more new series in development now than in anytime in HBO's history. 
Next month, we'll debut Boardwalk Empire, produced by Martin Scorsese, which we think will be HBO's next breakout hit. And we just greenlit Luck, that's a provocative look at horse race from Michael Mann and David Milch and starring Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte.
Turning from HBO to our Studio. Last week, Warner Bros. became the first studio to cross the $1 billion market, the domestic box office for the 10th year in a row, another validation of our strategy. And we'd expect to extend this success with a strong slate in the second half and next year. 
We're off to a great start. Our seller blockbuster, Inception, has led the domestic box office for three straight weeks, and is easily on track to exceed $0.5 million of the global box office. Another major releases planned for the rest of the year include: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part I; Legends of the Guardians from Zack Snyder, who gave you 300; Bill Gates from the writer and director of Hangover, Todd Phillips; Hereafter from Clint Eastwood; Life As We Know It with Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel; and Yogi Bear in 3D.
As we outlined in our recent Investor Day, we plan to release six event films again next year in 2011 including: Green Lantern, The Hangover 2, Happy Feet 2, The Next Sherlock Holmes, and last, but not least, the final in the Harry Potter series. 
Warner's Television Production business again delivered an industry-leading upfront with orders for 15 returning series and 11 new series from the broadcast networks. That makes us the number one provider of network TV programming for the fourth time in the past five years. And we're experiencing extremely strong demand for our products in the syndication market. 
We saw very competitive bidding and a record price for the off-network rights to The Big Bang Theory in May. And that was coming on the heels of last year's record sale of  The Mentalist. Demand for these shows is a great indicator about the value of our syndication pipeline over the next couple of years.  
Time Inc. is also outperforming its competitors. Again, a testament to the strength of its brands and to its editorial content. Time Inc. widens its industry leadership and advertising revenue during the first half of the year, gaining more share than any other publisher. And the growth was broad-based, with 15 of our top 20 titles showing increases. 
Looking ahead, these brands will continue to lead the industry as it expands into evolving digital platforms such as tablets, and the richer online environments that is enabled by HTML files. I hope you've had a chance to see the TIME, Sports Illustrated, FORTUNE and Entertainment Weekly apps for the iPad. 
Overtime, and very shortly, we anticipate that our subscribers will be able to enjoy the same amazing experience on every tablet. So in short, we're committing more resources than ever to strengthening our content and our brands. It's paying off in our results. And it's a big part of the reason why I'm so confident about how we're positioned for the rest of this year and the years after that. 
And so with that, I'll pass it off to John Martin."

There are slides that are now available on our website that will follow along with my comments. And let's begin, by the way, on the first slide, where there were a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. As we discusse",1612,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. There are slides that are now available on our website that will follow along with my comments. And let's begin, by the way, on the first slide, where there were a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. 
As we discussed with you before, our goal is to deliver superior shareholder returns through a combination of operational growth and direct returns of capital. In this quarter, we continue to execute on that plan. As Jeff described, we delivered our fastest revenue growth in two years, led in large part by the strength of our content. 
At the same time, we remain focused on operational efficiencies, which enabled us to grow both adjusted operating income and EPS at considerably faster rates than revenue. Our performance so far this year had given us the confidence to raise our full year outlook again. Growing at least 20% this year comes on top, as Jeff said, on top of the 29% adjusted EPS growth in 2009, think about that we're on track to deliver north of 50% adjusted EPS growth in just the last two years. 
Of course, this is in the face of what has been clearly an extremely challenging recession and what continues to be somewhat of an uncertain recovery.
Turning to capital appointment for a moment. Our free cash flow generation in the first half, as well as some recent refinancings that we've done, have further strengthened our balance sheet and we've used some of its flexibility to increase our return to capital. We've spent over $1.5 billion on dividend and share repurchases during the first half of the year, and that's more than twice the level of what we returned in the first half of last year.
Moving to the next slide, which shows consolidated second quarter financial highlights. Revenues were up 8% with Subscription, Advertising and Content revenues all up over last year. Advertising was particularly strong, increasing 11% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up over 15%, with margins increasing 120 basis points year-over-year. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. 
And as we've talked to you before, we continue to try to get the keep a lid on SG&A, where we can so that we can reallocate resources toward more productive areas like Programming, TV and Film Production and Marketing. 
Continuing to lock down the P&L, we grew adjusted EPS by 35%.  And these strong results was helped by our operational growth, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count as compared to last year.
Turning now to the segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks, where we achieved another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth.
Advertising revenues here were up 14%. We're still above 10% if you eliminate the impact of international transactions, and this performance was driven by growth across our networks. Our Domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scattered demand, with pricing up 20% to 30% in the quarter, as well as ongoing yield management. 
Gaming Networks including kids and young adults grew advertising in the high-single digits. And there was a high demand for the NBA playoffs on TNT, despite four fewer games than last year due to shorter series. And domestic news posted double-digit year-over-year advertising growth. 
At our International Networks, organic advertising growth was more than 30%. And I'd also point out that adjusted operating income for our consolidated International Network businesses grew by more than 50% in the quarter. And we achieved a 200 basis points of margin expansion here year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, domestic scatter pricing remains robust and it's still up more than 20% over the upfront. And trends internationally look relatively consistent with the second quarter. So, while it may be difficult for us to maintain quite the pace of this quarter's growth, we do expect another quarter of strong advertising growth in the third quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. 
Subscription revenue growth here of 9% primarily reflected higher rates and international expansion. Remember, that this is a very big revenue stream for us and we continue to receive Subscription revenues as being one of the largest growth opportunities for the company. We are continually investing to increase the value of our networks through our viewers and distributors, and we expect this value to be recognized over time in our affiliate views. 
Operating income was up 14% in the quarter and margins expanded approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with our plan, both marketing and programming costs grew more quickly in the second quarter than in the first quarter and that was tied to the timing of new and original programming. As you know, increased investment in originals is a key element in our strategic plan for both Turner and HBO, and we have a particularly strong lineup of originals running during the third quarter, and it's the shows that Jeff mentioned just a few minutes ago. And those include both returning and new shows, shows such as The Closer and Leverage on TNT, a new series Are We There Yet? on TBS, Rizzoli & Isles and Memphis Speed on TNT and Boardwalk Empire on HBO to name a few. 
Due to this large slate of originals, we expect our third quarter margins to compress somewhat compared to last year's third quarter, but they should once again expand in the fourth quarter. And for the year, we continue to expect relatively modest programming cost growth in and around the mid-single-digit area. So given strong topline performance to date and encouraging trends that we've experienced, we think that this will all translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division this year.
Let's turn now to Film. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was relatively flat, but it's still up significantly year-to-date and we saw significant increases in both the optical and television revenue in the quarter, but we also have higher film costs and P&A due to a larger number of high-budget theatrical films and the shift towards international sales distribution for new line releases. 
In addition, a greater percentage of our television revenue came from lower margin new series. Overtime, we're confident we can continue to push margins higher at this division by focusing on operational efficiencies and accelerating the transition to digital consumption, particularly in home video.
Our Home Video revenue was down 8% year-over-year in the quarter, but that was mostly a function of a previously disclosed return-reserve adjustment, which helped last year's results. Industry trends have shown some improvement in recent months, with home video sales for the industry close to flat in the second quarter. And digital growth remained quite strong. Warner Bros. grew video and electronic sell-through over 50%. And on a combined basis, these revenues are now quickly approaching 20% of our total Home Video business. As you know, that revenue have a much higher margin attached to it so that's both important and encouraging. 
So let's continue to move ahead and look at free cash flow for a minute on the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated about $1.2 billion of free cash flow. That's down a little year-over-year due to primarily higher cash taxes and an increase in accounts receivable tied to higher revenue growth. However, it still represents a meaningful amount of free cash flow and a high conversion ratio. So let's move to our final slide, which looks at net debt.
We ended the quarter with a little more than $12 billion in net debt, and that's up about $800 million compared to the end of last year. And that's a result of us spending more than 100% of our free cash flow year-to-date, or about $1.5 billion on share repurchases and dividends. And we've also spent about $0.5 billion year-to-date on acquisitions, and about 80% of the acquisitions have been on international cable networks, with the majority of that related to our acquisition of additional interests in HBO's international operations. It also includes our acquisition of Turbine, which is an online gaming studio, to further enhance Warner Bros.' capabilities in the video game space. So with half the year now complete, we're on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. 
So let me remind you quickly what those are. First, we're going to continue to invest in our businesses to improve the strategic position and drive long-term growth, and that's evidenced by the increased investment in programming production and marketing that we've talked to you about. 
Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned in the first half of the year, we spent $1.5 billion, including about $1 billion in share repurchases. And we still have about $2 billion outstanding under our current share repurchase authorization. 
Third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing debt maturities. This year, for example, we've taken full advantage of the current credit markets to effectively extend the maturities of $5 billion in debt, including $3 billion just last month. This has allowed us to improve our maturity profile at very, very attractive interest rates. We now have no more than $1 billion in debt coming due in any year through the end of the decade, so that's good.  We consider this strategic flexibility that we have to be a real competitive advantage. 
Our leverage ratio is now about 2x, and that's somewhat closer to our long-term target of 2.5x, but yet still leaves us with plenty of flexibility. So thanks for listening, and let me turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A part of the call."

As I think you all know, the intent of the move of the window is to boost demand for DVD sell-through and for VOD. And while it's early, as the results indicate, but that strategy is working quite well particularly, on big titles. Two that I would cite, which are the biggest ones since we moved there, Blind Side is one and Sherlock Holmes is another. We saw considerably higher sales and the weeks, say two to four that we used to see in that kind of week-by-week distribution of sales. The joint cable and studio marketing program to promote Video-on-Demand helped. And one other thing that, I think, we're going to see as we move along, you still have a fair amount of upside room for activity and effort in VOD. The VOD marketing effort, the kind of ability that cable, satellite, telco infrastructure to do VOD is still increasing pretty fast. And so we think that this is working already and it's going to work better as we go along. We have seen other studios following that plan in terms of that window. And we've seen the titles that come from studios that are not using that window structure underperform. So that's what we know so far on those windows. In terms of the affiliate fee, we are extremely confident of our outlook for affiliate fee growth. Obviously, in the premise of your question, the majority of what the revenue that we have is under multiyear contracts, and it's not quite right to say that it rolls over at the rate linearly that you were saying. I'm sorry, I'm not going to give exactly the timing of our maturity. But as you've been watching what we've been doing, not just this Turner, [indiscernible] its original programming success, which we mentioned in our prepared remarks, but also the big programming deals, whether it's for the sports, the basketball, Conan deal, some of the strength of new shows at HBO. We really think that we're improving our position in our future outlook on the affiliate side."

So one thing I would tell all of you is to actually look at that and any of these companies, Netflix not being the only one, we are quite organized at the job [ph] between Warner and HBO and Turner, how we look at those. And so what you see us doing is something that comes out of a fairly coordinated approach. In terms of HBO's view, we at HBO is very used to competition, and does it by providing a great product, which you can focus either on a superior movie supply that they've got, that got us major releases out many year, or on the original programming, which is unique to HBO. Really, in both respects, both the movies, the Hollywood movies and the originals are unique to HBO and exclusive when you're on HBO. Where Netflix has gone essentially, everywhere Netflix has sub [ph], HBO out-indexed it in terms of its penetration, retention and performance. As you look into the future, I'm not going to really clarify exactly how the programming strategy will work over time. But suffice it to say, I feel very good about that, both on the movie side and the original programming side. And I really would call everyone's attention to what you're about to see, and you already see it with our biggest distributors, Verizon and Comcast, which is HBO On Demand, not only on your TV set, which is already a huge success in ratings and in competitive relative position for HBO versus all other networks. But you're still going to see HBO on all your broadband devices because you're a subscriber to HBO. And if you take the show lineup that HBO's got on originals and movies and you put it available On Demand on all broadband devices, which you're already seeing at Comcast and Verizon, that's going to be the big news for this next year."

We do think broadcasters as competitors of our Cable Networks. They've always received a form of retran, usually not in cash for the broadcast network, but in other kind of ancillary networks. And so to the extent that as they get it more direct on their broadcast network and to the extent that they get additional cash, we still think that the stronger cable network, which will be the group we're at, will prosper as they, in the broadcast side, spoke their economics. We think that all our Networks are multi-task [ph] networks with multi-task [ph] programming. The originals, part of that. [indiscernible], the movie line ups as well. So we're actually kind of happy that broadcast has revitalized their programming because there's really two reasons. The easy one to see is that we have a very healthy leading business at Warner, making TV series for the broadcast networks and then bolstering their health going forward is actually good for that business. But the second fact that was related to that is that the successful shows that come off broadcast networks, many of which we made at Warner, are then available for the leading cable networks like TNT and TBS. And they're pretty important part of the ecosystem. And as we've said before, that kind of synergy relationship in terms of Warner supplying hit shows, broadcast across all broadcasts nets, and then having those hits shows available to the highest bidding cable network, which happened to be ours, due to their lead position, is a very beneficial kind of a cycle for the industry and for us. If you go now to the Syndication question, we think that, I think John mentioned in the second quarter, the sale of The Closer to TNT was already in there. It's not that large. We think the pipeline is very strong for the rest of the year. For the rest of this year, we have Two and a Half Men for cable. We have The Closer coming for cable, and we can broadcast. We have The New Adventures of Old Christine. And then looking after 2010, into next year, we've already sold Big Bang Theory for 2011 and The Mentalist for 2012.

At the present time, what we're doing is, we basically are launching HBO to our subscriber base. You have 30 million subs that deserve to get HBO On Demand on every platform, including on broadband. You paid for it, you should have it. And we're going to have our distributors, who are very important partners in doing this and putting up the plant that allows you to do this, be part of the equation. The question of whether we should that bask in the future, offer a subscription separately from that, is not something that we're ready to do now. Of course, we could do it, if and when it would become reasonable, but the one thing that we're quite interested in -- and I think every content company should be, is in supporting the economic infrastructure of video streaming, video delivery and broadband ISP delivery. Because if you think carefully about the broadband-video distribution infrastructure, it needs to become more robust. It needs investment and the companies that do that are the ISPs. So you have to think carefully about keeping those economics related as you take products like HBO, Turner Network and you make them available on broadband devices. So I think we're working quite progressively to have the whole system function optimally. And the key to it all is to get our subscribers, not just for our TV Networks, but on ad events to be able to enjoy their products overall all these devices as soon as possible because they already subscribed."

It's bringing us titles like the Lord of the Rings, Arkham Asylum, Mortal Kombat. And then secondly, we have, as you all know, a pretty big titles in our IP inventory in the Warner and Time Warner Characters in some strategy. So we're essentially building from our position of both distribution related to DVD and all that, and IP that we have in our programming. And we're working towards the global video infrastructure, which goes adjacent in gains. So we think that we're making steady progress. We've moved into the top 10. We see it a growing percentage of the Warner Bros. 'revenues. It's actually one of the fairly high growth areas inside Warner Bros., and we believe the margins should improve as we increase our sales and further leverage the infrastructure."

And just to put a little bit more context around it, this is the sixth quarter in a row where we had a year-over-year margin expansion at the networks division. And I think if you look at the absolute margin in networks in the second quarter and if you go and compare that to history of the second quarters of all the prior years, I think it's the highest margin at the Networks for as long as our data goes back for. So my point being is that we are carefully managing the investment in the cost space. We are trying to be more efficient where we can, and I often mentioned that we're trying to keep a lid on SG&A, but marketing is a component of that. That is directly tied to revenues because of supporting the investment that we're making our programming. So we're working hard and we continue to see positive margin attributes as we go forward."

I mean, it's a long-standing question about whether the ticket priced for movies that people think are being hit, should be the same as the ticket price from let's say, are controversial as to whether they're hits. And I believe you mentioned what could fall into that category. And then your related question is what do you think of the GAAP between 3D pricing and regular pricing. Revenues in theatrical box office has been reasonably healthy. Admissions, have stayed flat. I don't think the industry, meaning the distribution retail field industry, they don't believe really believe that the it's all about elastic in terms of volume of ignitions. It's ticket prices. And I think they believe that the place to have some kind of revenue growth to keep inflation is on ticket pricing, whether it's for standard stuff or whether it's for 3D. It's clear that 3D represents a bit of an opportunity for higher ticket prices and that probably will remain a question of legitimate interest as to whether this title in 3D justifies whatever that ticket price is versus some other type of 3D. And I think it really gets down to the whole issue of ticket pricing, whether it's standard or 3D experience. The fact that it's been standard across really good titles versus weaker titles is the source of the question. I think the question will remain and I think even I can't answer it satisfactorily that the fruit is in the eating of the pudding. Revenues in theatrical are quite healthy. And one of the things I wouldn't underestimate is that in the help of the box office, even coming from 3D price before, what does that is it develops a real interest for ancillary viewing, whether you actually see the movie in your home on a standard basis or you may watch it a theater on 3D or in the future maybe you'd get a 3D for your home viewing. So I think its all positive in terms of the industry on the film economics, at least for the producing sector. If you go-to-go and you're flying on Comcast or on the view on -- I agree with you on something. I agree with you on actually a lot of what you're seeing here. I think the interface for HBO GO, the HBO develop is superior to, basically, any interface outfits. And so we are encouraging everyone, all our affiliates, whoever they are, to take advantage of that interface and use it, which they could. I think that what will happen is any distributor who has an interface, who's really not able to perform as well as what the HBO one does, you can end up adopting it. And if your question basically asks, okay; that's what; your question has with the premise shouldn't they, do that quickly? I agree with you, yes, they should."

We just completed another very strong quarter, capping off a good first half of the year. 
Our revenue grew 8%, and that's our highest rate in two years, with advertising revenue up 11%, its highest rate in almost six years. Adjusted operating income rose 15%, and our adjusted earnings per share climbed 35%. 
As you saw in this morning's release, we've raised our outlook for the year. We now expect adjusted EPS to increase at least 20% in 2010, up from our prior guidance of at least mid-teens growth. And please keep in mind that, that's after growing adjusted EPS by 29% last year. 
Our results this year have benefited from an improved ad environment, from our continued cost controls and more than anything else, the appeal of our content and the strength of our brands. As I've told you before, one of our key objectives is to leverage our scale and brands, to invest in and create the highest-quality concept. That, in turn, strengthens  our brands, attracts audiences and increases our scale. It's a virtuous circle and a key competitive advantage for Time Warner. Across the company this quarter, you can see our commitment to this strategy, and you can see the payoff. I'll start with our Networks.
There's no doubt that the quality of Turner's content and the appeal of its brands helped drive its 14% advertising growth this quarter, and that's the highest in years. Discounted market was healthy in the quarter, which helped our performance. But our advertising growth was so strong, in large part because advertisers increasingly want to associate their brands and products with ours. Our success at this year's upfront also showed the appeal of our content and brands. 
Turner's Entertainment Networks (sic) [Turner Entertainment Networks] led both their broadcast and cable competitors in pricing gains. And they increased volumes by double digits. In particular, we saw extremely strong demand for Conan O'Brien. In fact, we were able to achieve parity with the broadcast EPS for the show. 
Also, we're especially encouraged by the performance of truTV. As you know, tru recently broke into the ranks of top 10 cable networks. In the second quarter, it delivered more adults, 18 to 49, than MTV, Spike, Sci-fi and Lifetime. And tru was treated like a top 10 network at the upfront, achieving CPM increases comparable with our other large entertainment networks for the first time. 
So advertisers are recognizing the growing value of our programming and brands. We're confident that our affiliates will also recognize this increasing value over time. As we head into the back half of the year, we're feeling very confident about Turner's slate of original programming. One of our new shows, Memphis Beat, premiered in June as the top-rated new cable series of the quarter. 
And last month, in July, another new series, Rizzoli & Isles, launched as the highest-rated, ad-supported premier in the history of cable. And we just brought back The Closer, which remains the number one show week-after-week on cable, and it's up over last year. Other hit shows returning in the next couple of months included Dark Blue, which is premiering tonight, and Ray Romano's, Men of a Certain Age, which is coming back in the fall. And then, of course, we'll launch Conan's show in November. 
This team focused on content and brand as the driving force at HBO. As you know, HBO not only has the best slate of recently released movies, but it also has the best original programming on TV. Just a few weeks ago, for example, HBO received 101 Emmy nominations, the most in any network for the 10th year in a row. Viewers agree with the critics. 
For instance, we recently debuted the third season of True Blood to a 40% bigger audience than last season's premier. It's now averaging about 13 million viewers per episode, rivaling the final season of The Sopranos. HBO subscribers love our unmatched selection of movies as much as ever. But our consumer research shows that original programming is an increasingly important factor in their decision to subscribe. We're working hard to build on this momentum with more new series in development now than in anytime in HBO's history. 
Next month, we'll debut Boardwalk Empire, produced by Martin Scorsese, which we think will be HBO's next breakout hit. And we just greenlit Luck, that's a provocative look at horse race from Michael Mann and David Milch and starring Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte.
Turning from HBO to our Studio. Last week, Warner Bros. became the first studio to cross the $1 billion market, the domestic box office for the 10th year in a row, another validation of our strategy. And we'd expect to extend this success with a strong slate in the second half and next year. 
We're off to a great start. Our seller blockbuster, Inception, has led the domestic box office for three straight weeks, and is easily on track to exceed $0.5 million of the global box office. Another major releases planned for the rest of the year include: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part I; Legends of the Guardians from Zack Snyder, who gave you 300; Bill Gates from the writer and director of Hangover, Todd Phillips; Hereafter from Clint Eastwood; Life As We Know It with Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel; and Yogi Bear in 3D.
As we outlined in our recent Investor Day, we plan to release six event films again next year in 2011 including: Green Lantern, The Hangover 2, Happy Feet 2, The Next Sherlock Holmes, and last, but not least, the final in the Harry Potter series. 
Warner's Television Production business again delivered an industry-leading upfront with orders for 15 returning series and 11 new series from the broadcast networks. That makes us the number one provider of network TV programming for the fourth time in the past five years. And we're experiencing extremely strong demand for our products in the syndication market. 
We saw very competitive bidding and a record price for the off-network rights to The Big Bang Theory in May. And that was coming on the heels of last year's record sale of  The Mentalist. Demand for these shows is a great indicator about the value of our syndication pipeline over the next couple of years.  
Time Inc. is also outperforming its competitors. Again, a testament to the strength of its brands and to its editorial content. Time Inc. widens its industry leadership and advertising revenue during the first half of the year, gaining more share than any other publisher. And the growth was broad-based, with 15 of our top 20 titles showing increases. 
Looking ahead, these brands will continue to lead the industry as it expands into evolving digital platforms such as tablets, and the richer online environments that is enabled by HTML files. I hope you've had a chance to see the TIME, Sports Illustrated, FORTUNE and Entertainment Weekly apps for the iPad. 
Overtime, and very shortly, we anticipate that our subscribers will be able to enjoy the same amazing experience on every tablet. So in short, we're committing more resources than ever to strengthening our content and our brands. It's paying off in our results. And it's a big part of the reason why I'm so confident about how we're positioned for the rest of this year and the years after that. 
And so with that, I'll pass it off to John Martin.

There are slides that are now available on our website that will follow along with my comments. And let's begin, by the way, on the first slide, where there were a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. As we discusse",1612,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. There are slides that are now available on our website that will follow along with my comments. And let's begin, by the way, on the first slide, where there were a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. 
As we discussed with you before, our goal is to deliver superior shareholder returns through a combination of operational growth and direct returns of capital. In this quarter, we continue to execute on that plan. As Jeff described, we delivered our fastest revenue growth in two years, led in large part by the strength of our content. 
At the same time, we remain focused on operational efficiencies, which enabled us to grow both adjusted operating income and EPS at considerably faster rates than revenue. Our performance so far this year had given us the confidence to raise our full year outlook again. Growing at least 20% this year comes on top, as Jeff said, on top of the 29% adjusted EPS growth in 2009, think about that we're on track to deliver north of 50% adjusted EPS growth in just the last two years. 
Of course, this is in the face of what has been clearly an extremely challenging recession and what continues to be somewhat of an uncertain recovery.
Turning to capital appointment for a moment. Our free cash flow generation in the first half, as well as some recent refinancings that we've done, have further strengthened our balance sheet and we've used some of its flexibility to increase our return to capital. We've spent over $1.5 billion on dividend and share repurchases during the first half of the year, and that's more than twice the level of what we returned in the first half of last year.
Moving to the next slide, which shows consolidated second quarter financial highlights. Revenues were up 8% with Subscription, Advertising and Content revenues all up over last year. Advertising was particularly strong, increasing 11% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up over 15%, with margins increasing 120 basis points year-over-year. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. 
And as we've talked to you before, we continue to try to get the keep a lid on SG&A, where we can so that we can reallocate resources toward more productive areas like Programming, TV and Film Production and Marketing. 
Continuing to lock down the P&L, we grew adjusted EPS by 35%.  And these strong results was helped by our operational growth, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count as compared to last year.
Turning now to the segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks, where we achieved another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth.
Advertising revenues here were up 14%. We're still above 10% if you eliminate the impact of international transactions, and this performance was driven by growth across our networks. Our Domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scattered demand, with pricing up 20% to 30% in the quarter, as well as ongoing yield management. 
Gaming Networks including kids and young adults grew advertising in the high-single digits. And there was a high demand for the NBA playoffs on TNT, despite four fewer games than last year due to shorter series. And domestic news posted double-digit year-over-year advertising growth. 
At our International Networks, organic advertising growth was more than 30%. And I'd also point out that adjusted operating income for our consolidated International Network businesses grew by more than 50% in the quarter. And we achieved a 200 basis points of margin expansion here year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, domestic scatter pricing remains robust and it's still up more than 20% over the upfront. And trends internationally look relatively consistent with the second quarter. So, while it may be difficult for us to maintain quite the pace of this quarter's growth, we do expect another quarter of strong advertising growth in the third quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. 
Subscription revenue growth here of 9% primarily reflected higher rates and international expansion. Remember, that this is a very big revenue stream for us and we continue to receive Subscription revenues as being one of the largest growth opportunities for the company. We are continually investing to increase the value of our networks through our viewers and distributors, and we expect this value to be recognized over time in our affiliate views. 
Operating income was up 14% in the quarter and margins expanded approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with our plan, both marketing and programming costs grew more quickly in the second quarter than in the first quarter and that was tied to the timing of new and original programming. As you know, increased investment in originals is a key element in our strategic plan for both Turner and HBO, and we have a particularly strong lineup of originals running during the third quarter, and it's the shows that Jeff mentioned just a few minutes ago. And those include both returning and new shows, shows such as The Closer and Leverage on TNT, a new series Are We There Yet? on TBS, Rizzoli & Isles and Memphis Speed on TNT and Boardwalk Empire on HBO to name a few. 
Due to this large slate of originals, we expect our third quarter margins to compress somewhat compared to last year's third quarter, but they should once again expand in the fourth quarter. And for the year, we continue to expect relatively modest programming cost growth in and around the mid-single-digit area. So given strong topline performance to date and encouraging trends that we've experienced, we think that this will all translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division this year.
Let's turn now to Film. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was relatively flat, but it's still up significantly year-to-date and we saw significant increases in both the optical and television revenue in the quarter, but we also have higher film costs and P&A due to a larger number of high-budget theatrical films and the shift towards international sales distribution for new line releases. 
In addition, a greater percentage of our television revenue came from lower margin new series. Overtime, we're confident we can continue to push margins higher at this division by focusing on operational efficiencies and accelerating the transition to digital consumption, particularly in home video.
Our Home Video revenue was down 8% year-over-year in the quarter, but that was mostly a function of a previously disclosed return-reserve adjustment, which helped last year's results. Industry trends have shown some improvement in recent months, with home video sales for the industry close to flat in the second quarter. And digital growth remained quite strong. Warner Bros. grew video and electronic sell-through over 50%. And on a combined basis, these revenues are now quickly approaching 20% of our total Home Video business. As you know, that revenue have a much higher margin attached to it so that's both important and encouraging. 
So let's continue to move ahead and look at free cash flow for a minute on the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated about $1.2 billion of free cash flow. That's down a little year-over-year due to primarily higher cash taxes and an increase in accounts receivable tied to higher revenue growth. However, it still represents a meaningful amount of free cash flow and a high conversion ratio. So let's move to our final slide, which looks at net debt.
We ended the quarter with a little more than $12 billion in net debt, and that's up about $800 million compared to the end of last year. And that's a result of us spending more than 100% of our free cash flow year-to-date, or about $1.5 billion on share repurchases and dividends. And we've also spent about $0.5 billion year-to-date on acquisitions, and about 80% of the acquisitions have been on international cable networks, with the majority of that related to our acquisition of additional interests in HBO's international operations. It also includes our acquisition of Turbine, which is an online gaming studio, to further enhance Warner Bros.' capabilities in the video game space. So with half the year now complete, we're on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. 
So let me remind you quickly what those are. First, we're going to continue to invest in our businesses to improve the strategic position and drive long-term growth, and that's evidenced by the increased investment in programming production and marketing that we've talked to you about. 
Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned in the first half of the year, we spent $1.5 billion, including about $1 billion in share repurchases. And we still have about $2 billion outstanding under our current share repurchase authorization. 
Third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing debt maturities. This year, for example, we've taken full advantage of the current credit markets to effectively extend the maturities of $5 billion in debt, including $3 billion just last month. This has allowed us to improve our maturity profile at very, very attractive interest rates. We now have no more than $1 billion in debt coming due in any year through the end of the decade, so that's good.  We consider this strategic flexibility that we have to be a real competitive advantage. 
Our leverage ratio is now about 2x, and that's somewhat closer to our long-term target of 2.5x, but yet still leaves us with plenty of flexibility. So thanks for listening, and let me turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A part of the call.

Can you help us out with the timing part of that increasing value over time? I mean, typically these deals are five years or so, so a fifth comes up every year. Is that the layout, which you just expect 20% of the deals a year? Or is there a bigger year in '11 or '12 that we should think about?

As I think you all know, the intent of the move of the window is to boost demand for DVD sell-through and for VOD. And while it's early, as the results indicate, but that strategy is working quite well particularly, on big titles. Two that I would cite, which are the biggest ones since we moved there, Blind Side is one and Sherlock Holmes is another. We saw considerably higher sales and the weeks, say two to four that we used to see in that kind of week-by-week distribution of sales. The joint cable and studio marketing program to promote Video-on-Demand helped. And one other thing that, I think, we're going to see as we move along, you still have a fair amount of upside room for activity and effort in VOD. The VOD marketing effort, the kind of ability that cable, satellite, telco infrastructure to do VOD is still increasing pretty fast. And so we think that this is working already and it's going to work better as we go along. We have seen other studios following that plan in terms of that window. And we've seen the titles that come from studios that are not using that window structure underperform. So that's what we know so far on those windows. In terms of the affiliate fee, we are extremely confident of our outlook for affiliate fee growth. Obviously, in the premise of your question, the majority of what the revenue that we have is under multiyear contracts, and it's not quite right to say that it rolls over at the rate linearly that you were saying. I'm sorry, I'm not going to give exactly the timing of our maturity. But as you've been watching what we've been doing, not just this Turner, [indiscernible] its original programming success, which we mentioned in our prepared remarks, but also the big programming deals, whether it's for the sports, the basketball, Conan deal, some of the strength of new shows at HBO. We really think that we're improving our position in our future outlook on the affiliate side.

So one thing I would tell all of you is to actually look at that and any of these companies, Netflix not being the only one, we are quite organized at the job [ph] between Warner and HBO and Turner, how we look at those. And so what you see us doing is something that comes out of a fairly coordinated approach. In terms of HBO's view, we at HBO is very used to competition, and does it by providing a great product, which you can focus either on a superior movie supply that they've got, that got us major releases out many year, or on the original programming, which is unique to HBO. Really, in both respects, both the movies, the Hollywood movies and the originals are unique to HBO and exclusive when you're on HBO. Where Netflix has gone essentially, everywhere Netflix has sub [ph], HBO out-indexed it in terms of its penetration, retention and performance. As you look into the future, I'm not going to really clarify exactly how the programming strategy will work over time. But suffice it to say, I feel very good about that, both on the movie side and the original programming side. And I really would call everyone's attention to what you're about to see, and you already see it with our biggest distributors, Verizon and Comcast, which is HBO On Demand, not only on your TV set, which is already a huge success in ratings and in competitive relative position for HBO versus all other networks. But you're still going to see HBO on all your broadband devices because you're a subscriber to HBO. And if you take the show lineup that HBO's got on originals and movies and you put it available On Demand on all broadband devices, which you're already seeing at Comcast and Verizon, that's going to be the big news for this next year.

We do think broadcasters as competitors of our Cable Networks. They've always received a form of retran, usually not in cash for the broadcast network, but in other kind of ancillary networks. And so to the extent that as they get it more direct on their broadcast network and to the extent that they get additional cash, we still think that the stronger cable network, which will be the group we're at, will prosper as they, in the broadcast side, spoke their economics. We think that all our Networks are multi-task [ph] networks with multi-task [ph] programming. The originals, part of that. [indiscernible], the movie line ups as well. So we're actually kind of happy that broadcast has revitalized their programming because there's really two reasons. The easy one to see is that we have a very healthy leading business at Warner, making TV series for the broadcast networks and then bolstering their health going forward is actually good for that business. But the second fact that was related to that is that the successful shows that come off broadcast networks, many of which we made at Warner, are then available for the leading cable networks like TNT and TBS. And they're pretty important part of the ecosystem. And as we've said before, that kind of synergy relationship in terms of Warner supplying hit shows, broadcast across all broadcasts nets, and then having those hits shows available to the highest bidding cable network, which happened to be ours, due to their lead position, is a very beneficial kind of a cycle for the industry and for us. If you go now to the Syndication question, we think that, I think John mentioned in the second quarter, the sale of The Closer to TNT was already in there. It's not that large. We think the pipeline is very strong for the rest of the year. For the rest of this year, we have Two and a Half Men for cable. We have The Closer coming for cable, and we can broadcast. We have The New Adventures of Old Christine. And then looking after 2010, into next year, we've already sold Big Bang Theory for 2011 and The Mentalist for 2012. We've got Gossip Girl and Chuck coming in 2011.  Fringe is available in 2012. And the shows you mentioned on HBO, Entourage...

And I think we had mentioned that with the growing Syndication pipeline, that we would expect to see growth on a go-forward basis from that Television business beginning this year. And so I mean, the mix, sort of, can go up and down at any one particular year, but we have a very, very big component of profits coming from each of the Theatrical and the Television side.

There was a small movie package in there that's quite old movies, which is really the kind of movies Netflix has. So basically, we don't see so far, and we haven't seen too many other cases where other companies have sold things to Netflix, but essentially, there are a few where it cannibalizes  business that's actually better than what Netflix was able to represent. And we basically traded a lot, whether it's with our current networks or with our syndicated files.

I do think over time what you'll see on the VOD side, the television streaming side is a more robust product as the Cable, Sat, Telco operators beef up their VOD, but basically think of it as eventually, as much as what it has coming to you as a subscriber, go to your first question, which is what are we doing with subscribers? At the present time, what we're doing is, we basically are launching HBO to our subscriber base. You have 30 million subs that deserve to get HBO On Demand on every platform, including on broadband. You paid for it, you should have it. And we're going to have our distributors, who are very important partners in doing this and putting up the plant that allows you to do this, be part of the equation. The question of whether we should that bask in the future, offer a subscription separately from that, is not something that we're ready to do now. Of course, we could do it, if and when it would become reasonable, but the one thing that we're quite interested in -- and I think every content company should be, is in supporting the economic infrastructure of video streaming, video delivery and broadband ISP delivery. Because if you think carefully about the broadband-video distribution infrastructure, it needs to become more robust. It needs investment and the companies that do that are the ISPs. So you have to think carefully about keeping those economics related as you take products like HBO, Turner Network and you make them available on broadband devices. So I think we're working quite progressively to have the whole system function optimally. And the key to it all is to get our subscribers, not just for our TV Networks, but on ad events to be able to enjoy their products overall all these devices as soon as possible because they already subscribed.

We are trying to be more efficient where we can, and I often mentioned that we're trying to keep a lid on SG&A, but marketing is a component of that. That is directly tied to revenues because of supporting the investment that we're making our programming. So we're working hard and we continue to see positive margin attributes as we go forward.

I mean, it's a long-standing question about whether the ticket priced for movies that people think are being hit, should be the same as the ticket price from let's say, are controversial as to whether they're hits. And I believe you mentioned what could fall into that category. And then your related question is what do you think of the GAAP between 3D pricing and regular pricing. Revenues in theatrical box office has been reasonably healthy. Admissions, have stayed flat. I don't think the industry, meaning the distribution retail field industry, they don't believe really believe that the it's all about elastic in terms of volume of ignitions. It's ticket prices. And I think they believe that the place to have some kind of revenue growth to keep inflation is on ticket pricing, whether it's for standard stuff or whether it's for 3D. It's clear that 3D represents a bit of an opportunity for higher ticket prices and that probably will remain a question of legitimate interest as to whether this title in 3D justifies whatever that ticket price is versus some other type of 3D. And I think it really gets down to the whole issue of ticket pricing, whether it's standard or 3D experience. The fact that it's been standard across really good titles versus weaker titles is the source of the question. I think the question will remain and I think even I can't answer it satisfactorily that the fruit is in the eating of the pudding. Revenues in theatrical are quite healthy. And one of the things I wouldn't underestimate is that in the help of the box office, even coming from 3D price before, what does that is it develops a real interest for ancillary viewing, whether you actually see the movie in your home on a standard basis or you may watch it a theater on 3D or in the future maybe you'd get a 3D for your home viewing. So I think its all positive in terms of the industry on the film economics, at least for the producing sector. If you go-to-go and you're flying on Comcast or on the view on -- I agree with you on something. I agree with you on actually a lot of what you're seeing here. I think the interface for HBO GO, the HBO develop is superior to, basically, any interface outfits. And so we are encouraging everyone, all our affiliates, whoever they are, to take advantage of that interface and use it, which they could. I think that what will happen is any distributor who has an interface, who's really not able to perform as well as what the HBO one does, you can end up adopting it. And if your question basically asks, okay; that's what; your question has with the premise shouldn't they, do that quickly? I agree with you, yes, they should.

We had another strong quarter, and we're on track for another terrific year. More important, we're positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that digital distribution will bring. This quarter, Turner, again, posed a double-digit advertising growth. We're continuing to benefit from strong demand for our inventory on TNT and TBS. And while we have ratings challenges at CNN that we are addressing, we've had solid ratings growth at several of our other Networks, including truTV, Turner and Adult Swim.
We saw outstanding results from our most important new content this quarter. On TNT, our new show, Rizzoli & Isles, became the number one original series of all time on ad-supported Cable. On HBO, Boardwalk Empire is on track to become the most watched first year series in the network's history.
At Warner Bros, our blockbuster movie, Inception, generated over $800 million at the global box office, and we're having a great start to new television season. In addition to the success of our returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and The Mentalist, a new show, Mike & Molly, is the number one new comedy on TV. 
Looking forward, we expect improved ratings performance at our biggest entertainment Networks in the fourth quarter, driven by our strong lineup of original, the debut of Conan's new show next Monday and outstanding recent performance from our sports program. In fact, our coverage of the Major League Baseball American League championship series was the most watched league championship ever on TBS. And NBA Opening Night was the most watched regular season NBA game ever on Cable TV. This should enable us to continue capitalize on the solid demand in the scatter market, with pricing up 15% to 20% over the healthy prices that we saw in the 2010, 2011 upfront.
And we're excited about the films that we're premiering this month. As you all know, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows opens in a few weeks. And just this weekend, we're opening Due Date from the Hangover Director, Todd Phillips, which could be another sleeper hit. All that momentum gives us the confidence to, again, raise our full year outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at a rate in the high 20s over 2009. And last year was a year when we grew adjusted earnings per share by 29%.
John will walk you through the results in detail in a few minutes. But overall, it's shaping up to be another very good year. I'd like to shift gears now and update you on a bigger picture issue that has made plenty of headlines in the way and that's the impact of digital distribution on our businesses. Clearly, digital distribution present some new challenges for the industry, but we believe that the opportunities significantly outweigh the risks. The unequivocal good news is that digital distribution offers consumers a better experience, with more choice, more convenience and more control. As a result, there's more demand than ever for the kind of high-quality content that we make, and it's a testament to that demand that so many companies are devoting so many resources to finding new ways to distribute and monetize our films and our TV shows and magazines.
The question, of course, is how do we take advantage of these opportunities in a way that both enhances the consumer experience and enhances our economics. First, we're supporting an array of Networks to allow consumers to access Time Warner content on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want in a way that's attractive and convenient for them and economically beneficial for us. In other words, buy our content once and use it in multiple places. Think of it as content everywhere. I'll talk more about this idea in a moment.
And second, we're experimenting with new business models that enable consumers to use and access our content in ways they couldn't before. As just one example of that, we will help lead the industry to launch a premium video-on-demand service that will enable consumers to watch recently released theatrical movies at home in high definition and eventually, in 3D. We're near agreement with our distributors on the right window and the right price point, and we expect to start offering our movies this way nationwide by the second quarter of next year.
Let me come back to this idea of content everywhere. It means something slightly different in TV, film and magazine, so I'd like to touch on each of those. In TV Networks and production, it means TV Everywhere. And as you know, TV Everywhere is a framework to provide TV subscribers with a huge array of TV content, everything on the dial and have it on demand on a wide variety of devices for television, the PC, tablets, mobile devices at no extra charge. TV Everywhere promises to give consumers that flexibility while also bolstering an ecosystem that has produced such high-quality programs and so much choice. 
A year ago, there was vibrant debate about whether free was a good business model. TV Everywhere was just a concept, and many argued that it wouldn't work. So where are we now? TV Everywhere has made tremendous progress in a very short period of time. Today, there is widespread acknowledgment among content providers that free ad-supported websites cannot replace powerful dual revenue stream business models. But it's being adopted across the industry faster than anyone expected. 
Every major programmer has announced plans to participate. CBS, Discovery, Disney, Liberty, NBC Universal, News Corp, Scripts, Viacom, among others. As one important step, just last week, Disney launched authenticated versions of ESPN and ESPN 3  in most Time Warner Cable markets. In the last few weeks, we've launched TV Everywhere versions of TNT and TBS across the entire footprints of both Comcast and Dish, and we have many more announcements pending.
We also have several deals pending for HBO GO and MAX GO, and now expect the services to be accessible to the vast majority of our HBO-Cinemax subscribers within a few months. In fact, some form of TV Everywhere is now available to over 50 million homes, and we expect it will be available to 70 million by the second quarter of next year. That's six months ahead of plan.
In Film, content everywhere means enabling consumers to buy a movie once and then access it everywhere on a wide variety of devices. As we talked about with you before, digital is good for the Home Entertainment business. It's more convenient for consumers, and it generates higher gross profits for us. Video-on-demand movie rentals have been growing at a rapid rate recently but so far, electronic sales have lagged. The problem is it just isn't convenient for consumers to buy digital movies and then try to watch them on their TVs and move them from device to device. So we're leading the industry on several initiatives that seek to change that by improving the buying experience and expanding the suite of rights that consumers get when they purchase a movie or a television show. 
One of these is the ultraviolet consortium. Ultraviolet, which has broad backing from studios, consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers, will allow consumers to buy movies from a huge variety of retailers and then to access them at no extra charge across a broad array of apps and devices, wherever and whenever they want. It should make digital ownership just as compelling and convenient as owning a DVD, if not more so. We can't be more specific about the plans for ultraviolet today, but you can expect to hear a lot more about it and related initiatives in the coming months.
Finally, in magazines. Content Everywhere means offering our subscribers a convenient, attractively priced way of enjoying our titles in prints and enhanced electronic versions across as many devices as possible. If you download an iPad version of one of our Time Inc. magazines, you know that it's a rich and compelling consumer experience. As you'd expect, we want to offer our customers a range of purchase options, including single copy sales, digital subscriptions and combined print and digital subscriptions. Right now, for example, subscribers to People's print edition can now access the People iPad app for free.
In the near future, we expect to announce deals with other tablet makers that offer our readers flexible ways to access all our electronic titles. We're confident that as the competition increases in that space, every tablet manufacturer will want to give its consumers the same range of choices and the same value.
Speaking of Publishing, before I pass it off to John, I'd like to comment on an important management change that we made during the quarter. We recently appointed Jack Griffin as the new CFO of Time Inc. As you know, Jack is succeeding Anne Moore, and Anne is retiring after for more than 33 years of outstanding service to the company. Over her tenure, Anne grew and launched some of the biggest, most important and most profitable titles in history titles like People, In Style and Real Simple. She made an indelible mark on both Time Warner and on the magazine industry.
Now Jack just started a month ago, but all of us are excited about the energy and expertise he brings. It's already clear to everyone who has met him why he's one of the most highly regarded executives in the Publishing business. 
So wrapping up, we're performing very well on the near term, and we're very focused on the decisions that we make today that will drive value over the long term. Digital distribution clearly present some challenges to our company and to the industry, but we think it clearly offers even greater opportunities. We're excited about the progress we're making, and we're looking forward to sharing more of the details in the coming months. 
Now I'd like to hand it off to John."
24689,113994023,84798,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation,",2809,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.
Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation, particularly with regard to returns to shareholders. We've continued to execute on both fronts, and we are very, very pleased with our progress to date. Because of some tough comparisons coming into the quarter, we expected that the third quarter would be the slowest quarter of the year for us in terms of year-over-year growth, yet it ended up that we posted some pretty good results for the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 5% year-over-year and just a quick note, those results did include the benefit of a $58 million or $0.05 per share related to the reversal of a litigation reserve at Turner.
On a year-to-date basis, we've grown adjusted operating income 18% and adjusted EPS 36%. That's ahead of our own expectations, allowing us, once again, as Jeff said, we're raising our 2010 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s. So we're on track to deliver well north of 60% EPS growth in just the last two years.
From a capital plan standpoint, we're also executing according to our plan. For the first nine months, we generated about $2 billion in free cash flow, and we've returned more than 100% of that to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases so far this year. And if you look at over the past 12 months, we've returned nearly $3 billion in dividends and share repurchases.
Moving on to the next slide, which shows our consolidated third quarter financial results. Total revenues were up 2%. And underneath that, Subscription revenues continues to be a very consistent growth driver for us, up 7% in the quarter. Advertising growth was strong again, up 9%. Content revenues fell 5% in the quarter, but that was largely due to some very difficult theatrical comparisons that we had in our film studio. 
Total expenses, which include cost of revenues, SG&A and depreciation and amortization were almost flat in the quarter, and this is continued evidence of our focus on improving our operating efficiency. We've been keeping a lid on SG&A, allowing us to invest even more in Content and Other revenue generating areas. Adjusted operating income margins were also up modestly year-over-year in the quarter, and margins are up a full 200 basis points on a year-to-date basis. And we expect them to increase, again, in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EPS grew 17%, benefiting from earnings growth, a lower tax rate and fewer shares due to ongoing repurchases. We lowered our recurring effective tax rate due to a larger share of our earnings now coming from international territories, as well as some successful proactive tax planning. So we now expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 37% on a go-forward basis as opposed to the 38% that we previously anticipated.
Let me now turn to our segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks division. Here, we saw another quarter of really, really terrific revenue growth at both Turner and HBO, as well as strong adjusted operating income growth of 17%. Our results at this segment remain consistently strong, and we've grown revenue year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of the recession in 2008. That's a testament to the strength of our Networks and the consistency of its Subscription revenue base, which grew 9% in the quarter.
We did have about 200 basis points of that growth being contributed from the consolidation of certain international operation, so I just wanted to quickly highlight that. Let me take a moment now to comment about HBO specifically where we're, once again, on track for another record year of both revenue and profits. Looking at the subscriber picture for a moment, however, right now, we expect our year-end subscriber count to be approximately 1.5 million lower than what we reported at the end of 2009, and let me go into why that's the case. 
That's due largely to unusual promotional activity by two of our distributors. First, the majority of that loss was from non-revenue-generating Cinemax subscribers that are rolling off a very aggressive retail promotion at Dish last year; and second, we've also experienced declines at another major distributor where we're currently out of contract, so we haven't benefited from normal and usual promotional activity, and we're hopeful that this situation resolves itself in a positive way in the not-too-distant future. And of course, the tough economic backdrop isn't helping.
This year, we're not seeing the usual positive impact on subscribers from normal household formation as we've seen in most years as household formation has been quite a bit lower this year in the U.S. So importantly, these subscriber losses are almost all non-revenue-generating subscribers and by contrast, our revenue-generating HBO subscriber base has been stable over the past year. And you can see that, that's evident in our Subscription revenue growth, once again, this quarter. I also want to stress that we haven't really seen any evidence of court cutting relating to over-the-top competitors. And to the contrary, we continue to see increasing penetration from those distributors and affiliates that are focused on premium TV. And I'd also just -- one more quick highlight, HBO does have, as a quick note, over 80 million subscribers worldwide with more than 40 million outside of the U.S., and we're continuing to see very vibrant growth there.
Turning to Advertising for a minute where we saw revenues grow 10% in the quarter. And here, international transactions contributed several hundred basis points to that growth. Our domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scatter demand and ongoing yield management. Domestic entertainment Networks, together with kids and young adults, grew Advertising in the high-single digits. This was partly offset by a decline at domestic news due to the audience declines.
Core Advertising growth at our international Networks was approximately 25%. Adjusted operating income, again, grew significantly faster internationally than domestically, and that's a trend that we expect will continue in the coming quarters and years. Our international margins also expanded approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. 
Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect to see Advertising growth accelerate as the benefits of this year's strong upfront kick in. Demand from advertisers remains robust, pushing scatter pricing up 15% to 20% overall most at recent upfront. Adjusted operating income was up 17% in the quarter with margins expanding nearly 250 basis points year-over-year.
Looking ahead, we expect margins to expand modestly at the Networks division in the fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to expect programming costs growth to be in the mid-single digits as we continue to execute on our strategy of investing in high-quality content. So to sum up here, given the strong top line performance to-date and the encouraging Advertising trends that should translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division for our 2010, and in its entirety. 
Now let me move on to Film. Coming into the quarter, we expected that adjusted operating income at this division would decline year-over-year, and that was due to top theatrical comparisons. And you may recall that last year's third quarter benefited from having Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the late June release of The Hangover. 
G&A was also higher in the current quarter due to the timing and mix of theatrical releases and the shift toward international self-distribution of new line titles. Nevertheless, this comparison masks some really bright spots in the quarter. And as Jeff said, Inception was a blockbuster, and it's generated more than $800 million now at the global box office. And we benefited from the off network television sales of Two and A Half Men and the New Adventures of Old Christine. Just as importantly, the success of The Big Bang Theory on Thursday nights has further solidified the outlook for our television revenues in the coming years. 
And again, as Jeff mentioned, we're seeing some very promising performances from several of our new and returning TV shows. Home entertainment revenues were up slightly in the quarter, and they're now up 8% on a year-to-date basis, and we remain very focused on driving higher margin products, and we've seen it pay off in recent quarters, and that's evidenced by growth in Blu-ray, Video-on-Demand and electronic sell-through. Warner Bros. has been building on its leading position across all of these categories, increasing its share of the home entertainment category by well over 200 basis points year-to-date. As these revenue lines continue to grow, we expect home-video margins to further improve as well.
Looking forward, we are very, very optimistic about our fourth quarter theatrical slate, which includes Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows, that's the first part and then Due Date. And with adjusted operating income up 1% on a year-to-date basis here at this division despite very, very tough comparisons against record results in 2009, we believe we're on track for another great year at Warner Bros.
Let me move on to Publishing where we've continue to drive up margins through effective operational improvements and cost controls. Advertising revenues continue to recover, increasing 5% in the quarter and there, digital Advertising was particularly strong, growing over 20% in the quarter. Looking across Time Inc.'s three primary operating units, its style and entertainment unit and the lifestyle units grew Advertising in the quarter, and that was offset by a modest decline at news, and that was largely due to magazine closures that occurred in the prior year.
Style and entertainment continues to be our strongest performing group by far. Our Advertising growth comparisons do get more difficult in the fourth quarter, and I also wanted to highlight that in addition, based on a deal that was completed a little bit earlier this year, Turner is now managing SI.com and Golf.com for Time Inc. And as a result, Time Inc. is not going to be booking the Advertising revenues generated by these sites starting in the fourth quarter. So that, coupled with the difficult comparisons, may make year-over-year growth in Advertising, tough to achieve at this division.
However, we still expect Advertising to be up for the full year. As we've anticipated, Subscription revenues were down 5% in the quarter and about half of this decline was due to unfavorable FX. Domestic Subscription and newsstand sales also fell modestly. 
Looking ahead to the next quarter, we expect FX once again to be somewhat of a drag on description revenue, and we also expect continued pressure on Subscription and newsstand comparisons are going to get more difficult. So all in all, we anticipate a similar year-over-year decline in Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter at Time Inc. 
Operating income was up 45% in the third quarter, and margins increased 500 basis points year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter in a row of margin improvement at Time Inc, and so we're pleased with that. Total expenses were down almost $60 million year-over-year, and that was reflected operational improvements and cost initiatives, including lower pension expenses.
We should continue to see the benefit of those initiatives in the fourth quarter, and restructuring charges will also be down significantly year-over-year in Q4. So we expect another quarter of solid growth in operating income at Time Inc.
So with the division review completed, let's look to the consolidated outlook. We continue to be very encouraged by the strength of our results for the first nine months, and we're continuing to invest more in programming in TV and film production, and that investment should make the company stronger for the future. But at the same time, we've been able to deliver very strong near-term financial results. Our solid execution has given us confidence once again to raise the full year outlook. And as we put in our release this morning, we now expect adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s, and that's off of a base of $1.83 last year. Our full year outlook has continued to strengthen throughout the year, and we now expect to grow revenues by more than $1 billion year-over-year in 2010, and that's the best result we've had in several years.
We're also aggressively managing our expenses and investments, and so let me talk about what I mean by that. Overall for the year, expenses will likely be up only in the low-single digits. But we're fully investing in our best businesses to drive growth, and this is evidenced by a high single-digit increase in our investment in programming, including originals and sports, television and film production and marketing. And at the same time, we expect the rest of our expenses to be down in the low- to mid-single digits, and that's how we're improving margins and that's how we're improving returns, while we're still investing for the future. 
Let me turn now and look at free cash flow very, very briefly. So let's turn to the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated $2 billion of free cash flow, that's a healthy conversion over 40% of adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, and it's almost 100% of adjusted income from continuing operations. The increase in working capital as you see here includes a $250 million payment related to the resolution of some litigation, as well as a $70 million payment made to the NCAA tied to the beginning of the March Madness contract, which will be next year. Factoring out these two payments, our free cash flow actually compared to last year is down only very slightly, and that's due to an increase in accounts receivable tied to revenue growth, as well as higher cash taxes and cash interest. 
We expect and we'll continue to maintain a high conversion rate of both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted income from continuing operations and some free cash flow. So let me move on to the final slide here, which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with about $12.5 billion in net debt, and that's up about $1.1 billion compared to the end of last year, and it's up slightly compared to the second quarter. The increase is a result of us returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders year-to-date, and we've also spent almost $600 million to date on acquisitions. And we paid premiums and transactions costs that total about $370 million, and that's related to the redemptions of debt securities previously announced. 
International expansion remains one of our top priorities as a company, and that's reflected in how we're allocating capital. About 80% of our M&A activity has been on international Cable Networks, and we've continued to invest in international Cable Networks at Turner, which closed recently on two acquisitions. The first was a company named MMG. It's a Scandinavian channel group where we see a nice opportunity to strengthen our position in the region. And we've also recently added Chilevisión one of the leading broadcasters in Chile to our already strong Latin American business. 
Warner Bros. also expanded its international footprint with the recent acquisition of Shed Media, a leading TV producer in the U.K., and this acquisition is part of its strategy to grow international local language production. All of these acquisitions were done at attractive prices and for reasonable multiples, and they should help drive further international growth.
So with only one quarter left in the year, we are on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to improve their strategic position and drive long-term growth. That's evidenced by our increased investment and programming production and marketing this year. 
Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned, we've now returned over $2.2 billion so far this year, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases. And including our regular dividend, we've had a fairly consistent return of approximately $750 million a quarter recently, and we may look to grow that over time. 
And third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing our debt maturities. Our leverage ratio is now about 2x. That's still a bit below our long-term target of 2.5x. But today, we consider the strategic flexibility to be a competitive advantage in the current environment. So we remain comfortable operating in this range at least for the time being. Looking out over the next five years, we have less than $2.5 billion in total debt maturities, so we feel really good about how we're positioned there as well. 
So that concludes my proactive remarks. Let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call."

I'll take the first part of the question in the order which you asked. The first thing I guess I would say just to repeat what you said is part of the question, which is just a reminder for everybody that the majority of our Networks are fully distributed in the U.S. And so over time, we would expect that they will follow, in terms of numbers of subscribers, what ends up happening as it relates to the overall multi-channel household universe, which has been mature for some time. In terms of giving additional clarity with respect to recent trends, though, I'm afraid we'll probably not going to be able to do that. In fact, I would suspect that the distributors themselves would be the first to report that because the way that we get our information at the Networks from the distributors tends to be on a couple of month lag basis. And so while we would fully expect to be up year-over-year, I'm just not sure that we have the most recent information as it relates to sequential trending. So I would say we'll have to wait and get better information over the next couple of months because the last information we have is probably really just the beginning of the third quarter."

If you look at TV viewing across all the different Networks, it's a very healthy picture, ratings, programming quality, the strength of these brands. So I guess the most important thing and we've been fairly outspoken about it is that if you take all of these Networks, not just ours but the industry, and you have them on demand, we've seen how powerful it is at HBO. I think we're about to see how powerful it is when you can watch whatever your favorite network is on all kinds of devices on demand and on your TV set, that's going to strength in TV viewing. It's probably going to not lead to any cord cutting. Now in the long run, with viewers preference is being clear that they love all these Networks, if you have to reach them through some other distribution than the one that we currently have, then that's how the content industry will evolve. But I don't think that's likely to happen. If it does happen, we think that the Network business is very strong in either case."

So I mean, as we look at it, obviously, the subscriber numbers are instructive and illustrative, but they're just subscriber figures and what we're really more focused on is making money and driving revenue growth. And if you look at the Subscription revenue trends at HBO, they have been and continue to be extremely healthy. And so we wanted to provide some transparency with respect to the direction of the subscriber numbers. But we do not believe it's going to translate into any softness or weakness in Subscription revenues. And so that's what's most important. So I understand your question.

I think that the sub trends at HBO, the underlying paid sub trends are healthy and good from my point by point of view looking forward. And we always have a band of promotional subs depending on what affiliates giving away Cinemax subs for very low prices. We are still in the band. We, basically, are used to, although our promotional subs is about 10% to 15%. And so this basically lines up with various deal renewals and some of the leverage that gets put into play. I think HBO is in very solid shape. It's just a function of promotional and deal renewal activity. So on the question you raised about HBO going direct, we do have the ability to do that. And it's not something that we have decided to do today because as you've said, we have a very good relationship and very good position where HBO occupies the position that it does in all of the TV and video packages for all the different distributors. There's a lot of marketing customer service and so on benefits that go with that. And I think the questions we already had about vigorous launch of HBO GO are important to seeing all of us get HBO out there and get it in the hands of all of our subs.

So far, all the choices we made and what we've done, what we haven't done and this can vary show by show, have been we've actually found an alliance calculation between what's best for Warner and what, say, would be best for HBO and Turner in the long-term industry structure.

And in fact, last quarter, year-to-date, we've issued about $5 billion in the public debt markets at very, very attractive rates. And that has allowed us to push out our maturity on average by about four years, while at the same time, and this is rare when you can do this, we lowered our average interest costs by about $60 million a year. And all of that was done to take advantage of the interest rate environment and to frankly, increase our flexibility. And as I mentioned in my proactive remarks, you look out over the next five years, we've only got about two -- less than $2.5 billion of total maturities coming due. So we've got outstanding liquidity with no near-term maturities, which is a really nice place to be and more broadly speaking from a capital allocation standpoint, we think about our leverage target and the context of overall capital allocation, and it's really about making sure that we're preserving adequate flexibility, making sure that we have constant access to the capital markets at attractive prices and at the same time, optimizing returns. And if you look at how we approach capital allocation that's exactly what we've been doing, and we've taken a very consistent and balanced approach between strengthening the balance sheet, which we did mostly last year, having a meaningful buyback program, complement a meaningful dividend at the same time, engaging it to try to grow the businesses through M&A.

So it's basically, I think you may have had either a question or a premise about different Internet at higher rates. That's not the case on TV Everywhere ad sales and remember the loads are going to be the same and on all the Networks whether you're watching a show on Turner on demand on TV or on broadband. In the C3 window, it's the same ads, it's the same feed. So we're agnostic and so are the advertisers. In the world of VOD, which is the more delayed, the last week or the last three or four episodes, the industry in general whether on TV or on broadband is supporting on an ad model. I think there's a lot to be figured out there, but it probably won't distinguish between watching an ad on a Turner show from whether it's on a TV VOD or an Internet VOD version of a TNT show will probably be the same box."

First of all, as you think about the growth prospects of this division on a go-forward basis. We're coming at it from a position where we've retrenched in profits quite a bit as we went into the Advertising downturn. And so we've been able to maintain margin and grow this year's margin by virtue of a lot of the operational improvement initiatives that you highlighted in your question. If you think about it on a going-forward basis, I think there are numerous avenues of growth. First, I would say traditional print Advertising where we're still in I would say, hopefully the early days of what's a cyclical rebound and a cyclical recovery. And everybody knows that the economy has improved. Our print Advertising is not as strong as our TV Advertising. But nevertheless, we have a lot of confidence in our brands, and we think that we can drive Advertising over the foreseeable future in our print brands. I think Subscription trends are challenging but stable. And so I don't think that there's going to be any major source of downward trend there. It's going to be more stable, can we grow it. I think that's the challenge for our company in the industry. I think there's a huge longer-term opportunity in digital magazines, magazines on tablets, all sorts of brand extensions. But the too long an answer for this call. And then your question, which is really on operational improvements, the division has done a tremendous job over the last several years of reorganizing and re-engineering the way they do business and pulling out literally hundreds of millions of dollars of fixed cost that's not going to go back into the business. I think that operational engineering and improvement is a way of life at that division, and I would anticipate that there are further opportunities that we will explore over time. I would just note that with Jack Griffin now coming on board and just recognizing that he's only been at Time Inc. for a few weeks we'll obviously be working very, very closely with Jack and interested in his ideas as we look to continue to improve not only the top line, but margin opportunity there as well.

We had another strong quarter, and we're on track for another terrific year. More important, we're positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that digital distribution will bring. This quarter, Turner, again, posed a double-digit advertising growth. We're continuing to benefit from strong demand for our inventory on TNT and TBS. And while we have ratings challenges at CNN that we are addressing, we've had solid ratings growth at several of our other Networks, including truTV, Turner and Adult Swim.
We saw outstanding results from our most important new content this quarter. On TNT, our new show, Rizzoli & Isles, became the number one original series of all time on ad-supported Cable. On HBO, Boardwalk Empire is on track to become the most watched first year series in the network's history.
At Warner Bros, our blockbuster movie, Inception, generated over $800 million at the global box office, and we're having a great start to new television season. In addition to the success of our returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and The Mentalist, a new show, Mike & Molly, is the number one new comedy on TV. 
Looking forward, we expect improved ratings performance at our biggest entertainment Networks in the fourth quarter, driven by our strong lineup of original, the debut of Conan's new show next Monday and outstanding recent performance from our sports program. In fact, our coverage of the Major League Baseball American League championship series was the most watched league championship ever on TBS. And NBA Opening Night was the most watched regular season NBA game ever on Cable TV. This should enable us to continue capitalize on the solid demand in the scatter market, with pricing up 15% to 20% over the healthy prices that we saw in the 2010, 2011 upfront.
And we're excited about the films that we're premiering this month. As you all know, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows opens in a few weeks. And just this weekend, we're opening Due Date from the Hangover Director, Todd Phillips, which could be another sleeper hit. All that momentum gives us the confidence to, again, raise our full year outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at a rate in the high 20s over 2009. And last year was a year when we grew adjusted earnings per share by 29%.
John will walk you through the results in detail in a few minutes. But overall, it's shaping up to be another very good year. I'd like to shift gears now and update you on a bigger picture issue that has made plenty of headlines in the way and that's the impact of digital distribution on our businesses. Clearly, digital distribution present some new challenges for the industry, but we believe that the opportunities significantly outweigh the risks. The unequivocal good news is that digital distribution offers consumers a better experience, with more choice, more convenience and more control. As a result, there's more demand than ever for the kind of high-quality content that we make, and it's a testament to that demand that so many companies are devoting so many resources to finding new ways to distribute and monetize our films and our TV shows and magazines.
The question, of course, is how do we take advantage of these opportunities in a way that both enhances the consumer experience and enhances our economics. First, we're supporting an array of Networks to allow consumers to access Time Warner content on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want in a way that's attractive and convenient for them and economically beneficial for us. In other words, buy our content once and use it in multiple places. Think of it as content everywhere. I'll talk more about this idea in a moment.
And second, we're experimenting with new business models that enable consumers to use and access our content in ways they couldn't before. As just one example of that, we will help lead the industry to launch a premium video-on-demand service that will enable consumers to watch recently released theatrical movies at home in high definition and eventually, in 3D. We're near agreement with our distributors on the right window and the right price point, and we expect to start offering our movies this way nationwide by the second quarter of next year.
Let me come back to this idea of content everywhere. It means something slightly different in TV, film and magazine, so I'd like to touch on each of those. In TV Networks and production, it means TV Everywhere. And as you know, TV Everywhere is a framework to provide TV subscribers with a huge array of TV content, everything on the dial and have it on demand on a wide variety of devices for television, the PC, tablets, mobile devices at no extra charge. TV Everywhere promises to give consumers that flexibility while also bolstering an ecosystem that has produced such high-quality programs and so much choice. 
A year ago, there was vibrant debate about whether free was a good business model. TV Everywhere was just a concept, and many argued that it wouldn't work. So where are we now? TV Everywhere has made tremendous progress in a very short period of time. Today, there is widespread acknowledgment among content providers that free ad-supported websites cannot replace powerful dual revenue stream business models. But it's being adopted across the industry faster than anyone expected. 
Every major programmer has announced plans to participate. CBS, Discovery, Disney, Liberty, NBC Universal, News Corp, Scripts, Viacom, among others. As one important step, just last week, Disney launched authenticated versions of ESPN and ESPN 3  in most Time Warner Cable markets. In the last few weeks, we've launched TV Everywhere versions of TNT and TBS across the entire footprints of both Comcast and Dish, and we have many more announcements pending.
We also have several deals pending for HBO GO and MAX GO, and now expect the services to be accessible to the vast majority of our HBO-Cinemax subscribers within a few months. In fact, some form of TV Everywhere is now available to over 50 million homes, and we expect it will be available to 70 million by the second quarter of next year. That's six months ahead of plan.
In Film, content everywhere means enabling consumers to buy a movie once and then access it everywhere on a wide variety of devices. As we talked about with you before, digital is good for the Home Entertainment business. It's more convenient for consumers, and it generates higher gross profits for us. Video-on-demand movie rentals have been growing at a rapid rate recently but so far, electronic sales have lagged. The problem is it just isn't convenient for consumers to buy digital movies and then try to watch them on their TVs and move them from device to device. So we're leading the industry on several initiatives that seek to change that by improving the buying experience and expanding the suite of rights that consumers get when they purchase a movie or a television show. 
One of these is the ultraviolet consortium. Ultraviolet, which has broad backing from studios, consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers, will allow consumers to buy movies from a huge variety of retailers and then to access them at no extra charge across a broad array of apps and devices, wherever and whenever they want. It should make digital ownership just as compelling and convenient as owning a DVD, if not more so. We can't be more specific about the plans for ultraviolet today, but you can expect to hear a lot more about it and related initiatives in the coming months.
Finally, in magazines. Content Everywhere means offering our subscribers a convenient, attractively priced way of enjoying our titles in prints and enhanced electronic versions across as many devices as possible. If you download an iPad version of one of our Time Inc. magazines, you know that it's a rich and compelling consumer experience. As you'd expect, we want to offer our customers a range of purchase options, including single copy sales, digital subscriptions and combined print and digital subscriptions. Right now, for example, subscribers to People's print edition can now access the People iPad app for free.
In the near future, we expect to announce deals with other tablet makers that offer our readers flexible ways to access all our electronic titles. We're confident that as the competition increases in that space, every tablet manufacturer will want to give its consumers the same range of choices and the same value.
Speaking of Publishing, before I pass it off to John, I'd like to comment on an important management change that we made during the quarter. We recently appointed Jack Griffin as the new CFO of Time Inc. As you know, Jack is succeeding Anne Moore, and Anne is retiring after for more than 33 years of outstanding service to the company. Over her tenure, Anne grew and launched some of the biggest, most important and most profitable titles in history titles like People, In Style and Real Simple. She made an indelible mark on both Time Warner and on the magazine industry.
Now Jack just started a month ago, but all of us are excited about the energy and expertise he brings. It's already clear to everyone who has met him why he's one of the most highly regarded executives in the Publishing business. 
So wrapping up, we're performing very well on the near term, and we're very focused on the decisions that we make today that will drive value over the long term. Digital distribution clearly present some challenges to our company and to the industry, but we think it clearly offers even greater opportunities. We're excited about the progress we're making, and we're looking forward to sharing more of the details in the coming months. 
Now I'd like to hand it off to John.

I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation,",2809,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.
Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation, particularly with regard to returns to shareholders. We've continued to execute on both fronts, and we are very, very pleased with our progress to date. Because of some tough comparisons coming into the quarter, we expected that the third quarter would be the slowest quarter of the year for us in terms of year-over-year growth, yet it ended up that we posted some pretty good results for the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 5% year-over-year and just a quick note, those results did include the benefit of a $58 million or $0.05 per share related to the reversal of a litigation reserve at Turner.
On a year-to-date basis, we've grown adjusted operating income 18% and adjusted EPS 36%. That's ahead of our own expectations, allowing us, once again, as Jeff said, we're raising our 2010 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s. So we're on track to deliver well north of 60% EPS growth in just the last two years.
From a capital plan standpoint, we're also executing according to our plan. For the first nine months, we generated about $2 billion in free cash flow, and we've returned more than 100% of that to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases so far this year. And if you look at over the past 12 months, we've returned nearly $3 billion in dividends and share repurchases.
Moving on to the next slide, which shows our consolidated third quarter financial results. Total revenues were up 2%. And underneath that, Subscription revenues continues to be a very consistent growth driver for us, up 7% in the quarter. Advertising growth was strong again, up 9%. Content revenues fell 5% in the quarter, but that was largely due to some very difficult theatrical comparisons that we had in our film studio. 
Total expenses, which include cost of revenues, SG&A and depreciation and amortization were almost flat in the quarter, and this is continued evidence of our focus on improving our operating efficiency. We've been keeping a lid on SG&A, allowing us to invest even more in Content and Other revenue generating areas. Adjusted operating income margins were also up modestly year-over-year in the quarter, and margins are up a full 200 basis points on a year-to-date basis. And we expect them to increase, again, in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EPS grew 17%, benefiting from earnings growth, a lower tax rate and fewer shares due to ongoing repurchases. We lowered our recurring effective tax rate due to a larger share of our earnings now coming from international territories, as well as some successful proactive tax planning. So we now expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 37% on a go-forward basis as opposed to the 38% that we previously anticipated.
Let me now turn to our segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks division. Here, we saw another quarter of really, really terrific revenue growth at both Turner and HBO, as well as strong adjusted operating income growth of 17%. Our results at this segment remain consistently strong, and we've grown revenue year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of the recession in 2008. That's a testament to the strength of our Networks and the consistency of its Subscription revenue base, which grew 9% in the quarter.
We did have about 200 basis points of that growth being contributed from the consolidation of certain international operation, so I just wanted to quickly highlight that. Let me take a moment now to comment about HBO specifically where we're, once again, on track for another record year of both revenue and profits. Looking at the subscriber picture for a moment, however, right now, we expect our year-end subscriber count to be approximately 1.5 million lower than what we reported at the end of 2009, and let me go into why that's the case. 
That's due largely to unusual promotional activity by two of our distributors. First, the majority of that loss was from non-revenue-generating Cinemax subscribers that are rolling off a very aggressive retail promotion at Dish last year; and second, we've also experienced declines at another major distributor where we're currently out of contract, so we haven't benefited from normal and usual promotional activity, and we're hopeful that this situation resolves itself in a positive way in the not-too-distant future. And of course, the tough economic backdrop isn't helping.
This year, we're not seeing the usual positive impact on subscribers from normal household formation as we've seen in most years as household formation has been quite a bit lower this year in the U.S. So importantly, these subscriber losses are almost all non-revenue-generating subscribers and by contrast, our revenue-generating HBO subscriber base has been stable over the past year. And you can see that, that's evident in our Subscription revenue growth, once again, this quarter. I also want to stress that we haven't really seen any evidence of court cutting relating to over-the-top competitors. And to the contrary, we continue to see increasing penetration from those distributors and affiliates that are focused on premium TV. And I'd also just -- one more quick highlight, HBO does have, as a quick note, over 80 million subscribers worldwide with more than 40 million outside of the U.S., and we're continuing to see very vibrant growth there.
Turning to Advertising for a minute where we saw revenues grow 10% in the quarter. And here, international transactions contributed several hundred basis points to that growth. Our domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scatter demand and ongoing yield management. Domestic entertainment Networks, together with kids and young adults, grew Advertising in the high-single digits. This was partly offset by a decline at domestic news due to the audience declines.
Core Advertising growth at our international Networks was approximately 25%. Adjusted operating income, again, grew significantly faster internationally than domestically, and that's a trend that we expect will continue in the coming quarters and years. Our international margins also expanded approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. 
Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect to see Advertising growth accelerate as the benefits of this year's strong upfront kick in. Demand from advertisers remains robust, pushing scatter pricing up 15% to 20% overall most at recent upfront. Adjusted operating income was up 17% in the quarter with margins expanding nearly 250 basis points year-over-year.
Looking ahead, we expect margins to expand modestly at the Networks division in the fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to expect programming costs growth to be in the mid-single digits as we continue to execute on our strategy of investing in high-quality content. So to sum up here, given the strong top line performance to-date and the encouraging Advertising trends that should translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division for our 2010, and in its entirety. 
Now let me move on to Film. Coming into the quarter, we expected that adjusted operating income at this division would decline year-over-year, and that was due to top theatrical comparisons. And you may recall that last year's third quarter benefited from having Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the late June release of The Hangover. 
G&A was also higher in the current quarter due to the timing and mix of theatrical releases and the shift toward international self-distribution of new line titles. Nevertheless, this comparison masks some really bright spots in the quarter. And as Jeff said, Inception was a blockbuster, and it's generated more than $800 million now at the global box office. And we benefited from the off network television sales of Two and A Half Men and the New Adventures of Old Christine. Just as importantly, the success of The Big Bang Theory on Thursday nights has further solidified the outlook for our television revenues in the coming years. 
And again, as Jeff mentioned, we're seeing some very promising performances from several of our new and returning TV shows. Home entertainment revenues were up slightly in the quarter, and they're now up 8% on a year-to-date basis, and we remain very focused on driving higher margin products, and we've seen it pay off in recent quarters, and that's evidenced by growth in Blu-ray, Video-on-Demand and electronic sell-through. Warner Bros. has been building on its leading position across all of these categories, increasing its share of the home entertainment category by well over 200 basis points year-to-date. As these revenue lines continue to grow, we expect home-video margins to further improve as well.
Looking forward, we are very, very optimistic about our fourth quarter theatrical slate, which includes Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows, that's the first part and then Due Date. And with adjusted operating income up 1% on a year-to-date basis here at this division despite very, very tough comparisons against record results in 2009, we believe we're on track for another great year at Warner Bros.
Let me move on to Publishing where we've continue to drive up margins through effective operational improvements and cost controls. Advertising revenues continue to recover, increasing 5% in the quarter and there, digital Advertising was particularly strong, growing over 20% in the quarter. Looking across Time Inc.'s three primary operating units, its style and entertainment unit and the lifestyle units grew Advertising in the quarter, and that was offset by a modest decline at news, and that was largely due to magazine closures that occurred in the prior year.
Style and entertainment continues to be our strongest performing group by far. Our Advertising growth comparisons do get more difficult in the fourth quarter, and I also wanted to highlight that in addition, based on a deal that was completed a little bit earlier this year, Turner is now managing SI.com and Golf.com for Time Inc. And as a result, Time Inc. is not going to be booking the Advertising revenues generated by these sites starting in the fourth quarter. So that, coupled with the difficult comparisons, may make year-over-year growth in Advertising, tough to achieve at this division.
However, we still expect Advertising to be up for the full year. As we've anticipated, Subscription revenues were down 5% in the quarter and about half of this decline was due to unfavorable FX. Domestic Subscription and newsstand sales also fell modestly. 
Looking ahead to the next quarter, we expect FX once again to be somewhat of a drag on description revenue, and we also expect continued pressure on Subscription and newsstand comparisons are going to get more difficult. So all in all, we anticipate a similar year-over-year decline in Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter at Time Inc. 
Operating income was up 45% in the third quarter, and margins increased 500 basis points year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter in a row of margin improvement at Time Inc, and so we're pleased with that. Total expenses were down almost $60 million year-over-year, and that was reflected operational improvements and cost initiatives, including lower pension expenses.
We should continue to see the benefit of those initiatives in the fourth quarter, and restructuring charges will also be down significantly year-over-year in Q4. So we expect another quarter of solid growth in operating income at Time Inc.
So with the division review completed, let's look to the consolidated outlook. We continue to be very encouraged by the strength of our results for the first nine months, and we're continuing to invest more in programming in TV and film production, and that investment should make the company stronger for the future. But at the same time, we've been able to deliver very strong near-term financial results. Our solid execution has given us confidence once again to raise the full year outlook. And as we put in our release this morning, we now expect adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s, and that's off of a base of $1.83 last year. Our full year outlook has continued to strengthen throughout the year, and we now expect to grow revenues by more than $1 billion year-over-year in 2010, and that's the best result we've had in several years.
We're also aggressively managing our expenses and investments, and so let me talk about what I mean by that. Overall for the year, expenses will likely be up only in the low-single digits. But we're fully investing in our best businesses to drive growth, and this is evidenced by a high single-digit increase in our investment in programming, including originals and sports, television and film production and marketing. And at the same time, we expect the rest of our expenses to be down in the low- to mid-single digits, and that's how we're improving margins and that's how we're improving returns, while we're still investing for the future. 
Let me turn now and look at free cash flow very, very briefly. So let's turn to the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated $2 billion of free cash flow, that's a healthy conversion over 40% of adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, and it's almost 100% of adjusted income from continuing operations. The increase in working capital as you see here includes a $250 million payment related to the resolution of some litigation, as well as a $70 million payment made to the NCAA tied to the beginning of the March Madness contract, which will be next year. Factoring out these two payments, our free cash flow actually compared to last year is down only very slightly, and that's due to an increase in accounts receivable tied to revenue growth, as well as higher cash taxes and cash interest. 
We expect and we'll continue to maintain a high conversion rate of both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted income from continuing operations and some free cash flow. So let me move on to the final slide here, which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with about $12.5 billion in net debt, and that's up about $1.1 billion compared to the end of last year, and it's up slightly compared to the second quarter. The increase is a result of us returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders year-to-date, and we've also spent almost $600 million to date on acquisitions. And we paid premiums and transactions costs that total about $370 million, and that's related to the redemptions of debt securities previously announced. 
International expansion remains one of our top priorities as a company, and that's reflected in how we're allocating capital. About 80% of our M&A activity has been on international Cable Networks, and we've continued to invest in international Cable Networks at Turner, which closed recently on two acquisitions. The first was a company named MMG. It's a Scandinavian channel group where we see a nice opportunity to strengthen our position in the region. And we've also recently added Chilevisión one of the leading broadcasters in Chile to our already strong Latin American business. 
Warner Bros. also expanded its international footprint with the recent acquisition of Shed Media, a leading TV producer in the U.K., and this acquisition is part of its strategy to grow international local language production. All of these acquisitions were done at attractive prices and for reasonable multiples, and they should help drive further international growth.
So with only one quarter left in the year, we are on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to improve their strategic position and drive long-term growth. That's evidenced by our increased investment and programming production and marketing this year. 
Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned, we've now returned over $2.2 billion so far this year, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases. And including our regular dividend, we've had a fairly consistent return of approximately $750 million a quarter recently, and we may look to grow that over time. 
And third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing our debt maturities. Our leverage ratio is now about 2x. That's still a bit below our long-term target of 2.5x. But today, we consider the strategic flexibility to be a competitive advantage in the current environment. So we remain comfortable operating in this range at least for the time being. Looking out over the next five years, we have less than $2.5 billion in total debt maturities, so we feel really good about how we're positioned there as well. 
So that concludes my proactive remarks. Let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call.

I'll take the first part of the question in the order which you asked. The first thing I guess I would say just to repeat what you said is part of the question, which is just a reminder for everybody that the majority of our Networks are fully distributed in the U.S. And so over time, we would expect that they will follow, in terms of numbers of subscribers, what ends up happening as it relates to the overall multi-channel household universe, which has been mature for some time. In terms of giving additional clarity with respect to recent trends, though, I'm afraid we'll probably not going to be able to do that. In fact, I would suspect that the distributors themselves would be the first to report that because the way that we get our information at the Networks from the distributors tends to be on a couple of month lag basis. And so while we would fully expect to be up year-over-year, I'm just not sure that we have the most recent information as it relates to sequential trending. So I would say we'll have to wait and get better information over the next couple of months because the last information we have is probably really just the beginning of the third quarter.

If you look at TV viewing across all the different Networks, it's a very healthy picture, ratings, programming quality, the strength of these brands. So I guess the most important thing and we've been fairly outspoken about it is that if you take all of these Networks, not just ours but the industry, and you have them on demand, we've seen how powerful it is at HBO. I think we're about to see how powerful it is when you can watch whatever your favorite network is on all kinds of devices on demand and on your TV set, that's going to strength in TV viewing. It's probably going to not lead to any cord cutting. Now in the long run, with viewers preference is being clear that they love all these Networks, if you have to reach them through some other distribution than the one that we currently have, then that's how the content industry will evolve. But I don't think that's likely to happen. If it does happen, we think that the Network business is very strong in either case.

And we always have a band of promotional subs depending on what affiliates giving away Cinemax subs for very low prices. We are still in the band. We, basically, are used to, although our promotional subs is about 10% to 15%. And so this basically lines up with various deal renewals and some of the leverage that gets put into play. I think HBO is in very solid shape. It's just a function of promotional and deal renewal activity. So on the question you raised about HBO going direct, we do have the ability to do that. And it's not something that we have decided to do today because as you've said, we have a very good relationship and very good position where HBO occupies the position that it does in all of the TV and video packages for all the different distributors.

And in fact, last quarter, year-to-date, we've issued about $5 billion in the public debt markets at very, very attractive rates. And that has allowed us to push out our maturity on average by about four years, while at the same time, and this is rare when you can do this, we lowered our average interest costs by about $60 million a year. And all of that was done to take advantage of the interest rate environment and to frankly, increase our flexibility. And as I mentioned in my proactive remarks, you look out over the next five years, we've only got about two -- less than $2.5 billion of total maturities coming due. So we've got outstanding liquidity with no near-term maturities, which is a really nice place to be and more broadly speaking from a capital allocation standpoint, we think about our leverage target and the context of overall capital allocation, and it's really about making sure that we're preserving adequate flexibility, making sure that we have constant access to the capital markets at attractive prices and at the same time, optimizing returns. And if you look at how we approach capital allocation that's exactly what we've been doing, and we've taken a very consistent and balanced approach between strengthening the balance sheet, which we did mostly last year, having a meaningful buyback program, complement a meaningful dividend at the same time, engaging it to try to grow the businesses through M&A. So we've taken a balanced and consistent approach, and we're going to continue to maintain that going forward.

I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about where the rights stand with your studio partners there.

So it's basically, I think you may have had either a question or a premise about different Internet at higher rates. That's not the case on TV Everywhere ad sales and remember the loads are going to be the same and on all the Networks whether you're watching a show on Turner on demand on TV or on broadband. In the C3 window, it's the same ads, it's the same feed. So we're agnostic and so are the advertisers. In the world of VOD, which is the more delayed, the last week or the last three or four episodes, the industry in general whether on TV or on broadband is supporting on an ad model. I think there's a lot to be figured out there, but it probably won't distinguish between watching an ad on a Turner show from whether it's on a TV VOD or an Internet VOD version of a TNT show will probably be the same box.

First of all, as you think about the growth prospects of this division on a go-forward basis. We're coming at it from a position where we've retrenched in profits quite a bit as we went into the Advertising downturn. And so we've been able to maintain margin and grow this year's margin by virtue of a lot of the operational improvement initiatives that you highlighted in your question. If you think about it on a going-forward basis, I think there are numerous avenues of growth. First, I would say traditional print Advertising where we're still in I would say, hopefully the early days of what's a cyclical rebound and a cyclical recovery. And everybody knows that the economy has improved. Our print Advertising is not as strong as our TV Advertising. But nevertheless, we have a lot of confidence in our brands, and we think that we can drive Advertising over the foreseeable future in our print brands. I think Subscription trends are challenging but stable. And so I don't think that there's going to be any major source of downward trend there. It's going to be more stable, can we grow it. I think that's the challenge for our company in the industry. I think there's a huge longer-term opportunity in digital magazines, magazines on tablets, all sorts of brand extensions. But the too long an answer for this call. And then your question, which is really on operational improvements, the division has done a tremendous job over the last several years of reorganizing and re-engineering the way they do business and pulling out literally hundreds of millions of dollars of fixed cost that's not going to go back into the business. I think that operational engineering and improvement is a way of life at that division, and I would anticipate that there are further opportunities that we will explore over time. I would just note that with Jack Griffin now coming on board and just recognizing that he's only been at Time Inc. for a few weeks we'll obviously be working very, very closely with Jack and interested in his ideas as we look to continue to improve not only the top line, but margin opportunity there as well. And so I won't go into a lot of the detail, but there are opportunities.

We had another strong quarter, and we're on track for another terrific year. More important, we're positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that digital distribution will bring. This quarter, Turner, again, posed a double-digit advertising growth. We're continuing to benefit from strong demand for our inventory on TNT and TBS. And while we have ratings challenges at CNN that we are addressing, we've had solid ratings growth at several of our other Networks, including truTV, Turner and Adult Swim.
We saw outstanding results from our most important new content this quarter. On TNT, our new show, Rizzoli & Isles, became the number one original series of all time on ad-supported Cable. On HBO, Boardwalk Empire is on track to become the most watched first year series in the network's history.
At Warner Bros, our blockbuster movie, Inception, generated over $800 million at the global box office, and we're having a great start to new television season. In addition to the success of our returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and The Mentalist, a new show, Mike & Molly, is the number one new comedy on TV. 
Looking forward, we expect improved ratings performance at our biggest entertainment Networks in the fourth quarter, driven by our strong lineup of original, the debut of Conan's new show next Monday and outstanding recent performance from our sports program. In fact, our coverage of the Major League Baseball American League championship series was the most watched league championship ever on TBS. And NBA Opening Night was the most watched regular season NBA game ever on Cable TV. This should enable us to continue capitalize on the solid demand in the scatter market, with pricing up 15% to 20% over the healthy prices that we saw in the 2010, 2011 upfront.
And we're excited about the films that we're premiering this month. As you all know, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows opens in a few weeks. And just this weekend, we're opening Due Date from the Hangover Director, Todd Phillips, which could be another sleeper hit. All that momentum gives us the confidence to, again, raise our full year outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at a rate in the high 20s over 2009. And last year was a year when we grew adjusted earnings per share by 29%.
John will walk you through the results in detail in a few minutes. But overall, it's shaping up to be another very good year. I'd like to shift gears now and update you on a bigger picture issue that has made plenty of headlines in the way and that's the impact of digital distribution on our businesses. Clearly, digital distribution presents some new challenges for the industry, but we believe that the opportunities significantly outweigh the risks. The unequivocal good news is that digital distribution offers consumers a better experience, with more choice, more convenience and more control. As a result, there's more demand than ever for the kind of high-quality content that we make, and it's a testament to that demand that so many companies are devoting so many resources to finding new ways to distribute and monetize our films and our TV shows and magazines.
The question, of course, is how do we take advantage of these opportunities in a way that both enhances the consumer experience and enhances our economics. First, we're supporting an array of Networks to allow consumers to access Time Warner content on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want in a way that's attractive and convenient for them and economically beneficial for us. In other words, buy our content once and use it in multiple places. Think of it as content everywhere. I'll talk more about this idea in a moment.
And second, we're experimenting with new business models that enable consumers to use and access our content in ways they couldn't before. As just one example of that, we will help lead the industry to launch a premium video-on-demand service that will enable consumers to watch recently released theatrical movies at home in high definition and eventually, in 3D. We're near agreement with our distributors on the right window and the right price point, and we expect to start offering our movies this way nationwide by the second quarter of next year.
Let me come back to this idea of content everywhere. It means something slightly different in TV, film and magazine, so I'd like to touch on each of those. In TV Networks and production, it means TV Everywhere. And as you know, TV Everywhere is a framework to provide TV subscribers with a huge array of TV content, everything on the dial and have it on demand on a wide variety of devices for television, the PC, tablets, mobile devices at no extra charge. TV Everywhere promises to give consumers that flexibility while also bolstering an ecosystem that has produced such high-quality programs and so much choice. 
A year ago, there was vibrant debate about whether free was a good business model. TV Everywhere was just a concept, and many argued that it wouldn't work. So where are we now? TV Everywhere has made tremendous progress in a very short period of time. Today, there is widespread acknowledgment among content providers that free ad-supported websites cannot replace powerful dual revenue stream business models. But it's being adopted across the industry faster than anyone expected. 
Every major programmer has announced plans to participate. CBS, Discovery, Disney, Liberty, NBC Universal, News Corp, Scripts, Viacom, among others. As one important step, just last week, Disney launched authenticated versions of ESPN and ESPN 3 in most Time Warner Cable markets. In the last few weeks, we've launched TV Everywhere versions of TNT and TBS across the entire footprints of both Comcast and Dish, and we have many more announcements pending.
We also have several deals pending for HBO GO and MAX GO, and now expect the services to be accessible to the vast majority of our HBO-Cinemax subscribers within a few months. In fact, some form of TV Everywhere is now available to over 50 million homes, and we expect it will be available to 70 million by the second quarter of next year. That's six months ahead of plan.
In Film, content everywhere means enabling consumers to buy a movie once and then access it everywhere on a wide variety of devices. As we talked about with you before, digital is good for the Home Entertainment business. It's more convenient for consumers, and it generates higher gross profits for us. Video-on-demand movie rentals have been growing at a rapid rate recently but so far, electronic sales have lagged. The problem is it just isn't convenient for consumers to buy digital movies and then try to watch them on their TVs and move them from device to device. So we're leading the industry on several initiatives that seek to change that by improving the buying experience and expanding the suite of rights that consumers get when they purchase a movie or a television show. 
One of these is the ultraviolet consortium. Ultraviolet, which has broad backing from studios, consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers, will allow consumers to buy movies from a huge variety of retailers and then to access them at no extra charge across a broad array of apps and devices, wherever and whenever they want. It should make digital ownership just as compelling and convenient as owning a DVD, if not more so. We can't be more specific about the plans for ultraviolet today, but you can expect to hear a lot more about it and related initiatives in the coming months.
Finally, in magazines. Content Everywhere means offering our subscribers a convenient, attractively priced way of enjoying our titles in prints and enhanced electronic versions across as many devices as possible. If you download an iPad version of one of our Time Inc. magazines, you know that it's a rich and compelling consumer experience. As you'd expect, we want to offer our customers a range of purchase options, including single copy sales, digital subscriptions and combined print and digital subscriptions. Right now, for example, subscribers to People's print edition can now access the People iPad app for free.
In the near future, we expect to announce deals with other tablet makers that offer our readers flexible ways to access all our electronic titles. We're confident that as the competition increases in that space, every tablet manufacturer will want to give its consumers the same range of choices and the same value.
Speaking of Publishing, before I pass it off to John, I'd like to comment on an important management change that we made during the quarter. We recently appointed Jack Griffin as the new CFO of Time Inc. As you know, Jack is succeeding Anne Moore, and Anne is retiring after for more than 33 years of outstanding service to the company. Over her tenure, Anne grew and launched some of the biggest, most important and most profitable titles in history titles like People, In Style and Real Simple. She made an indelible mark on both Time Warner and on the magazine industry.
Now Jack just started a month ago, but all of us are excited about the energy and expertise he brings. It's already clear to everyone who has met him why he's one of the most highly regarded executives in the Publishing business. 
So wrapping up, we're performing very well on the near term, and we're very focused on the decisions that we make today that will drive value over the long term. Digital distribution clearly present some challenges to our company and to the industry, but we think it clearly offers even greater opportunities. We're excited about the progress we're making, and we're looking forward to sharing more of the details in the coming months. 
Now I'd like to hand it off to John."
24689,113994023,84932,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation,",2809,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.
Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation, particularly with regard to returns to shareholders. We've continued to execute on both fronts, and we are very, very pleased with our progress to date. Because of some tough comparisons coming into the quarter, we expected that the third quarter would be the slowest quarter of the year for us in terms of year-over-year growth, yet it ended up that we posted some pretty good results for the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 5% year-over-year and just a quick note, those results did include the benefit of a $58 million or $0.05 per share related to the reversal of a litigation reserve at Turner.
On a year-to-date basis, we've grown adjusted operating income 18% and adjusted EPS 36%. That's ahead of our own expectations, allowing us once again, as Jeff said, we're raising our 2010 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s. So we're on track to deliver well north of 60% EPS growth in just the last two years.
From a capital plan standpoint, we're also executing according to our plan. For the first nine months, we generated about $2 billion in free cash flow, and we've returned more than 100% of that to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases so far this year. And if you look at over the past 12 months, we've returned nearly $3 billion in dividends and share repurchases.
Moving on to the next slide, which shows our consolidated third quarter financial results. Total revenues were up 2%. And underneath that, Subscription revenues continues to be a very consistent growth driver for us, up 7% in the quarter. Advertising growth was strong again, up 9%. Content revenues fell 5% in the quarter, but that was largely due to some very difficult theatrical comparisons that we had in our film studio. 
Total expenses, which include cost of revenues, SG&A and depreciation and amortization were almost flat in the quarter, and this is continued evidence of our focus on improving our operating efficiency. We've been keeping a lid on SG&A, allowing us to invest even more in Content and Other revenue generating areas. Adjusted operating income margins were also up modestly year-over-year in the quarter, and margins are up a full 200 basis points on a year-to-date basis. And we expect them to increase, again, in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EPS grew 17%, benefiting from earnings growth, a lower tax rate and fewer shares due to ongoing repurchases. We lowered our recurring effective tax rate due to a larger share of our earnings now coming from international territories, as well as some successful proactive tax planning. So we now expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 37% on a go-forward basis as opposed to the 38% that we previously anticipated.
Let me now turn to our segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks division. Here, we saw another quarter of really, really terrific revenue growth at both Turner and HBO, as well as strong adjusted operating income growth of 17%. Our results at this segment remain consistently strong, and we've grown revenue year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of the recession in 2008. That's a testament to the strength of our Networks and the consistency of its Subscription revenue base, which grew 9% in the quarter.
We did have about 200 basis points of that growth being contributed from the consolidation of certain international operation, so I just wanted to quickly highlight that. Let me take a moment now to comment about HBO specifically where we're, once again, on track for another record year of both revenue and profits. Looking at the subscriber picture for a moment, however, right now, we expect our year-end subscriber count to be approximately 1.5 million lower than what we reported at the end of 2009, and let me go into why that's the case. 
That's due largely to unusual promotional activity by two of our distributors. First, the majority of that loss was from non-revenue-generating Cinemax subscribers that are rolling off a very aggressive retail promotion at Dish last year; and second, we've also experienced declines at another major distributor where we're currently out of contract, so we haven't benefited from normal and usual promotional activity, and we're hopeful that this situation resolves itself in a positive way in the not-too-distant future. And of course, the tough economic backdrop isn't helping.
This year, we're not seeing the usual positive impact on subscribers from normal household formation as we've seen in most years as household formation has been quite a bit lower this year in the U.S. So importantly, these subscriber losses are almost all non-revenue-generating subscribers and by contrast, our revenue-generating HBO subscriber base has been stable over the past year. And you can see that, that's evident in our Subscription revenue growth, once again, this quarter. I also want to stress that we haven't really seen any evidence of court cutting relating to over-the-top competitors. And to the contrary, we continue to see increasing penetration from those distributors and affiliates that are focused on premium TV. And I'd also just -- one more quick highlight, HBO does have, as a quick note, over 80 million subscribers worldwide with more than 40 million outside of the U.S., and we're continuing to see very vibrant growth there.
Turning to Advertising for a minute where we saw revenues grow 10% in the quarter. And here, international transactions contributed several hundred basis points to that growth. Our domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scatter demand and ongoing yield management. Domestic entertainment Networks, together with kids and young adults, grew Advertising in the high-single digits. This was partly offset by a decline at domestic news due to the audience declines.
Core Advertising growth at our international Networks was approximately 25%. Adjusted operating income, again, grew significantly faster internationally than domestically, and that's a trend that we expect will continue in the coming quarters and years. Our international margins also expanded approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. 
Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect to see Advertising growth accelerate as the benefits of this year's strong upfront kick in. Demand from advertisers remains robust, pushing scatter pricing up 15% to 20% overall most at recent upfront. Adjusted operating income was up 17% in the quarter with margins expanding nearly 250 basis points year-over-year.
Looking ahead, we expect margins to expand modestly at the Networks division in the fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to expect programming costs growth to be in the mid-single digits as we continue to execute on our strategy of investing in high-quality content. So to sum up here, given the strong top line performance to-date and the encouraging Advertising trends that should translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division for our 2010, and in its entirety. 
Now let me move on to Film. Coming into the quarter, we expected that adjusted operating income at this division would decline year-over-year, and that was due to top theatrical comparisons. And you may recall that last year's third quarter benefited from having Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the late June release of The Hangover. 
G&A was also higher in the current quarter due to the timing and mix of theatrical releases and the shift toward international self-distribution of new line titles. Nevertheless, this comparison masks some really bright spots in the quarter. And as Jeff said, Inception was a blockbuster, and it's generated more than $800 million now at the global box office. And we benefited from the off network television sales of Two and A Half Men and the New Adventures of Old Christine. Just as importantly, the success of The Big Bang Theory on Thursday nights has further solidified the outlook for our television revenues in the coming years. 
And again, as Jeff mentioned, we're seeing some very promising performances from several of our new and returning TV shows. Home entertainment revenues were up slightly in the quarter, and they're now up 8% on a year-to-date basis, and we remain very focused on driving higher margin products, and we've seen it pay off in recent quarters, and that's evidenced by growth in Blu-ray, Video-on-Demand and electronic sell-through. Warner Bros. has been building on its leading position across all of these categories, increasing its share of the home entertainment category by well over 200 basis points year-to-date. As these revenue lines continue to grow, we expect home-video margins to further improve as well.
Looking forward, we are very, very optimistic about our fourth quarter theatrical slate, which includes Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows, that's the first part and then Due Date. And with adjusted operating income up 1% on a year-to-date basis here at this division despite very, very tough comparisons against record results in 2009, we believe we're on track for another great year at Warner Bros.
Let me move on to Publishing where we've continue to drive up margins through effective operational improvements and cost controls. Advertising revenues continue to recover, increasing 5% in the quarter and there, digital Advertising was particularly strong, growing over 20% in the quarter. Looking across Time Inc.'s three primary operating units, its style and entertainment unit and the lifestyle units grew Advertising in the quarter, and that was offset by a modest decline at news, and that was largely due to magazine closures that occurred in the prior year.
Style and entertainment continues to be our strongest performing group by far. Our Advertising growth comparisons do get more difficult in the fourth quarter, and I also wanted to highlight that in addition, based on a deal that was completed a little bit earlier this year, Turner is now managing SI.com and Golf.com for Time Inc. And as a result, Time Inc. is not going to be booking the Advertising revenues generated by these sites starting in the fourth quarter. So that, coupled with the difficult comparisons, may make year-over-year growth in Advertising, tough to achieve at this division.
However, we still expect Advertising to be up for the full year. As we've anticipated, Subscription revenues were down 5% in the quarter and about half of this decline was due to unfavorable FX. Domestic Subscription and newsstand sales also fell modestly. 
Looking ahead to the next quarter, we expect FX once again to be somewhat of a drag on description revenue, and we also expect continued pressure on Subscription and newsstand comparisons are going to get more difficult. So all in all, we anticipate a similar year-over-year decline in Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter at Time Inc. 
Operating income was up 45% in the third quarter, and margins increased 500 basis points year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter in a row of margin improvement at Time Inc, and so we're pleased with that. Total expenses were down almost $60 million year-over-year, and that was reflected operational improvements and cost initiatives, including lower pension expenses.
We should continue to see the benefit of those initiatives in the fourth quarter, and restructuring charges will also be down significantly year-over-year in Q4. So we expect another quarter of solid growth in operating income at Time Inc.
So with the division review completed, let's look to the consolidated outlook. We continue to be very encouraged by the strength of our results for the first nine months, and we're continuing to invest more in programming in TV and film production, and that investment should make the company stronger for the future. But at the same time, we've been able to deliver very strong near-term financial results. Our solid execution has given us confidence once again to raise the full year outlook. And as we put in our release this morning, we now expect adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s, and that's off of a base of $1.83 last year. Our full year outlook has continued to strengthen throughout the year, and we now expect to grow revenues by more than $1 billion year-over-year in 2010, and that's the best result we've had in several years.
We're also aggressively managing our expenses and investments, and so let me talk about what I mean by that. Overall for the year, expenses will likely be up only in the low-single digits. But we're fully investing in our best businesses to drive growth, and this is evidenced by a high single-digit increase in our investment in programming, including originals and sports, television and film production and marketing. And at the same time, we expect the rest of our expenses to be down in the low- to mid-single digits, and that's how we're improving margins and that's how we're improving returns, while we're still investing for the future. 
Let me turn now and look at free cash flow very, very briefly. So let's turn to the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated $2 billion of free cash flow, that's a healthy conversion over 40% of adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, and it's almost 100% of adjusted income from continuing operations. The increase in working capital as you see here includes a $250 million payment related to the resolution of some litigation, as well as a $70 million payment made to the NCAA tied to the beginning of the March Madness contract, which will be next year. Factoring out these two payments, our free cash flow actually compared to last year is down only very slightly, and that's due to an increase in accounts receivable tied to revenue growth, as well as higher cash taxes and cash interest. 
We expect and we'll continue to maintain a high conversion rate of both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted income from continuing operations and some free cash flow. So let me move on to the final slide here, which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with about $12.5 billion in net debt, and that's up about $1.1 billion compared to the end of last year, and it's up slightly compared to the second quarter. The increase is a result of us returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders year-to-date, and we've also spent almost $600 million to date on acquisitions. And we paid premiums and transactions costs that total about $370 million, and that's related to the redemptions of debt securities previously announced. 
International expansion remains one of our top priorities as a company, and that's reflected in how we're allocating capital. About 80% of our M&A activity has been on international Cable Networks, and we've continued to invest in international Cable Networks at Turner, which closed recently on two acquisitions. The first was a company named MMG. It's a Scandinavian channel group where we see a nice opportunity to strengthen our position in the region. And we've also recently added Chilevisión one of the leading broadcasters in Chile to our already strong Latin American business. 
Warner Bros. also expanded its international footprint with the recent acquisition of Shed Media, a leading TV producer in the U.K., and this acquisition is part of its strategy to grow international local language production. All of these acquisitions were done at attractive prices and for reasonable multiples, and they should help drive further international growth.
So with only one quarter left in the year, we are on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to improve their strategic position and drive long-term growth. That's evidenced by our increased investment and programming production and marketing this year. 
Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned, we've now returned over $2.2 billion so far this year, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases. And including our regular dividend, we've had a fairly consistent return of approximately $750 million a quarter recently, and we may look to grow that over time. 
And third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing our debt maturities. Our leverage ratio is now about 2x. That's still a bit below our long-term target of 2.5x. But today, we consider the strategic flexibility to be a competitive advantage in the current environment. So we remain comfortable operating in this range at least for the time being. Looking out over the next five years, we have less than $2.5 billion in total debt maturities, so we feel really good about how we're positioned there as well. 
So that concludes my proactive remarks. Let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call."

I'll take the first part of the question in the order which you asked. The first thing I guess I would say just to repeat what you said is part of the question, which is just a reminder for everybody that the majority of our Networks are fully distributed in the U.S. And so over time, we would expect that they will follow, in terms of numbers of subscribers, what ends up happening as it relates to the overall multi-channel household universe, which has been mature for some time. In terms of giving additional clarity with respect to recent trends, though, I'm afraid we'll probably not going to be able to do that. In fact, I would suspect that the distributors themselves would be the first to report that because the way that we get our information at the Networks from the distributors tends to be on a couple of month lag basis. And so while we would fully expect to be up year-over-year, I'm just not sure that we have the most recent information as it relates to sequential trending. So I would say we'll have to wait and get better information over the next couple of months because the last information we have is probably really just the beginning of the third quarter."

If you look at TV viewing across all the different Networks, it's a very healthy picture, ratings, programming quality, the strength of these brands. So I guess the most important thing, and we've been fairly outspoken about it, is that if you take all of these Networks, not just ours but the industry, and you have them on demand, we've seen how powerful it is at HBO. I think we're about to see how powerful it is when you can watch whatever your favorite network is on all kinds of devices on demand and on your TV set, that's going to strengthen in TV viewing. It's probably going to not lead to any cord cutting. Now in the long run, with viewers preference is being clear that they love all these Networks, if you have to reach them through some other distribution than the one that we currently have, then that's how the content industry will evolve. But I don't think that's likely to happen. If it does happen, we think that the Network business is very strong in either case."

We are still in the band we basically are used to, although our promotional subs is about 10% to 15%. And so this basically lines up with various deal renewals and some of the leverage that gets put into play. I think HBO is in very solid shape. It's just a function of promotional and deal renewal activity. So on the question you raised about HBO going direct, we do have the ability to do that. And it's not something that we have decided to do today because as you've said, we have a very good relationship and very good position where HBO occupies the position that it does in all of the TV and video packages for all the different distributors.

So we've got outstanding liquidity with no near-term maturities, which is a really nice place to be and more broadly speaking from a capital allocation standpoint, we think about our leverage target and the context of overall capital allocation, and it's really about making sure that we're preserving adequate flexibility, making sure that we have constant access to the capital markets at attractive prices and at the same time, optimizing returns. And if you look at how we approach capital allocation that's exactly what we've been doing, and we've taken a very consistent and balanced approach between strengthening the balance sheet, which we did mostly last year, having a meaningful buyback program, complement a meaningful dividend at the same time, engaging it to try to grow the businesses through M&A. So we've taken a balanced and consistent approach, and we're going to continue to maintain that going forward."

In the C3 window, it's the same ads, it's the same feed. So we're agnostic and so are the advertisers. In the world of VOD, which is the more delayed, the last week or the last three or four episodes, the industry in general whether on TV or on broadband is supporting on an ad model.

First of all, as you think about the growth prospects of this division on a go-forward basis. We're coming at it from a position where we've retrenched in profits quite a bit as we went into the Advertising downturn. And so we've been able to maintain margin and grow this year's margin by virtue of a lot of the operational improvement initiatives that you highlighted in your question. If you think about it on a going-forward basis, I think there are numerous avenues of growth. First, I would say traditional print Advertising where we're still in I would say, hopefully the early days of what's a cyclical rebound and a cyclical recovery. And everybody knows that the economy has improved. Our print Advertising is not as strong as our TV Advertising. But nevertheless, we have a lot of confidence in our brands, and we think that we can drive Advertising over the foreseeable future in our print brands. I think Subscription trends are challenging but stable. And so I don't think that there's going to be any major source of downward trend there. It's going to be more stable. Can we grow it? I think that's the challenge for our company in the industry. I think there's a huge longer-term opportunity in digital magazines, magazines on tablets, all sorts of brand extensions. But that’s too long an answer for this call. And then your question, which is really on operational improvements, the division has done a tremendous job over the last several years of reorganizing and re-engineering the way they do business and pulling out literally hundreds of millions of dollars of fixed cost that's not going to go back into the business. I think that operational engineering and improvement is a way of life at that division, and I would anticipate that there are further opportunities that we will explore over time. I would just note that with Jack Griffin now coming on board and just recognizing that he's only been at Time Inc. for a few weeks we'll obviously be working very, very closely with Jack and interested in his ideas as we look to continue to improve not only the top line, but margin opportunity there as well.

We had another strong quarter, and we're on track for another terrific year. More important, we're positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that digital distribution will bring. This quarter, Turner, again, posed a double-digit advertising growth. We're continuing to benefit from strong demand for our inventory on TNT and TBS. And while we have ratings challenges at CNN that we are addressing, we've had solid ratings growth at several of our other Networks, including truTV, Turner and Adult Swim.
 We saw outstanding results from our most important new content this quarter. On TNT, our new show, Rizzoli & Isles, became the number one original series of all time on ad-supported Cable. On HBO, Boardwalk Empire is on track to become the most watched first year series in the network's history.
 At Warner Bros, our blockbuster movie, Inception, generated over $800 million at the global box office, and we're having a great start to new television season. In addition to the success of our returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and The Mentalist, a new show, Mike & Molly, is the number one new comedy on TV.
 Looking forward, we expect improved ratings performance at our biggest entertainment Networks in the fourth quarter, driven by our strong lineup of original, the debut of Conan's new show next Monday and outstanding recent performance from our sports program. In fact, our coverage of the Major League Baseball American League championship series was the most watched league championship ever on TBS. And NBA Opening Night was the most watched regular season NBA game ever on Cable TV. This should enable us to continue capitalize on the solid demand in the scatter market, with pricing up 15% to 20% over the healthy prices that we saw in the 2010, 2011 upfront.
 And we're excited about the films that we're premiering this month. As you all know, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows opens in a few weeks. And just this weekend, we're opening Due Date from the Hangover Director, Todd Phillips, which could be another sleeper hit. All that momentum gives us the confidence to, again, raise our full year outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at a rate in the high 20s over 2009. And last year was a year when we grew adjusted earnings per share by 29%.
 John will walk you through the results in detail in a few minutes. But overall, it's shaping up to be another very good year. I'd like to shift gears now and update you on a bigger picture issue that has made plenty of headlines in the way and that's the impact of digital distribution on our businesses. Clearly, digital distribution present some new challenges for the industry, but we believe that the opportunities significantly outweigh the risks. The unequivocal good news is that digital distribution offers consumers a better experience, with more choice, more convenience and more control. As a result, there's more demand than ever for the kind of high-quality content that we make, and it's a testament to that demand that so many companies are devoting so many resources to finding new ways to distribute and monetize our films and our TV shows and magazines.
 The question, of course, is how do we take advantage of these opportunities in a way that both enhances the consumer experience and enhances our economics. First, we're supporting an array of Networks to allow consumers to access Time Warner content on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want in a way that's attractive and convenient for them and economically beneficial for us. In other words, buy our content once and use it in multiple places. Think of it as content everywhere. I'll talk more about this idea in a moment.
 And second, we're experimenting with new business models that enable consumers to use and access our content in ways they couldn't before. As just one example of that, we will help lead the industry to launch a premium video-on-demand service that will enable consumers to watch recently released theatrical movies at home in high definition and eventually, in 3D. We're near agreement with our distributors on the right window and the right price point, and we expect to start offering our movies this way nationwide by the second quarter of next year.
 Let me come back to this idea of content everywhere. It means something slightly different in TV, film and magazine, so I'd like to touch on each of those. In TV Networks and production, it means TV Everywhere. And as you know, TV Everywhere is a framework to provide TV subscribers with a huge array of TV content, everything on the dial and have it on demand on a wide variety of devices for television, the PC, tablets, mobile devices at no extra charge. TV Everywhere promises to give consumers that flexibility while also bolstering an ecosystem that has produced such high-quality programs and so much choice.
 A year ago, there was vibrant debate about whether free was a good business model. TV Everywhere was just a concept, and many argued that it wouldn't work. So where are we now? TV Everywhere has made tremendous progress in a very short period of time. Today, there is widespread acknowledgment among content providers that free ad-supported websites cannot replace powerful dual revenue stream business models. But it's being adopted across the industry faster than anyone expected.
 Every major programmer has announced plans to participate. CBS, Discovery, Disney, Liberty, NBC Universal, News Corp, Scripts, Viacom, among others. As one important step, just last week, Disney launched authenticated versions of ESPN and ESPN 3  in most Time Warner Cable markets. In the last few weeks, we've launched TV Everywhere versions of TNT and TBS across the entire footprints of both Comcast and Dish, and we have many more announcements pending.
 We also have several deals pending for HBO GO and MAX GO, and now expect the services to be accessible to the vast majority of our HBO-Cinemax subscribers within a few months. In fact, some form of TV Everywhere is now available to over 50 million homes, and we expect it will be available to 70 million by the second quarter of next year. That's six months ahead of plan.
 In Film, content everywhere means enabling consumers to buy a movie once and then access it everywhere on a wide variety of devices. As we talked about with you before, digital is good for the Home Entertainment business. It's more convenient for consumers, and it generates higher gross profits for us. Video-on-demand movie rentals have been growing at a rapid rate recently but so far, electronic sales have lagged. The problem is it just isn't convenient for consumers to buy digital movies and then try to watch them on their TVs and move them from device to device. So we're leading the industry on several initiatives that seek to change that by improving the buying experience and expanding the suite of rights that consumers get when they purchase a movie or a television show.
 One of these is the ultraviolet consortium. Ultraviolet, which has broad backing from studios, consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers, will allow consumers to buy movies from a huge variety of retailers and then to access them at no extra charge across a broad array of apps and devices, wherever and whenever they want. It should make digital ownership just as compelling and convenient as owning a DVD, if not more so. We can't be more specific about the plans for ultraviolet today, but you can expect to hear a lot more about it and related initiatives in the coming months.
 Finally, in magazines. Content Everywhere means offering our subscribers a convenient, attractively priced way of enjoying our titles in prints and enhanced electronic versions across as many devices as possible. If you download an iPad version of one of our Time Inc. magazines, you know that it's a rich and compelling consumer experience. As you'd expect, we want to offer our customers a range of purchase options, including single copy sales, digital subscriptions and combined print and digital subscriptions. Right now, for example, subscribers to People's print edition can now access the People iPad app for free.
 In the near future, we expect to announce deals with other tablet makers that offer our readers flexible ways to access all our electronic titles. We're confident that as the competition increases in that space, every tablet manufacturer will want to give its consumers the same range of choices and the same value.
 Speaking of Publishing, before I pass it off to John, I'd like to comment on an important management change that we made during the quarter. We recently appointed Jack Griffin as the new CFO of Time Inc. As you know, Jack is succeeding Anne Moore, and Anne is retiring after for more than 33 years of outstanding service to the company. Over her tenure, Anne grew and launched some of the biggest, most important and most profitable titles in history titles like People, In Style and Real Simple. She made an indelible mark on both Time Warner and on the magazine industry.
 Now Jack just started a month ago, but all of us are excited about the energy and expertise he brings. It's already clear to everyone who has met him why he's one of the most highly regarded executives in the Publishing business.
 So wrapping up, we're performing very well on the near term, and we're very focused on the decisions that we make today that will drive value over the long term. Digital distribution clearly present some challenges to our company and to the industry, but we think it clearly offers even greater opportunities. We're excited about the progress we're making, and we're looking forward to sharing more of the details in the coming months.
 Now I'd like to hand it off to John.

24689,113994023,86554,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives"," Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation",2809," Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.
 Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation, particularly with regard to returns to shareholders. We've continued to execute on both fronts, and we are very, very pleased with our progress to date. Because of some tough comparisons coming into the quarter, we expected that the third quarter would be the slowest quarter of the year for us in terms of year-over-year growth, yet it ended up that we posted some pretty good results for the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 5% year-over-year and just a quick note, those results did include the benefit of a $58 million or $0.05 per share related to the reversal of a litigation reserve at Turner.
 On a year-to-date basis, we've grown adjusted operating income 18% and adjusted EPS 36%. That's ahead of our own expectations, allowing us, once again, as Jeff said, we're raising our 2010 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s. So we're on track to deliver well north of 60% EPS growth in just the last two years.
 From a capital plan standpoint, we're also executing according to our plan. For the first nine months, we generated about $2 billion in free cash flow, and we've returned more than 100% of that to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases so far this year. And if you look at over the past 12 months, we've returned nearly $3 billion in dividends and share repurchases.
 Moving on to the next slide, which shows our consolidated third quarter financial results. Total revenues were up 2%. And underneath that, Subscription revenues continues to be a very consistent growth driver for us, up 7% in the quarter. Advertising growth was strong again, up 9%. Content revenues fell 5% in the quarter, but that was largely due to some very difficult theatrical comparisons that we had in our film studio.
 Total expenses, which include cost of revenues, SG&A and depreciation and amortization were almost flat in the quarter, and this is continued evidence of our focus on improving our operating efficiency. We've been keeping a lid on SG&A, allowing us to invest even more in Content and Other revenue generating areas. Adjusted operating income margins were also up modestly year-over-year in the quarter, and margins are up a full 200 basis points on a year-to-date basis. And we expect them to increase, again, in the fourth quarter.
 Adjusted EPS grew 17%, benefiting from earnings growth, a lower tax rate and fewer shares due to ongoing repurchases. We lowered our recurring effective tax rate due to a larger share of our earnings now coming from international territories, as well as some successful proactive tax planning. So we now expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 37% on a go-forward basis as opposed to the 38% that we previously anticipated.
 Let me now turn to our segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks division. Here, we saw another quarter of really, really terrific revenue growth at both Turner and HBO, as well as strong adjusted operating income growth of 17%. Our results at this segment remain consistently strong, and we've grown revenue year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of the recession in 2008. That's a testament to the strength of our Networks and the consistency of its Subscription revenue base, which grew 9% in the quarter.
 We did have about 200 basis points of that growth being contributed from the consolidation of certain international operation, so I just wanted to quickly highlight that. Let me take a moment now to comment about HBO specifically where we're, once again, on track for another record year of both revenue and profits. Looking at the subscriber picture for a moment, however, right now, we expect our year-end subscriber count to be approximately 1.5 million lower than what we reported at the end of 2009, and let me go into why that's the case.
 That's due largely to unusual promotional activity by two of our distributors. First, the majority of that loss was from non-revenue-generating Cinemax subscribers that are rolling off a very aggressive retail promotion at Dish last year; and second, we've also experienced declines at another major distributor where we're currently out of contract, so we haven't benefited from normal and usual promotional activity, and we're hopeful that this situation resolves itself in a positive way in the not-too-distant future. And of course, the tough economic backdrop isn't helping.
 This year, we're not seeing the usual positive impact on subscribers from normal household formation as we've seen in most years as household formation has been quite a bit lower this year in the U.S. So importantly, these subscriber losses are almost all non-revenue-generating subscribers and by contrast, our revenue-generating HBO subscriber base has been stable over the past year. And you can see that, that's evident in our Subscription revenue growth, once again, this quarter. I also want to stress that we haven't really seen any evidence of court cutting relating to over-the-top competitors. And to the contrary, we continue to see increasing penetration from those distributors and affiliates that are focused on premium TV. And I'd also just -- one more quick highlight, HBO does have, as a quick note, over 80 million subscribers worldwide with more than 40 million outside of the U.S., and we're continuing to see very vibrant growth there.
 Turning to Advertising for a minute where we saw revenues grow 10% in the quarter. And here, international transactions contributed several hundred basis points to that growth. Our domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scatter demand and ongoing yield management. Domestic entertainment Networks, together with kids and young adults, grew Advertising in the high-single digits. This was partly offset by a decline at domestic news due to the audience declines.
 Core Advertising growth at our international Networks was approximately 25%. Adjusted operating income, again, grew significantly faster internationally than domestically, and that's a trend that we expect will continue in the coming quarters and years. Our international margins also expanded approximately 700 basis points year-over-year.
 Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect to see Advertising growth accelerate as the benefits of this year's strong upfront kick in. Demand from advertisers remains robust, pushing scatter pricing up 15% to 20% overall most at recent upfront. Adjusted operating income was up 17% in the quarter with margins expanding nearly 250 basis points year-over-year.
 Looking ahead, we expect margins to expand modestly at the Networks division in the fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to expect programming costs growth to be in the mid-single digits as we continue to execute on our strategy of investing in high-quality content. So to sum up here, given the strong top line performance to-date and the encouraging Advertising trends that should translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division for our 2010, and in its entirety.
 Now let me move on to Film. Coming into the quarter, we expected that adjusted operating income at this division would decline year-over-year, and that was due to top theatrical comparisons. And you may recall that last year's third quarter benefited from having Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the late June release of The Hangover.
 G&A was also higher in the current quarter due to the timing and mix of theatrical releases and the shift toward international self-distribution of new line titles. Nevertheless, this comparison masks some really bright spots in the quarter. And as Jeff said, Inception was a blockbuster, and it's generated more than $800 million now at the global box office. And we benefited from the off network television sales of Two and A Half Men and the New Adventures of Old Christine. Just as importantly, the success of The Big Bang Theory on Thursday nights has further solidified the outlook for our television revenues in the coming years.
 And again, as Jeff mentioned, we're seeing some very promising performances from several of our new and returning TV shows. Home entertainment revenues were up slightly in the quarter, and they're now up 8% on a year-to-date basis, and we remain very focused on driving higher margin products, and we've seen it pay off in recent quarters, and that's evidenced by growth in Blu-ray, Video-on-Demand and electronic sell-through. Warner Bros. has been building on its leading position across all of these categories, increasing its share of the home entertainment category by well over 200 basis points year-to-date. As these revenue lines continue to grow, we expect home-video margins to further improve as well.
 Looking forward, we are very, very optimistic about our fourth quarter theatrical slate, which includes Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows, that's the first part and then Due Date. And with adjusted operating income up 1% on a year-to-date basis here at this division despite very, very tough comparisons against record results in 2009, we believe we're on track for another great year at Warner Bros.
 Let me move on to Publishing where we've continue to drive up margins through effective operational improvements and cost controls. Advertising revenues continue to recover, increasing 5% in the quarter and there, digital Advertising was particularly strong, growing over 20% in the quarter. Looking across Time Inc.'s three primary operating units, its style and entertainment unit and the lifestyle units grew Advertising in the quarter, and that was offset by a modest decline at news, and that was largely due to magazine closures that occurred in the prior year.
 Style and entertainment continues to be our strongest performing group by far. Our Advertising growth comparisons do get more difficult in the fourth quarter, and I also wanted to highlight that in addition, based on a deal that was completed a little bit earlier this year, Turner is now managing SI.com and Golf.com for Time Inc. And as a result, Time Inc. is not going to be booking the Advertising revenues generated by these sites starting in the fourth quarter. So that, coupled with the difficult comparisons, may make year-over-year growth in Advertising, tough to achieve at this division.
 However, we still expect Advertising to be up for the full year. As we've anticipated, Subscription revenues were down 5% in the quarter and about half of this decline was due to unfavorable FX. Domestic Subscription and newsstand sales also fell modestly.
 Looking ahead to the next quarter, we expect FX once again to be somewhat of a drag on description revenue, and we also expect continued pressure on Subscription and newsstand comparisons are going to get more difficult. So all in all, we anticipate a similar year-over-year decline in Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter at Time Inc.
 Operating income was up 45% in the third quarter, and margins increased 500 basis points year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter in a row of margin improvement at Time Inc, and so we're pleased with that. Total expenses were down almost $60 million year-over-year, and that was reflected operational improvements and cost initiatives, including lower pension expenses.
 We should continue to see the benefit of those initiatives in the fourth quarter, and restructuring charges will also be down significantly year-over-year in Q4. So we expect another quarter of solid growth in operating income at Time Inc.
 So with the division review completed, let's look to the consolidated outlook. We continue to be very encouraged by the strength of our results for the first nine months, and we're continuing to invest more in programming in TV and film production, and that investment should make the company stronger for the future. But at the same time, we've been able to deliver very strong near-term financial results. Our solid execution has given us confidence once again to raise the full year outlook. And as we put in our release this morning, we now expect adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s, and that's off of a base of $1.83 last year. Our full year outlook has continued to strengthen throughout the year, and we now expect to grow revenues by more than $1 billion year-over-year in 2010, and that's the best result we've had in several years.
 We're also aggressively managing our expenses and investments, and so let me talk about what I mean by that. Overall for the year, expenses will likely be up only in the low-single digits. But we're fully investing in our best businesses to drive growth, and this is evidenced by a high single-digit increase in our investment in programming, including originals and sports, television and film production and marketing. And at the same time, we expect the rest of our expenses to be down in the low- to mid-single digits, and that's how we're improving margins and that's how we're improving returns, while we're still investing for the future.
 Let me turn now and look at free cash flow very, very briefly. So let's turn to the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated $2 billion of free cash flow, that's a healthy conversion over 40% of adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, and it's almost 100% of adjusted income from continuing operations. The increase in working capital as you see here includes a $250 million payment related to the resolution of some litigation, as well as a $70 million payment made to the NCAA tied to the beginning of the March Madness contract, which will be next year. Factoring out these two payments, our free cash flow actually compared to last year is down only very slightly, and that's due to an increase in accounts receivable tied to revenue growth, as well as higher cash taxes and cash interest.
 We expect and we'll continue to maintain a high conversion rate of both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted income from continuing operations and some free cash flow. So let me move on to the final slide here, which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with about $12.5 billion in net debt, and that's up about $1.1 billion compared to the end of last year, and it's up slightly compared to the second quarter. The increase is a result of us returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders year-to-date, and we've also spent almost $600 million to date on acquisitions. And we paid premiums and transactions costs that total about $370 million, and that's related to the redemptions of debt securities previously announced.
 International expansion remains one of our top priorities as a company, and that's reflected in how we're allocating capital. About 80% of our M&A activity has been on international Cable Networks, and we've continued to invest in international Cable Networks at Turner, which closed recently on two acquisitions. The first was a company named MMG. It's a Scandinavian channel group where we see a nice opportunity to strengthen our position in the region. And we've also recently added Chilevisión one of the leading broadcasters in Chile to our already strong Latin American business.
 Warner Bros. also expanded its international footprint with the recent acquisition of Shed Media, a leading TV producer in the U.K., and this acquisition is part of its strategy to grow international local language production. All of these acquisitions were done at attractive prices and for reasonable multiples, and they should help drive further international growth.
 So with only one quarter left in the year, we are on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to improve their strategic position and drive long-term growth. That's evidenced by our increased investment and programming production and marketing this year.
 Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned, we've now returned over $2.2 billion so far this year, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases. And including our regular dividend, we've had a fairly consistent return of approximately $750 million a quarter recently, and we may look to grow that over time.
 And third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing our debt maturities. Our leverage ratio is now about 2x. That's still a bit below our long-term target of 2.5x. But today, we consider the strategic flexibility to be a competitive advantage in the current environment. So we remain comfortable operating in this range at least for the time being. Looking out over the next five years, we have less than $2.5 billion in total debt maturities, so we feel really good about how we're positioned there as well.
 So that concludes my proactive remarks. Let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call.

I'll take the first part of the question in the order which you asked. The first thing I guess I would say just to repeat what you said is part of the question, which is just a reminder for everybody that the majority of our Networks are fully distributed in the U.S. And so over time, we would expect that they will follow, in terms of numbers of subscribers, what ends up happening as it relates to the overall multi-channel household universe, which has been mature for some time. In terms of giving additional clarity with respect to recent trends, though, I'm afraid we'll probably not going to be able to do that. In fact, I would suspect that the distributors themselves would be the first to report that because the way that we get our information at the Networks from the distributors tends to be on a couple of month lag basis. And so while we would fully expect to be up year-over-year, I'm just not sure that we have the most recent information as it relates to sequential trending. So I would say we'll have to wait and get better information over the next couple of months because the last information we have is probably really just the beginning of the third quarter.

If you look at TV viewing across all the different Networks, it's a very healthy picture, ratings, programming quality, the strength of these brands. So I guess the most important thing and we've been fairly outspoken about it is that if you take all of these Networks, not just ours but the industry, and you have them on demand, we've seen how powerful it is at HBO. I think we're about to see how powerful it is when you can watch whatever your favorite network is on all kinds of devices on demand and on your TV set, that's going to strength in TV viewing. It's probably going to not lead to any cord cutting. Now in the long run, with viewers preference is being clear that they love all these Networks, if you have to reach them through some other distribution than the one that we currently have, then that's how the content industry will evolve. But I don't think that's likely to happen. If it does happen, we think that the Network business is very strong in either case.

I think that the sub trends at HBO, the underlying paid sub trends are healthy and good from my point by point of view looking forward. And we always have a band of promotional subs depending on what affiliates giving away Cinemax subs for very low prices. We are still in the band. We, basically, are used to, although our promotional subs is about 10% to 15%. And so this basically lines up with various deal renewals and some of the leverage that gets put into play. I think HBO is in very solid shape. It's just a function of promotional and deal renewal activity. So on the question you raised about HBO going direct, we do have the ability to do that. And it's not something that we have decided to do today because as you've said, we have a very good relationship and very good position where HBO occupies the position that it does in all of the TV and video packages for all the different distributors.

If that doesn't work well, or speedily enough, then we have the option of adding a direct sale of HBO.

So we absolutely evaluate everything from Apple TV rentals, we're not going forward to sales and licensing agreements within like Netflix or Hoovu [ph] in the context of what is best, in this case, for Warner's on providing the most healthy revenue support for the licensing that we do because there a lot of things that have been proposed in ""digital"" that are really not in the interest of the studio just thinking of studio interest alone. At the same time, we also have Networks, so we keep an eye on that too. So far, all the choices we made and what we've done, what we haven't done and this can vary show by show, have been we've actually found an alliance calculation between what's best for Warner and what, say, would be best for HBO and Turner in the long-term industry structure. So we haven't seen many things that conflict in that. And as you can tell by the things we've done and not done, we don't agree with some of the moves that our studio competitors have taken. We think it's bad for the value of their content.

And in fact, last quarter, year-to-date, we've issued about $5 billion in the public debt markets at very, very attractive rates. And that has allowed us to push out our maturity on average by about four years, while at the same time, and this is rare when you can do this, we lowered our average interest costs by about $60 million a year. And all of that was done to take advantage of the interest rate environment and to frankly, increase our flexibility. And as I mentioned in my proactive remarks, you look out over the next five years, we've only got about two -- less than $2.5 billion of total maturities coming due. So we've got outstanding liquidity with no near-term maturities, which is a really nice place to be and more broadly speaking from a capital allocation standpoint, we think about our leverage target and the context of overall capital allocation, and it's really about making sure that we're preserving adequate flexibility, making sure that we have constant access to the capital markets at attractive prices and at the same time, optimizing returns. And if you look at how we approach capital allocation that's exactly what we've been doing, and we've taken a very consistent and balanced approach between strengthening the balance sheet, which we did mostly last year, having a meaningful buyback program, complement a meaningful dividend at the same time, engaging it to try to grow the businesses through M&A. So we've taken a balanced and consistent approach, and we're going to continue to maintain that going forward.

So it's basically, I think you may have had either a question or a premise about different Internet at higher rates. That's not the case on TV Everywhere ad sales and remember the loads are going to be the same and on all the Networks whether you're watching a show on Turner on demand on TV or on broadband. In the C3 window, it's the same ads, it's the same feed. So we're agnostic and so are the advertisers. In the world of VOD, which is the more delayed, the last week or the last three or four episodes, the industry in general whether on TV or on broadband is supporting on an ad model. I think there's a lot to be figured out there, but it probably won't distinguish between watching an ad on a Turner show from whether it's on a TV VOD or an Internet VOD version of a TNT show will probably be the same box.

And secondly, in terms of Publishing business, this year you were benefited by some of the operational improvement that you made last year. As we look forward a couple of years, how should we think about the profitability of the Publishing business. Clearly, some challenge from the Subscription side. Are you seeing -- can we offset that from the digital distribution? Is there any further cost pending opportunities, how should we think about the Publishing business as we look out over the next couple of years?

First of all, as you think about the growth prospects of this division on a go-forward basis. We're coming at it from a position where we've retrenched in profits quite a bit as we went into the Advertising downturn. And so we've been able to maintain margin and grow this year's margin by virtue of a lot of the operational improvement initiatives that you highlighted in your question. If you think about it on a going-forward basis, I think there are numerous avenues of growth. First, I would say traditional print Advertising where we're still in I would say, hopefully the early days of what's a cyclical rebound and a cyclical recovery. And everybody knows that the economy has improved. Our print Advertising is not as strong as our TV Advertising. But nevertheless, we have a lot of confidence in our brands, and we think that we can drive Advertising over the foreseeable future in our print brands. I think Subscription trends are challenging but stable. And so I don't think that there's going to be any major source of downward trend there. It's going to be more stable, can we grow it. I think that's the challenge for our company in the industry. I think there's a huge longer-term opportunity in digital magazines, magazines on tablets, all sorts of brand extensions. But the too long an answer for this call. And then your question, which is really on operational improvements, the division has done a tremendous job over the last several years of reorganizing and re-engineering the way they do business and pulling out literally hundreds of millions of dollars of fixed cost that's not going to go back into the business. I think that operational engineering and improvement is a way of life at that division, and I would anticipate that there are further opportunities that we will explore over time. I would just note that with Jack Griffin now coming on board and just recognizing that he's only been at Time Inc. for a few weeks we'll obviously be working very, very closely with Jack and interested in his ideas as we look to continue to improve not only the top line, but margin opportunity there as well. And so I won't go into a lot of the detail, but there are opportunities.
