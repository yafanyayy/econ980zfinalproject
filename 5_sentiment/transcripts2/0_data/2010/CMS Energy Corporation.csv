We appreciate your interest in the company, and we thank you for your participation today. First thing I'd like to do is just introduce a few people so you can get to know a few of the folks from the company that are here, both presenting and not presenting. So not in the middle of our presentations, but certainly after that, get a chance to catch them and ask them some questions.First of all, I'll show you -- I won't do that just yet, but I want to introduce Dave Joos who will be leading the event today. Dave, of course, is our CEO. And then right over near Dave is John Russell, who's the President and Chief Operating Officer of Consumers, will be talking with you today. In addition, Bill Garrity, who is the Senior Vice President for both Electric and Gas Supply, and I know a lot of you have good questions for him because I've heard about some of those already, Bill. So just to boost them up for you. Proposes to boost them up for up. Maureen Trumble, who is our Smart Grid Director, and I know that's an interesting subject to many of you. She'll be speaking today. And also with us in the back here is Dan Malone, who's the Vice President for Customer and Energy Operations, important fellow to us. Laura Mountcastle, she's right in the back, great. Everybody knows Laura, Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer for the company. Phil McAndrews is outside, but Phil is Director for Investor Relations. And then, of course, we have Glenn Barba back here in the corner. He is our Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, keeps us all straight. And Amy Conrad, Amy is outside, I think, right now. She's part of the Investor Relations group. You'll get a chance to see her maybe a little bit later. So let me do always the fun part, but I would like you to take a look at this little more carefully and it simply says that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. They are subject to risk and uncertainties. They should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements and the information, as well as the Risk Factors section of the CMS Energy and Consumers Energy Form 10-K for this year ended December 31, 2009 as filed yesterday. I'm sure you all have copies of that. The presentation also includes non-GAAP measures when describing CMS Energy's results of operations and financial performance. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted on our website. So you'll see that in the books that you have in front of you, those of you that are with us today and those of you on the webcast, check the website.We expect 2010 reported earnings to be about the same as adjusted earnings. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors, and we're not providing reported earnings guidance reconciliation because of the uncertainties associated with those factors. So thank you for your patience there. Here's the order of what we'll do today. Dave will be up right now to introduce and cover some of the key aspects of where the company has come from recently and where we're going. And John Russell and Bill Garrity and Maureen Trumble on the subjects that I just mentioned earlier, and then I'll come up to wrap up with a financial overview. And then we'll take your questions at the end. So you'll note that you have a very lovely bright green pen. I don't know if it's a good sign or a bad sign. We normally don't give things out, but our gift to you for being with us for many years so you can make notes for your questions later in the day. And I'll turn over to Dave. Dave?"

We had another good year at the company. I'm going to just give you a very quick overview of our ongoing strategy. As you know, it's become f",1839,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you here in the room and also those listening on the webcast. We had another good year at the company. I'm going to just give you a very quick overview of our ongoing strategy. As you know, it's become fairly simple. John will get into more details because frankly, he's going to talk about the utility and frankly, the utility is 95% plus of our strategy. We're not going to spend a lot of time talking about enterprises, but certainly, if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer those at the end. Our strategy has been, for some time, operating utility assets in which we have significant investment, as you know, in a safe and excellent way, and we think optimizing those assets is the way in which utilities can perform year in and year out. We have had a strategy to focus our investments on the utility each year. We update these numbers and they get a little bit bigger this year. The next five-year window looks like about $7 billion of investment, and that has gotten about $1 billion bigger than last year because we're starting to see the front end now in our five-year projection of the coal plant investment. Fair and timely regulatory recovery is critical to the strategy that we're talking about, and that's why we focused on improving the regulatory structure in Michigan a year and a half ago. We're now into operations. The new energy law that was passed in Michigan and allows for forward-looking test to you [ph] self-implementation rates. And in fact, also decoupling, which we now have on the electric side in the business and expect to have short rate on the gas side of the business. And all those factors combined, along with, we think, a constructive regulatory environment and a constructive relationship with our regulators are going to allow us, we think, to deliver on the strategy that we've adopted. Our goal has been to grow our earnings at 6% to 8% on an adjusted basis. This year, 2009, we reported $1.26 in adjusted earnings. And I'm not going to get into a lot of details, but I'd mention our GAAP net income at $0.91 and the difference between the two almost entirely related to a 10-year old issue associated with Big Rock Point decommissioning funds. We're anticipating that we might see that result. I won't say that it's not one we're not a bit disappointed in, but we anticipated it, having seen the administrative live judge decision or recommendation late last year. We were a bit surprised with the timing the commission came out with the final order, sooner than we expected. And we opened their books and reflected in 2009. So it's 10-year old issue, it's not a recurring item and in our adjusted basis for the $1.26 a share. Just a $0.01 better than our original goal of $1.25. You'll recall back in November, those of you who were at the EEI Conference, we were suggesting it might be difficult to reach our goal of $1.25 given some of the elements of the final order and the electric case [ph] that came out at that time frame. But we were able to overcome that with some good cost control. In other measures, Tom will get into more details on those.Our guidance on adjusted earnings for 2010, $1.35 per share, is up exactly 8% from our goal last year of $1.25 and so we feel pretty good about that. We have been growing our dividend, as you know. We increased it from $0.50 to $0.60 a share for this year, and that increase gets us to about a 44% payout ratio. That's still below the industry average, we're aware of that, and our intention is to continue to increase it toward the peer average. Although, we don't expect that we'll get there quickly because the amount of time or the amount of investment we're making in the company, we're not going to rush to get to that peer average. But we want to continue to move in that direction. And also, then to generate strong cash flow and liquidity, and I think our liquidity situation is fairly good now, and Tom will talk about that as well. And our cash flow is increasing at roughly $100 million a year because of the investment portfolio that we're making. So that's an outline. Now John will get into a little bit more detail in the utility here in a minute.2007 is a few years ago, as you know, but as we prepared for the presentation, we thought the last time we did this kind of an event was in 2007. So we went back and looked at what we were talking about then. I won't spend a lot of time on this, but it's been instructive. We were dealing with a significant problem with the contract at Dearborn Industrial Generating facility. That's now solved. We were focused on regulatory restructuring. As I said, it was important to our strategy. That's now been implemented, we think, in a very constructive way. And of course, managing capital projects, that hasn't changed. And that's a lot of -- what we're focused on right now is those capital projects on a go-forward basis.The environment, the business environment overall, some positive, some negative. I would say most of these have changed in a positive direction. The ones that haven't, of course, the Michigan economy and the U.S. economy, frankly, struggled since that time, and that has had some effect on electric supply and demand. But cost of natural gas, cost of construction, a lot of other things have moved in a positive direction. Maureen's going to talk a little bit more about technological innovations. Our business tends to move a bit slowly in that regard, as you know. But we are seeing technological innovation in the Smart Grid area and Smart vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, and we think that's going to have a positive impact on the company over time.The investor issue we hear the most about, people ask me, ""Why are you guys trading at a discount?"" And my answer is, we shouldn't be trading at a discount. We don't think over time, we think we should shrink that discount. But the kinds of issues that come up are the Michigan economy has struggled more because of the auto industry. We're not heavily focused on the auto industry anymore, but there's certainly that perception. We think the Michigan economy has hit bottom and is starting to show some signs of improvement, particularly on the industrial side, and I think we'll see that here in the coming quarters. The response to that has been to try to somewhat alleviate the impact of the economy through the regulatory restructuring. We have a tracker now on uncollectible accounts, and we have surcharges in place for our renewable energy efficiency programs that are actually positive from a cash flow perspective. So we think the structure that's in place sort of mitigates that. But obviously, our life would be easier if the economy was stronger. Our balance sheet continues to be a bit leveraged at the parent, about a $1.8 billion in parent company debt. We could certainly pay that debt down, and it's our intention to do that somewhat slowly over time. But given today's environment and our opportunity to invest in the utility, we simply don't think it's economically efficient to take a lot of our excess cash and use it to pay down that debt quickly, but rather, to invest it in utility. And our dividend payout ratio is still discounted a bit to the peers, but we're moving in that direction as we just talked about.For 2010, our major priorities are fairly simple and they haven't changed a whole lot, achieved [ph] our financial objectives. And I just talked about the $1.35 a share in earnings. Our cash flow forecast, Tom will go over in more detail, and to maintain our coverage ratios and our overall debt level. Continue to focus on employee safety and operational performance, you'll see this on every slide every year, I suspect, because that's what we think the fundamental of the companies are. And to execute our investment plan, including making sure that we get timely recovery of our investments in the utility, and we continue to believe that the regulatory structure and relationships will support that. National energy policy and environmental issues, boy, they've been up and down, haven't they? It's difficult to tell right now exactly what's going to happen in Washington. I certainly don't forecast any significant movement on carbon legislation this year. Although, Senator Reid mentioned that he wants to try to get something done. That was a bit of a surprise. We do see some movement in the EPA, although, I think that process is going to be long and drawn out. So we're continuing to watch it. We were expecting and continue to plan for some sort of long-term cost of carbon in our overall plan. Bill Garrity can address that a little bit more. But nothing dramatic, in our view, that's going to affect the company here in the coming years. And then finally, our balanced energy initiative, and we make a bit of a caveat here, with or without the coal plant. Many of you are aware, I think many of you were surprised that we were able to get a permit to build a new coal plant in December. Certainly, not a lot of those being issued nationwide these days. We continue to believe that, that makes sense for the state of Michigan. But our plan hasn't been based on just building a new coal plant and frankly, there are a number of hurdles they'd get over before we are going to move forward with the construction of a coal plant. We have a permit, we expect it will be appealed in the courts. That's likely to take a couple of years to get resolved. We'll be filing a certificate immediate [ph]  This year and have to resolve with the commission whether it still makes sense to go forward with the coal plant. So a lot of detail. We're only over the first major hurdle here in the coal plant. But the point is, I don't want people to get overly focused on a coal plant because the initiative all along has been a balanced one. We have lots of investment opportunities and whether we end up building a coal plant or don't end up building a coal plant, we don't think it has a dramatic impact on our future plans here. So I just want to highlight that. With that, let me just end. I've got a cast of characters here, over a lot of detail on this and I'll be back to answer questions at the end of the presentation. Thank you."

This is a strategy I think you're familiar with, and something that we've had for several years now. It's clear, it's consistent. When you look at the strategy, it's built on the foundation which is safe and excellent operations. Everything we do with this strategy is based on that. And if we perform that well, we're able to make the Utility investments that you see, which provide value to our customers and ultimately provide value for the regulators, which enable us to continue to make the investments and achieve the overall consistent financial performance Dave talked about. What I'd like to do today between me and the others here is, that we'll go through each of these sections with you to show you we're performing.To begin with, let me show you what some of the highlights that have occurred over the past year. Operational improvements, I'll show you some graphs in a minute to show we are making good operational improvement. We established targets back in 2006, what I called breakthrough goals between 2006, for us to achieve outstanding performance in 2012. I'll give you an update on those in just a few minutes. We just completed a restructuring of the Consumers Energy of the Utility. We reduced our workforce by about 5%, and that was completed at the end of last week. The economy continues to be a challenge. The weather, Dave Joos used to refer to this as the summerless summer which, I think, is exactly what happened in Michigan. We didn't have much of a summer, so we're challenged there. Implementation of energy legislation, the law was passed in the fall of 2008. Last year, we had our first full cycle working through the legislation and through the regulatory components to have the implementation of the law. And in my belief is, the regulators did what was intended in the energy legislation. And I'll show you a quick evaluation how I've graded that out based on the legislation and based how the regulators have implemented it. We did receive an electric Rate Order at the end of last year. Some key components there, we've talked about it with you last night. But some important pieces here are the key outcome to the cases full decoupling. That's decoupling for energy optimization, decoupling for the economy and decoupling for weather. So an important piece for us to eliminate the uncertainty of those variables, particularly in Michigan. We did receive an uncollectible tracker. That's something we've asked for, for many years. We received that on the electric side of the business to mitigate some of the uncertainty of uncollectibles with the Michigan economy. And then finally, and you'll hear from Maureen Trumble today, full recovery of the Smart Grid investment. It's something the commission is very interested in and something we think we can capitalize on in an approach to help provide value to our customers, while advancing our technological systems. The challenge we had, though, is that the final order was less than our self-implementation. It's a bit of old news now based on the earnings, but we were able to pull some operational levers, do some cost management to be able to make that our target. The good news for you, though, is that what is in that final order is what we've planned on for 2010. So going forward, our plan [ph] matches what the commission gave us as far as the electric rate case. Big Rock decommissioning was a surprise to us. Without a lot of detail, this has to do with a refund of $86 million, plus interest, for a surcharge that was on our bill for the Big Rock, which is a nuclear plant we had, Big Rock decommissioning surcharge during the freeze period. And the freeze period occurred with the first energy legislation in Michigan. When that surcharge was completed and ordered to come off the bill prior to energy legislation, we removed it from the bill and took those proceeds for general purposes. That was discussed with the commission. It was also something that we filed a tariff with the commission that was approved. I'm personally disappointed in this order. We're evaluating all options now, including appeal. So this is something that we'll continue to look at and see what happens in the future on that. And Dave talked about the clean coal plant. Bill Garrity is going to talk more about it, but I am proud that we did receive the air permit for the clean coal plant. What I'm most proud about, though, this is the best-in-class coal plant. You hear people talk about carbon neutral. This impacted this plant with the five units that we will shut down if we proceed and two more potentially that we may end up retiring based on their performance. This will be a carbon negative outcome. And I have not seen that in the industry yet. What I've seen is carbon neutral, but the efficiency of the new coal plants and the retirement of the older coal plants, the carbon output will be less than it was before we entered into this. So I'm pleased with that piece. Bill's going to get into more detail with you as we move forward. Let me now talk to you about some of the components of the strategy. And I'll start with the base, which was safe and excellent operation. As we established the targets in 2006, we can see here employee safety. For us, this is the most important thing that we do in the business. And I know this is a financial meeting, but without safety, we can't run our business. We've got a great partnership with a union, union leadership and our leadership of the management team to reduce incidents by 47% since 2006. Now we've got a long way to go. When you look at the 2006 number, we were in fourth quartile in the industry. And just to put things in perspective, we measure safe and excellent operations against all of our peers. We do a lot of benchmarking. It's the way we can determine whether we're performing or not. So far, we've been able to move with the performance in 2009 in the second quartile performance. So a lot of great progress has been made by the employees, but we still have a long way to go to get the first quartile to match our target. Productivity is another breakthrough goal we established in 2006 to increase productivity by 40% by 2012. And you can see we made a pretty good jump in 2009. We're up to 14% and we still have ways to go there, but we are moving that in the right direction, too.Reliability, on the distribution side of the business, you can see a 26% improvement. This is the lighter side of the business, minutes of interruption. Even though this graph looks like we made significant progress, we're still in fourth quartile. We do have issues that we need to improve on the distribution reliability of this business. Our frequency is first quartile, which is the number of events that occur, but as far as the minutes of interruption, the duration, we're still in fourth quartile. But we will continue to move this and improve it for customers because this is what drives value. On the generation side of the business, you can see here EFOR [Equivalent Forced Outage Rate], a standard measure in the industry for reliability. We've improved it by 39%. You see, we've kind of leveled off between 2008 and 2009, and that's intentional because with the air permits that we've received, we're making investments in our largest, newest units. And our newest units are far better than the 5.5% EFOR. But the smaller, older units that we may retire in the future, we're limiting our investment on those units because if they are retired, doesn't make a lot of sense to put the money into it and make the investments. So we're going to see that levelized over the next couple of years, but that puts us at about the average, a little bit higher than the average as far as the industry.Cost management, something we focused on every single day to enable our customers to have the best value they can. This is a five-year average on gas and a six-year average in the Electric business. These are generally all the O&M costs, including pension, overhead, A&G [ph] and so forth. You can see from the charts there, we were at the top of the second quartile. Now we moved into the bottom of the first quartile. So we are pleased that we're removing that in the right direction, aggressively managing cost and one thing we're proud to talk about and we tell the commission often is, that our A&G [ph] costs are the lowest in the country, despite the fact that Tom gave away a free pen.How will we keeping our rates competitive? This is how we do it. I won't go through all of these with you, but the first one is probably the most important. Many years ago, we converted to Western coal versus Eastern coal, that has saved our customers opportunity. If we would have burned Eastern coal versus Western coal, our customers would've paid about $1.5 billion more in fuel costs than they do today. So a significant change, and I think most of you are familiar with it. Coal costs are about $58 a ton. Western coal is about $12 a ton. Now the transportation costs are higher getting the Western coal to Michigan. However, this is a significant savings for our customers. You can see the other things here that we've done, between healthcare and cost-sharing and pension and so forth. And by the way, the defined pension program is for all of our employees, including our union employees. And then finally, the utility restructuring, which I want to talk about briefly. Back in 2007, when I combined the Electric and Gas Utilities into one, we reduced the work force by about 2.5%. We did and I called a selective basis here, which is a little unique for our company, a little unique for Michigan and probably a little unique for the industry. What that meant is, that we offered a voluntary separation package of about half a year's salary. If employees were interested in it, they could tell us they were interested in it. Historically, what happened at the company, if you were most senior, the most senior person, you'll receive that package. That's not the way we did it this time. If your job wasn't going to be eliminated or if we couldn't do the job without you, we didn't give you that package despite the fact that you were the most senior person. And that made sense to me because just because somebody's the most senior and a little bit older than somebody else, doesn't make a lot of sense for us to pay them to leave if I want them to stay. And that was a change in 2007 that we did, and it was very effective. People left that wanted to leave, and we were able to let them leave and those that stayed, we also wanted them to stay because they added value to us. We did the same thing again in 2010, but for different reasons. 2010 was in the consolidation of the industry or the utility, it was an impact of the economy in Michigan. We're seeing a couple of things happen. We think the economy, the recession we're experiencing now is cyclical, but also structural. And so we need to look at the workload and balance the workload with our workforce. We've reduced contractors, we've shifted crews around the state, we've insured as much flexibility as possible with our workforce, which I appreciate all the employees doing all that they can to continue through this process. But we still had an excess of work and excess of resources compared to the work. So we went through, again, on the salaried side of selective basis. In 2010, just last month, we also affected the union employees on an involuntary and a voluntary basis. The net change was about 5%, and you can see there the two restructurings reduced our workforce by about 530 people. We're going through that change now. I expect it will make us more productive in the future and balance our workforce to the work load.Let's switch up to another side of the pyramid, capital investment, utility investment. This is the criteria that we go through that all capital investments that we make at the utility go through this criteria. And it's something that we've used for several years now, and it's really helped us prioritize where our investments need to be. And this is the criteria we use, as it reduces O&M costs. And I think you're all familiar with $1 invested in capital costs our customers about $0.15. $1 invested in O&M costs our customers $1 in that first year. So if we can invest capital to reduce O&M, it saves our customers money as long as there's value oriented to that capital. Supply cost, we've done that, we've talked about the $1.5 billion savings in Western coal, and you can see the list here. There's an add value to customers because it provides service to customers, because it improves our competitive position and ultimately, there are some costs that we have to spend based on mandatory spending. Clean Air Act and other things like that are required. We will do it regardless if it's the most efficient thing to do or not. But this is the criteria we use, which ensures that our investments that we have our rigorous, and we use great discipline in making those investments. This slide, I think all of you are familiar with. This is the rate base slide. I'm not going to go through it because you are familiar with it. But I do want to make a couple of key points. If you look at the right-hand side of the slide, it shows the change from around $6 billion to $7 billion. And Dave mentioned the primary drivers for that, a check there, is the new clean coal plant. But also, there's a significant investment, about a quarter of a billion dollars increase in renewable energy from the last time you saw this and about $400 million in environmental compliance cost. Those are the big changes that have occurred over the last, for this five-year horizon compared to last five-year horizon. But as Dave mentioned, we have a long process to go and Bill's going to show you the various steps that are still required for the new clean coal plant. But if we wouldn't, if we didn't move ahead with a new clean coal plant, we have an abundance of opportunities to invest in the utility. And you can see there on the grayed out box several opportunities in the Gas business, electric reliability, electric generation, plus what's not even on here is taking those older plants that we committed to shut down if we build a new plant and make sure they're in compliance with the Clean Air Act. And so there's other investment opportunities there also. So a lot of opportunities for us to invest in both sides of the business.Can the customers afford it? This is an issue that we struggle with everyday that's why we're in the first quartile of cost management, and we look at every single dollar that we spend as we need to ensure we add value to our customers. What I've done here in a very simplistic way is separate Electric and Gas and have broken them down into two buckets, one is fuel and one is rate base. And you can see historically from 2006 to 2009 what the change was for electric cuts in the rates for fuel and base rates and what we expect them to be in 2009 through 2012 with what our plan has today. Base rates would go up about 3%, almost 1% of that is renewable energy and energy optimization surcharges. And the reason I mention that is, that if customers are taking advantage of energy optimization, they should see their bill decrease. So the average rate, they won't see the increase of average rates. They'll be able to see less dollars paid from their pockets to us because they're taking advantage of it. I think energy optimization offers us a great benefit for our customers and one worth investing in. On the right side of the slide, you'll see a little different story at the Gas business. The Gas business, the increase is about flat from 2006 through 2009 and then continues to be flat based on our expectation for gas prices in 2009 to 2012. But on the bottom panel there what's important is our competitive position. We continue residential rates on Electric or about 7% less than average in Michigan, so below average. And on the Gas side, we're extremely competitive when we think nationally because of the storage that we have. So this is something that we also carefully monitor to make sure that it is affordable and add value to our customers.Let's move up the triangle to regulatory. This is our strategy with the regulators in Michigan. It's one that's been very consistent for the past several years. We need to be able to provide reliable and competitive price energy to our customers. They need to have good service. They need to expect value from us, and we need to deliver that. We also see, and I think the commission sees, the value of having healthy utilities in Michigan. Michigan had struggled over the past couple of years with the major bankruptcies of some auto companies, and they see it's important to have businesses be successful and be healthy in Michigan. And what we believe is important is the cooperative process. The commission doesn't want surprises, we don't want to be surprised and we work with them in a cooperative manner. This is what I'd mentioned earlier, how legislation works and how we're doing against legislation, as far as the regulatory side. And what I've done is just taken the liberty to grade out some of the -- first of all, identify some of the key components in the legislation and you can see those there from energy efficiency to renewable energy to forward-looking tests year and so forth. And then what I've done is, not only we've had a full cycle of regulatory impact on that loss, how we ended up doing. And you can see that, I think from our company's standpoint and from the Public Service Commission, not speaking on their behalf, but I think they have implemented energy legislation as it was intended to do, as intended the law when it was written. And you can see there most of the year, renewable energy, the surcharges are in place, we're moving forward, energy optimization, there's a cap on retail access, file and implement ratemaking, all those things are progressing. I have graded two of those in yellow, one is projected test year. What the Commission did in their order with our electric rate cases spoke very clearly about the importance of projected test year. The only thing is, we saw some actions that didn't necessarily align with their words. There were some contracts we had with our union employees in place that required us to increase their salaries, and yet, the Commission used the negative surcharge for some of those. So it's kind of hard to balance that, but the rest of it I'm very comfortable with. Certificate of Need process, we haven't done it yet. We haven't gone through it, Bill is going to talk about that in a minute, nor has the Commission. And decoupling, I'm pleased with. So I think the Commission has done everything that was intended by the law and moving it in the right direction.This is my last slide, just to give you regulatory update. Most of you are curious, of all the things that are going on with the regulator, this shows, I'll start at the top, the gas rate case we self-implemented, $89 million in November, final order is due the second quarter of this year. Electric rate case, you can see we filed at $178  million, we'll self-implement in July and a final order in the first quarter of January. Show cause is one I don't think we've talked a lot about. The Commission asked us to show cause why in two years, we underspent a tracked item. Our position on that was forestry and fossil fuel, our position is we have overspent on the cumulative basis through 2006 through 2009. For all of those years combined, we have overspent what they wanted us to track. And that's something that we're in the process of working through right now and the ALJ's position will be out in April, I wish I could tell you what others think about this show cause, but no intervenor testified in this case. So that's a bit unusual. It was just us and nobody else show up. File electric decoupling, that's something you should know we'll file after the year to align and true up the decoupling from the previous year. And then the clean coal plant, I'll turn that over to Bill. There is an MPSC meeting today that has to do with the 2007 PSCR [power supply cost recovery] reconciliation. It's not out until 1:30, but I just -- we're all here today, I want to give you a heads up that's on the agenda today. So with that, let me turn it over, the certificate of Need, I'll leave you with that. Bill's going to talk about the Balanced Energy Initiative and he can go into details of what many steps we have to go before we actually file the certificate of Need and to build the clean coal plant. So with that, Bill Garrity, Senior Vice President of Electric and Gas Supply."

The Balanced Energy Initiative was developed in 2007 as our comprehensive long-term energy resource plan. It has been designed as both a balanced and diverse plan, as well as to meet the Michigan standards for renewable energy and energy efficiency. 2/3 of our new resource plan comes from new renewable energy efficiency and demand management programs. The other third comes from the Zeeland natural gas facility that we added to our operating portfolio in 2008 and our new clean coal plant. I'll be providing some status on our renewables and energy efficiency programs that were approved by the MPSC last year, as well as an update on the new coal plants. Maureen will be providing some perspective on our demand management programs next. Maintaining a balanced portfolio and diversity of fuel supply are probably the most key principles of the BEI. As illustrated in the upper left pie chart, our current portfolio is well balanced and consists of about 1/3 coal capacity, 1/3 natural gas capacity and the remaining third spread out over nuclear, oil, pumped storage, purchases and existing renewables on our systems.Our portfolio is less dependent on coal than the Midwest ISO, depicted in the upper right pie chart, which is the market we operate in. We intend to maintain a well-balanced portfolio in the future as exhibited in the lower pie chart. As that chart shows, including our new coal plant, retirement of a number of our oldest coal facilities, expansion of renewables and the demand-side management programs I mentioned, by 2018, the portfolio will be about 1/4 coal, 1/4 natural gas, 1/4 other existing generation facility and 1/4 renewables and demand side. Overall, we believe this represents an effective risk management strategy for our portfolio.As Dave mentioned, when we were here in 2007, we had just announced plans to construct an 830-megawatt coal plant at our generating complex near Bay City, Michigan. The plant is an advanced supercritical pulverized coal design and will use proven state-of-the-art technology in all aspects of its operations, including the latest and the best available technology to control emissions. There is very strong community support for the project and it represents a significant economic boost for Bay County and for Michigan, including construction and operating jobs as well as expanded local property tax base. With a projected service date of 2017, ownership of about 300 megawatts of the total capacity is assumed to be allocated to municipal entities and other interested parties, resulting in about 500 megawatts dedicated to our use. In a significant development along the way, as John mentioned, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality issued an air permit for the plant on December 29, 2009.Besides being an important component of a balanced portfolio, we continue to believe that coal will be a significant factor in U.S. power generation in the future. Coal is the most abundant natural resource in the U.S. and 50% of America's, as well as Michigan's electricity is produced from coal. The new facility will eventually replace a number of our oldest less efficient coal plants. The new plant will be carbon-capture ready and is designed to accommodate the installation of carbon capture and sequestration equipment when this technology becomes technically and economically feasible. In addition, coal is a significant factor in helping to mitigate market price volatility and risk and the BEI capacity mix will reduce the fleet's over all environmental footprint moving forward.As this chart illustrates, our emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury have all been steadily declining since the late 1990s and will continue to decline substantially as we continue to implement the BEI. By 2018, the emissions from our portfolio will decline by as much as 80% to 90% from today's levels. As we've mentioned, we received the air permit in December last year, covering the first two milestones listed on this chart. But as the timeline indicates, we indeed have a long way to go. Our next big step is to file a Certificate of Necessity with the Michigan Public Service Commission, under the new process that was established by the 2008 Michigan energy legislation. This will be a very challenging process and we expect the CON case will be heavily contested, particularly since we face uncertainty and indeed differences of opinion associated with Michigan's economy and associated electric demand, future commodity prices, primarily natural gas and future emission control and regulation and cost. It is very hard to prevent the outcome of the CON process and we will not move ahead with the coal plant if the commission doesn't improve the CON, along with cost recovery for the plants being retired. However, the BEI, as I mentioned, is a comprehensive plan and a flexible plan, It identifies other viable alternatives as well, including life extension for existing fleet and/or additional natural gas capacity, if we don't move ahead with the new coal plant.Moving on to the single largest capacity component of the BEI, as I showed in that first pie chart in the first slide, our renewable energy plant was approved by the MPSC last year and we implemented an $80 million renewable surcharge last fall. Our plan is designed to meet Michigan's 10% renewable energy standard and the requirement to install 500 megawatts of new renewable capacity, which will be predominantly wind by 2015. We currently provide about 4% of our energy requirements to existing renewables on our system and our plan is to meet the incremental energy and new capacity requirement by building 50% and entering into power purchase agreement for the other 50%.The 2008 Michigan energy legislation also established a Wind Energy Resource Board to identify the best wind potential zones throughout Michigan. Based on the Board's filing, the MPSC was also charged with designating a primary wind zone, at least one primary wind zone, in order to facilitate expedited transmission upgrades associated with that zone. Michigan's Thumb region on the east side of the state was designated as that primary wind zone. And the ITC Transmission Company will have the opportunity to build new transmission in this area to accommodate substantial wind energy expansion. This could represent on the order of $500 million in new transmission being built by ITC.Consumers Energy will focus on the west side of the state initially for new generating facilities. Since in that area no new transmission is needed, there is excellent wind potential in that area and this will facilitate obtaining the current Production Tax Credit by 2012. Our intention is to move east to the Thumb region as new transmission becomes available.Our new facilities in the Thumb on the east side will be named the Cross Winds Energy Park in Tuscola County, Michigan, the west side, the Lake Wind Energy Park in Mason County, Michigan. We are already working on evaluating the results of our turbine generator solicitation to support our overall development plan and of course, with the potential of a federal renewable portfolio standard in the future, that can require additional wind capacity by 2020.On the power purchase side of renewables, the other 50% that I mentioned to complement the 50% of self build, we have already solicited for about 260 megawatts of new renewable energy purchase agreements, with about 10 megawatts of new contracts already in place and approved by the Commission. We are well along in evaluating bid responses for the next 250 megawatts, and we have an excellent set of proposals to choose from. We expect to issue another major solicitation in 2011.Moving on to demand side, the Commission approved our six-year energy optimization plan and levelized surcharge of about $90 million in May of last year. A number of residential and business programs were implemented shortly after that and overall customer demand or overall customer response has been excellent since then. The savings results in 2009, as you can see in this table, significantly exceeded the energy savings target for 2009, resulting in a $5.7 million incentive and reduced customer costs throughout our service territory. The EO [ph] programs will be expanded in 2010 to meet a higher incremental energy savings target according to the energy legislation. We have a maximum incentive potential of about $8 million next year.Our most popular programs in 2009 included residential and commercial lighting, home furnace rebates, refrigerator and other appliance recycling and incentives for heating, air conditioning and water heating equipment. In 2010, we will continue the 2009 program and focus on the most popular ones. We will also implement a number of new programs, including an existing home retrofit program and an energy efficiency classroom program that we call Think! Energy. We plan to spend up to the spending limits established in the energy legislation, and we'll strive to exceed the electric savings targets to satisfy the Commission's rate decoupling requirements.Overall and in summary, the BEI embodies a balanced and flexible strategy for new energy supply resources. Without a dominant reliance on any particular type of capacity, fuel source or technology, we believe the BEI mitigates the significant uncertainties we face and has an integrated approach to energy supply and investment planning. And with that, I thank you, and I'll turn it over to Maureen who will talk to us a little bit about our Smart Grid Program."

As Bill said, I'd like to give an update on our Smart Grid Program, starting with an explanation of the three major components for the Smart Grid Program. The diagram shown on the left side is the enhancements and improvements to o",2200,"Good morning, everyone. As Bill said, I'd like to give an update on our Smart Grid Program, starting with an explanation of the three major components for the Smart Grid Program. The diagram shown on the left side is the enhancements and improvements to our SAP enterprise system and other core business systems that will be required to support the Smart Grid. The middle component, the network, shows the two-way communication stream that connects the customer to the company. And on the right-hand side is the home area network and it shows the 1.8 million electric meters that we will be replacing, as well as the communication modules that we'll be installing on 1.7 million gas customers meters. 80%, as you can see here, of the total cost of implementing Smart Grid is in that middle and the right side of the diagram. So one of the things that we feel is very, very clear in this is it's important to make sure that we're thoroughly assessing and piloting and testing the equipment to make sure we're making the right choices before we begin mass deployment.Smart Grid is a customer-oriented investment. We estimate the total investment at Consumers Energy to be $920 million. It enables operational efficiencies for the company and for our customers. Some of those include reduced field trips, we're able to do certain functions remotely. It also gives us the capability to improve service reliability. Bill talked about the Balanced Energy Initiative. The Smart Grid program contributes significantly to the Balanced Energy Initiative and meeting our customers capacity requirement going forward. It enables our direct load management program or dynamic pricing program, both programs together allow our customers to make better energy decisions and control their energy cost and make better decisions as far as their usage patterns. By 2020, these two programs together are estimated to contribute nearly 500 megawatts towards our capacity requirements. Smart Grid also provides customer value through expanded energy information that we're giving to customers and giving customers the capability to control their energy usage and energy costs. It also provides a good return for our customers.I know some of you in this room have toured our Smart Services Learning center, which we're very proud about. It opened in late 2008 and it serves two primary purposes: One is the demonstration facility; and the other is testing. We've had nearly 2,000 people tour the Smart Services Learning Center, that includes legislators, regulators, major customers, major vendors in the industry and media and several other groups as well. One of the major benefits we see is it helps customers to better understand the benefits that Smart Grid will enable and it also makes all of that technology much more realistic and understandable when customers can actually see the components involved. Looking at the diagram, I'll start with the blueprints at the bottom. Looking at the bottom right-hand corner of the slide, you'll see our demonstration facility in the Smart Services Learning Center. One side of the room has the customer home of the future, the other side has the utility of the future. Moving counterclockwise on the slide, you'll see in the upper right quadrant is our Michigan Public Service Commission Chairman is touring the home of the future. And here he's learning a bit more about some of the programs that Smart Grid will enable and actually seeing some of the devices. And we feel that this has been one of the keys to the relationship we built in working with the Commission. And as John talked, it helped as far as our full recovery of our investment through 2009 on the electric side, totaling $46 million.Continuing to move counterclockwise, the top left corner, you'll see what is the utility of the future. And this is the area where we demonstrate with our SAP prototype environment. We can actually show we can remotely read customer meters. We also show how we can enhance service reliability with outage response. And then continuing again on the lower left quadrant of the diagram here, is what's one of the most important segments of our Smart Services Learning Center, our testing area. And here's where we really rigorously testing the meters, the communications equipment, the equipment that will go in the customers home, as far as intelligent communicating thermostats and so forth. It's only after we rigorously tested the equipment there that then we can continue assessment by moving it into the demonstration facility and continue to evaluate it there.We have continued to position ourselves as fast followers. We're not the first in the industry to deploy Smart Grid. We're learning from the industry, we're watching other deployments. We have said we will not be the first to deploy any significant equipment of any vendor. We're continuing to assess. We're assessing seven different AMI Smart Grid vendors in our assessment facility. What some of the things that we're looking at there is we're focusing on the components, we're focusing on interoperability, security and future proofing, making sure that the equipment will be able to expand going forward as more home area network devices are available and deployed. From those seven vendors that we're assessing, the plan is to take three to four vendors into a pilot environment. I say three to four because we have already deployed two vendors into the field. We recently selected a third vendor and will begin deploying that within the next month or so. We anticipate that we'll have a fourth vendor that will pass our assessment criteria, but I can't say who that is, obviously, at this point and I can't for sure say that there will be a fourth vendor. As I said, they [ph] have to pass that rigorous assessment testing that we have. One of the other key things that goes into our architectural design and our overall vendor selection is security and interoperability standards. It's very costly and very difficult to change direction to match standards once you've deployed millions of meters. So one of the things that we have stated is until those security and interoperability standards have progressed and developed, we will not begin mass deployment. We're actively engaged with NIST, the Department of Energy and other leading groups, as far as helping to move these standards forward and the NIST roadmap shows that the required standards will be developed by the beginning, early in 2011, and that sits very well with our program schedule. We've had, as I indicated, a lot of people within our group that had been heavily involved. In fact, Wayne Longcore, from our program team, has taken a very active leadership role. He is working with NIST and is a member of NIST's Smart Grid Interoperability Panel, which is a 20-member guidance panel. He's also was recently named to a 12-member panel, that's the GridWise Architecture Council, and they're actually an advisory group to the Department of Energy as far as grid modernization. So we're taking the leadership role to help to move this critical work forward and helping to drive it. The next few slides will show a little bit more on some of the things that we're actually doing to test and assess the technology. We've collected GPS information on all of our customer meter locations. We then use that information to develop geospatial models for each of the Smart Grid AMI vendors that we're testing. This diagram shows a geospatial model for one of the mesh communication vendors that we have in assessment. Many of the pilots in early deployments across the country have been in more densely-populated urban environments. And a significant portion of our service territory is rural, so we feel it's very important to test this equipment in a rural environment and make sure how it will function where the meters are a little bit further apart and it makes it a little bit more difficult with trees and hills and all of the things that come in between.Once vendors have made it through our assessment in our lab facility, we actually get a little bit creative and we continue assessment in a field environment. We actually have mounted meters on the back of trucks that you can [ph] see here. We've also temporarily strapped them to poles. What we're doing is we're testing that geospatial model that we've developed. We're finding out where the vendors says that it takes so many collectors for so many meters, we're validating is that relationship really true. How do the communication patterns work? Is the communication truly circular or does it communicate better in one direction than another? What's the impact of trees and hills? We had highway abutments. We've had all kinds of interesting learnings that as we've gone forward in this environment, we're able to pick everything up and continue in different locations to test.I've talked about our Smart Services Learning Center, now I'd like to talk about our Smart Grid Technology Center. And what this is, as you heard in the Smart Services Learning Center, we're testing there performance and capability, but this center focuses on something different. We're focusing on quality and durability. We're actually doing a rigorous life-cycle test on meters and other devices. And this is really part of our risk mitigation strategy, finding out how those meters will hold up over that 20-year lifetime. It includes exposing meters in environmental chambers. We find out how they'll operate in a hot August day in Michigan and how they'll handle a cold January day in the dead of winter in Michigan. So we're really putting it through a rigorous test. We feel it's critical to test and validate, not only the performance, but also the durability and the quality of all of this equipment before we do begin deployment of 1.8 million electric meters and 1.7 million gas modules on meters.Very quickly, this shows our four pilot area territories that we've mapped out in the greater Jackson area. We've had significant learnings on vendor performance as we've gone through the pilot. We've also learned a lot about vendor support as we've gone forward. All of this truly has reaffirmed our approach that we feel that it is important to continue assessing and piloting the technology.This last slide shows our program timeline. It represents the major segments of work going forward and the incremental program cost. Our Board of Directors recently approved funding for the program through 2011. And I've talked quite a bit already about assessment and piloting, so I'd like spend just a couple of minutes talking about two other major streams of work that we have going forward over that two-year period. First of all, our systems and communications enablement. This is where we're building upon the enterprise system that we built with SAP that we implemented a couple of years ago, continuing to add the functionality required to enable Smart Grid benefits for our customers. It also includes expansion to our outage management system and other supporting systems. The first release you see there will be implemented in the middle of July of 2011. That will enable us to begin mass meter deployment beginning in January of 2012. There's been a second release that will come in the middle of 2012 and that release will give us additional functionality, as well as it will give us the capability to handle a higher volume of meters being deployed.The other major stream of work I'd like to talk about a little bit here is the two programs that I mentioned earlier, our dynamic pricing program and our load management program, we'll actually be conducting field pilots on both of those over the summer of 2010. Getting ready to kick both of those off right now. Dynamic pricing will actually have five treatment groups as well as a control group and we plan to learn a little bit more about customer motivation and acceptance of our marketing approaches, as well as multiple pricing option. With our load management program, we're hoping to learn more about customer reaction and receptivity to different marketing approaches. Other utilities across the country have deployed load management. We're taking a little bit of a different twist to it, but in addition to that, it's very important for us to understand how customers will respond in Michigan versus customers in California and other parts of the country because all customer groups can be different.Meter deployment, as you see here, begins to ramp up in January of 2012. We're going to start with a slow deployment pace, about what 150,000 meters over that first six months gives us a chance to learn a little bit more still about the technology. Also gives us an opportunity to learn more exactly how the field deployment goes and what are the learnings there so we can adjust going forward. The middle of the year, we begin to ramp up the pace and we'll begin deployment of about 4,000 meters on a daily basis. And we'll continue at that pace on average through the life of the program and expect to complete deployment by the end of 2015. Thank you very much."

I hope you'll find that it's beneficial to have these professional experts come and chat with you and then they have the finance guy to get up and I've got about 878 slides to take you through in great detail about how everything is going. Oh, maybe not that many. But if you need to, take a stretch it's okay but just your fingers on your pens that's all. I won't be much longer before we get into the most interesting part and that's to take some of your questions, which we do look forward to. But here, let me just give you a quick peek. This is the 2009 report card, then I'll show you a little bit about '10 and then the more distant future where we're going. We're pretty pleased that in a tough year, where the economy wasn't really our friend and as John mentioned, and quoted, ""Dave, I think on [ph] the weather wasn't exactly there for the summer either."" It was a pretty big challenge. But we beat and exceeded all our report card goals except one. And we're going to watch that one carefully as we go into the future and I think Dave chatted just a little bit about that. Here's some other accomplishments that aren't directly shown on that chart. Because they include the further cost reduction and you could say if you're already feeling you're pretty lean why would you be doing more and I think John described it nicely and his team gets huge amount of credit for going out there and keeping us down to the size of where the customers are and what they really need from us. And that's never a fun thing, to go through reduction programs like that but it's one that we keep our eye on because we've got to watch the rates we charge our customers. Then on the liquidity position, I looked at Laura she just seems to have a crystal ball out there. She figures out exactly when the markets going to be terrific. My advice to you is watch Laura as she starts to make a move on CMS. Check all the rest of your clients out there because there's something good about to happen. And in fact in our case, we nearly doubled our free cash flow through some things with the government help, like lower pension contributions and the like and some things that we did on our own. And we pre-funded our 2010 and 2011 CMS parent maturity requirements, which takes some overhang out of this system. The total [ph] cost into this year but we think that that's the right thing to do, so congratulations to the team there. Doing that at the lowest interest rate ever at CMS Energy parent [ph].And then also thanks to the Public Service Commission for some very constructive regulatory orders that allow us take the programs that we've been talking about for a couple of years and continue to move forward with those in a way that's helpful for our customers and helpful for you, the owners of the company. And of course Dave mention the dividend, we thank our board for staying tuned in on that to try to keep moving in a direction that's helpful to you. In this slide, we show you the track record and if you look at what happened over the last several years, you see the earnings growth is up about 8%, we're pleased with that but our guidance isn't that, that would be the high-end of what we would expect to do in the future as you look out over the next five years. This year at a $1.26, $0.01 better, sorry we couldn't hit it right on the money but a penny better is better than a penny worse I think and the picture here of showing the dividend increase that occurred in January and the make up of where the earnings were in 2009. Let's take a little look at as you think about where we were this time last year, what were we facing and how did things really turn out. Because Dave has already talk a little bit of the left side of this chart. I want to go over to the right side of the chart and remind that versus the plan that we started out with, the economy was tougher than we expected. And the weather was awful, almost $0.10 of earnings loss to the mild summer that we had. And then as John mentioned, we had a very constructive, a very helpful rate order but it was a little tough on us in the back part of the year in terms of what it meant in 2009. We were able to go out and do a variety of things, including some really good operational changes to be lean on cost, including some benefit that didn't occur until 2010 around some of the restructuring with some things that help us in 2009 and the parent financing was good as that was for liquidity it also brought us a little earnings boost that we were able to put into the year. And then Bill Garrity mentioned to you the Energy Optimization Incentive, almost $6 million. That was also able to help us perform well on what our customers really wanted us to do.Now here's a peek, if we now look at the 2009 results compared to 2008. And just say how year to year did it go. And again here, you can see in the left side where the weather hurt us a bit and the economy hurt us a bit as well and we had some programs in place like a resource conservation program that had been completed so that was behind us no benefits in 2009. But you see how the utility put it all together with its rate cases and its cost controls to hold itself flat in a pretty tough year. And then over the enterprise side, we were lucky with some of the financing or fortunate I would say, with some of the work on the financing and some of our projects to be able to add in a little bit of good news, all in the total structure of the company that leave us with the $1.26.Now here's a little peek about the refinancing that we talked about, which is kind of a prefunding of maturities. This is a nice kind of a look at exactly what that means. We still have about $67 million coming due this year in parent maturities and $214 million in 2011. But the financing that we put in place that shows here as 2020 of $300 million covers that. So we're in good shape. Now that's a little pressure on the earnings but nothing that we couldn't contain in the guidance that we've provided to use, so we thought that it was a good move for our liquidity in taking over hang out of the way. Now looking to into the future, for 2010, here's the guidance that Dave mention at $1.35 a share part of that 6% to 8% growth. In fact about 7% growth compared to last year and then you can see the elements in the company on where that's going to happen. And when you look at the utility, there's a lot of pieces, a lot of ups and downs but if you does simplify the picture and you look at the rate base growth, and you look at the equity portion of that, including having a little bit better ROE than we would've had in the prior year. You can see that the $0.16, $0.17 of earnings growth that happens at the utility is driven by that. Now there are other things in there but that the simple look at how to figure out where the company is going in 2010. Let me jump over to a picture that says well, how does that all compared to 2009. And we've done a little bit of linkage here for you. We show that the on the utility side, where revenues are going to be down a little bit in part because we talked about a little softer economy than most, and I'll show you more on that in just a moment. That links up in part with our decoupling program. Not in total but a large part of that. And then when you look at the cost and other, these are things that we need to do for our customers, investments that were making maintenance work that we're doing, and most of that is captured in our new rates. So you can see here between the new rates, the decoupling and the full year effect of old rates that we're put in place during the course of the past year, utility becomes the driver and that you would expect it to be with earnings growth of about $0.29. On the enterprise side, you can see we have to pick up a few things that don't repeat from their prior year so you see things like the financing where not only did we get some benefit last year that doesn't repeat this year, we also did that prefunding so we're holding a little more cash than we normally would and that's a negative year-to-year, so you can see those pieces. Another important piece that I know you're very attentive to, is our convertibles. And our convertibles will cost us money as the price of the stock goes up and I hope you don't ask me the question on what would you assume the price of the stock is but I'm certain with that comment someone now will. But we made just a guess if where it might be for planning purposes and build that into our guidance. So we view that stock appreciation as a good thing even with a bit of dilution that comes out of that to have our 7% growth. SO let's talk about the economy. I wanted first to show you just a little bit about 2009 compared to 2008 because it's somewhat instructive of what I think you're hearing from a variety of companies including us. The blue bars that we show up here are Industrial overall 6% down for the year last year compared to the 2008. The green bar is up here to show our total electric sales on a weather adjusted basis and you can see that overall, they were down 3%. But you can see, there's a trend in here as we were going through the year, the declines were less and less and in fact in the fourth quarter, we looked pretty good but I want you to remember the industrial for the full year down 6% and the total down 3%, as I'd take you to this next slide.Here, you can see that same 3% in the total blue bar for 2009 in the same 6% in that longer bar for the industrial side. And then you can also see where we were in residential customers and commercial customers but more instructively, with the green bars where we think we might be in 2010. Now, neighbors to the south of us into the east of us into the west of us are talking about something a little more robust than I think many of them have been more in the a ballpark of a 1% growth. We'd rather plan conservatively. We are not smarter than our colleagues around the region but we've rather be a little bit safe here with our decoupling in place that will give us some protection on the electric side, whether it's the economy or whether it's the weather or whether it's energy optimization, what it may be. And then starting in May, we may also have some decoupling around the gas side of the business, well that helps but then you say, why plan conservatively. I just think it's good to be there on an underlying basis and if we're better, more benefits back to our customers because we are going to have our chance to earn our authorized rate of return in any event and we'd like to see that turn happen. The big yellow circle on the left side of this, I have been showing this one, it feels like since about 1981 but it really has only been a year or two. And this recession, the great recession as they call it in our country here is certainly different than what we faced back in the early 80s. But it does have a lot of similarities and looks like the impact and lease in Michigan is a lot similar. This time compared to then. Remember back then, we watched sales decline over a three-year period, in total about 7%. In this period, it looks like we may be closer to 6% and if we're a little too pessimistic on this may be it won't even be that much and it's a good sign. Despite all the difficulties we face, we've been through this before and know some of the things that we need to do to work with our customers to try to help them be successful. So here's some of the protection. This is a look and I hear you talking a lot about this with others but these are some of the things that were able to do to minimize or mitigate the risk at the utility. I want to start with a circle on the right side. When you take look at that, that's the revenue recovery we get for our cost structure and if you look at the fuel side where we've had that pass through for some time both on PSCR and GCR, but here as you look at the business also tree trimming on the electric side and uncollectible, that's about 2/3 of our cost structure that we have some protection for and that's a good place to be. Now the rest clearly are O&M investment and interest expense. If there are changes in those up or down, we're still exposed to what those may be not the absolutes, but of course the changes. That's a pretty nice position to be in and we're grateful to be working with the Public Service Commission that's helpful to us on that. Go to the left side now, sales side of the story. I think we probably have one of the better decoupling mechanisms on the electric side and that gives us protection for about 60% of the business, and we suspect we'll have something similar to that in the gas rate order but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. So it gives you some nice protection in the sales side. Again, importantly when their sales are down, we get this protection, which helps us and we're just as happy to have this mechanism when the sales are up. I know some of you are saying, ""But you are going to give up the upside we really don't think of it that way. When there's an upside that goes right back to our customers and gives them some cushion, that gives them a little bit more benefit and we still get our opportunity to earn our authorized rate of return. So the risk of mitigation here, we think is important. Now staying with the decoupling for a minute, here is an example of how it works for us in Michigan. Taking a residential customers only but you could apply this into and other classes because this is monitored by class, residential, commercial classes, industrial classes. And here what you see, the operative words are, we get the comparison if you will of average sales per customer, compared to what was authorize in the rate case for decoupling. So let's use an example, where the average sales for customers, let's say a month would be 725-kilowatt hours and then we get an actual for that month of about 700 and you take the difference in that and multiply that times the number of customers that we're in the rate case in the average margin, which in this case, in this example gives you a surcharge of about $2.4 million that we collect a little bit later of course after it goes through its review process. It's pretty simple. That's how it works, but remember it goes the other way as well. If those average sales are up, then there's a refund that goes back to the customer again, later but we still have our ability to earn our authorize rate of return. Now Dave made a quick mention about the rest of the business and we have this one slide and I wanted to share with you so what is happening in enterprises and where are you with interbank and that's what in this particular slide, you get a map here that shows you where are all the facilities and operations are in a little inserts box that tells you for the generation facilities, what did they burn, where do have partnerships and what's the capacity and as always, the main story there is Dearborn Industrial Generation facility that makes up the bulk of the operation. Here you can see that we expect the earnings per share for 2010 to be about $0.06 on enterprises and a couple pennies on Interbank so about $0.08 in total. You've heard us talk I think a year ago about the enterprise side being about $0.05 but maybe going up to $0.06 or $0.07 so you begin to see that we actually did a little better than we expected last year and we expect that to continue at about $0.06. So small part of our business but contributed about $0.01 to growth that we have.Let's look at cash flow. You have in your materials in front of you and on the website that we've put out for everybody, this is the same cash flow slide for 2009 and the only thing I'm going to point out because I know you're very familiar with it and enjoy having the parent on the left and the utility on the right when you look at the parent on the left with Starburst one item. By looking at the source of cash compared to both interest and preferred dividends, as well as overhead and tax payment and you can see the space there has growth. It's up to $455 million as shown in this slide for 2010 that equivalent number when you look at the back up 2009 was about a quarter of $1 billion. So you see substantial improvements as we go through time for parent and that gives us headwind to do the things that we like to do. Here's just a brief picture on liquidity, we like -- instead of just giving one picture we like to give you a two-year look in how the liquidity runs because there are the absolutes for the end of the year of $1.1 billion worth of liquidity. And because on the gas side of the business we by gas throughout the year but during the summer months and spring and fall months, we're buying gas, putting in it to our storage deal to buy it a the favor rate for customers, that gives you a little bit of cycling here in terms of cash levels and the liquidity levels and that's the purpose of this slide.On this next slide, this is one that's very familiar to you as well and I like the repetition. I hope you do as well. But these are our sensitivities. Now highlighted in yellow here are the things that we think they're still substantial, still important to look at but what's different in this slide from what you've been looking at in the prior years is that we have some more trackers in place and a little protection on the decoupling side. So reflecting all of that, you can see that sales isn't as big an issue to us even though it still has a cash flow implication in part because the cash is collected later through the decoupling process. But you still get the ups and downs there. On the gas side, it's always been true, the earnings impact has been small but because of that gas we're putting in an inventory you can have flexibility, short-term working capital on the gas that we purchase. The rule of thumb here that we use for about $0.50 that's worth about $60 million up or down depending on the direction that you're going. UAs, with the tracker that's in placed on the electric side and then probably on the gas side coming up this May gives you a little bit of protection there. So there's not a lot of exposure and then all these are still important. Both that we get a good authorized return on equity and then we have the ability and that we succeed on delivering that. I think when you look at track record on that, we've been doing better and better as we've gone through the years on both of our main business units electric and gas and you can see what the impacts are here, if we were to miss. So here are the targets for 2010. They're very similar to the kinds of targets that we've shown you before except for cash flow. We thought it might be more instructive to use operating cash flow now to show you were going to be and what we expect to do and in two slides I'll show you the reason for that. Let me move to a slide here that John used and went through this with some care I'd put this up again because I want to reemphasize the two-track approach that we have to our investment programs. We're very hopeful that coal turns out to be the right thing to do and that we can get a certificate and necessity approved and we can be successful for that. But if it turns out the economics aren't there for whatever reason or the commission doesn't see that's the certificate they want to issue. We have a second track of investments that John talked about that are very important for our customers. Some of them are substitutes for what we would need to do if there's not a coal plant and some of those are being able to do some incremental work that we would really like to be able to do, and we think our customers would prefer. So there's a two-track approach here on the investment plan. Okay, now this is the slide that tells you why I wanted to focus a little more on operating cash flow. And that is because as we put these investments in place, which are shown on this slide in light blue and a yellow with the choices in the yellow, that investment generates not only the earnings growth of around 6% to 8% but it also delivers an operating cash flow improvements. So the underlying cash flow of the company improves each year by more than $100 million as you can see on this particular chart. And that's important for a lot of reasons, that gives us the room to make the additional investments in the future. To do the things that are important, including growing the dividend, so important slide for you to look at. Now this one goes out a little bit further and its just to give you a view of a kind of the layering of three of the choices and there are a lot of choices we could have put up here but here's the cash flow as we see it for the next many years into the future. And then it shows you one of the big choices that we're making of course is on the win side, where we're required to make these investments. Even though we're using PPAs earlier as Bill Garrity told you in our investment program, and our investment come a little bit later. There's still early in this cycle so where we go. And Maureen told you about AMI program and she showed you the investments we're making those are those investments shown up there in red or pink or whatever you want to call that color and then coal plant, or whatever other investments may be there. So you get a sense of how all those layer in overtime. Now I have one more slide that I wanted to -- I like that slide but I'll go to a different one with you. I have one more slide that I want show you that's a bit of more of a repeat. This is one that John showed you because it's so important to us. I'm taking from some of the details that he talked about to show you four points about what I call the balance on the left side. John gave you several examples of why the investments needs to meet customer needs first and foremost. If the Customers don't need it, then there's no reason to make the investment but then there are three other pieces, one, we've got to do this so they result in responsible rate increases that our customers can afford. Two, they're affordable for our capital structure and three, they are attractive to earnings growth. And those pushing different directions of course and it also along with the earnings growth gives us that extra cash flow growth that gives us the flexibility to do important things we needed to do. This is the same data for the same period. These are annual rate increases over the last three years in the first bar and over the next three years, our gas in the second bar. In the electric side, you see overall rate increases coming down from about 7% to 6% but the important part is the rate base request that we have over that three-year period would be about 3%. Now any increases is a challenge for your customers when they are in tough times. But when they're delivering on things that are going to give them the right reliability that they need to have and give them returns as they go through time like there's no electric customers on AMI, they're not going to get the return in day one but they are going to get a nice return as we go through time on that investment being made on their back. And of course the gas stories even more exciting because it essentially says if fuels go where we think they're going to go, gas prices come down the way people are predicting then you'll have a situation that's a lot like where we were in last three years and it's almost like the investments are for free for the customers but we're still very focused on that 2% piece of the base rate increases.A couple more slides. This one is a slide that has a little bit of history and thank goodness we don't have to talk much about this anymore but we had some challenges in their early years of the last 10 years ago. And spent a lot of time restructuring and rebuilding our balance sheet both at consumers to get the equity level, as well as the parent to get the debt down substantially as shown here by $4 billion. That was fun but I get asked, do you like it now more than back then or was it exciting to be part of the restructuring? Let me be clear, I like it now. It's a whole lot better. What we've done over the last couple of years has gotten a comprehensive state law around energy. And I think taken any other way, would not have been successful for us, trying to do that piecemeal wouldn't have worked. Those people are maybe wanted to go but for good reason are not the same people that would want renewables. But we have the possibility for both. People that want to see energy efficiencies on one hand probably don't necessarily want to see more investments that are related on generation or whatever on the other hand. A lot of balancing and a lot great work under Dave's and John's leadership and many other people in this room and outside this room along with legislature and other politicians to make that possible is very important for our business. Over the last year we've been in the execution phase. It's all well and good to have a law and we're well down that path and we're proud of that. So a little bit of sunshine, as you look in the future, that's the $7 million of investments. And remember when talked about going from $6.3 billion when we showed you this for a five-year projection last year compared to a little over $7 billion now. It's really this simple. It's the same program we've been talking about but it drops off the first year of lower spending and adds in a new last year and a fifth year at a bit higher spending that follows some of the charts that I've shown you here. So it's the same program as we're evolving through time. With that, if we're able to better serve our customers and that's what we're all about then we can be very successful and grow the business for you. A few take aways that I'd like to have you think about is, we're more visible now. We're more visible from the standpoint of our utility investment that leads to earnings growth of 6% to 8% and operating cash flow growth that's about $100 million or more each year improvement. We're fortunate I guess to have NOLs, I was cringe a little bit for how we get them but we're fortunate to have them because it avoids the need for new equity in the near term.Our regulatory framework is constructive. We are very happy with the way we been able to do our work with the Public Service Commission and the way they been able to lead us to things that our important to them and to us for our customers and we've been able to mitigate our risk somewhat. And then lastly, and probably very importantly to many of you whose been able to grow the dividend I think substantially over the last few years and we know we have more work to do in that area. So what I'd like to do now is ask the presenter if they would come up to the front table so they have a chance to look you in the eyes so that you can look them in the eye. So everyone have Dave please come up to lead us through our Q&A session and we're happy to take your questions and we thank you for your patience over an hour and a half here because I know that's a lot of patience and we look forward your questions. Dave?"

But all things equal, I'm just wondering what is driving the estimate for interest and other from $0.37 to $0.45 I assume a chunk of that is the pre-funding of the maturities.

The number in here is not our prediction of where the stock price will be and should be but the number is $17 a share because I know you're going to go out and figure it out anyhow. And I want you to know we hope it substantially higher than that. But that's what's built into the convertible calculations for the dilution. I'd like to also point out in case you didn't note that in the appendix portion of your book, we'd laid out the convertibles for you. Convertible by convertible with the impact that would happen going stock price up or stock price down. So you can do your own math and understand exactly how that affects our earnings. Importantly on that subject, we've built that into our guidance and so were still very comfortable with $1.35. To your second question, that's specific about the interest and the other for those of you that don't see that slide, it goes from $0.37 in 2009 to $0.45 in 2010. The biggest piece of that is the pre-funding of the interest. In part, we had a benefit last year if you recall that helped us a little bit on the interest side of the equation and then because we had done a few things that helped us on our earnings per share. But then on this side, we've done this pre-funding so we got an extra $300 million sitting in our cash to pay that $67 million at the end of this year and the $214 million I think it was into next year. So that's in interest expense that we didn't have $300 million times 6 1/4%. We can figure out that particular piece and put it there. But there's another little piece that's in there. There's some parent tax benefit about a couple of pennies that we had in 2009 that we don't predict would repeat in 2010 and everybody looks at me and says, ""I always say that Tom and all of a sudden there's another couple of pennies of tax but there's not any in our guidance. So put those two together and that's about $0.09 that covers."

Once we get past that, unless new things come up, and I'm going to give you an example of new things in just a moment. We would need to go to the market, particularly if we have a project that scale of a coal plant or something like that. It would make sense for us to come to the market to issue new equity. We have made that decision, that's pretty far out in the future. So that's one that I guess I wouldn't worry about, but I want to be very candid and transparent with you that we don't have other tools in place. Now why might I be wrong and why might this protection that we have last longer? Why might the NOLs be worth more to us as we go further in time. We have not built bonus depreciation into the 2010 guidance yet, and they're still a pretty good prospect that something may happen there. I think you all realize how that works when we get the tax shelter down at the Utility, that pushes the time when we use the NOLs out. Doesn't change them, they have a good life, it just pushes the timeframe out. So we're always looking for the best ways to first protect our customers down at the Utility, with whatever tax shelters that are available. And then two, to get a benefit to help the financing for the company at the top end. So I hope that helps."

Obviously, maybe talk about both of them, we're at a 10% renewable portfolio standard by 2015, there was a lot of debate about what that standard ought to be, when the legislation was passed. In our case, we already had about 4%. Certainly, it wasn't a huge stretch for us to get to six. Though a lot of people thought ought to be higher. Of course, you're hearing the proposed federal standards that are higher than that. And I think some of people continuing to pressure and say, look let's do more. I would say it was carefully considered because there were arguments on the other side that say, look Michigan's economy isn't really strong right now. One sure thing, you want to drive up the price of terabyte over doing renewables to the time when renewables continued to be a little bit more expensive than what prices otherwise would be in the region. I think there will be continued debate. I don't expect to see anything happen in the near term with regard to changes in the state standard. We'll continue to watch what happens with the federal level and if something higher does happen, I think we've got the ability to implement more within the state. On the choice cap, remember when that choice cap was put into place, we were only in about 3%, maybe 4%,  folks taking choice percentage of our. We had been higher than 10 at one in point. And what we pointed out to the legislature and resonated was, look, when you have a situation where customers can come and go as they please, and the kind of gas price volatility we saw to drive that in either direction it has, it's going to be difficult for folks to invest in base load capacity whether it's on the Merchant side or whether it's on the Utility side. And eventually folks you're right, we're not prepared to completely get rid of the idea of choice, but we're prepared to limit it as 10% cap. We we're okay with that because frankly that's about the level of short-term purchases we would normally make as part of our portfolio planning, anyway. And it wouldn't preclude us from moving forward with the base load plan. There are some now because gas prices come down dramatically,, pricing and with the economy off for the summer that power prices came down and choice is now up to that cap for sensing [ph] where we ought to raise the cap. A lot of folks I talked to understand the fundamentals of this, where we knew that would happen and what has happened is exactly what was predicted and that's the reason we put this cap into place. I expect there will be proposals to raise the cap I don't expect that they'll get any traction but there will be no doubt be some debate about that. And I think the reason is exactly as we said, if you raise the cap then it's going to be difficult to invest in significant generation within the state and what has happened is totally predictable and the reason they put the cap in place in the first place.

There are folks that are proposing for example, that the fastest way to roll out renewables in the Eastern Interconnect would be to build a high-voltage overlay over the whole Eastern Interconnect somewhere between $50 billion and $100 billion worth of investments over time. And they've liked it to the interstate highway system. That maybe fast, but it isn't necessarily fair to all customers and isn't necessarily reflect the market. So some of the folks that are involved in this I would say including us are concerned that if you build that and socialized all the cost. Basically, postage stamp-type of rates if you will, that you'll work the economics. So that indeed when power from the Dakotas where the wind is 40% plus unavailability factor is going to be much more competitive than wind in Michigan or wind in offshore in the East Coast. If you ignore the cost of transmission if you roll the cost of transmission in and the folks building the wind or buying the power are paying for that incremental cost. The economics is actually maybe favorable, for in fact are masses [ph] that they are favorable to developing renewable in Michigan. And Ralph Izzo for example, he believes his math is favorable to developing offshore in New Jersey, but you wouldn't develop offshore wind in New Jersey at that expense, if the transmission costs were effectively socialized because it's going to be cheaper to buy power plant in North Dakota. On an overall cost, however, customers would pay more. Secondly, Michigan is a bit unique in terms of circumstances because even the Eastern Interconnect overlay analysis has been done so as Michigan wouldn't derive significant benefits, but of course if you socialize the costs then they pay a large share of those cost that actually came out negative in terms of the cost of transmission. So our goal is simply to say, let's make sure the people that are benefiting from significant transmission investment are the ones that are paying for the investment both though it's fair to the customers and so that it doesn't work the economics, and potentially even impede the development of renewables across the Eastern Interconnect to the benefits of a few locations. So that's the concern that we have."

Natural gas of course, every three years we seem to have a different story, but the story right now is all about the shale gas as you know. And the viewpoint and certainly the future has reflected a more stable pricing, higher than they are today but more stable pricing going forward than what we've seen in the past. I don't know whether to believe that's a long-term trend or not. Obviously, if gas prices moved up fairly dramatically over time, that makes the coal plant even more attractive. But obviously, also drives up price in natural gas, the order base is few customers and drives up the regional prices and puts more pressure generally on the economy and more pressure generally on your customers.

In Michigan, it's always been you file after you've spent or invested the capital, and it's both used and useful. In fact, the reason we had such a debate about the CON is we didn't feel that it made sense for companies to make those kind of commitment to our major generating facilities without some assurance upfront or at least that would support for the investment. So that CON process really only applies to $500 million or larger generating plant type of investments. And we don't have anything else in our plant besides the coal plant of that category. Having said that, we work closely with the commission and the staff and they've been aware of what we're doing, we don't want them to be surprised. And I would say the Smart Grid is a great example of that, where you've got close to $1 billion of investment. And one where, nationwide, there's been some controversy over, is this the right thing to do? And how much of the cost, how fast you do it, what are the benefits? And we've spent a lot of time with the staff on that. Maureen and her team in particular. And the commission has decided that in the case of Smart Grid, they're going to allow us to recover on a running basis, and we've already rolled into $46 million that the commission supported very strenuously in our last case so we'll see. Generally speaking, most of these projects when it comes to distribution, investment, energy efficiency investment and things like that, all of those things are going to get rolled in as we invest in them.

Then we’ll close with questions and answers.
First quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.38 a share, up $0.07 or 22% from 2009.  The increase was primarily due to the effect of the rate release on both the electric and gas sides of the business, partly offset by unseasonable warm weather and other items Tom will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.
For the full year we expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, unchanged from our previous guide.  Although it’s old news to almost everyone, we raised our dividend 20% in the first quarter of 2010 to an annualized $0.60 a share, reflecting the confidence our board has in the business plan and the progress we’ve made over the past year.  
I’m going to turn the call over to John Russell, but before I do I want to make a few comments about the transition of leadership here at the company.  Ken Whipple, our current Chairman, has reached our mandatory retirement age and will step down from the board at our annual meeting on May 21.  Ken has been an outstanding Chairman and we’ll miss him.  Because we believe in separating the role of the Chair and CEO, I’ve decided to retire as CEO to assume Chairmanship at that time.  
Frankly, now that we’ve completed our corporate restructuring to focus on the utility, it makes sense from a continuity perspective to turn the reigns over to John Russell, who’s been the President and Chief Operating Officer at Consumers Energy since 2004.  John’s experience and leadership of the utility business makes him the ideal candidate to lead the company as we focus on our growing forward strategy.  
I know many of you already met John at various events over the past few years and will agree with me that he brings a high level of dedication and energy to the company.  John has already announced a few key changes to his senior management team that will take effect at the annual meeting or near that time as well.  We’ve been planning those changes as part of the transition, so I’m confident that the change will be seamless and allow us to continue the progress we’ve made.  Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss his priorities for 2010 in our key regulatory matters.

There are no changes in our financial objectives for earnings, cash flow and capital structure that were set out in early March.  Tom will review each of them with you in a few minutes.  Based on excellent operations, which is the foundation of our business strategy, and we will continue to focus on ways to improve our operational performance.
Our plan is to invest $7 billion in the utility over the next five years.  That will result in a rate base growth of about 7%.  We believe the regulatory structure and the Michigan energy law supports the fair and timely recovery of these investments.  We will continue to take an active role to influence national energy policy being debated in Washington which serves the best interests of our customers and our shareholders.  
Our balanced energy initiative has a two tracked approach.  Our base plan includes building a new clean coal plant.  Our other plan assumes replacing the clean coal plant with various alternative investments.  Whether we end up building a new clean coal plant or making alternative investments, we don’t believe it will have a dramatic impact on our future growth plan.  We have plenty of investments to invest in.
The contract with our unionized employees expires in June.  We have reached an agreement with the union on a new five year agreement.  It is in the process of being ratified.  The results will be known in May.
Now let me give you a brief update on the timing of a couple of key regulatory cases.  We self implemented an $89 million revenue increase in the gas rate case last November.  The staff and ALJ have filed their recommendations.  The case is ready for a final order in May.  We filed a new electric rate case in January seeking a $178 million rate increase.  We plan to self implement a rate increase in July.  
Last October, the Commission directed Consumers to reconcile the amount it had spent for tree trimming, an O&M expense, during the period 2006 through 2009.  Because the amount we spent exceeded the amount collected in rates, we continue to believe we don’t owe a refund.  The staff has recommended a refund of $27 million, whereas, the ALJ supports our position of no refund.  A final order is expected in the second quarter of this year.
To comply with the requirements of the electric decoupling mechanism, approved in last November’s electric rate order, we plan to file an annual reconciliation with the Commission in the first quarter of 2011.  We expect recovery in 2012. 
Here’s a little more detail on the gas and electric rate cases.  On March 24, the ALJ filed his proposal for decision in our gas rate case, recommending the $60 million rate increase.  The two primary differences from the $89 million the company self implemented are a lower return on equity and a lower uncollectible account expense.  The ALJ supports the sales decoupling mechanism proposed by the company with a modification to reflect weather normal consumption.  He also recommends approval of the pension and OPEB trackers.  
However, he does not support our proposed uncollectible tracker.  The final order is due no later than May 21.  The schedule has been set for the electric rate case.  We must file by June 28.  The tariffs we plan to self implement on July 22.  The staff will file its testimony on June 10 and the ALJ’s PFD will be filed on September 16.  
As Dave said earlier, our full year adjusted EPS guidance remains at $1.35 a share.  Our adjusted EPS has grown at an average rate of 8% over the past six years and our growing forward strategy, supported by the regulatory construct and the Michigan energy law, should permit us to deliver 6% to 8% EPS growth going forward.  Our current dividend payout ratio has grown over the past four years and is currently at 44%.  Now let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the first quarter results.

257682,99617041,57429,"CMS Energy Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-23-2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","As Dave mentioned, first quarter earnings were $0.38 a share up $0.07 or 22% from a year ago.  These results exclude one-time costs of $6 million associated with downsizing needed in the first quarter.  We reduced the size of our workforce by 350 people o",1344,"As Dave mentioned, first quarter earnings were $0.38 a share up $0.07 or 22% from a year ago.  These results exclude one-time costs of $6 million associated with downsizing needed in the first quarter.  We reduced the size of our workforce by 350 people or nearly 5% in order to keep our costs as low as possible for our customers.  Most of this was accomplished through voluntary retirements across our entire workforce.
Weather in Michigan has been unusually warm in March, as well as the early part of April.  Excluding the impact of mild weather, results would have been $0.42 a share.  Compared with the first quarter a year ago, the improvement in earnings of $0.07 a share included the milder weather and lower demand rate more than offset by decoupling, the continuation of approved higher rates, new gas rates associated with our self implementation last November and cost reduction.  The cost reductions include the benefits of downsizing mentioned earlier.
For the rest of the year, we still expect to generate sufficient earnings to achieve guidance reaffirmed at $1.35 a share.  Lower forecast sales mix and higher than year ago costs are more than offset by decoupling and associated rate increases.  Higher costs include capital investment at the utility, interest expense associated with prefunding 2011 Parent debt maturities, and gains on early debt retirement last year, as well as the impact on share count associated with our higher stock price.  These actions provide for strong earnings, growth, liquidity, and risk mitigation.
As in the fourth quarter of 2009, we continue to see good signs of recovery.  For example, Ford, GM and Chrysler substantially increased production with overall U.S. auto production up 68% for the year through April 17, compared with the same period a year ago.  You recall, of course, that production levels were very low last year but the higher levels of production this year were accomplished without increasing inventory.  Days supply in April were at 53.  That’s substantially below the levels in 2009 at 84 days.  
Michigan real gross state product is forecasted to be up in the first quarter compared with the decline of 3% a year ago.  Manufacturing employment also is up, where it was down 12% a year ago.  More specifically for CMS, electric sales in the first quarter were up 2% from last year, led by the industrial sector up 12%.  
After declines of 2% in 2008 and 3% in 2009, we now forecast sales for 2010 to be up 2% with the industrial sector leading commercial and residential sales recovery.  Now we’re still cautious and we’ll be watching the improvement with great care and will keep you posted on a regular basis.
Another important sign regarding the recovery is that we now anticipate the sharp rise in uncollectible write offs over the last two years to subside just a bit this year.  As you know, for the electric business we have a tracker that permits us to offset 80% of changes and write offs whether increases or decline.  We’ve requested a tracker for the gas business and the pending rate case.
Our trackers and our sales decoupling mechanisms provide good tools for risk mitigation and should sales and/or uncollectible accounts improve, we’re able to share the good news with customers without jeopardizing our ability to earn our authorized return.
Here’s an example of how the sales decoupling worked for the residential sector during the first quarter.  Average monthly sales per customer were down 22kWh from the approval rate case level.  This will result in a lost margin and recovery surcharge of $6 million.  We’ll request decoupling recovery by March of next year and expect then, in order to enable cash recovery by 2012.  
Here’s a comprehensive summary of sales and decoupling for the first quarter compared with a year ago.  Although weather adjusted electric sales were up 2%, adverse weather and the loss of large bundled customers to retail open access resulted in an earnings drop of $0.07.  Of this, $0.04 should be recovered in our decoupling mechanism.  Lower gas sales reduced earnings per share by $0.06.  The majority of this was due to adverse weather and, of course, we don’t have a gas decoupling mechanism yet.
Let me cover the nickel decline associated with large electric customers in a bit more detail.  As gas prices and energy rates fell during the deep recession, the numbers of customers enrolling in the retail open access program reached the cap of 10% late last year.  That’s up from 4% a year ago.  This shift was the primary reason for lower demand from our large bundled customers in the first quarter.  As shown on the prior slide (Slide #15) and here (Slide #16) this reduced earnings by $0.05.  Of this, $0.03 should be offset in decoupling recovery.
The changes in the use of demand rates are not captured completely in the sales decoupling mechanism.  As you know, demand charges occur when large customers use energy in peak low periods.  We, of course, don’t realize these charges from customers who shift to retail open access.  Over time this will level out ratemaking.  Also, the shift to retail open access is capped at 10% and we’ve provided for the full year impact in our earnings guidance at $1.35.
Cash flow remains strong with the utility operating cash flow growing each year by about $100 million each year as a result of our planned investment program.  After investment and dividends to the CMS Parent, Consumers Energy cash outflow is expected to be about $600 million.  This includes a contribution of $97 million to our pension fund completed just this last month.  
We’ve already financed much of our cash needs with $200 million of the $250 million equity investment from the Parent into Consumers [inaudible] and $300 million of $550 million of planned new debt in place.
The forecast of the Parent sources of cash will be $415 million in excess of interest, overhead and taxes.  This provides substantial head room for common dividend.  Expect to end the year with more than $250 billion in cash and more than $500 billion of available bank facilities.  We’ve already secured sufficient cash to meet all debt maturities coming due at the Parent this year and next year.  
In addition, we’ve secured $300 million of new debt planned for the utility this year through the form of a delayed draw mechanism.  This allows us to lock in favorable rates without carrying the cost of new debt until the planned draw in September when we need the cash.
Many of you have read about the loss of retirees prescription drug tax subsidies that were eliminated in the new health care law that was recently enacted by Congress. For CMS the lost deduction is worth $68 million of which $65 million has been reflected as a regulatory asset.  We’ve recognized $3 million in our income statement and that’s for our non-regulated business.  
Now here are our earnings and cash flow sensitivities to major changes in projected assumptions for 2010.  Although we have protection from electric sales variations, we’re still exposed to sales changes in our gas business until a decoupling mechanism is approved.  Although gas prices are soft, changes of $0.50 up or down would impact short term cash flow by about $30 million in the opposite direction.  Of course, if we improve or fall short on our forecasted ROE by 50 basis points this could impact earnings by $0.08 and cash flow by about $35 million.
Our risk mitigation plans are working well but we remain vigilant about changes in market conditions.  Last, here are our key financial targets for 2010.  We’re on track to meet each of them and as we’ve done for the past several years, we’ll continue to review this report card with you each quarter and monitor our progress, whether it’s good or bad.  Thank you for your interest, thank you for your support.  Dave, John and I are happy to take your questions, so operator could you please open the line for questions.

We'll have to see where that narrows down.  I will tell you though that energy issues have not been a platform of any of the candidates to date.  I'm not overly concerned; most of them have positions that are consistent with our views on what needs to be done here in the state.
Obviously, in Michigan, with high unemployment rates, one of the big concerns is job creation and we with our investment profile are one of the larger job creators, and I think folks recognize that.

Part of that was driven as Tom indicated by the lower gas prices and the lower prices in [nysil].  As far as changing the law to raise the cap, it involves a lot of work and it also involves a lot of other issues such as renewable energy, energy optimization, and some of the other key components of the energy legislation.

But both of that change is in that industrial improvement.  We still see for the year, compared to the prior year, that our residential sales will be off just a bit, maybe as much as 1%.  And that our commercial sales will be up just a bit, and I'd call that flat to 0.5%, with the industrial sales up 8%.
We have seen really good news on the industrial side, a little easing of the pain on the residential side and a bit of a swing on commercial from negative to slightly positive.  And all of that has added up to the total going from 1% down to 2% up.  
And again, we are going to watch that with a lot of care.

Thanks for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. I'll start the presentation with a few brief remarks about the quarter before I turn the call over to John Russell who'll give you an update on the business and regulatory agenda. And then, Tom Webb will take you through more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. And then we'll close with questions and answers.
First quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.38 a share, up $0.07 or 22% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the rate relief on both the Electric and Gas sides of the business, partly offset by unseasonably warm weather and other items Tom will discuss in more detail on a few minutes.
For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, unchanged from our previous guidance. Although it's old news to almost everyone, we raised our dividend 20% in the first quarter of 2010 to an annualized $0.60 a share, reflecting the confidence our board has in the business plan and the progress we've made over the past year. 
I'm going to turn the call over to John Russell, but before I do, I want to make a few comments about the transition of leadership here at the company. Ken Whipple, our current Chairman, has reached our mandatory retirement age and will step down from the board at our Annual Meeting on May 21. Ken has been an outstanding Chairman and we'll miss him. 
Because we believe in separating the role of the Chair and CEO, I decided to retire as CEO to assume chairmanship at that time. Frankly, now that we've completed our corporate restructuring to focus on the Utility, it makes sense from a continuity perspective to turn the reigns over to John Russell, who has been the President and Chief Operating Officer at Consumers Energy since 2004. John's experience and leadership of the Utility business makes him the ideal candidate to lead the company as we focus on our Growing Forward strategy. 
I know many of you already met John at various events over the past two years and will agree with me that he brings a high level of dedication and energy to the company. John has already announced the few key changes to its senior management team that will take effect at the Annual Meeting or near that time as well. And we've been planning those changes as part of the transition, so I'm confident the change will be seamless and allow us to continue to progress we've made.
Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss his priorities for 2010 and our key regulatory matters. John?"

Safe and excellent operations through the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to focus on ways to improve our operational performance. Our plan is to invest $7 billion in the Utility over the next five years and that will result in a rate-based growth of about 7%. We believe the regulatory structure and the Michigan energy law supports the fair and timely recovery of these investments. We will continue to take an active role to influence national energy policy being debated in Washington, which serve the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. 
Our Balanced Energy Initiative has a two-track approach. Our base plan includes building a new clean coal plant. Other plan assumes replacing the clean coal plant with various alternative investments. Whether we end up building a new clean coal plant or making alternative investments, we don't believe it will have a dramatic impact on our future growth plan. We have plenty of investments to invest in. 
The contract with our unionized employees expires in June. We have reached an agreement with the Union on a new five-year agreement and it is in the process of being ratified. The results will be known in May.
Now let me give you a brief update on the timing of a couple of key regulatory cases. We self-implemented an $89 million revenue increase in the gas rate case last November. The staff and ALJ have filed their recommendation and the case is ready for a final order in May. We filed a new electric rate case in January, taking a $178 million rate increase. We plan to self-implement a rate increase in July.
Last October, the Commission directed consumers to reconcile the amount it expensed for tree-trimming and O&M expense during the period 2006 through 2009. Because the amount we spent exceeded the amount collected in rates, we continue to believe we don't owe a refund. The staff has recommended a refund of $27 million, whereas the ALJ supports our position of no refund. A final order is expected in the second quarter of this year.
To comply with the requirements of the electric decoupling mechanism approved in last November's electric rate order, we plan to file an annual reconciliation with the Commission in the first quarter of 2011. We expect recovery in 2012.
Here's a little more detail on the gas and electric rate cases. On March 24, the ALJ proposed filed his proposal for decision in our gas rate case, recommending a $60 million rate increase. The two primary differences from the $89 million the company self-implemented are a lower return on equity and a lower uncollectible account expense. 
The ALJ supports the sales decoupling mechanism proposed by the company, with a modification to reflect weather normal consumption. He also recommends approval of the pension and OPEB trackers. However, he does not support our proposed uncollectible tracker. The final order is due no later than May 21. 
The schedule has been sent for the electric rate case. We must file by June 28, the tariffs we plan to self-implement on July 22. The staff will file its testimony on June 10 and the ALJ's PFD will be filed on September 16. 
As Dave said earlier, our full year adjusted EPS guidance remains at $1.35 a share. Our adjusted EPS has grown at an average rate of 8% over the past six years and our Growing Forward strategy supported by the regulatory construct and the Michigan energy law should permit us to deliver 6% to 8% EPS growth going forward. Our current dividend payout ratio has grown over the past four years and is currently at 44%. Now let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the first quarter results."
257682,99617041,57482,"CMS Energy Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-23-2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and I'm pleased to add my welcome to everyone on the call this morning, so good morning. As Dave mentioned, first quarter earnings were $0.38 a share, up $0.07 or 22% from a year ago. These results exclude one-time costs of $6 million associ",1350,"Thanks, John, and I'm pleased to add my welcome to everyone on the call this morning, so good morning. As Dave mentioned, first quarter earnings were $0.38 a share, up $0.07 or 22% from a year ago. These results exclude one-time costs of $6 million associated with downsizing dated in the first quarter. We reduced the size of our workforce by 350 people or nearly 5% in order to keep our costs as low as possible for our customers. Most of this was accomplished through voluntary retirements across our entire workforce.
Weather in Michigan has been unusually warm in March, as well as the early part of April. Excluding the impact of mild weather, results would have been $0.42 a share. Compared with the first quarter a year ago, the improvement in earnings of $0.07 a share included a milder weather and lower demand rate; more than offset by decoupling, the continuation of approved higher rates, new gas rates associated with our self-implementation last November and cost reductions. The cost reductions include the benefits of downsizing mentioned earlier. 
For the rest of the year, we still expect to generate sufficient earnings to achieve guidance reaffirmed at $1.35 a share. Lower forecast sales mix and higher-than-year-ago costs are more than offset by decoupling and associated rate increases. Higher costs include capital investment at the Utility, interest expense associated with pre-funding 2011 parent debt maturities and gains on early debt retirement last year, as well as the impact on share count associated with our higher stock price. These actions provide for strong earnings, growth, liquidity and risk mitigation.
As in the fourth quarter of 2009, we continue to see good signs of recovery. For example, Ford, GM and Chrysler substantially increased production with overall U.S. auto production up 68% for the year through April 17, compared with the same period a year ago. Recall, of course, that production levels were very low last year but the higher levels of production this year were accomplished without increasing inventory. Days supply in April were at 53, that substantially below the levels in 2009 at 84 days.
Michigan real gross state product is forecasted to be up in the first quarter compared with the decline of 3% a year ago. Manufacturing employment also is up but it was down 12% a year ago. More specifically for CMS, electric sales in the first quarter were up 2% from last year, led by the Industrial sector, up 12%. After declines of 2% in 2008 and 3% in 2009, we now forecast sales for 2010 to be up 2% for the Industrial sector leading Commercial and Residential sales recovery. Now we're still cautious and we'll be watching the improvement with great care and we'll keep you posted on a regular basis.
Another important sign regarding the recovery is that we now anticipate the sharp rise in uncollectible write-offs over the last two years to subside just a bit this year. As you know, for the Electric business, we have a tracker that permits us to offset 80% of changes in write-offs whether increases or declines. We've requested a tracker for the Gas business in the pending rate case.
Our trackers and our sales decoupling mechanisms provide good tools for risk mitigation. And should sales and/or uncollectible accounts improve, we're able to share the good news with customers without jeopardizing our ability to earn our authorized return. Here's an example of how the sales decoupling work for the Residential sector during the first quarter. Average monthly sales per customer were down 22-kilowatt hours from the approval rate case level. This will result in a loss margin and recovery surcharge of $6 million. We'll request decoupling recovery by March of next year and expect an order to enable cash recovery in 2012.
Here's a comprehensive summary of sales and decoupling for the first quarter compared with a year ago. Although weather-adjusted electric sales were up 2%, adverse weather and the loss of large bundled customers to retail open access resulted in an earnings drop of $0.07. Of these, $0.04 should be recovered in our decoupling mechanism. Lower gas sales reduced earnings per share by $0.06. Majority of this was due to adverse weather and of course, we don't have a gas decoupling mechanism yet. 
Let me covered the nickel decline associated with the large electric customers in a bit more detail. As gas prices and energy rates fell during the deep recession, the numbers of customers enrolling in the retail open access program reached the cap, 10%, late last year. That's up from 4% a year ago. This shift was the primary reason for lower demand from our large bundled customers in the first quarter. 
As shown on the prior slide and here, these reduced earnings by $0.05. Of these, $0.03 should be offset in decoupling recovery. Now changes in the use of demand rates are not captured completely in the sales decoupling mechanism. As you know, demand charges occur when large customers use energy in peak low periods. We, of course, don't realize these charges from customers who shift to retail open access. Over time, this will level out in rate making. Also, the shift to retail open access is capped at 10% and we've provided for the full year impact in our earnings guidance at $1.35.
Cash flow remained strong with the Utility operating cash flow growing each year by about $100 million as a result of our planned investment program. After investment in dividends to the CMS parent, Consumers Energy cash outflow is expected to be about $600 million. This includes a contribution of $97 million to our pension fund completed just this last month. We've already financed much of our cash needs with $200 million of the $250 million equity investment from the parent into consumers fleet, and $300 million of $550 million of planned new debt in place.
We forecast that the parent sources of cash will be $415 million in excess of interest overhead and taxes. This provides substantial headroom for common dividend. We expect to end the year with more than $250 million in cash and more than $500 million of available bank facility. 
We've already secured sufficient cash to meet all debt maturities coming due at the parent this year and the next year. In addition, we've secured $300 million of new debt planned for the Utility this year through the form of a delayed draw mechanism. This allows us to lock in favorable rates without carrying the costs of new debt until the planned draw in September when we need the cash.
Many of you has read about the loss of Retiree Prescription Drug tax subsidy that were eliminated in the new Healthcare Law. This was recently enacted by Congress. For CMS, the lost deduction is worth $68 million, of which $65 million has been reflected as a regulatory asset. We've recognized $3 million in our income statement and that's for our non-regulated business.
Now here are earnings and cash flow sensitivities to major changes in the projected assumptions for 2010. Although we have protection from electric sales variations, we're still exposed to sales changes at our Gas business until a decoupling mechanism is approved. Although gas prices are soft, changes of $0.50, up or down, would impact short-term cash flow by about $30 million in the opposite direction. And of course, if we improve or fall short on our forecasted ROE by 50 basis points, this could impact earnings by $0.08 and cash flow by about $35 million. Our risk mitigation plans are working well but we remain vigilant about changes in market conditions. 
Last here, our key financial targets for 2010. We're on track to meet each of them. And as we've done for the past several years, we'll continue to review this report card with you each quarter to monitor our progress whether it's good or bad.

There are five announced Republican candidates, three Democratic candidates and the primaries won't be until August, so let's see where that narrows down. I would tell you though that energy issues have not been a platform of any of the candidates to date. I'm not overly concerned. Most of them have positions that are consistent with our views on what needs to be done here in the state. Obviously, in Michigan, with high unemployment rates, one of the big concerns is job creation and we, with our investment profile, are one of the larger job creators and I think folks recognize that. So I'm not expecting any broad changes in policy and I do expect that to continue with a relatively support of regulatory structure that we have here in the state."

What we saw this year is some larger industrial customers go to choice, compared to some of the more commercial-oriented customers that we've had in the past. And part of that was driven, as Tom indicated, by the lower gas prices and the lower prices in MISO. And as far as changing the law to raise the cap, it involves a lot of work and it also involves a lot of other issues, such as renewable energy, energy optimization and some of the other key components of the Energy Legislation.

You'll see that we're now seeing, overall, our sales will be up about 2%. And that includes the 8% increase. Now when we were looking at this previously, the last time we talked, we told you those overall sales would be down about 1%. But both of that change is in that industrial improvement. We still see, for the year, compared to the prior year, that our Residential sales will be off just a bit, maybe as much as 1%, and that our Commercial sales will be up just a bit. Then I'd call that flat to half a percent, with the Industrial sales up 8%. So we've seen really good news on the Industrial side, a little easing of the pain on the Residential side and a bit of a swing on Commercial from negative to slightly positive. And all of that's added up to the total, going from 1% down, 2% up. And again, we're going to watch that with a lot of care. We feel really good with what we've seen in the fourth quarter, really good with what we've seen in the first quarter, but we've got to make sure this industrial recovery sustains because that's what's going to pull the Residential and the Commercial sales back up."

Thanks for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. I'll start the presentation with a few brief remarks about the quarter before I turn the call over to John Russell who'll give you an update on the business and regulatory agenda. And then, Tom Webb will take you through more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. And then we'll close with questions and answers.
First quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.38 a share, up $0.07 or 22% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the rate relief on both the Electric and Gas sides of the business, partly offset by unseasonably warm weather and other items Tom will discuss in more detail on a few minutes.
For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, unchanged from our previous guidance. Although it's old news to almost everyone, we raised our dividend 20% in the first quarter of 2010 to an annualized $0.60 a share, reflecting the confidence our board has in the business plan and the progress we've made over the past year. 
I'm going to turn the call over to John Russell, but before I do, I want to make a few comments about the transition of leadership here at the company. Ken Whipple, our current Chairman, has reached our mandatory retirement age and will step down from the board at our Annual Meeting on May 21. Ken has been an outstanding Chairman and we'll miss him. 
Because we believe in separating the role of the Chair and CEO, I decided to retire as CEO to assume chairmanship at that time. Frankly, now that we've completed our corporate restructuring to focus on the Utility, it makes sense from a continuity perspective to turn the reigns over to John Russell, who has been the President and Chief Operating Officer at Consumers Energy since 2004. John's experience and leadership of the Utility business makes him the ideal candidate to lead the company as we focus on our Growing Forward strategy. 
I know many of you already met John at various events over the past two years and will agree with me that he brings a high level of dedication and energy to the company. John has already announced the few key changes to its senior management team that will take effect at the Annual Meeting or near that time as well. And we've been planning those changes as part of the transition, so I'm confident the change will be seamless and allow us to continue to progress we've made.
Now let me turn the call over to John to discuss his priorities for 2010 and our key regulatory matters. John?"

There were no changes in our financial objective for earnings, cash flow and capital structure that were set out in early March. Tom will review each of them with you in a few minutes.
Safe and excellent operations through the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to focus on ways to improve our operational performance. Our plan is to invest $7 billion in the Utility over the next five years and that will result in a rate-based growth of about 7%. We believe the regulatory structure and the Michigan energy law supports the fair and timely recovery of these investments. We will continue to take an active role to influence national energy policy being debated in Washington, which serve the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. 
Our Balanced Energy Initiative has a two-track approach. Our base plan includes building a new clean coal plant. Other plan assumes replacing the clean coal plant with various alternative investments. Whether we end up building a new clean coal plant or making alternative investments, we don't believe it will have a dramatic impact on our future growth plan. We have plenty of investments to invest in. 
The contract with our unionized employees expires in June. We have reached an agreement with the Union on a new five-year agreement and it is in the process of being ratified. The results will be known in May.
Now let me give you a brief update on the timing of a couple of key regulatory cases. We self-implemented an $89 million revenue increase in the gas rate case last November. The staff and ALJ have filed their recommendation and the case is ready for a final order in May. We filed a new electric rate case in January, taking a $178 million rate increase. We plan to self-implement a rate increase in July.
Last October, the Commission directed consumers to reconcile the amount it expensed for tree-trimming and O&M expense during the period 2006 through 2009. Because the amount we spent exceeded the amount collected in rates, we continue to believe we don't owe a refund. The staff has recommended a refund of $27 million, whereas the ALJ supports our position of no refund. A final order is expected in the second quarter of this year.
To comply with the requirements of the electric decoupling mechanism approved in last November's electric rate order, we plan to file an annual reconciliation with the Commission in the first quarter of 2011. We expect recovery in 2012.
Here's a little more detail on the gas and electric rate cases. On March 24, the ALJ proposed filed his proposal for decision in our gas rate case, recommending a $60 million rate increase. The two primary differences from the $89 million the company self-implemented are a lower return on equity and a lower uncollectible account expense. 
The ALJ supports the sales decoupling mechanism proposed by the company, with a modification to reflect weather normal consumption. He also recommends approval of the pension and OPEB trackers. However, he does not support our proposed uncollectible tracker. The final order is due no later than May 21. 
The schedule has been sent for the electric rate case. We must file by June 28, the tariffs we plan to self-implement on July 22. The staff will file its testimony on June 10 and the ALJ's PFD will be filed on September 16. 
As Dave said earlier, our full year adjusted EPS guidance remains at $1.35 a share. Our adjusted EPS has grown at an average rate of 8% over the past six years and our Growing Forward strategy, supported by the regulatory construct and the Michigan energy law, should permit us to deliver 6% to 8% EPS growth going forward. Our current dividend payout ratio has grown over the past four years and is currently at 44%. Now let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the first quarter results."

As Dave mentioned, first quarter earnings were $0.38 a share, up $0.07 or 22% from a year ago. These results exclude one-time costs of $6 million associ",1351,"Thanks, John, and I'm pleased to add my welcome to everyone on the call this morning, so good morning. As Dave mentioned, first quarter earnings were $0.38 a share, up $0.07 or 22% from a year ago. These results exclude one-time costs of $6 million associated with downsizing dated in the first quarter. We reduced the size of our workforce by 350 people or nearly 5% in order to keep our costs as low as possible for our customers. Most of this was accomplished through voluntary retirements across our entire workforce.
Weather in Michigan has been unusually warm in March, as well as the early part of April. Excluding the impact of mild weather, results would have been $0.42 a share. Compared with the first quarter a year ago, the improvement in earnings of $0.07 a share included a milder weather and lower demand rate, more than offset by decoupling, the continuation of approved higher rates, new gas rates associated with our self-implementation last November and cost reductions. The cost reductions include the benefits of downsizing mentioned earlier. 
For the rest of the year, we still expect to generate sufficient earnings to achieve guidance reaffirmed at $1.35 a share. Lower forecast sales mix and higher-than-year-ago costs are more than offset by decoupling and associated rate increases. Higher costs include capital investment at the Utility, interest expense associated with pre-funding 2011 parent debt maturities and gains on early debt retirement last year, as well as the impact on share count associated with our higher stock price. These actions provide for strong earnings, growth, liquidity and risk mitigation.
As in the fourth quarter of 2009, we continue to see good signs of recovery. For example, Ford, GM and Chrysler substantially increased production with overall U.S. auto production up 68% for the year through April 17, compared with the same period a year ago. Recall, of course, that production levels were very low last year but the higher levels of production this year were accomplished without increasing inventory. Days supply in April were at 53, that substantially below the levels in 2009 at 84 days.
Michigan real gross state product is forecasted to be up in the first quarter compared with the decline of 3% a year ago. Manufacturing employment also is up but it was down 12% a year ago. More specifically for CMS, electric sales in the first quarter were up 2% from last year, led by the Industrial sector, up 12%. After declines of 2% in 2008 and 3% in 2009, we now forecast sales for 2010 to be up 2% for the Industrial sector leading Commercial and Residential sales recovery. Now we're still cautious and we'll be watching the improvement with great care and we'll keep you posted on a regular basis.
Another important sign regarding the recovery is that we now anticipate the sharp rise in uncollectible write-offs over the last two years to subside just a bit this year. As you know, for the Electric business, we have a tracker that permits us to offset 80% of changes in write-offs whether increases or declines. We've requested a tracker for the Gas business in the pending rate case.
Our trackers and our sales decoupling mechanisms provide good tools for risk mitigation. And should sales and/or uncollectible accounts improve, we're able to share the good news with customers without jeopardizing our ability to earn our authorized return. Here's an example of how the sales decoupling work for the Residential sector during the first quarter. Average monthly sales per customer were down 22 kilowatt-hours from the approval rate case level. This will result in a loss margin and recovery surcharge of $6 million. We'll request decoupling recovery by March of next year and expect an order to enable cash recovery in 2012.
Here's a comprehensive summary of sales and decoupling for the first quarter compared with a year ago. Although weather-adjusted electric sales were up 2%, adverse weather and the loss of large bundled customers to retail open access resulted in an earnings drop of $0.07. Of these, $0.04 should be recovered in our decoupling mechanism. Lower gas sales reduced earnings per share by $0.06. Majority of this was due to adverse weather and of course, we don't have a gas decoupling mechanism yet. 
Let me cover the nickel decline associated with the large electric customers in a bit more detail. As gas prices and energy rates fell during the deep recession, the numbers of customers enrolling in the retail open access program reached the cap, 10%, late last year. That's up from 4% a year ago. This shift was the primary reason for lower demand from our large bundled customers in the first quarter. 
As shown on the prior slide and here, these reduced earnings by $0.05. Of these, $0.03 should be offset in decoupling recovery. Now changes in the use of demand rates are not captured completely in the sales decoupling mechanism. As you know, demand charges occur when large customers use energy in peak low periods. We, of course, don't realize these charges from customers who shift to retail open access. Over time, this will level out in rate making. Also, the shift to retail open access is capped at 10% and we've provided for the full year impact in our earnings guidance at $1.35.
Cash flow remained strong with the Utility operating cash flow growing each year by about $100 million as a result of our planned investment program. After investment in dividends to the CMS parent, Consumers Energy cash outflow is expected to be about $600 million. This includes a contribution of $97 million to our pension fund completed just this last month. We've already financed much of our cash needs with $200 million of the $250 million equity investment from the parent into consumers fleet, and $300 million of $550 million of planned new debt in place.
We forecast that the parent sources of cash will be $415 million in excess of interest overhead and taxes. This provides substantial headroom for common dividend. We expect to end the year with more than $250 million in cash and more than $500 million of available bank facilities. 
We've already secured sufficient cash to meet all debt maturities coming due at the parent this year and the next year. In addition, we've secured $300 million of new debt planned for the Utility this year through the form of a delayed draw mechanism. This allows us to lock in favorable rates without carrying the costs of new debt until the planned draw in September when we need the cash.
Many of you has read about the loss of Retiree Prescription Drug tax subsidy that were eliminated in the new Healthcare Law. This was recently enacted by Congress. For CMS, the lost deduction is worth $68 million, of which $65 million has been reflected as a regulatory asset. We've recognized $3 million in our income statement and that's for our non-regulated business.
Now here are earnings and cash flow sensitivities to major changes in the projected assumptions for 2010. Although we have protection from electric sales variations, we're still exposed to sales changes at our Gas business until a decoupling mechanism is approved. Although gas prices are soft, changes of $0.50, up or down, would impact short-term cash flow by about $30 million in the opposite direction. And of course, if we improve or fall short on our forecasted ROE by 50 basis points, this could impact earnings by $0.08 and cash flow by about $35 million. Our risk mitigation plans are working well but we remain vigilant about changes in market conditions. 
Last, here are our key financial targets for 2010. We're on track to meet each of them. And as we've done for the past several years, we'll continue to review this report card with you each quarter to monitor our progress whether it's good or bad. 
Well, thanks for your interest and thank you for your support. Dave, John and I are happy to take your questions. So operator, could you please open the line for questions."

There are five announced Republican candidates, three Democratic candidates and the primaries won't be until August, so let's see where that narrows down. I would tell you though that energy issues have not been a platform of any of the candidates to date. I'm not overly concerned. Most of them have positions that are consistent with our views on what needs to be done here in the state. Obviously, in Michigan, with high unemployment rates, one of the big concerns is job creation and we, with our investment profile, are one of the larger job creators and I think folks recognize that. So I'm not expecting any broad changes in policy and I do expect that to continue with a relatively support of regulatory structure that we have here in the state."

What we saw this year is some larger industrial customers go to choice, compared to some of the more commercial-oriented customers that we've had in the past. And part of that was driven, as Tom indicated, by the lower gas prices and the lower prices in MISO. And as far as changing the law to raise the cap, it involves a lot of work and it also involves a lot of other issues, such as renewable energy, energy optimization and some of the other key components of the Energy Legislation.

Thanks for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. I’ll start the presentation with a few brief remarks, and then turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then we’ll close with Q&A.
Second quarter 2010 adjusted earnings were $0.26, down $0.02 from last year. The decrease was due primarily to the absence of a gain from financing activities in 2009 and the effect of unseasonably warm weather on our gas utility, partly offset by electric and gas rate relief. Adjusting for weather at our gas utility, we would report $0.31 in the second quarter. As a reminder, this sales decoupling mechanism offset the effect of unseasonably warm or cold weather on our electric business. But weather is not included in our gas decoupling mechanism.
For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings at $1.35 a share, unchanged from previous guide. Tom will discuss the second quarter variances and full-year guidance in more detail in a few minutes. The foundation of our long-term strategy is safe and excellent operation that provides value to our customers.
I will review the results of the recent customer satisfaction survey and other operational improvements shortly. We have taken another step forward towards achieving our 10% renewable energy target, and I will discuss those in a few minutes, and finally I will give you an update on the status of recent regulatory actions. First, let me update you on our operating performance.
One of our primary objectives is to continue improving the safety and reliability of our system, which we believe creates customer satisfaction and value. We had seen the benefits of our efforts in a couple of recent independent surveys. We moved up 13 places from the fourth quartile to the second quartile in the 2010 University of Michigan American Customer Satisfaction Index, which surveys residential customers of combination utility companies.
And in the annual JD Power survey of electric customer satisfaction, our customers rated us higher this year in five of the six categories, but we still have more work to do to achieve first quartile performance. I’m pleased with our improvement in the area of employee safety from 2007 through the end of 2009; we improved our overall safety performance by more than 50% as measured by reduction in employee incidents.
Based on year-to-date results, we are forecasting another 20% improvement for the current year. Another area of improvement is cost management. A recent benchmarking study by Oliver Wyman ranked consumers in the first quartile of overall cost management, which reaffirms our ongoing commitment to keep our customer rates as competitive as possible.
In May of this year, our union employees ratified a new five year agreement that provides for increased health care cost sharing, and changed post retirement health benefits under the OPEB [ph] plan for retired employees. This decreased our OPEB liability by $95 million and will result in a decrease in benefit costs of $14 million in 2010.
As discussed on the next slide, our renewable energy development plan is on target. To meet Michigan’s 10% renewable energy requirement, we expect to add 500 MW of owned or contracted renewable capacity by 2015. The blue dots on the map represent the locations of existing renewable sources that account for approximately 4% of our sales.
In June, we signed agreements with developers for 243 MW of renewable energy capacity as represented by the gold triangles shown on the map. The 24 year power purchase agreement was approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission yesterday. On the build side, we plan to construct 100 MW wind farm named Lake Winds Energy Park located on the west side of Michigan. We finalized the turbine contract with Vestas-American last week, and recently issued a request for proposal for the balance of the work.
The wind park is scheduled to begin operation in late 2012. Renewable energy from our existing projects, combined with our four new PPAs and our Lake Wind Energy Project will bring the total supply from renewables to about 8% of our sales by the end of 2012. Additional development will take place in our Cross Winds Energy Park. This project is expected to be fully operational by 2017. As a reminder, the company is currently collecting a surcharge from its customers to recover the cost of these developments and projects.
Here is an update on our gas and electric rate cases. In May, the commission issued its final order authorizing us to increase gas rates by $66 million annually, $23 million less than we self implemented. We recorded a regulatory liability of $15 million in the second quarter related to the customer refund. We will file our refund proposal with the MPSC in August.
On July 22, the company self implemented an electric revenue increase of $150 million. The key differences between the amount self implemented and the staffs’ [ph] recommendation are a lower return on equity, and deferral of future recovery of the projected 2011 capital expenses. Although the staff is not in favor of our proposal for an economic development sales tracker, they do recommend a $25 million revenue increase if the tracker is not approved.
The commission has also decided to read the record in this case, which means we could see a final order before year-end. This slide gives you a brief update of the timing of our regulatory cases. The commission has agreed with our recommendation to refund $85 million of Big Rock Point decommissioning surcharges over seven months beginning in July of 2010. This will help to offset the electric self implementation rate increase and cushion the effect on customer bills.
We expect the MPSC to issue an order in the third quarter regarding the 2009 electric rate case refund. Briefs were filed in July with staffs’ recommending a $32 million refund compared to our proposed refund of $15 million.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the second quarter results.

Recorded GAAP earnings are $0.32 for the second quarter and that is equal to 2009. Adjusting primarily for an insurance settlement and additional tax expense related to assets sold, our earnings were $0.26 in the quarter. That is down $0.02 from last year, when we had a gain from the extinguishment of our QUIPS worth $0.08 good news.
On a weather adjusted basis, our earnings would have been $0.31 a share. This includes a nickel for weather compared to last year for the gas business unit, where our decoupling mechanism does not have weathered adjustment. This excludes $0.03 of favorable weather at our electric business, where we have a weather adjustment in our electric decoupling mechanism.
As you can see on this waterfall chart, 2009 earnings per share was $0.20 before including the $0.08 gain associated with the extinguishment of the QUIPS. It was $0.28 including the gain. The utility improved during the quarter by $0.06 with a decline in sales of $0.04 improvement in the cost of $0.03 and rates relief of $0.07. Enterprises and the parent were off $0.08 completely explained by the gain in 2009 on the extinguishment of the QUIPS.
The sales decline for 2010 compared with 2009 includes a loss of demand rate revenues associated with bundled customers, who have chosen to take retail open access. As we covered in the earnings call last quarter, customers that have chosen to take retail open access now represent 10% of our business, and that is equal to the cap. Compared with the retail open access level of 5% a year ago, the associated impact of lower demand rates was $0.04 a share. This is a little bit better than what we predicted in our last call, when we thought the impact might be about a nickel.
As you can see, this trend will continue in the third and the fourth quarters until the prior year comparisons reach the 10% ROA level. Over time, this will level out in rate making, and for the year we have reflected all of this in our earnings guidance. As you can see on this slide, we are still on the path to meet our guidance of $1.35 for the year. With the results for the first six months a nickel better than a year ago, we expect a $0.04 improvement in the second half.
This includes a decline in sales of $0.07, which reflects the higher ROA and lower demand revenue we discussed on the prior slide. In addition, this includes higher cost of $0.12 at the utility for higher capital investments and the absence of a few gains in 2009, including a research tax credit and (inaudible) gain. We also include an estimate of $0.04 for the notional impact on share dilution should existing convertibles be exercised.
Rate relief improvements total $0.29. The bulk of this already is approved in rates and a portion reflects new rates associated with the self implementation of our electric rate case. Let us step back just for a moment and think about the economy. One of the better indicators of a turnaround in the US as well as in Michigan is the auto industry.
As you know, the autos make up about 3% of our gross margin, but provide a nice indicator of the economy in general. As of July 17 year-to-date, the US automakers have increased their production by 68% without inflating inventories, those being down 13% from 63 days supply a year ago to 55 days supply at the end of June. This continues to bode well for a reasonable recovery.
Sticking with automotive for a moment, recent groundbreaking occurred for another electric vehicle battery plant in Midland, Michigan. This plant alone involves investment of $600 million employing 230 workers by 2012. As shown here, this is only one of several battery plants under construction to meet new auto production requirements. The 2000 jobs directly related to production at these facilities spurred substantially more construction support and related jobs and economic activity.
For example, there are 1000 construction workers on-site today at the new Midland plant site. Restoration of economic activity for existing businesses, whether they are auto, furniture, pharmaceutical, packaged goods or one of the other multitude of industries in Michigan, will layer in more recovery as we go through each of the next few years.
Unemployment has however been particularly stubborn in both US and Michigan, but during the course of the last six months each month unemployment in Michigan has dropped modestly from a peak of 14.5% to just over 13% in June. Here is another indicator for the economy in the future. Credit scores, as you would expect after coming through a deep recession are worse today than they were prior to the recession.
If credit is not available to business and consumers then that could dampen the rebound. We are keeping our eyes on this along with many economic indicators to help us predict the pace of the rebound in our service territory. But let us specifically look at our service territory for consumers in Michigan. Electric sales have rebounded led by our industrial customers. As shown in the left side of this slide, industrial sales began their recovery in the fourth quarter of 2009, and were up 12% compared with year ago levels both for the first and second quarters.
Now, we may be a bit conservative, but we forecast industrial sales to continue to grow at a lower level in the second half of the year. We anticipate that residential and commercial sales will follow the industrial recovery with commercial sales flat this year and improving by about 1% next year, and residential sales down 1% this year to flat in 2011. As shown on the right side of this slide, consumers’ electric sales improved 1% in the fourth quarter of last year, 2% in the first quarter of this year and 4% in the second quarter.
Our forecast reflects a continued recovery of 1% in the second half. Looking at the longer trend, you may recall that the cumulative decline in the 1979 to 1982 recessions was about 7% and that is the worst decline in our history. Less than a year ago, we expected the decline in this recession to be about the same or a little larger, but the recovery in progress suggests that the combined decline will end up at less than 6%.
It has been a long recession for us in Michigan, signs are improving for the recovery. Now before we wrap up our formal remarks, I want to share three slides with you that we provide each earnings call to help you assess our condition, and ask us questions. First, our cash flow for 2010 for both the parent and consumers. The utility continues on plan with operating cash flow of almost $1.5 billion. Please recall that we have been growing our operating cash flow by about $100 million each year and plan to continue that in the future.
This enhances liquidity and cash flow to support the healthy growth of the company. From a financing standpoint, the equity contribution to the utility of $250 million and $300 million of the financing plan are complete. We anticipate having well over $400 million of bank facilities available at year-end to protect for any uncertainties. We will be completing our $150 million 364 day revolver in a few weeks, and will do that for a three year term.
At the parent, our sources of cash are expected to be little over $650 million with adequate capacity to cover interest, preferred dividends, overhead and Federal tax payments. This provides nearly $450 million to support our equity contribution into the utility and plenty of room to support the common dividend and the continued debt reduction plans.
Here is our sensitivity slide, where we try to give you the tools to assess both the good and the bad that could happen in the remainder of the year. The sensitivity metrics are unchanged. As you can see, the impact of variations in sales is muted by the decoupling mechanisms that are in place for electric and gas. The gas sensitivity is provided to help you assess the impact of weather since that is not included in the decoupling mechanism as it is in the electric business.
Changes up or down in our return on equity of say 50 basis points could impact the electric business by $0.06, and the gas business by $0.02, again up or down. We worked hard to improve our disciplines in a way that permits us to minimizing volatility, providing more certainty. In addition, we have been able to put in place mechanisms to help mitigate the impact of changes in sales, uncollectible accounts, and fuel costs.
Last, here are the key financial targets that we show you each quarter. We are on track to meet or exceed all of them. This continues our track record over the last 6 to 7 years. John and I thank you for your interest and your support and we would be happy to take your questions. So, operator, would you please open the line for questions?

There are five Republican candidates lined for that position and two Democrats. Too close to call right now. Certainly a common theme between all the candidates is improving the economy in Michigan and creating jobs. So that is what we are seeing right now. It is too close for us to handicap this race right now, but we will know much better in about a week.
As far as the plans that the new administration has compared to the previous administration, it is hard to tell, but again job creation, investing in Michigan are a common theme we have heard between these candidates and what the current administration has. As far as the cap is concerned, there has been something floated in the legislature to increase the cap up to 25%. The issue with the legislation in Michigan, the energy legislation, there really is a good - it is a good legislation that provides a balance between all parties. People that - groups that like renewables, groups that like competition.
I don’t think there is much traction to make that change certainly in the near term, and I really wouldn’t expect much changes to the law, even in the long term even with the new administration. The law has only been in existence a couple of years. We are in the process as you heard me talk today about meetings some of the targets, particularly on renewables and I don’t think there is much interest besides a few people to change the law.

I mean, we’re all just coming out of this recession. So we want to see real results as opposed to optimistic estimates and plan accordingly.
So that is what we are doing. And that is probably a pretty good indicator I think for you, where you would expect us to go in the next six months. You were asking, I think about our authorized levels for electric and gas. We have got on the electric side an authorized rate of 10.7%, and we’re running to give you an idea on the electric side, over the last 13 months about 9.5%, and on the gas business, we’re running just a touch over 10%.

And that would, if we had enough elements tracked, whether it is uncollectibles with decoupling and with a capital investment tracker that could postpone the need for us to come back in for rate cases. So I thought that was a creative way for the commission to think about ways to do that, which I thought was good.

Thanks for joining us today on our third quarter earnings call. I’ll start the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed discussion on the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then we’ll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2010 adjusted earnings per share was $0.52, up $0.22 or 73% from last year. About half of the increase was due to higher electric and gas rate relief, reflecting our growth strategy of investing in the utility to improve customer value and the environment. The other half reflects the absence of a very cool summer last year and the premium on early debt retirement in 2009. The warm weather impact in the third quarter of 2010 was largely offset by the sales decoupling mechanism that was not in effect last year.
The decoupling mechanism is working as designed to provide more stability for customers and minimize volatility for the company. For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings at $1.35 a share, unchanged from our original guidance. Our guidance assumes an acceptable final order in the pending electric rate case, which is expected before year-end. Tom will discuss the third quarter variances and the full year guidance in more detail in a few minutes.
Although it is old news to most of you, in August, we announced our new business plan that increased our common stock dividend by 40%, reduced our capital investment plan by $800 million over the next five years, and trimmed our long-term EPS growth rate by a point to a range of 5% to 7%. This new plan was well received by investors and regulators and will be a benefit to our customers by lowering future rate increases.
Now let me give you an update on operations and our regulatory agenda. One of the primary utility goals is to improve employees’ safety by 70% through 2012, as measured by a percent reduction in safety incidence in 2006. With the cooperation of our union employees, we have already seen a 60% improvement and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 70%.
Last quarter, we announced a new five-year labor agreement with the union that provides increased healthcare cost-sharing and changed post-retirement health benefits. In the third quarter, the union ratified a new agreement for the virtual call center employees and our Zeeland generating plant employees. Going forward, this eliminates the legacy cost for all new salary and union employees.
As part of our commitment to improve the environment, we are in the process of installing selective catalytic reduction equipment at our Campbell 2 plant. Since our emission reduction initiatives began, NOx has been reduced by 74% and SO2 by 67%. And for the sixth straight year, the Whiting plant received the Michigan Department of Natural Resources’ Neighborhood Environmental Partners Award for its commitment to the environment and the community. The award is in recognition of the Whiting employees who donate their time to do natural resource enhancement and environmental cleanup. I’m very proud of the efforts of our employees to help improve the environment.
Let me give you a brief update on a few regulatory cases. I’ll begin with the gas business. In October, the MPSC staff agreed with our proposed refund of $11 million for the 2009 gas rate case. We expect the final order from the Commission in the first quarter. We filed a new gas rate case on August 13, seeking a $55 million revenue increase based on $11 million return on equity. The primary driver for the case is new investment. A schedule has been set that called for the MPSC staff to file their testimony on January 24. We plan to self-implement our rate increase in February.
In the electric business, on July 22, we self-implemented $150 million electric rate increase. The staff has recommended an increase of $91 million plus an additional $35 million in lieu of a mechanism to track economic development discounts. This case is right for a final order before year-end.
Another topic that’s getting a lot of attention, especially in Michigan, is the plug-in electric vehicle. The MPSC has approved a new voluntary rate program that offers residential customers three rate options, an incentive for charging the new hi-tech vehicles at home. The first 2,500 customers will be reimbursed up to $2,500 toward the purchase of 240-volt quick charging station. Our customers will have the infrastructure and rate option for the upcoming release of the Chevy Volt later this year and a Nissan LEAF next year.
Our new business plan is on track to deliver consistent results. With the dividend yield up from about 4% to 5%, we have reduced our long-term earnings growth modestly from a range of 6% to 8% a year to 5% to 7% a year, a range we feel comfortable with considering our business plans and the regulatory construct in Michigan.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to discuss the third quarter results.

And let me add my welcome to everybody participating on the call today. We know it’s a very busy day in advance of EEI. So, thanks for joining us. Our GAAP earnings were $0.53 for the quarter, up from $0.28 a year ago. And as John just men",1161,"Thanks, John. And let me add my welcome to everybody participating on the call today. We know it’s a very busy day in advance of EEI. So, thanks for joining us. Our GAAP earnings were $0.53 for the quarter, up from $0.28 a year ago. And as John just mentioned, excluding a small gain related to the sale of Latin American asset several years ago, adjusted earnings were $0.52, up $0.22 or 73% from last year.
Weather-adjusted earnings in the third quarter 2010 were $0.50. Most of the favorable impact of the warmer than normal summer in 2010 was offset by decoupling. Our risk mitigation continues to work well as we decouple lower or higher sales, but continue to be able to earn our authorized rate of return and grow the business.
About half of the $0.22 improvement compared with 2009 broadly reflects planned earnings growth associated with our ongoing investment at the utility. The other half reflects weather, $0.08 of which comes from the mild weather in 2009. Although this helps the comparison, it does not impact the quality of our earnings this year.
As planned, the results for the first nine months were up 30% from a year ago. Fourth quarter results are expected to be lower than a year ago and solidly on our plan. Last year, in the fourth quarter, we did not have a scheduled generation outages to the extent planned for this year. Storm costs were well below the norm that we expect this year, and maintenance costs are higher at our gas-fired plants that were running a lot more this year.
Also, we had some gains in the fourth quarter of 2009 that are similar to the gains that already occurred this year. For example, we enjoyed research tax credits last year of about $0.04. We had a credit this year in the third quarter. In addition, we suffer from more dilution this year than last. We are, however, taking action to minimize dilution in the future.
With the recent conversion of our convertible preferred, we were able to replace the preferred tool with lower cost debt and avoid future dilution. This likely will improve our 2011 results by about $0.03 a share. This lower cost debt in place of the preferred will, however, increase the face of our parent debt from $1.8 billion to about $2.1 billion even though the total size of the combined debt and equity related financing tools are not changed. This does not change our strategy to hold our parent debt flat to down in the future.
We are simply pleased to have the opportunity to reduce the cost of our financing, improve liquidity, and eliminate related dilution exposure. With the convertible preferred gone, the number of our remaining convertibles is down from four to three. This cuts our new dilution exposure by about half. You can see this in the appendix to this presentation. We will continue to look for accretive ways to eliminate the remaining exposure over time.
Switching to the economy, it appears the recession has ended with almost a 6% decline in electric sales over a three-year period. Now, that’s a bit less than the three-year decline of 7% in the early ‘80s that was our worst ever. We expect sales to be up about 1.5% this year and another 2% next year.
As shown here in a bit more detail, the year-to-year improvement that began in the fourth quarter of 2009 has been led by a recovery in the industrial sector. We anticipate that commercial sales will be up a bit next year and that residential sales will grow about 1%. Even though Michigan unemployment is stubbornly high at 13%, it’s down from 14.5% at the start of this year. Several of our industrial customers have restored a pre-recession level of production and hired back many of their employees laid off during 2009.
We are still planning cautiously, as you can see in our sales forecast. We are, however, optimistic that improvement will continue. For example, the autos continue increasing production in North America without building excessive levels of finished vehicles in their dealerships. Many dealerships complain about short supply, but the cautious approach sure seems smart.
In our service territory, we are seeing strong rebounds in steel production and fabrication, aluminum casting for hi-tech turbines, food processing and auto production, not to mention the growth in electric vehicle battery production, solar panel components, and other renewable based businesses. Pent-up demand is evident in many areas like high used car prices, but the cloud around large national, state and local government debts provides a cause for caution. Strong risk mitigation programs like decoupling in place of many utilities like our own certainly provide good precautions.
Our cash flow remained strong with sufficient capacity at the utility to fund investment-based growth plans that are well underway. Cash flow is apparent, which is shown in the left box, is more than adequate to cover interest, overhead and equity infusions into the utility with sufficient room to fund the dividend. We continue to meet our parent debt obligations one or two years in advance of due dates while reducing the cost of financings.
Here is a more comprehensive look at profit and cash flow sensitivities for 2010. The numbers are smaller as we continue our work to minimize volatility. As shown conceptually here, we have been able to reduce the magnitude of exposure to changes in earnings and cash flow by improving the quality of our own cost controls. We have also worked with the regulators to minimize the risk to our investors and customers with tools like bad debt trackers and decoupling.
This limits risk for investors and also provides upside and benefits to our customers without jeopardizing our ability to deliver our authorized rate of return with a 5% to 7% earnings growth. We may not offer the prospects of double-digit earnings growth, but we do provide more stability and predictability. We believe earnings growth of 5% to 7% and our improved dividend payout with a yield of about 5% continues to provide an attractive proposition for investors.
So here is our quarterly report card. Earnings are on track. Cash flow is substantially stronger than targeted. Liquidity and equity ratios are right on target. But as mentioned earlier, the conversion of an equity financing tool to debt will cause us to miss our parent debt target. We believe this was a good business decision, but regret having to report a target miss. I hope you appreciate the quality of our earnings leading into 2011. We look forward to sharing 2011 guidance with you when we report our 2010 results in February.
Thank you for your interest today, particularly spending time on such a busy day. We look forward to seeing you at EEI, and John and I would be delighted to take your questions now. So, operator, would you please open the line for questions?

There doesn’t seem to be much interest today about changing the law, because as you know, Paul, when we change the law, one component of the law, let’s say it’s the cap, it’s likely to have the opportunity to change other components of the law such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, which to the parties that want to change the cap are generally opposed to opening up to further renewable energy target.

And recall too, because I think it has confused - might confuse some people that on the electric side, it was a mild summer back in 2009. So that was $0.07 hurt back then, which is a fair comparison for us now. So we’ve got a big benefit that flows through this year. But most of ’10 benefits offset by decoupling.

I think the important things for you to consider are, number one, the rate relief, which just reflects the investments we are making and the growth we are having in the business, which really does drive the 5% to 7% earnings growth. But there are some good things and some bad things. We had the dilution that was associated with the convertible preferred, the 4.5% tool. With that gone, that’s going to give us a $0.03 tick-up. But there has always things that go both ways. Remember we have the 10D4 provision where that’s been good news last year, good news this year, that will actually kind of disappears as we move into next year. So that’s probably a $0.03 or $0.04 hurt, as you move year-to-year comparison to next year. So we’ve got a nice mix of things.
We always plan for normal weather, and you see that we show our sales picking up. But remember, all that’s built around are intent to earn only on our authorized rate of return. So whether there is good or bad, we try to do all the work we can to our cost controls and through things like decoupling to mitigate the downside, but also to reinvest when we can in the business, whether we get to trim more trees or whatever it may be, so that we can still grow the business 5% to 7% and end up earning close to or at our authorized rate of return.

It was another solid quarter for operation and financial performance. We’re on track, as we mentioned before, to deliver our full year adjusted earnings guidance. I also want to thank most of you on the call, particularly the analysts that have called and provided favorable comments to Tom and I about our new business plan, our new investment plan and the results that have occurred since that announcement. I passed those comments on to the Board. They are appreciative.
And as you know, we work hard every day to make sure that we have the right business plan for the environment we’re working at. Tom and I look forward to seeing you this weekend and Monday and Tuesday at EEI and hopefully we can answer any other questions you have at that point. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate it.
