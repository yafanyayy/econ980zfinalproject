Joining me on the call today is H. K. Desai, our Chief Executive Officer. I will begin the call with a review of the third quarter financial results. H. K. will follow with a discussion of the current state of our business, and progress on our strategic initiatives. Afterwards, we will open the call for questions.
Certain of our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future events and/or projections of the financial performance of the company based on our current expectations. These comments are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
We refer you to the documents QLogic files with the SEC, specifically our most recent forms 10-K and 10-Q. These documents identify important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations. We do not intend to update these forward-looking statements that we make today.
In our third quarter earnings press release issued earlier today, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and a summary of the non-GAAP adjustments are included in our earnings press release. All of the references we will make on our call today relate to the non-GAAP results, unless otherwise stated.
Turning now to our financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2009.
Our revenue in the third quarter was $149.1 million, a decrease of 9% from the same quarter last year. This revenue represents a sequential increase of $17.7 million or 13%, and significantly beat our forecasted range of $134 million to $140 million provided during our second quarter earnings conference call, and exceeded our preliminary third quarter results announced on January, the 12th of $147 million to $149 million.
Revenue exceeded our expectations primarily as a result of a 17.5% sequential increase in revenue from host products. Our third quarter revenue from host products, which are comprised primarily of Fibre Channel host bus adaptors and converged network adaptors was $110.4 million, and decreased 1.5% from $112.2 million recorded in the third quarter of last year.
Third quarter revenue from network products, which are comprised primarily of Fibre Channel and InfiniBand switches, was $27.4 million and decreased 16% from $32.8 million recorded in the third quarter of last year.
Our third quarter revenue from silicon products comprised primarily of Fibre Channel and iSCSI protocol chips was $8.7 million, and decreased 47% from $16.5 million recorded in the third quarter of last year. Silicon products also include chips for embedded applications for converged networks.
Our revenue from royalty and service was $2.6 million.
Our third quarter gross margin of 66% declined from 68% recorded in the third quarter of last year, primarily due to lower volume to absorb manufacturing costs and unfavorable product mix. Our gross margin was consistent with our forecast provided during our second quarter earnings conference call.
Next, I would like to cover our quarter operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $53.2 million, down 3% from $54.6 million reported in the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were below our expectations.
Engineering expenses in the third quarter of $29.5 million, increased 1% from a year ago and increased as a percentage of revenues from 17.7% to 19.8%. We expect future engineering expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 21%.
Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter of $16.9 million decreased 10% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 11.5% to 11.3%. We expect that future sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will range from 11% to 14%.
G&A expenses in the third quarter of $6.8 million were consistent with a year ago and were 4.6% of revenue in the December quarter. We expect that future G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 4%.
Operating profit in the third quarter was $45.2 million, which was 30.3% of revenue. Interest and other income was $1.7 million in the third quarter.
Our income tax rate for the third quarter was 22.8%, which was better than our expectation as a result of certain discrete items during the quarter.
Our third quarter net income was $36.2 million, and represented a net profit margin of 24.3%. This net income represents a sequential increase of $11.1 million or 44% from the September quarter.
Our third quarter net income per diluted share of $0.31 significantly beat the high end of our forecasted range of $0.22 to $0.24 provided during our second quarter earnings conference call, and exceeded the $0.29 to $0.30 provided in our preliminary third-quarter results announcement. This represents the 58th consecutive quarter of profitability for QLogic.
Turning now to our balance sheet, the company’s cash and investment securities were $349.2 million at the end of the third quarter. We continued to maintain a strong cash position and have no debt.
During the third quarter, we generated $44 million of cash from operations. During the quarter, we purchased $39.8 million of the company’s common stock at an average price of $18.24 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We expect to purchase common stock with a total value significantly in excess of free cash flow in fiscal 2010. Since 2003, we have used nearly $1.4 billion to repurchase 89.5 million shares of the company’s common stock.
Receivables of $86.1 million at the end of December, increased from $75.2 million at the end of the September quarter. DSO at the end of the December quarter was 53 days compared to 52 days at the end of the September quarter. We expect DSO in the future to range from 45 to 55 days.
During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress with regard to inventory. Inventory at the end of the December quarter was $21.8 million and decreased sequentially from $23.3 million at the end of the September quarter.
Annualized inventory turns for the December quarter was 9.3 compared to 7.8 turns for the September quarter.
Turning now to our outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter, we expect total revenue for the March quarter to be in the range of $140 million to $144 million. We expect gross margin to be approximately 65.5%.
Based on this outlook, combined with the planned operating expenses of approximately $56 million, a sequential increase primary due to employment costs associated with the new tax year, and a projected quarterly tax rate of approximately 25%, we expect to achieve non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.24 to $0.26 in the March quarter.
Actual results for future periods may differ materially due to a number of factors, including those outlined during the course of this conference call, in the company’s filings with the SEC, and in the disclaimer statement at the end of our earnings press release.
I will now turn the call over to H.K. H.K.?

My remarks today will be focused on the current state of our business, followed by a quarterly update on our strategic initiatives. We are very pleased with our strong financial performance in the third fiscal quarter.Revenues of $149.1 m",1486,"Thanks, Simon. My remarks today will be focused on the current state of our business, followed by a quarterly update on our strategic initiatives. We are very pleased with our strong financial performance in the third fiscal quarter.
Revenues of $149.1 million, up 13% sequentially, significantly beat our originally forecasted range of $134 million to $140 million provided during our second quarter earnings conference call. On a sequential basis, revenue from host products grew 17.5% and revenue from NetWare products grew 12%.
We are very encouraged by the breath of our revenue growth with each of the four major server OEMs growing between 21% and 23% sequentially. We're also very pleased to have achieved our targets of 30% operating margin and 20% net profit margin through increased revenue, a sequential improvement in gross margin, careful operating expense management, and a lower tax rate.
During the third quarter, our net income per diluted share was $0.31 and significantly beat our originally forecasted range of $0.22 to $0.24 provided during our second quarter earnings conference call.
Net income for the third quarter increased sequentially by 44% on a revenue growth of 13%, demonstrating the significant leverage that exists in our model. We continue to be optimistic given the trends we are seeing in our business. We are encouraged by the improvements we experienced in order patterns and shipments during the December quarter, and the forecast we are receiving from our OEM customers for the March quarter.
We are clearly benefiting from the server upgrade cycle that is underway, and is expected to continue through calendar 2010 driven by the transitions to Intel Nehalem-EX based servers increasing the adoption of VMWare and other high providers and the shift to Windows Server 2008 R2.
We expect to benefit from an improved IT spending in 2010. QLogic is strongly positioned with a broad product portfolio to be a significant beneficiary of this server update cycle.
Now, I will provide an update on our strategic initiatives. During the third fiscal quarter, we made significant progress on the three strategic initiatives that we have previously discussed, specifically FCoE or converged networking, Fibre Channel, and InfiniBand. Our focus and investment in this strategic initiative is as important as ever to ensure that we are optimally positioned for continued growth and market leadership.
In converged networking, we further extended our lead as the premier supplier of single chip fibre channel or Ethernet converged network adapters or CNS. In October, we announced that IBM Power System has chosen our single chip 8100 CNS for native FCoE connectivity and Ethernet niche [ph] requirements, repeat Ethernet niche requirements in the IBM Power System portfolio of tower, rack-mount and blade servers.
With additional power system for large-scale Unix and Linux deployments, we continue to expand our leadership positions in FCoE. And this is a significant milestone that represents an expanded market opportunity for QLogic. Until this achievement, we have not had access to the IBM Power System SAN connectivity market. Revenue shipments began in October right after the announcement.
In November, we announced that we were first to achieve full VMWare vSphere 4 certification with our 8100 Series adapters. VMWare vSphere 4 is the industry's leading platform for datacentre virtualization for both FCoE and 10-gig Ethernet publications. The powerful combination of our 8100 CNS with vSphere 4 enables customers to achieve a high degree of datacentre efficiency where thousands of virtual machines supporting enterprise business application, around a densely packed server or converged, unified networks.
In December, we announced that Dell is shipping our 8100 Series CNA across a broad range of Dell Poweredge Servers, including Intel Xeon 5500 Nehalem (inaudible) servers, tower servers, and blade servers. Dell has deployed our products for both Ethernet niche requirements and storage network in niche. By reducing infrastructure requirements for Dell customers, our CNS enables organizations to streamline the datacentres, while optimizing performance for both application and environment.
Our announcement marks another key milestone in our long-standing history of providing networking solutions for Dell servers and storage. Earlier this month, we announced that our 8100 CNA certification and was immediately available for HP ProLiant DL and ML servers. The 8100 Series CNA ensured continued availability of the same Pro and QLogic Fibre Channel stack broadly in use by HP customers today.
The biggest OEMs in the industry continue to choose and rely on QLogic to deliver single-chip native FCoE and Ethernet networking connectivity, repeat Ethernet networking connectivity for the servers and high-density storage systems. Since our initial 8100 Series announcement less than 12 months ago, we have announced and are shipping second-generation converged network products to IBM System x, IBM BladeCente, NetApp, EMC, IBM Power, Dell, and HP as well as our worldwide channel partners.
These customers are taking full advantage of convergence by deploying QLogic’s fully qualified and OEM deployed storage and Ethernet networking software stacks. The broad benefits of convergence, including power savings and spares cut across all lines of business and have been broadly accepted and started being deployed globally by an increasing number of end-users.
During the quarter, our revenue from converged networks adapters grew in excess of 75% sequentially, a rate significantly in excess of our principal competitor’s growth.
Turning now to Fibre Channel, according to the Dell'Oro Group, calendar Q3 2009 SAN report, the most recent one published, QLogic extended its undisputed market leadership in SAN adapters. While the calendar Q4 2009 Dell'Oro is not available yet, the combination of the published Q1 through Q3 reports and public announcements regarding Q4 performance lead us to conclude that the Q4 data will show that QLogic again widened our shared leadership in Fibre Channel adapters for calendar year 2009.
This would mark the sixth consecutive year, where we grew Fibre Channel adapter share, and maintained the number one share position. During the December quarter, our revenue from 8-gig Fibre Channel adapters again grew very strongly at a rate in excess of 60% sequentially, now represent more than 30% of our revenue from our Fibre Channel host products.
We believe this was driven primarily by the higher performance in Intel Nehalem-based server platforms and the increasing adoption of VMWare and other hypervisors. In the expanding blade server market, we continue to have more than 70% revenue market share for all Fibre Channel mezzanine cards.
In December, we announced that Hitachi Data Systems had selected our 8-gig Fibre Channel Switches and iSCSI Intelligent Storage Routers to provide new connectivity options for Hitachi's comprehensive portfolio of storage systems, including the flagship Universal Storage Platform, and channel-optimized, midrange Hitachi Adaptable Modular Storage 2000 family.
We made several critical advances in our InfiniBand initiative during the quarter. In November, at the Supercomputing ‘09 conference, we announced that HP has selected our portfolio of end-to-end 40-gig per second QDR InfiniBand products to be a part of the HP Unified Cluster Portfolio. The HP Unified Cluster Portfolio makes standard based cluster easy to configure and manage or QDR Host Channel Adapters, directors, edge and blade switches when coupled with HP ProLiant and BladeSystem C-class servers deliver industry-leading scalability and performance with a reduced total cost of ownership in high-performance cluster in a broad range of applications.
Also at the Supercomputing ‘09 conference, we announced an expanded OEM agreement with IBM for our QDR InfiniBand directors, edge switches, and Host Channel Adapters into its System x servers makes servers for HP application like the IBM System Cluster 1350 and IBM iDataPlex. Our solutions allow IBM to deliver pre-tested easy to deploy solutions.
Dell also joined the expanding list of OEMs deploying QLogic’s QDR InfiniBand director, edge switches, and Host Channel Adapters for the 11G PowerEdge servers. Finally, we announced a new agreement with SGI for the resale of our QDR InfiniBand directors and edge switches as part of its CloudRack and Rackable HPC Servers and Clusters.
Our InfiniBand business is better positioned today than at any point in the past. Our products offer superior performance, superior scalability, enhanced reliability and power efficiency. Combining this with our relationships at IBM, HP, Dell, SGI and our worldwide channel partners positions us to continue to increase our share in this market. In closing, we are very confident that we have been and remain focused on the right set of strategic initiatives, which will benefit us in calendar 2010 and beyond.
First, our server upgrade cycle is clearly under way, and will benefit us as a result of our market leading positions in Fibre Channel adapters. Second, in the converged network adapter market, our time-to-market advantage, technology superiority, and the significant number of publicly announced Tier 1 OEM customers shipping our product, position us to significantly benefit as enterprises transition to converged networks.
Finally, our network products are better positioned to experience revenue growth and capture market share for both Fibre Channel and InfiniBand switches than in the past. This concludes our preferred remarks. Operator, now we're open for questions.

So, a lower expectation of contribution associated with the royalty and service part of business.
And then once you get beyond that, there is obviously a volume impact as a result of the revenues ticking down a little from the number that we delivered in the December quarter, and then there is a mix impact as well. Unfortunately, it is at levels of granularity that below the headline levels that you can see within the context of a press release or that we can give you color on. So, lower royalty and services, the primary piece of it and then other volume and product related mix issues as well.

So, as you correctly pointed out the gross margin was consistent with the guidance even though the revenue was higher than we'd expected to be. There is ample of things, right. Number one is you've got lower revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage obviously. Therefore from the silicon business and the silicon business does tend to carry the highest gross margins that we experience. So that was a meaningful contributed gross margin, not be higher than the 66%, and then beyond that you've got the inventory work down that we continued to see impact the business, and you've got some mix that didn't work in our favor at a more granular level then you can see within the context of the headline numbers as I said.
So those three factors, lower revenue from silicon and absolute dollars, and therefore obviously as a percentage of revenues it was lower, lower impact on volumes, because we continue to work inventory down and then other mix issues that you can't see.

Joining me on the call today is H. K. Desai, our Chief Executive Officer. I will begin the call with a review of the fourth quarter and full-year financial results and in addition, provide detail on the tax impact of our globalization initiative. H. K. will follow with a discussion of the current state of our business, a brief recap of fiscal 2010, and progress on our strategic initiatives. Afterwards, we will open the call for questions.
Certain of our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future events and/or projections of the financial performance of the company based on our current expectations. These comments are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
We refer you to the documents QLogic files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. These documents identify important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements that we make today.
In our fourth quarter earnings press release issued earlier today, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and a summary of the non-GAAP adjustments are included in our earnings press release. All of the references we will make on the call today relate to non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated.
Turning now to our financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter ended March 28th, 2010. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $145.7 million, an increase of 12% from the same quarter last year. This revenue exceeded our forecasted range of $140 million to $144 million provided during our third quarter earnings conference call.
Our fourth quarter revenue from Host Products, which comprised primarily of fiber channel adapters and converged network adapters was $103.7 million and increased 17% from $88.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter revenue from Network Products, which comprised primarily of fiber channel and InfiniBand switches, was $22.6 million and decreased 10% from $25.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the lower revenue from InfiniBand switch products. Our fourth quarter revenue from Silicon Products comprised primarily of fiber channel and iSCSI protocol chips was $16.7 million and increased 22% from $13.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Silicon Products also include chips for embedded applications for converged networks.
Our revenue from royalty and service was $2.7 million. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 66.6% declined from 67.7% recorded in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to unfavorable product mix. Our gross margin exceeded our forecast provided during our third quarter earnings conference call due to product mix, primarily associated with the higher-than-expected revenue from Silicon Products and lower-than-expected revenue from InfiniBand switch products.
Next, I would like to cover our fourth quarter operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $55.5 million, up 4% from $53.3 million reported in the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were slightly below our expectations. Engineering expenses in the fourth quarter of $30.4 million increased 2% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 22.9% to 20.9%. We expect future engineering expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 21%.
Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of $17.6 million increased 4% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 13% to 12.1%. We expect that future sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will range from 11% to 14%. G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of $7.4 million were 5.1% of revenue. We expect that future G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 4%. Operating profit in the fourth quarter of $41.5 million increased 18% from a year ago and increased as a percentage of revenue from 26.9% to 28.5%.
Interest and other income was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter. Our income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.6%, resulting in an annual rate for the full year of 24.7%. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was consistent with our expectation and excluded the effect of the special charge recorded during the quarter related to the globalization initiative. Our fourth quarter net income of $32.4 million increased 32% from a year ago and represented a net profit margin of 22.3%. Our fourth quarter net income per diluted share of $0.28 significantly beat the $0.20 we achieved last year and exceeded the high end of our forecasted range of $0.24 to $0.26 provided during our third quarter earnings conference call. This represents the 59th consecutive quarter of profitability for QLogic. The income per diluted share calculation for the current quarter was based on 115.6 million shares.
Turning now to our balance sheet. The company’s cash and investment securities were $375.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to maintain a strong cash position and have no debt. During the fourth quarter, we generated $69.3 million of cash from operations. During the quarter, we purchased $56.8 million of the company’s common stock at an average price of $18.56 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Since 2003, we have used nearly $1.45 billion to repurchase 92.6 million shares of the company’s common stock.
Receivables of $73.3 million at the end of the March quarter decreased sequentially from $86.1 million at the end of the December quarter. DSO at the end of the March quarter improved to 46 days compared to 53 days at the end of the December quarter. We expect DSO in the future will range from 45 days to 55 days. Inventory at the end of the March quarter was $19.4 million and decreased sequentially from $21.8 million at the end of the December quarter. Annualized inventory turns for the March quarter were 10 compared to 9.3 turns for the December quarter.
Now, let me summarize the results for the full fiscal year. Revenue for the full fiscal year was $549.1 million. Non-GAAP net income was $117.7 million or $1 per diluted share and represented a net profit margin of 21.4%. During the fiscal year, we generated free cash flow of $137.2 million and purchased 10.1 million shares of our common stock for $165.5 million at an average price of $16.38 pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Approximately five years ago, we implemented the globalization initiative to greatly expand our worldwide footprint. As part of this initiative, certain intellectual property and other rights were licensed to an international subsidiary of QLogic. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded special tax charge for GAAP purposes of $29.7 million, primarily related to an amendment of the license agreement with the international subsidiary, which resulted in a fully paid up license. We determined that all obligations under the license agreement had been satisfied and accordingly, this will result in a significantly lower effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011 and subsequent years.
Turning now to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We expect our combined revenue from Host and Network Products to grow sequentially at approximately 3% and our revenue from Silicon Products to decline. We expect total revenue for the June quarter to be in the range of $140 million to $146 million. We expect gross margin for the June quarter to range from 65.5% to 66%. Based on this outlook, combined with the planned operating expenses of approximately $55 million, our projected annual tax rate of approximately 20% under diluted share count of approximately 115 million shares, we expect to achieve non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.27 to $0.30 in the June quarter.
Actual results for future periods may differ materially due to a number of factors, including those outlined during the course of this conference call, in the company’s filings with the SEC, and in the disclaimer statement at the end of our earnings press release.
I will now turn the call over to H. K. H. K.?

My comments today will include a discussion of our business highlights for fiscal 2010 as well as the most recent quarter, followed by an update on our strategic initiatives.
Despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment, QLogic delivered solid financial performance for the fiscal year. This performance was attributable to continued share gains within our traditional markets, the introductions and ramp of innovative new products that provide us incremental business opportunities in the converged networking and 10-Gig Ethernet markets, extremely careful operating expense management and our reduction in our tax rate.
For fiscal year 2010, we delivered revenues of $549.1 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1. We achieved an operating margin of 27% and net profit margin of 21.4%, which is consistent with our long-term target of greater than 20% net profit margin. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $145.7 million, a sequential decrease of 2%, but above our forecasted range of $140 million to $144 million provided during our third quarter earnings conference call.
Sequentially, revenue from Host Products was down 6%, revenue from Network Products was down 18%, primarily a result of lower revenue from InfiniBand switches and revenue from Silicon Products was up 93%. The fastest growing part of our revenue from Silicon Products was those serving the converged networking market. We also benefited from strong sequential growth for our fiber channel and iSCSI silicon products. Throughout the fiscal year, we remained sharply focused on our goals and business strategies and have executed very well against them.
During our fourth fiscal quarter, we continued to make significant progress on the three strategic initiatives that we have previously highlighted, specifically FCoE or converged networking, fiber channel and InfiniBand. In converged networking, we further extended our lead as the premier supply of single-chip Fiber Channel over Ethernet converged network adapters or CNAs. In January, we announced that about 8100 Series CNAs had completed certification and were immediately available for HP ProLiant DL and ML servers. The 8100 Series CNAs ensure continued availability of the same proven QLogic fiber channel stack broadly used by a majority of HP enterprise datacenter customers today.
In March, we announced that Cisco had certified and is shipping our 8100 Series CNAs with its unified company systems or UCS platform. Our products had previously been fully certified for use with Cisco’s Nexus 5000 Series FCoE switches, which are commonly deployed with a UCS platform. With the addition of our 8100 Series CNAs, Cisco customers can now take full advantage of the complete range of QLogic fiber channel and converged network adapters.
The addition of HPN and Cisco to the already impressive list of customers for QLogic converged networking products caps off a fiscal year of a tremendous achievement and the successful completion of our initial goals for the converged networking market. Just over one year ago, we announced our second-generation single-chip converged networking products. We followed that announcement with a succession of Tier 1 deployment, including IBM System x, IBM BladeCenter, NetApp, EMC, IBM Power Systems, Dell, HP, Cisco, and QLogic branded version of our worldwide channel partners.
These customers are now providing end users the full benefits of network convergence by deploying QLogic’s fully qualified and OEM deployed storage and Ethernet stacks with QLogic’s own cost-effective, highly integrated single-chip ASIC technology. We succeeded in our goal of early converged networking leadership by establishing a clear time-to-market advantage, leveraging our industry-leading storage and Ethernet stack, and establishing QLogic as a networking market leader.
Our ownership of all IP associated with our ASIC, fiber channel stack, and Ethernet stack give us a complete control over our technology roadmap, future production and a lifecycle management. This leadership position allow us to significantly benefit in multiple ways from the growing market for converged networking products currently estimated by Dell’Oro Group at approximately $50 million for calendar year 2010 and growing at a compounded annual growth rate of over 90% over the next few years.
During the quarter, our revenue from solutions serving the converged networking market grew approximately 50% on a sequential basis. Turning now to fiber channel, based on this week’s announced results, we believe that we capture revenue market share for fiber channel adapters during the first calendar quarter and expanded significant leadership position that we enjoy exiting 2009.
According to Dell’Oro Group’s calendar Q4 2009 SAN report, our revenue market share for fiber channel adapters was 54.4% in calendar year 2009 beating our nearest competitor by 16.5 percentage points. This represents the sixth consecutive year of market leadership and share gains. Turning now to fiber channel switches. We are seeing a shift in our favor, which we believe will allow us to expand our global market share in the fiber channel switch market. In February, we announced that our 8-Gig stackable fiber channel switches are now available from HP as a scalable SAN solutions for use with HP server and storage portfolios, including HP’s Blade system, Virtual Connect, HP StorageWorks, MSA and EVA systems.
Branded as the HP StorageWorks SN6000, the switches incorporate QLogic’s unique intra switching technology, which significantly reduces total cost of ownership compared to non-stackable alternatives. The switch is innovative, dedicated 20 gigabit per second fiber channel stacking ports made it possible to connect switches together without utilizing valuable user ports. By reducing cable and connection costs while enhancing SAN performance, the SN6000 enables lower capital and operational expenditures. Revenues from this solutions comments in our fourth fiscal quarter and we expect a more meaningful revenue contribution later this year.
In March, we also announced the availability of our 8-Gig stackable fiber channel switches for the EMC Select programs as well as scalable SAN solutions for a broad range of EMC network and Unified Storage systems, including Symmetrix and CLARiiON portfolios. The switches are available worldwide from EMC and its partners and have been qualified through the EMC E-Lab.
Turning now to our InfiniBand initiative, during the fourth fiscal quarter, we introduced the Dell QDR Blade mezzanine card in conjunction with the industry’s first Quad Data Rate InfiniBand Pass-Through Module. The Pass-Through Module is now available for Dell PowerEdge servers in high performance computing environments. The new module designed specifically to address Dell’s HPC customer’s requirements eliminates the latencies associated with internal switch hubs, by connecting BladeServers directly to the external QDR InfiniBand port switch, typically found in a large HPC cluster. In additions to the Pass-Through Module and QDR Blade mezzanine card, Dell offers QLogic end-to-end QDR InfiniBand adapter and switch solutions worldwide.
In closing, we are very confident that we have placed our focus on the right set of strategic initiatives which will continue to benefit us in fiscal 2011 and beyond. First, the server update cycle which commenced in 2009 is continuing and will benefit us as a result of our market-leading position in the fiber channel adapters. Second, our network products are better positioned to experience revenue growth and capture market share for both fiber channel and InfiniBand switches. Finally, in the converged network adapter market, based on our time-to-market advantage, technology superiority and a significant number of publicly-announced Tier 1 OEM customer shipping our products, we expect to further extend our lead as enterprises transitions to converged networks.
Datacenter is focused on even greater efficiency through virtualizations, lower power consumptions, increased bandwidth in smaller footprint and converged networking technology. We will continue focusing on these aspects while driving higher performance and greater ease-of-use through highly innovative products based on our own IP. This concludes our prepared remarks.
Operator, now we will open to the questions.

So, we show great strength. As you have seen in the past, this silicon line does tend to be a little choppy, and we would experience that over a number of quarters. It’s primarily associated with the lead times, the fact that more participants in the supply chain are OEMs and they contract manufacturers, tend to place orders that reflective of lead time. Sometimes we can deal with those issues through inventory that we have. Sometimes you end up with choppier patents because we are satisfying demand in different periods and it may actually exist and so on.
So, it has been a little lumpy. If you take the midpoint of guidance range that we provided to you, you end up with somewhere around $11 million silicon number. I think our expectation as we look forward over the course of the coming years that will sit somewhere close to that kind of level based on what facts we have in hand today. It’s certainly improved from the $7 million to $8 million to $9 million that it had been running through the first part of fiscal 2010, and $11 million feels like an appropriate rate to have about for the remainder of the year for now, but other than that, it’s choppy in the past and it will probably be choppier in the future.

When you gave the commentary which said that we expected the silicon line to be roughly flat to $8 million right, so it’s clearly within the overall performance of the company versus the guidance that we provided you back in the January timeframe over-performance relative to the midpoint of the guidance that we gave you and relative to the high point of the guidance, and then some of the silicon improvement offsetting some of the weakness that we saw primarily in the InfiniBand switch business.
So, across the board, fiber channel protocol chips, iSCSI protocol chips and chips serving the converged networking opportunity were better that we had expected them to be. Now, we are able to deal with some of the customer demand, because we hold inventory of certain of those products at various points in time, not necessarily all, and the lead times do tend to cause customers to place orders that can be for larger quantities than they expect to consume in any individual short period of time, right. So, even you see that to be choppier, we move forward. But we were in a very good position to be able to satisfy the incremental demand that occurred over the course of the quarter.

I think one thing what we do is like we always skip inventory with ours for the silicon and if the customer demand come in within the quarter, we are able to satisfy these things. So, right now, it looks like we should be able to do that, but I think where we are - if you look at even last year 2009 when we gave our guidance, we said that we should have about $35 million, $36 million, $37 million overall revenue for the year actually we were right there.

What we have done in the past is that we always want to make sure we have our insurance policy again some new technology coming into play. When we are strongly in fiber channels, iSCSI came in, and we said, you know what, we got to take an insurance policy on that. We acquired the company, we invest, and we continue investing in that. Then certainly the FCoE happened, so the iSCSI becoming not that important, because it’s going to converge technologies, not going to be the iSCSI - Ethernet iSCSI, but it’s going to be FCoE. So, we are focusing a lot more on that.
At the same time, we also thought going backward for few years ago that we can become one of the - can get traction in the enterprise datacenter. So, we want to make sure that we go and take a bat against that, we invest into these things. We are not seeing that because of the FCoE coming into play, we invested in the IB before the FCoE coming into play, and now FCoE coming into play, the convergence is going to happen on Ethernet that is going to be storage and it’s going to be data or eventually it’s going to be the HPC 2. So, we believe the long-term IB is not going to be a technology for the datacenter convergence. It’s going to be really the FCoE.
So, what we are doing is we have invested in these things, we will continue investing, because we have OEM customers and it’s going to be just like what you are enjoying, the iSCSI will enjoy some revenue in profit.

This is a very typical technology company; in fact any major company that has international operations will have this type of structure in place, right. So, in many ways you could argue that QLogic was later coming to the market because of the specific US nature of our business that existed 5 or 10 or 15 years ago, right. So, what we did beginning 5 years ago was essentially realigned the business to more appropriately support our OEM customers increasing global activity. So, that means multiple international manufacturing locations, (inaudible) continue to supply to ensure cost competitiveness, they ensure that we are manufacturing closer to the actual component providers and to the customers as well. It involved putting in place international fulfillment centers, so our product staged overseas. That improves time-to-market or time-to-delivery for our customers; it improves the cost of delivery for customers. It improves our ability to manage inventory.
It involved an expansion of our global sales force into geographies that they haven’t previously participated in, in order to support the OEM efforts that were ongoing in those places, and to a certain extent, it even involved the setup of international development centers, right. So, with this entire globalization initiative, which is obviously very expensive to implement, there are series of benefits that we realized and one of those benefits is overtime a lower tax rate and in the most recent period, we were able to finalize, the agreements have been in place for many years, and there we are in a position where we are going to enjoy those lower tax rates as we move forward.

So, what Keith wanted me to do is like what we said once we - I mean I have seen this saying in the fiber channel transition that what we have seen is that when the market transition happen or the technology transition happen, it’s very difficult to give any guidance. We don’t believe in giving any numbers on those revenues, because it’s going to take some time. There has to be stability and the growth has to be continued. The market is still just starting any way. We are growing every quarter, we said we are growing 75% and we are growing 50% sequentially. So, our converged network business which includes everything for example includes the CNA and excludes the Silicon. That’s what we gave you as all converged solutions grew about 50% sequentially. So I think that’s continuing. What we are saying is as the time goes when we give the data about, we also start giving the colors, even though we will put CAN into the parcel of Host and the Silicon, Silicon will give you the color of overall conversion network, what’s going and it will give you that color.

I apologize here for beating a dead horse, and I am going to ask another question on silicon, maybe take a different approach here. As you think about that silicon business, if you kind of flat line your guidance here going forward, it does imply three or four quarters of year-over-year growth. And so, I guess the question I have specifically is, is that year-over-year growth that you expect in silicon solely tied to just a volume rebound on legacy design wins in the silicon business or are there some new design wins that we should think about driving and sustaining some growth specifically in the silicon business, and kind of part B to that, is there any NetXen silicon design wins that’s in that segment as well?

So, I think what we have down in the guidance is more because of silicon and we probably assume that they have some inventory OEMs, because they were so strong quarter in the March. That’s what the guidance is. Our guidance really is a slightly built on seasonality as well as June quarter is concerned for the coal business.

And welcome to QLogic’s first quarter fiscal year 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today is H. K. Desai, our Chief Executive Officer.
I will begin the call with a review of the first quarter financial results. H.K. will follow with a discussion of the current state of our business and progress on our strategic initiatives. Afterwards, we will open the call for questions.
Certain of our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future events and/or projections of the financial performance of the company based on our current expectations. These comments are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
We refer you to the documents QLogic files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-K. These documents identify important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements that we make today.
In our first quarter earnings press release issued earlier today, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and a summary of the non-GAAP adjustments are included in our earnings press release. All of the references we will make on the call today relate to non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated.
Turning now to our financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2010. Our revenue in the first quarter was $142.6 million, an increase of 16% from the same quarter last year. This revenue was within our forecasted range of $140 to $146 million, provided during our fourth quarter earnings conference call.
Our first quarter revenue from Host Products, which are comprised primarily of fibre channel adapters and converge network adapters was $102.5 million and increased 16% from $88.3 million recorded in the first quarter of last year.
First quarter revenue from Network Products, which comprised primarily of fibre channel and InfiniBand switches was $25.6 million and increased 3% from $25 million recorded in the first quarter of last year.
Our first quarter revenue from Silicon Products, comprised primarily of fibre channel and iSCSI protocol chips was $11.9 million, consistent with our expectations and increased 60% from $7.4 million recorded in the first quarter of last year. Silicon Products also include chips for embedded applications for converge networks.
Our revenue from Royalty and Service was $2.6 million, and that consists almost entirely of service revenues.
Our first quarter gross margin of 66.5% improved from 65.5% recorded in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to higher volume to absorb manufacturing costs. Our gross margin exceeded our forecast provided during the -- during our fourth quarter earnings conference call primarily due to product mix.
Next, I’d like to cover our first quarter operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $54 million, up 4% from $52.2 million reported in the first quarter of last year. Operating expenses were slightly below our expectation.
Engineering expenses in the first quarter of $29.7 million increased 2% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 23.7% to 20.8%. We expect feature engineering expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 21%.
Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of $18.3 million increased 8% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 13.9% to 12.8%. We expect that future sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will range from 11% to 14%.
G&A expenses in the first quarter of $6 million or 4.2% of revenue. We expected future G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 4%.
Operating profit in the first quarter of $40.8 million increased 44% from a year ago and increased as a percentage of revenue from 23% to 28.6%. Interest and other income was $1.4 million in the first quarter. Our income tax rate for the first quarter was 17.7%, which was slightly better than our expectation.
Our first quarter net income of $34.7 million increased 45% from a year ago and represented a net profit margin of 24.3%. Our first quarter net income per diluted share of $0.30 was significantly better than the $0.20 we achieved last year and at the high-end of our forecasted range of $0.27 to $0.30 provided during our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This represents the 60th consecutive quarter of profitability for QLogic.
Turning now to our balance sheet. The company’s cash and investment securities were $348.6 million at the end of the first quarter. We continue to maintain a strong cash position and have no debt. During the first quarter, we generated $30.6 million of cash from operations.
During the quarter, we purchased $52.5 million of the company’s common stock at an average price of $18.81 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Since 2003 we have used $1.5 billion to repurchase 95.4 million shares of the company’s common stock.
Receivables of $74.6 million at the end of the June quarter increased sequentially from $73.3 million at the end of the March quarter.
DSO at the end of the June quarter was 48 days, compared to 46 days at the end of the March quarter. We expect DSO in the future will range from 45 to 55 days.
Inventory at the end of the June quarter was $24.4 million and increased sequentially from $19.4 million at the end of the March quarter. Annualized inventory turns for the June quarter was 7.8 compared to 10 turns for the March quarter. The increase in inventory is entirely associated with advanced purchases of silicon to maintain flexibility due to long lead time.
Turning now to our outlook for our second quarter, we expect total revenue for the September quarter to be in the range of $143 to $147 million. We expect gross margin for the September quarter to range from 65.5% to 66%.
Based on this outlook combined with planned operating expenses of approximately $55 million, projected annual tax rate of approximately 18% and diluted share count of approximately 112 million shares, we expect to achieve non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.29 to $0.32 in the September quarter.
Actual results for future periods may differ materially due to a number of factors including those outlined during the course of this conference call, and the company’s filings with the SEC, and in the disclaimer statement at the end of our earnings press release.
I’ll now turn the call over to H.K. H.K.?

My remarks today will focus on the current state of our business followed by quality update on strategic initiatives. Our revenue in the first quarter was $142.6 million, a sequential decrease of 2% and approximately at the midpoint of our guidance.
On a sequential basis, revenue from Host Products declined 1% and revenue from Network Products grew 14%. Revenue from Silicon Products was consistent with our expectation. We achieved an operating margin of 29% and net profit margin of 24%, includes solid gross margin, careful operating expense management and a lower tax. During the first quarter our net income per diluted share was $0.30 at the high-end of our forecasted range of $0.27 to $0.30, provided during our fourth quarter earnings conference call.
Turning now to the current state of our business. We are encouraged by the plans we experienced during the first fiscal quarter in both our Host and our Network Products families. The several this cycle that began in calendar 2009 is continuing and we expect increasing benefit to our business in the second half of calendar 2010 as our OEM customers complete the introduction of the Nehalem-EX based servers.
We continue to believe that the new Nehalem-EX based Servers will drive incremental attach of our high performance fibre channel and converge networking products as end users optimize network configurations to maximize the advantages of this very powerful bandwidth-intensive processors.
QLogic is strongly positioned through a broad product portfolio and leadership positions in the storage area and converge networking market and will be a significant beneficiary of this server of this cycle.
Now I’ll provide an update on our strategic initiatives. During our first quarter we continue to make significant progress on three strategic initiatives that we have previously discussed, specifically, converge networking, fibre channel and InfiniBand.
Our investments to date have resulted in new design wins, improved market share and revenue from new markets. We are continuing to invest aggressively in each of these initiatives.
In the converge networking we made our first major announcement regarding our converge network switching technology with recent unveiling of the new HP Virtual Connect FlexFabric 10Gb/24-port module. Our key element of HP’s converge infrastructure portfolio. HP can now converge Ethernet, Fibre Channel and iSCSI on a single virtual connect module.
The new QLogic converge network switching ASIC, code name Bullet features industry first flex port technology that enables sports to be dynamically allocated to support Fibre Channel, iSCSI or FCoE data.
This highly innovated network convergence technology provides variable connectivity options and complex flexibility enabling protocol shift as and when required by users. This important achievement tangibly demonstrates the broadness and depth of our converge networking technology leadership. Our end-to-end portfolio enhances our position as a strategic supplier of converge network to our OEM customers.
In April, we announced that our 1800 Series converge network adapters are available from Hitachi Data Systems and its authorized reseller worldwide. The 1800 Series are fully qualified and interoperable with the comprehensive Hitachi portfolio of storage systems including the mid-range adaptable module storage 2,000 family and enterprise-class Universal V and VM platforms.
Also in the quarter Oracle begin revenue shipments for 8100 Series CNAs. We are using the complete server portfolio spanning Oracle Spark M Series Enterprise Servers. Oracle Spark T-Series mid-range and entry level servers and Oracle x64 platforms.
QLogic is a long-time supplier and development partner of Sun Microsystems, now Oracle and primary provider of the SAN Host products. The addition of QLogic’s converge network adapters with the common fibre channel stack enables Oracle customers to build reliable highly efficient and affordable unified networks.
We have now successfully deployed our converged networking solutions with all leading server and storage vendors, including IBM, Systemax, IBM Blade Center, NetApp, EMC, IBM Power Systems, Dell, HP, Cisco, Hitachi, Oracle and our QLogic branded version of our worldwide channel partners.
These customers are now providing and useful -- and there are the useful benefits of network convergence by deploying QLogic’s fully qualified and OEM deployed storage and Ethernet stack with QLogic’s own cost effective highly integrated single chip ASIC technology.
Our early investment and clear time to market advantage has resulted in converged market leadership. During the first fiscal quarter, our revenue from products serving the converge networking market, which include all products based on 10-gig Ethernet connectivity was $10 million.
The vast majority of this revenue is included in our Host Products and a small amount included in our Silicon Products where we sold ASIC for Host applications. This $10 million revenue excludes our very minor amount of revenue from our converged networks switching parts. Dell’Oro Group estimates that this market will be approximately $200 million in Canada, 2010, growing at a compound annual rate in excess of 40% for the next four years.
Turning now to Fibre Channel. According to the Dell’Oro Group, calendar Q1 2010 SAN report, the most recent report published QLogic extended its market leadership in SAN adapters. With 55.2% revenue market share for Fibre Channel adapters, we increase our market shared by 2.1 percentage points over the prior quarter and increase our lead to a total of 19.1 percentage points ahead of our nearest competitor.
We maintain our number one positions in every adapter category including Standard, Mezzanine, 4-gig and 8-gig adapters. In a move designed to expand its addressable market for high performance enterprise class storage systems, Oracle also selected QLogic over 8-gig Fibre Channel adapter supplier for its Sun Storage 7000 systems, also known as Amber Road. We continue engage with Oracle with a broad portfolio product offerings.
Turning now toward InfiniBand initiative. In May we announced that our QDR InfiniBand Host Channel adapters will be available from Voltaire as part of the portfolio of end-to-end QDR InfiniBand solutions. Voltaire is offering a 7300 Series HCAs alongside its Grid Director line of QDR InfiniBand switches and software.
This ensures that QLogic HCAs are interoperable with an increasing number of high-performance computing cluster configurations and provides greater flexibility for InfiniBand customers. This also marks the continued expansion of our InfiniBand Solutions in HPC marketplace.
In May we also announced our InfiniBand Fabric Management Suite version 6.0. This important release integrates industry leading intelligent features for InfiniBand network management and optimisms for high performance work loads at scale with minimal intervention from system administrators with a goal of improving efficiency of both people and hardware ultimately leading to greater productivity.
In summary, our focus in the right set of strategic initiatives is yielding tangible results which will continue to benefit us for the remainder of fiscal 2011 and beyond. First, the serve update cycle which commenced in 2009 is continuing and will benefit us as a result of our market leading positions in Fibre Channel adapters.
Second, our Network Products are experiencing revenue growth and capturing market share for Fibre Channel and InfiniBand switches.
Finally, in the converge networking market, based on our time-to-market advantage, technology superiority end-to-end portfolio and the broad adoptions by Tier 1 OEM customers, shipping our products today we expect to further extend or lead as enterprise transition to converge networks.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, now we’re open for the questions.

And clearly we expect people to deploy 8-gig as they deploy next generation sort of that are going to be in the data center for the number of years or we expect them to deploy 10-big based converge networking technology. So, we think that essentially everybody is in the market with a full set of products at this point in time and they’re going to ramp as we move through the second part of the year.

But what caused the Host business performance to not be quite as strong as we’d expected it to be last quarter, really there was a couple of things.
We did see something of a slowdown in Europe at the very end of the quarter and I’d characterize that as being just the last month of the quarter specific to the Host business and then we also saw weakness with one specific OEM as well. So, whilst server trends that we’ve seen from those OEMs we managed over the course of the last three months have been very positive. And whilst there were trends with those OEMs have been very consistent with their sort of a server performance, that’s not true across the board. So we’ve got one OEM but did drag down the performance on a sequential basis a little more than we’d expected them to.

We really started to see the benefit of that activity here in the most recent June quarter.

And then as we have explained in the past, the objectivity would be move right of that path of the converged market, into the much broader converged market which includes 10 gig Ethernet and Converged Network Adapter type technologies. So, as we’ve executed on the converged technologies and as our Ethernet stacks have become qualified, proven, hardened and ultimately deployed by end users, we have been able to establish credibility as a supplier for that technology and it becomes a logical extension to the OEMs of everything what we’re doing with them.

We’re very comfortable with that sizing of the market. We understand the ASP assumptions. We understand the unit assumptions. Okay? So let say it is $800 million when you get out to 2014.

Joining me on the call today is H. K. Desai, our Chief Executive Officer.
 I will begin the call with a review of the first quarter financial results. H.K. will follow with a discussion of the current state of our business and progress on our strategic initiatives. Afterwards, we will open the call for questions.
 Certain of our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future events and/or projections of the financial performance of the company based on our current expectations. These comments are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
 We refer you to the documents QLogic files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-K. These documents identify important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements that we make today.
 In our first quarter earnings press release issued earlier today, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and a summary of the non-GAAP adjustments are included in our earnings press release. All of the references we will make on the call today relate to non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated.
 Turning now to our financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2010. Our revenue in the first quarter was $142.6 million, an increase of 16% from the same quarter last year. This revenue was within our forecasted range of $140 to $146 million, provided during our fourth quarter earnings conference call.
 Our first quarter revenue from Host Products, which are comprised primarily of fibre channel adapters and converge network adapters was $102.5 million and increased 16% from $88.3 million recorded in the first quarter of last year.
 First quarter revenue from Network Products, which comprised primarily of fibre channel and InfiniBand switches was $25.6 million and increased 3% from $25 million recorded in the first quarter of last year.
 Our first quarter revenue from Silicon Products, comprised primarily of fibre channel and iSCSI protocol chips was $11.9 million, consistent with our expectations and increased 60% from $7.4 million recorded in the first quarter of last year. Silicon Products also include chips for embedded applications for converge networks.
 Our revenue from Royalty and Service was $2.6 million, and that consists almost entirely of service revenues.
 Our first quarter gross margin of 66.5% improved from 65.5% recorded in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to higher volume to absorb manufacturing costs. Our gross margin exceeded our forecast provided during the -- during our fourth quarter earnings conference call primarily due to product mix.
 Next, I’d like to cover our first quarter operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $54 million, up 4% from $52.2 million reported in the first quarter of last year. Operating expenses were slightly below our expectation.
 Engineering expenses in the first quarter of $29.7 million increased 2% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 23.7% to 20.8%. We expect feature engineering expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 21%.
 Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of $18.3 million increased 8% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 13.9% to 12.8%. We expect that future sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will range from 11% to 14%.
 G&A expenses in the first quarter of $6 million or 4.2% of revenue. We expected future G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 4%.
 Operating profit in the first quarter of $40.8 million increased 44% from a year ago and increased as a percentage of revenue from 23% to 28.6%. Interest and other income was $1.4 million in the first quarter. Our income tax rate for the first quarter was 17.7%, which was slightly better than our expectation.
 Our first quarter net income of $34.7 million increased 45% from a year ago and represented a net profit margin of 24.3%. Our first quarter net income per diluted share of $0.30 was significantly better than the $0.20 we achieved last year and at the high-end of our forecasted range of $0.27 to $0.30 provided during our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This represents the 60th consecutive quarter of profitability for QLogic.
 Turning now to our balance sheet. The company’s cash and investment securities were $348.6 million at the end of the first quarter. We continue to maintain a strong cash position and have no debt. During the first quarter, we generated $30.6 million of cash from operations.
 During the quarter, we purchased $52.5 million of the company’s common stock at an average price of $18.81 pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Since 2003 we have used $1.5 billion to repurchase 95.4 million shares of the company’s common stock.
 Receivables of $74.6 million at the end of the June quarter increased sequentially from $73.3 million at the end of the March quarter.
 DSO at the end of the June quarter was 48 days, compared to 46 days at the end of the March quarter. We expect DSO in the future will range from 45 to 55 days.
 Inventory at the end of the June quarter was $24.4 million and increased sequentially from $19.4 million at the end of the March quarter. Annualized inventory turns for the June quarter was 7.8 compared to 10 turns for the March quarter. The increase in inventory is entirely associated with advanced purchases of silicon to maintain flexibility due to long lead time.
 Turning now to our outlook for our second quarter, we expect total revenue for the September quarter to be in the range of $143 to $147 million. We expect gross margin for the September quarter to range from 65.5% to 66%.
 Based on this outlook combined with planned operating expenses of approximately $55 million, projected annual tax rate of approximately 18% and diluted share count of approximately 112 million shares, we expect to achieve non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.29 to $0.32 in the September quarter.
 Actual results for future periods may differ materially due to a number of factors including those outlined during the course of this conference call, and the company’s filings with the SEC, and in the disclaimer statement at the end of our earnings press release.
 I’ll now turn the call over to H.K. H.K.?

My remarks today will focus on the current state of our business followed by quality update on strategic initiatives. Our revenue in the first quarter was $142.6 million, a sequential decrease of 2% and approximately at the midpoint of our guidance.
 On a sequential basis, revenue from Host Products declined 1% and revenue from Network Products grew 14%. Revenue from Silicon Products was consistent with our expectation. We achieved an operating margin of 29% and net profit margin of 24%, includes solid gross margin, careful operating expense management and a lower tax. During the first quarter our net income per diluted share was $0.30 at the high-end of our forecasted range of $0.27 to $0.30, provided during our fourth quarter earnings conference call.
 Turning now to the current state of our business. We are encouraged by the plans we experienced during the first fiscal quarter in both our Host and our Network Products families. The several this cycle that began in calendar 2009 is continuing and we expect increasing benefit to our business in the second half of calendar 2010 as our OEM customers complete the introduction of the Nehalem-EX based servers.
 We continue to believe that the new Nehalem-EX based Servers will drive incremental attach of our high performance fibre channel and converge networking products as end users optimize network configurations to maximize the advantages of this very powerful bandwidth-intensive processors.
 QLogic is strongly positioned through a broad product portfolio and leadership positions in the storage area and converge networking market and will be a significant beneficiary of this server of this cycle.
 Now I’ll provide an update on our strategic initiatives. During our first quarter we continue to make significant progress on three strategic initiatives that we have previously discussed, specifically, converge networking, fibre channel and InfiniBand.
 Our investments to date have resulted in new design wins, improved market share and revenue from new markets. We are continuing to invest aggressively in each of these initiatives.
 In the converge networking we made our first major announcement regarding our converge network switching technology with recent unveiling of the new HP Virtual Connect FlexFabric 10Gb/24-port module. Our key element of HP’s converge infrastructure portfolio. HP can now converge Ethernet, Fibre Channel and iSCSI on a single virtual connect module.
 The new QLogic converge network switching ASIC, code name Bullet features industry first flex port technology that enables sports to be dynamically allocated to support Fibre Channel, iSCSI or FCoE data.
 This highly innovated network convergence technology provides variable connectivity options and complex flexibility enabling protocol shift as and when required by users. This important achievement tangibly demonstrates the broadness and depth of our converge networking technology leadership. Our end-to-end portfolio enhances our position as a strategic supplier of converge network to our OEM customers.
 In April, we announced that our 1800 Series converge network adapters are available from Hitachi Data Systems and its authorized reseller worldwide. The 1800 Series are fully qualified and interoperable with the comprehensive Hitachi portfolio of storage systems including the mid-range adaptable module storage 2,000 family and enterprise-class Universal V and VM platforms.
 Also in the quarter Oracle begin revenue shipments for 8100 Series CNAs. We are using the complete server portfolio spanning Oracle Spark M Series Enterprise Servers. Oracle Spark T-Series mid-range and entry level servers and Oracle x64 platforms.
 QLogic is a long-time supplier and development partner of Sun Microsystems, now Oracle and primary provider of the SAN Host products. The addition of QLogic’s converge network adapters with the common fibre channel stack enables Oracle customers to build reliable highly efficient and affordable unified networks.
 We have now successfully deployed our converged networking solutions with all leading server and storage vendors, including IBM, Systemax, IBM Blade Center, NetApp, EMC, IBM Power Systems, Dell, HP, Cisco, Hitachi, Oracle and our QLogic branded version of our worldwide channel partners.
 These customers are now providing and useful -- and there are the useful benefits of network convergence by deploying QLogic’s fully qualified and OEM deployed storage and Ethernet stack with QLogic’s own cost effective highly integrated single chip ASIC technology.
 Our early investment and clear time to market advantage has resulted in converged market leadership. During the first fiscal quarter, our revenue from products serving the converge networking market, which include all products based on 10-gig Ethernet connectivity was $10 million.
 The vast majority of this revenue is included in our Host Products and a small amount included in our Silicon Products where we sold ASIC for Host applications. This $10 million revenue excludes our very minor amount of revenue from our converged networks switching parts. Dell’Oro Group estimates that this market will be approximately $200 million in Canada, 2010, growing at a compound annual rate in excess of 40% for the next four years.
 Turning now to Fibre Channel. According to the Dell’Oro Group, calendar Q1 2010 SAN report, the most recent report published QLogic extended its market leadership in SAN adapters. With 55.2% revenue market share for Fibre Channel adapters, we increase our market shared by 2.1 percentage points over the prior quarter and increase our lead to a total of 19.1 percentage points ahead of our nearest competitor.
 We maintain our number one positions in every adapter category including Standard, Mezzanine, 4-gig and 8-gig adapters. In a move designed to expand its addressable market for high performance enterprise class storage systems, Oracle also selected QLogic over 8-gig Fibre Channel adapter supplier for its Sun Storage 7000 systems, also known as Amber Road. We continue engage with Oracle with a broad portfolio product offerings.
 Turning now toward InfiniBand initiative. In May we announced that our QDR InfiniBand Host Channel adapters will be available from Voltaire as part of the portfolio of end-to-end QDR InfiniBand solutions. Voltaire is offering a 7300 Series HCAs alongside its Grid Director line of QDR InfiniBand switches and software.
 This ensures that QLogic HCAs are interoperable with an increasing number of high-performance computing cluster configurations and provides greater flexibility for InfiniBand customers. This also marks the continued expansion of our InfiniBand Solutions in HPC marketplace.
 In May we also announced our InfiniBand Fabric Management Suite version 6.0. This important release integrates industry leading intelligent features for InfiniBand network management and optimisms for high performance work loads at scale with minimal intervention from system administrators with a goal of improving efficiency of both people and hardware ultimately leading to greater productivity.
 In summary, our focus in the right set of strategic initiatives is yielding tangible results which will continue to benefit us for the remainder of fiscal 2011 and beyond. First, the serve update cycle which commenced in 2009 is continuing and will benefit us as a result of our market leading positions in Fibre Channel adapters.
 Second, our Network Products are experiencing revenue growth and capturing market share for Fibre Channel and InfiniBand switches.
 Finally, in the converge networking market, based on our time-to-market advantage, technology superiority end-to-end portfolio and the broad adoptions by Tier 1 OEM customers, shipping our products today we expect to further extend or lead as enterprise transition to converge networks.
 This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, now we’re open for the questions.

And clearly we expect people to deploy 8-gig as they deploy next generation sort of that are going to be in the data center for the number of years or we expect them to deploy 10-big based converge networking technology.

 We did see something of a slowdown in Europe at the very end of the quarter and I’d characterize that as being just the last month of the quarter specific to the Host business and then we also saw weakness with one specific OEM as well. So, whilst server trends that we’ve seen from those OEMs we managed over the course of the last three months have been very positive. And whilst there were trends with those OEMs have been very consistent with their sort of a server performance, that’s not true across the board.

 And then as we have explained in the past, the objectivity would be move right of that path of the converged market, into the much broader converged market which includes 10 gig Ethernet and Converged Network Adapter type technologies. So, as we’ve executed on the converged technologies and as our Ethernet stacks have become qualified, proven, hardened and ultimately deployed by end users, we have been able to establish credibility as a supplier for that technology and it becomes a logical extension to the OEMs of everything what we’re doing with them.

I want to go back to this earlier question around kind of transition that one of your competitors is seeing, adapter card, silicon. I clearly understand your position to market and having a diversified portfolio with silicon adapters and mass card kind of business, but obviously depending on the mix of those segments, there is an impact on the model, impact on the ASPs and march gin. My question is, is the pace of the shift relative to what you’re seeing out there on the MEZ side or the lump silicon side, is it accelerating towards silicon in the short run at a faster pace than you would expect. Is this transition happening in line with the timing that you would expect? Give us an update relative to…

 So, I’m not sure there is a disconnect between the underlying server market and our business at this point in time. What we are seeing, as I said in my comments earlier, when I look at the major OEMs and the announcements that they have made, let’s say over the course of the last 90 days about their server business performance. Our performance with each of those OEMs essentially is very consistent with the numbers that they have talked about, right? So it’s a - We do their revenues and if they tell us their units that is even more helpful. If you look at change they have experienced in the units and revenues versus the change I’ve seen in my Host business, it is actually very tightly correlated.

I think what you have to look at the total market sizing, okay? And when we look at the total market sizing for the adapters, within the converged market, this year that’s roughly, let’s say it is a $200 million market and that is still our most recent number that H.K. made reference to, okay? The 10-gig adapter market in the first calendar quarter was $50 million. So the $200 million trajectory feels very appropriate and that is expected to grow in rate specs as a 40% over the course of the next four years and you end up with a market that is roughly 8 to $10 million when you get to 2014. Okay.
 We’re very comfortable with that sizing of the market. We understand the ASP assumptions. We understand the unit assumptions. Okay? So let say it is $800 million when you get out to 2014. As H.K. said, when you look at the converged chip, converged LOM opportunity that exists when you get out to the same time frame, it is a small fraction of the total adapter revenue. So there is still going to be an enormous back to market that is well in excess of the expectation for the chip market when you move forward over the course of the next few years.

 We’re coming from a lower revenue. The second one is we never believe in and we never thought that IB is going to be data center converge interphase. We always see it’s going to be reconnect and that’s why we are investing lot into that converge network market and that’s where our focus is. IB is really, we believe it’s going to be very specific component of the HPC markets and that’s where we are focusing. So our strategy is exactly always like that.

I’m delighted that H.K. and the entire Board of Directors have shown confidence in my ability to lead QLogic in the coming years. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the significant incremental opportunities in the emerging converged network end market. I’m excited to assume leadership of the company at this important time in our industry. I plan to continue the strategies outlined at our recent Analyst Day, maintaining our focus on customers, execution, and financial discipline.
I will now discuss our second quarter financial results. In our second quarter earnings press release issued early today, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, and a summary of the non-GAAP adjustments are included in our earnings press release. All of the references we will make on our call today relate to non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated.
Turning now to our financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended September 26, 2010. Our revenue in the second quarter was $146.5 million, an increase of 11% from the same quarter last year. This revenue was at the high end of our forecasted range of $143 million to $147 million provided during our first quarter earnings conference call and at the midpoint of our updated forecasted range of $146 million to $147 million provided in our preliminary second quarter results announced on October, the 7.
Our second quarter revenue from Host Products, which comprised primarily of Fibre Channel adapters and converged network adapters was $104.2 million, and increased 11% from $94 million recorded in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter revenue from Network Products, which are comprised primarily of Fibre Channel and InfiniBand switches was $27.2 million and increased 11% from $24.5 million recorded in the second quarter of last year.
Our second quarter revenue from Silicon Products comprised of Fibre Channel, converged networking, and iSCSI chips was $12.4 million. This revenue was consistent with our expectation and increased 30% from $9.6 million recorded in the second quarter of last year. Our service and other revenue was $2.7 million. Our second quarter gross margin of 66.8% improved from 65.5% recorded in the second quarter of last year, primarily due to higher volume to absorb manufacturing costs. Our gross margin exceeded our forecast of 65.5% to 66% provided during our first quarter earnings call, primarily due to product mix.
Next I’d like to cover our second quarter operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $53.6 million, up 1% from $52.8 million reported in the second quarter last year. Operating expenses were below our expectation. Engineering expenses in the second quarter of $28.8 million decreased 3% from a year ago and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 22.6% to 19.7%. We expect future engineering expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 21%.
Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter of $18.5 million increased 7% from a year ago, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 13.1% to 12.6%. We expect that future sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will range from 11% to 13%. G&A expenses in the second quarter of $6.3 million were 4.3% of revenue. We expect that future G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 4%. Operating profit in the second quarter of $44.3 million increased 33% from a year ago, and increased as a percentage of revenue from 25.3% to 30.2%. Interest and other income was $1.8 million in the second quarter. Our income tax rate for the second quarter was 20.6% due to certain discreet items. We continue to expect our annual tax rate to be approximately 18%.
Our second quarter net income of $36.6 million increased 46% from a year-ago and represented a net profit margin of 25%. Our second quarter net income per diluted share of $0.34 was significantly better than the $0.21 we achieved last year. In addition, we beat the high end of our forecasted range of $0.29 to $0.32 provided during the first quarter earnings call and also exceeded the $0.32 to $0.33 range provided in our preliminary second quarter results announcement. This represents the 61st consecutive quarter of profitability for QLogic.
Turning now to our balance sheet. The company’s cash and investment securities were $304 million at the end of the second quarter. We continue to maintain a strong cash position and have no debt. During the second quarter, we generated $26.6 million of cash from operations. In August, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $200 million of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase programs. During the quarter, we purchased $70.9 million of the company’s common stock at an average price of $16.23. Since 2003, we have used nearly $1.6 billion to purchase 99.7 million shares of the company’s common stock.
Receivables of $86.4 million at the end of September quarter increased sequentially from $74.6 million at the end of the June quarter. DSO at the end of the September quarter was 54 days. The linearity of revenue during the September quarter was consistent with the prior quarter. DSO for the second quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter. We expect DSO in the future will range from 50 to 55 days. Inventory at the end of the September quarter was $24.9 million and increased slightly from $24.4 million at the end of the June quarter. Annualized inventory turns for the September quarter was 7.8, consistent with the June quarter.
Turning now to our outlook for our third quarter. It is clear to us that the trends we commented on during our first quarter earnings conference call 90 days ago have continued, and the recovery is in fact weaker than had been expected. This now causes us to moderate our near-term expectations. Although October is off to a good start, we expect total revenue for the December quarter to be in the range of $148 million to $156 million. We expect gross margins to range from 66% to 66.5%.
When combined with planned operating expenses of approximately $55 million, a projected annual tax rate of approximately 18%, and a diluted share count of approximately 108 million shares, we expect to achieve non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.34 to $0.38 in the December quarter. Actual results for future periods may differ materially due to a number of factors including those outlined during the course of this conference call, in the company’s filings with the SEC, and in the disclaimer statement at the end of our earnings press release.
I will now turn the call over to H.K. H.K?

My comments today will build on themes discussed at our recently held Analyst Day in New York. We’ll discuss our performance within the framework of our unmatched foundation, world-class execution and our winning strategy.
First, we are pleased with our financial execution and discipline. Our revenue in the second quarter was $146.5 million, a sequential increase of 3%, and at the high end of the guidance we provided during our first quarter earnings call. On a sequential basis, revenue from Host Products grew 2%, revenue from Network Products grew 6% and revenue from Silicon Products grew 5%.
We are also very pleased to have achieved an operating margin of 30.2%, and a net profit margin of 25% during the second quarter, driven by higher than expected gross margin and lower than expected operating expenses.
During the second quarter, our net income per diluted share was $0.34, higher than our forecasted range of $0.29 to $0.32, provided during our first quarter earning conference call. At our recent Analyst Day, we detailed our Adaptive Convergence strategy and offered proof points to the strategy’s yielding winning results. We want to share some of the highlights and accomplishments that we think were clear indicator of the progress we have made in expanding our market opportunities as well as keeping proper focus on our traditional markets.
Our early investments in convergence and our time-to-market advantage for converged products have resulted in leadership positions in two important markets. On August 12, we announced that according to new data published by the Dell’Oro Group in its Q2 2010 SAN Adapter Report, QLogic was the leader of the 10-gig converged network adapter market with over 58% revenue market share for calendar Q2 2010.This represents a lead over our nearest competitor of 18.5 percentage points. This percentage of share split slightly exceeds our Fibre Channel SAN adapter market leadership, also reinforcing the power and leverage of our Fibre Channel market position.
On August 23, we announced that according to more new data published by the Dell’Oro Group in its Q2 2010 Network Adapter Report, QLogic took over the number two position for the first time with 15.7% revenue share in the 10-gig adapter market, second only to Intel for the quarter, and tied for number one imports. QLogic was the only company to have gained market share for five consecutive quarters. This market is a significant incremental expansion opportunity for QLogic.
Further strengthening our offering in converged networking, we recently launched the industry’s first third generation 10-gig converged networking portfolio named 3GCNA. Based on our industry leading and broadly deployed Network Plus Architecture, the portfolio features a trio of new products, including our 8200 Series 10-gig converged network adapters, our 3200 Series 10-gig intelligent Ethernet adapters, and our converged LAN-on-motherboard solution. These products feature a number of industry-first for the converged networking market, including the first product with the ability to run Fibre Channel over Ethernet, iSCSI, and Ethernet traffic concurrently. This is also the first product to perform switch-agnostic VM-to-VM communications within physical machines and the first product to deploy quad 1-gig and dual 10-gig ports from a single chip using our advanced FlexLOM technology.
The 3GCNA portfolio is the first launch under QLogic’s recently unveiled Adaptive Convergence strategy. This strategy builds on the success of the company’s leadership positions and introduce four key flexible business enabling interconnect capabilities; ConvergeFlex being Concurrent Protocol Processing Services; VMflex being Advanced Virtualization Services; FlexOffload being Multiple Protocol Offload Services, and SecureFlex being Data Security Services. The new products address the increasing complex requirements of virtualized data centers, cloud service providers, and the converged enterprise. All of these environments will require 10-gig line rate throughput for virtualized data and storage traffic, support from concurrent Ethernet, FCoE and iSCSI, and low CPU utilization to allow for a high mobility of VMs.
During the quarter, we saw further success with our converged switching technology. Our Bullet ASIC is now shipping and HP-3Com recently announced 5820 Series top-of-rack products. Using our Bullet ASIC, HP-3Com can take advantage of our highly innovative flex port technology that enables ports to be dynamically allocated to support Fibre Channel, iSCSI, or FCoE data. This product further strengthens our converged product portfolio with HP.
Our InfiniBand momentum continued in the HPC space with the deployment of end-to-end QLogic TrueScale products at Lawrence Livermore National Labs. This high profile installation of a Dell supercomputing systems code-named Sierra is expected to rank in the top 20 of the world’s most powerful supercomputers on the top 500 list. InfiniBand is the fastest growing server interconnect technology in the top 500. Our traditional storage area networking markets continue to be a very important business for us. We’ll continue investment in products for the SAN market for many years to come.
Late last month, we announced our full support for the 16-gig Fibre Channel standards, which was ratified by the ANSI Technical Committee and announced by the Fibre Channel Industry Association. We’ll be offering a complete portfolio of 16-gig Fibre Channel host and switch products, providing SAN users a doubling of the bandwidth with backward compatibility to 8-gig and 4-gig products. Maintaining and growing our market share in Fibre Channel adapters continues to be an important priority for us. The media 2010 check point in the Fibre Channel adapter market share is encouraging. Based on the most recently published Dell’Oro data, our revenue market share in Fibre Channel adapters for the first half of calendar 2010 is substantially the same as our full year 2009 share.
Our market share remains at just over 54%, while our closest competitor has lost over a point. We’ll continue to stay focused on share growth for the remainder of the calendar 2010, and drive toward achieving a seventh consecutive year of share leadership and growth, as well as further expanding our base of over 8.5 million ports shipped. This install base is a significant competitive advantage for us as user transition to converged products.
In summary, we have an unmatched foundation for success, world-class execution, and winning strategy. While it is clear to us that the recovery is weaker than had been expected. We strongly believe that our market leadership in established and emerging markets, our relentless focus on execution, our continuous innovation and aggressive investment position us well for the future.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, now we are open for questions.

I think, as we look at what we see, as we said in our prepared remarks, October is off to a good start, but the recovery is certainly weaker than people have expected. I think we’re a little concerned that server numbers do continue to erode. I think even in the most recent Gartner numbers in this morning the performance of the server market last quarter was lower than people had expected it to be. So when we look at the underlying markets and the data associated with those underlying markets, it’s certainly not as robust as people had expected it to be. So clearly having no desire as a company to catch a falling knife, we have put forth what we believe to be the right guidance, if it proves to have been cautious at the end of the day then that’s appropriate. I think, if you look back 90 days, Kaushik, we thought at that time and indicated on the earnings call then that things probably weren’t as robust as everybody believed they were, and we said we were being cautious, and we were able to deliver the high end of the guidance that we provided them. So hopefully, we’ve put ourselves in exactly the same position again, but only time will tell.

I think there’s a handful of different data points right, so it’s broadly understood that the principal competitor owns substantially all of the IBM power activity for fibre channel, and that our position is a converged position as opposed to fibre channel position. If you look at what normally happens from a seasonal perspective, this quarter is always extraordinarily strong for that part of IBM’s business. So, I would expect that my principal competitor would see better performance primarily associated with that specific IBM activity in the fourth calendar quarter, and I think you’ll find that typically plays out. As it relates to HBAs, I think you are right. I think if you look at what Intel said about what it was seeing within the datacenter, they implied that datacenter growth last quarter was about 3%, but within the context of that, the cloud was very strong, enterprise therefore probably being a little bit weaker. I think the enterprise market at this point in time probably is a little weaker and that’s the color that we tried to provide around the trends that we are seeing for the fibre channel market. Our ability to participated in the cloud; we went through it in detail at the Analyst Day. It depends what the cloud means to you, private clouds, public clouds, fibre channel is an important part of certain private clouds today. As we move forward 10-gig Ethernet and the investments that we’ve made there are a critical part of how we are going to be successful in the cloud and concept of the cloud more generally. So, every investment we make today, whether it’s a fibre channel or a 10-gig Ethernet, it’s important within the context of how QLogic will participate in the converged enterprise, will participate in virtualized data centers and will participate in cloud environments as well.

So we continue to be very happy with the general trajectory of our InfiniBand business. We would always tell you its lumpy, as our nearest competitor in that market have seen in recent quarters as well. Individual transactions can cause that business to move up and down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There could be many millions of dollars worth of IB in any individual installation and that can cause lumpiness in the business. So, now we’re pleased.
