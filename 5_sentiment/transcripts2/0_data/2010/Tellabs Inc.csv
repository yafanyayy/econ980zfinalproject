Despite tough economic times, Tellabs performed well, both in the fourth quarter and in 2009. As we sit here and we begin 2010, we see that our innovations are helping customers and our companies exceed. As we visit customers, they're giving us positive responses as to how we improve their networks, increase the revenue, lower their expenses and improve profitability. Today, I'll provide a high-level look at both the fourth quarter and our 2009 results. Then I'll summarize our progress in advancing Tellabs' strategy towards profitable revenue growth. And then I'll pass it over to Tim, and Tim's going to give you more detailed results.First of all, in the fourth quarter, Tellabs landed squarely in the middle of our guidance at $389 million in revenue. And on a GAAP basis, $0.16 a share and on a non-GAAP basis, $0.09 a share. Tellabs is growing our Ethernet and Internet Protocol data space. It's demonstrated by our fourth quarter data revenue, which was up 10% sequentially and 52% year-over-year. It was our second best data quarter ever. Fourth quarter Transport revenue was up 4% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. It was driven by the strength of the Tellabs 7100 system, which customers are deploying around the world as I'll comment in a moment. We also had a slight uptick in our Tellabs 5500 system, which also contributed to our fourth quarter Transport revenue being up. Our Services business is up as well. Fourth quarter Services revenue was up 17% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. It could be a leading indicator of some positive trends moving forward. Our growth products generated almost half of our overall fourth quarter revenue or roughly 48%. This is an ongoing trend where we believe over time our growth products including this year will eclipse our core products. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP gross profit margins rose to 45.5%, up from roughly 42% or 41.9% in the third quarter. These were Tellabs' highest gross margins in over three years. This is consistent with our strategy, the management team to improve our profitability over time. And this is a strong indicator of trends to come here in 2010.Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $49 million. This was also one of our highest at 12.6% of revenue. As a percent of revenue, our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margins were the highest since the third quarter of 2006. At 9% of revenue, our fourth quarter GAAP operating margins were the highest since the third quarter of 2006 as well. This is our best profitability in over three years and we're proud of the trends that we're pursuing here at Tellabs.On a GAAP basis, our fourth quarter earnings as I mentioned, were $0.16 a share compared with $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of '08. Our fourth quarter GAAP earnings, of course include a tax benefit that Tim is going to talk about here in a moment of roughly $0.06 a share. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned a solid $0.09 per share. Now let's look at our 2009 annual results.We've made tremendous progress on improving profitability during 2009. We controlled the things within our control. Although our annual revenue was down by over $200 million or 12%, our non-GAAP operating income increased by $43 million or 39%. Our decisions to reduce investments in unprofitable businesses paid off. Our operating income in 2008 was $109 million and in 2009 was roughly $152 million. It manifested itself in both positive GAAP and non-GAAP comparisons of 2008 versus 2009. On a GAAP basis, in 2009, we earned $0.29 a share versus 2008, which was a loss of $2.32 a share, dominantly by a one-time write-off of goodwill. In our non-GAAP 2009, we earned $0.30 a share versus $0.26 a share in 2008.We increased our annual non-GAAP gross profit margins from 38.5% in 2008 to 43.9% in 2009. And we reduced our annual operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis from $556 million in 2008 to $517 million last year, all are positive trends. We also did a good job of managing our inventories down. Total inventories decreased by 49 million year-over-year. We went from $177 million at the end of '08 to $128 million at the end of '09. These are also positive trends, increasing turns ratios and so on. We generated $234 million in cash from operations during 2009. This enabled us to pay $165 million net of cash for our new merger and acquisition with WiChorus. And spend roughly $83 million or $82.9 million to purchase 12.9 million Tellabs' shares. All in all and most important, we advanced our strategy for profitable revenue growth.Now we're relentless about profitable revenue growth. We're turning the tides here at Tellabs. We're more focused on wireless and mobile markets. We expanded in the mobile packet core market with the WiChorus acquisition. This is the intelligence linking subscribers to the public Internet in the mobile market. And we see tremendous opportunity to lead in the mobile Internet. And when we say mobile Internet, we're talking about the confluence of events of the smartphone, 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G and the trend toward mobility and the personalized web. We believe over time the personalized web is going to create big demand both in bandwidth and new services and revenue opportunities for our customers.During the fourth quarter, Tellabs recognized our first WiChorus revenue from the platforms. We are now marketing at the Tellabs 9000 SmartCore platform. The Tellabs 9000 SmartCore platform now has five service provider customers and while I mentioned last time, we had 10 trials, we're now on 15 customer trials, including our U.S. customer. We're more focused on growth products. As we shared with you in the previous earnings calls, we focused and shifted our investment from our core products to our growth products in research and development. And growth products were 46% of 2009 revenue. That was up from 36% in 2008. In 2010, we expect growth products to generate more than half of our revenue. And of course in the fourth quarter, our growth products were roughly 48% of our total revenue. We're more focused on Ethernet and IP products. We achieved a record data revenue in 2009 and we expect further growth in 2010.Today, we're also announcing a restructuring. It's going to affect about 200 employees over the next five quarters. The restructuring shifts more investment from Time Division technology to Ethernet and Internet Protocol products. We're also shifting our skills set, its improving our Ethernet, Internet Protocol and mobile packet core skill sets company-wide. We're also moving our supply chain closer to our suppliers and we're reducing general and administrative expenses. These are all necessary changes that will continue on the transformation of Tellabs. Even though this is one of the smallest restructurings we've announced in previous years. That said, even though we're reducing these headcount, we expect Tellabs' overall headcount to increase during 2010, as we invest in our growth areas, namely markets outside the United States, as well as in Ethernet and IP products in our optical networking, in our data networking, in our business services delivery and in our professional services.In 2009, we're more successful with our optical products. We achieved record revenue for the Tellabs 7100 system by winning customers in all of our regions around the world. And I'm happy to say gross profit margins on the Tellabs 7100 improved in each quarter of 2009 quarter-over-quarter. We're more international.We continue to invest in international markets. And our percentage from international revenue has grown to 34% of our overall revenue, which is up from 32% in 2008. We're winning new customers. Our book-to-bill ratio is above one. During the fourth quarter, we won new customers for the Tellabs 7100 system, both in Asia Pacific and in North America. We also won two new customers for the 8600 in Latin America. We recognized our first revenue from three new Tellabs 7100 customers in Latin America and Asia Pacific. We recognized revenue from three new 8600 customers in both Latin America and our region in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We also recognized revenue from two new customers on the Tellabs 8800 system, both in North America and in Europe, the Middle East and Africa region and our Latin America region, all positive trends in Tellabs' transformation. We're more profitable. Our annual gross profit margins at the highest since 2006. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are at the lowest since 2004. We're proud of that. The management team is focused on the things we can control in our business.Our non-GAAP annual operating income increased, as I said, $43 million or 39% in 2009. And at 10%, our non-GAAP annual operating margin was the highest since 2006. Now we're laser beam focused on top line revenue growth and our underlying profitable revenue growth. As you heard from us before, we're financially strong. Our balance sheet includes more than $1.1 billion cash and equivalents, including after paying $165 million in net cash for WiChorus and repurchasing about $83 million in Tellabs shares during 2009. And as all of you know, we have zero debt. I also have some exciting news to announce to all of you. This is all with the goal of looking out for another way of looking out for our shareholders. Tellabs is announcing a new quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, which yields about 1.3% in our current, recent stock price of around $6 a share. We believe that dividends are a good way to return capital to Tellabs' shareholders. We're confident that Tellabs will continue to generate cash from operations. And we believe that sufficient to both invest in growth of our business, repurchase shares and pay dividends. Tellabs' plans to continue its share repurchase during 2010. And as I mentioned, we're going to annualize and pay out, our intent is to payout a quarterly dividend as voted on and approved by our Board of Directors. While we've achieved many positive changes over the past year, we're only going to be satisfied when we achieve profitable year-over-year revenue growth. Tellabs is going to continue to innovate to make both our company and our customers successful.Tomorrow we're going to do even more for them. We're going to focus on making them successful in the mobile Internet as this revolution goes forward. When we focus, we'll win. We're already seeing positive signs from our recent merger and acquisition with WiChorus. We're seeing increased trials and customer interest. I just came off of an annual sales meeting where our sales force is excited. In fact, they've already talked about winning new customers realtime during the sales meeting. And so with that, I'm going to turn it over for more of the details with Tim."

I'm sure you noticed the change in the way we delivered our earnings release this morning instead of e-mailing the complete 13-page document, we e-mailed a shorter, a short notification to the wire services on you [ph] for the hyperlink that leads to our tellabs.com website, where the complete earnings release resides. Given the length of our earnings release, this new delivery method significantly reduces our wire service cost. And I'd be Interested in hearing any feedback you might have on this change. Today's earnings release contains all the normal year-over-year comparisons, as well as a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. In my remarks this morning, I'm going to provide some additional insights where I think it's a helpful addition to the year-over-year data.First, let's take a look at the fourth quarter numbers. After that, I'll make some observations about our full year 2009 performance and update you on our guidance for the first quarter of 2010.Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 amounted to $389 million, which was consistent with the third quarter of '09. We saw sequential growth in the Transport and Services segments, which were offset by lower overall Broadband segment revenue. Looking a little deeper into the Broadband segment, sequential growth in data and managed access revenue was offset by lower access revenue. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 amounted to $62 million or $0.16 earnings per share. That's a little more than double the $29 million we recorded in the third quarter of '09, and up nearly fivefold from the $12.8 million or $0.03 a share we recorded in the fourth quarter of '08. On a non-GAAP basis, net income excluding pretax charges for special items, was $36 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter of '09. If you're wondering why our non-GAAP net income is less than our GAAP net income, it's due to a tax benefit that impacts only our GAAP expenses, as I'll explain more fully when we talk about taxes. Okay, if you take $36 million in non-GAAP net income and subtract $5 million for equity-based comp to be consistent with the way FirstCo [ph] compiles and reports estimates for Tellabs, the result is $0.08 and non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter of '09. On a geographic basis, revenue from customers outside North America grew to account a 34% of the total revenue in the fourth quarter compared with 30% in the prior quarter. Let's take a look at the segment data for the fourth quarter.Broadband segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $191 million compared with $206 million in the prior quarter. As I said on a sequential basis, growth in data and managed access product revenue was offset by a decline in access revenue. Specifically, data revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $90 million. That's up 10% from $82 million in the third quarter of 2009 and up 52% from $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. At $90 million in revenue, the fourth quarter marks our second highest level of data revenue. The strength we saw in sales of these products into North American wireless applications in the third quarter of 2009 continued into the fourth quarter. In all, data continues to be our fastest growing product category. For the full year 2009, data revenue totaled $342 million, up 59% from $215 million in 2008. Total revenue for the data category in the fourth quarter also includes our first contribution from the Tellabs 9000 SmartCore platform that came to us via the WiChorus acquisition that closed early last month. While the revenue we were able to recognize from the SmartCore platform for December was negligible, shipments in the fourth quarter were solid. On a full-year 2009 basis, shipments were solidly within the $6 million to $8 million forecast that we gave you in December.Turning to managed access category, revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 came in at $45 million, up 19% from $38 million in the prior quarter. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8100 and 6300 system was up on a sequential basis as anticipated, driven by an uptick from some of our traditional customers in the Nordic region and projects in India. Access revenue was $56 million in the fourth quarter compared with $86 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by an anticipated sequential decline in sales of single-family ONTs. Taking all that into account, Broadband segment profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $44 million compared with $50 million in the third quarter of this year. Segment profit declined, primarily as a result of higher research and development costs.In the Transport segment, revenue was $133 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, up 4% from the prior quarter, and increased revenue from cross-connects and voice-quality enhancement systems. Transport segment profit driven primarily by the higher level of revenue from voice quality and Digital Cross-Connect Systems and lower research and development costs was $45 million in the fourth quarter, up 55% from $29 million in the third quarter of '09. Like the data products, our voice-quality enhancement and Digital Cross-Connect Systems carry gross margins better than the corporate average. Services segment revenue was $65 million in 4Q, up 17% from $55 million in the prior quarter. Services segment profit amounted to $23 million, up from $20 million in the third quarter of '09. On a portfolio basis, revenue from the growth products, which includes the Tellabs 6300 transport system, the Tellabs 7100 Optical Transport system, Tellabs 8600 and 8800 data products, professional services and the recently acquired Tellabs 9000 SmartCore platform, grew in the fourth quarter to account for 48% of total revenue compared with 45% in the third quarter of '09, while core products contributed the balance of the revenue in each period. On a gross margin basis, non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter was better than anticipated at 45.5%, compared with 41.9% in the prior quarter. Gross margin is dependent upon product and customer mix, contributing to the favorable shift this quarter was about two points related to lower level of revenue from single-family ONTs, which carry gross margins lower than corporate average.A little more than a point of improvement related to profitability improvements in our Tellabs 7100 Optical Networking system. We've been diligent about proving optical networking profitability and have done so in aid of the last 11 quarters. And by the way, the story is the same for the single-family ONTs, where even improved profitability in eight of the last 11 quarters as well. The balance of the improvement in gross margin came from a higher level of Tellabs' revenue from Tellabs 5500 cross-connect products. Let's take a look at operating expenses.Total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis came in at $128 million, just above $127 million we recorded in the third quarter of 2009. With $1.1 million representing expenses attributable to WiChorus, which became part of Tellabs in early December. In the fourth quarter of 2009, non-GAAP R&D expenses came in at $66 million or almost 17% of revenue. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $62 million. Other income amounted to $4 million in the fourth quarter compared with $5 million in the prior quarter. Our tax provision on non-GAAP pretax income from the quarter was $17 million for an effective rate of 32%. Our GAAP results included a tax benefit of $23.4 million compared with the $17 million tax expense for non-GAAP. A number of items affected this difference. The largest was a $24 million tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances relating to the accounting for the WiChorus acquisition.  Looking ahead, we expect our effective non-GAAP tax rate for 2010 to be about 32%. Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter, we generated $60 million in positive cash from operations. On a full-year basis, positive cash from operations totaled $234 million. CapEx was about $21 million in the quarter and $46 million for the full year. You can expect 2010 CapEx to be similar to 2009. Day sales outstanding dropped to 61 days from 63 in the prior quarter. Inventory turns were 5.9x versus 6.2 in the third quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory in terms of dollars was at $128 million, compared with $127 million at the end of 3Q, and down $49 million from $177 million at the end of 2008. During the quarter, we purchased 3.4 million shares of our stock at a cost of about $21 million. Looking at the full year, we purchased 13 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $83 million. The actual number of shares outstanding at quarter's end was about 384 million. Our headcount at the end of the quarter stood at 3,300, which reflects the addition of about 100 employees from WiChorus. As Rob mentioned, book-to-bill for the quarter was above one.Looking at the full year that just passed, in 2009 total revenue reflecting industry conditions and the decisions we made in early 2008 to reduce investment in unprofitable businesses was $1.5 billion compared with $1.7 billion in 2008. Non-GAAP gross margin for the full year was 43.9%. That's up 5.4 points from 2008, an improved product mix and profitability improvements. Total non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $517 million. That's $39 million less than 2008 and better than the $520 million target we set for ourselves in the beginning of 2008. So on revenue that was down 12% in 2009, we delivered $152 million in non-GAAP operating income, which represents a 39% improvement compared with $109 million in 2008. And on a full-year basis, cash flow from operations was strong at $234 million.Turning to our outlook for the first quarter this year, based on our orders in 4Q backlog and given the overall market conditions, we're guiding for first quarter revenue to be in the range or to be about $370 million, plus or minus 2%. Near term, we expect gross margins in the first quarter to be up from 45.5% in the fourth quarter to 48.5%, plus or minus a point or two, depending again on product mix. This improvement is being driven from an anticipated favorable product mix in Q1.Looking further out, we have more uncertainty. But we expect full-year 2010 gross margins to be up over 2009 in the mid-40s range, depending again on product and customer mix. We expect non-GAAP OpEx for the first quarter to be in the low $130 million range, which includes expenses related from the WiChorus acquisition. In addition, we expect the effect of expensing equity-based compensation in the first quarter will be about $5 million, split between operating expense and cost of goods sold. For the recap, we made good progress in the fourth quarter and throughout 2009. We made significant improvements to gross margin, operating expenses and operating income. We expanded our presence in the mobile Internet market. We continued to generate cash and return some of that capital to our shareholders via stock buyback. And we're confident enough in the business to initiate our first cash dividend. Having said all that, we'll open the floor to your questions. Tonia, we're ready for the first question.********************************************************************************************************We expanded our presence in the mobile Internet market.

We estimate cash payments under this plan to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million beginning in the first quarter of 2010. I think really what's fundamentally different from this restructure from others is, as Rob mentioned, we expect to end the year with more employees than we start.  So we have an estimated savings from this action but we expect to reinvest it. We do expect to see our OpEx above our 2009 levels, as a result of the reinvestment in the WiChorus acquisition."

We think we can improve gross margins year-on-year. We're continuing to work on things like the mix. We're also working on cost reductions and other efficiencies. But based on what we know today, we thought it would be unfair to our investors to say that we expect to be able to maintain these margins throughout the year. So we're not sure if you'd asked me what my margin was going to be in Q1, and I was out on the street in early December, I would never have forecasted or thought we were going to roll up to 48 1/2.

We're innovators in integrating the Ethernet over optical layer. We're selling the 7100 all over the world. And furthermore, we're doing a unique thing, which is we're cannibalizing router ports. Were saving 50% of CapEx on router ports for customers doing low-speed Layer 2 or Ethernet aggregation in the optical layer. With the trend we continue to see around the world that adds a lot of value and with the increased public and private IP networking, including Virtual Private Networks, we believe that, that low-speed Ethernet aggregation over the optical layer is going to be a winner over time.

So just imagine for a moment if that business was humming along, and certainly that business is directly related to consumer spend and housing starts and/or people moving between houses. So I think that business is softer than in a number of markets and our customers would like to see. So we're going to start the year with a fairly low level as our customers adjust to inventory and change some of their marketing. I think we expect that business to pick up as we get into the warmer terms of the year and new marketing initiatives are out and inventories are adjusted. But having said that, we could still expect the ONT shipments to be down. They were about three quarters of a million [ph] products shipped. They would be down again this year as the customer moves towards a different technology there and spend past the majority of the homes. So we still are very active in the Access business and our other product lines. I think we're about to start about some of those opportunities. So we'll continue to work on those. We've made great investments there, we have good customer relationships, we see some potential tailwinds coming from the government spend in that area.

Tellabs is helping customers succeed with the mobile internet. We achieved our goal of profitable revenue growth in the first quarter, including record revenue from our growth products.
Our first quarter 2010 revenue increased to $380 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter. Our growth product continue to gain traction, a record of 57% of our first quarter 2010 revenue came from our growth products and services. That's up from 39% in the first quarter of 2009.
Also positively, data revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $131 million, that put us at the high-end of our revenue and our gross margin guidance. We saw strong customer demand for mobile solutions. Revenue for all three data products Tellabs 8600, 8800, and 9100, increased both year-over-year and sequentially. It was a positive sign.
Our first quarter cash flow enabled us to invest 18% of revenue into -- back into research and development, to pay our first cash dividend in February and add cash to our balance sheet.
In 2010 about 85% of our R&D investment is going into our growth products that was around 50% in 2007. We continue to improve Tellabs profitability and generate cash. GAAP gross profit margins improved to 50.7% from 44.2% a year ago. That was marking Tellabs highest gross profit margins in the last 22 quarters, that since third quarter of 2004.
GAAP operating earnings were $36 million, up from $9 million a year ago. GAAP net earnings were at $46 million, up from $7 million a year ago.
We delivered GAAP EPS of $0.12 that was up from $0.02 a year ago. We generated $63 million in cash from operations in the first quarter of 2010. And we added $42 million in cash to our balance sheet in the Q1. We now hold $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalence and liquid financial instruments and of course, we have no debt.
Our strategy to innovate in growth markets such as mobile internet is working well. We are adding new customers around the world due to our growth products. We received great customer feedback on our mobile internet solutions during Mobile World Congress and CTIA.
I was at Mobile World Congress for example and we met with the Chief Technology Officer of a Tier 1 service provider. He found the value proposition of the SmartCore 9100 platform so compelling, in our meeting he turned to the head of purchasing and asked that the orders that they were about to place for competitors mobile packet core equipment be put on hold so they can trial our solution. The trial is now in process and is doing well.
During the quarter, 23 new customers placed orders for the Tellabs 8600 and 8800, primarily for Tellabs mobile backhaul solution, and this was done all over the world.
In our new mobile packet core, we added two new customers. We also expanded our Clearwire business into Clearwire Spain. We now have seven customers for the Tellabs SmartCore 9100 platform, up from five last quarter.
We continue to work with customers and now increased number of trials to 18 both WiMAX and introduced 3G version of our SmartCore product and now both in WiMAX and 3G trials around the world.
We bought WiChorus for its industry leading mobile packet core platform and now we’re extending it beyond WiMAX into 3G and LTE. We also recognized revenue in the fist first from four new Tellabs 7100 customers both in North America and Latin America.
In the first quarter, we received Tellabs Government Systems received JTE certification or Joint Interoperability Test Command certification for access solutions and optical networking solutions. We now can offer Tellabs optical land and optical transport with 40 gigabit to the United States government including the Department of Defense.
In general, we had a strong first quarter, Tim, going to share with you in a moment positive guidance for the second quarter. Tellabs strategy is working. We continue to grow profitably by helping customers succeed in the mobile internet.
With my brief comments been over, I’ll pass it over to Tim, and then we’ll come back and we’ll answer your questions.

35237,99159482,57871,"Tellabs Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Tellabs, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Rob, and good morning, everyone. In addition to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this morning’s news release contain some comparisons of quarterly financial information o",1617,"Thanks Rob, and good morning, everyone. In addition to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this morning’s news release contain some comparisons of quarterly financial information on a sequential and non-GAAP basis.
We provide this information in instances where we think it's a helpful edition to the year-over-year data. Looking at Q1, we saw sequential growth in data and cross connect revenue driven by strong demand in North America.
Revenue from our growth portfolio increased to account for 57% of total revenue. Revenue from single family ONTs declined on a sequential basis as anticipated.
Operating expenses less restructuring and intangible asset amortization were flat with the first quarter of 2009 and gross margin operating income and net income were up nicely both sequentially and year-over-year.
Let's get to the specifics. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2010 amounted to $380 million. While that is down 2% from $389 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, the seasonal decline from 4Q to 1Q is one of the lowest we’ve seen in recent years.
On a year-over-year basis, total revenue was up 5%, compared with the first quarter of 2009, and above the guidance range we gave you in January. On a sequential quarterly basis, flat overall broadband segment revenue was offset by lower revenue in the transport and services segments.
Looking a little deeper into the broadband segment sequential growth in data revenue was offset by lower access in managed access revenue. Within transport, increased revenue from digital cross-connect systems offset lower revenue from optical transport systems on a sequential basis.
GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2010 amounted to $46 million or $0.12 a share. On a sequential basis that compares with $62 million or $0.16 a share in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a year-over-year basis, that's up from $6.5 million or $0.02 a share in the first quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, net income excluding pre-tax charges for special items, was $45 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. If you’re wondering why our non-GAAP net income is less than our GAAP net income, it's due to some tax benefits that impact only GAAP expenses as I’ll explain more fully when we talk about taxes.
Okay, if you take $45 million in non-GAAP net income and subtract $5.6 million or $0.01 a share for equity based comp, that's to be consistent with the way first call compiles and reports estimates for Tellabs, the result is $0.10 in non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2009.
On a geographic basis revenue from customers in North America grew to account for 72% of total revenue in the first quarter up from 66% in the prior quarter.
Let's take a look at the segment data for the first quarter. Broadband segment revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was $191 million consistent with the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, growth in data product revenue offset decline in access and managed access revenue. Data product was $130.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 108%, from $63 million in the first quarter of 2009.
Revenue from both the Tellabs 8600 managed edge system and the Tellabs 8800 multiservice router series increased in the year-over-year period, as we are participating in large network builds around the world.
The year-over-year increase in data revenue was driven by strong demand in North America. In addition, we recognized revenue from the Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform for a second consecutive quarter since acquiring the platform in December of 2009.
Turning to managed access category, revenue in the first quarter of 2010 came in at $30 million, compared with $45 million in the prior quarter. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8100, 6300 systems declined on a sequential basis as customers continue to migrate to data products.
Access revenue was $30 million in the first quarter, compared with $56 million in the prior quarter driven primarily by anticipated sequential decline in sales of single family ONTs. Taking all that into account broadband segment profit for the first quarter of 2010 was $61 million, up 37.2%, compared with $44 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
Segment profit increased primarily as higher level of revenue from data products offset lower revenue from managed access and access products.
In the transport segment, revenue of $128 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $133 million in the prior quarter. Increased revenue from cross-connect systems offset a decline in revenue from optical transport systems.
Transport segment profit driven primarily by shift from lower margin optical transport products, the higher margin cross-connect systems was $45.3 million in the first quarter, up from $44.5 million in the prior quarter.
Services segment revenue was $61 million in Q1, compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Services segment profit amounted to $20 million, compared with $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a portfolio basis, growth from growth products and that includes the Tellabs 6300, 7100, 86, 8800 data products, professional services, and recently acquired Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform grew sequentially in the first quarter to account for 57% of total revenue, compared with 48% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a gross margin basis, non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2010 was better than anticipated at 50.9%. That's up 5.4 percentage points from 45.5 in the fourth quarter of last year.
Gross margin is dependant on product and customer mix. The mix shift this quarter was attributed primarily to two factors. A little more than 4 points of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from data products and about 0.5 of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from digital cross-connect systems. In addition, the impact of lower ONT revenue on corporate gross margin was offset by lower managed access revenue.
Turning to operating expenses, total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis came in at $134 million, compared with $128 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis the increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of expenses for our recent WiChorus acquisition and higher incentive composition.
In the first quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses came in at $67 million or slightly less than 18% of revenue. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $67 million.
Other income amounted to $7 million in the quarter, compared with $4 million in the prior quarter as we realized gains on the sales of marketable securities. Our tax provision on non-GAAP pre-tax income for the quarter was $21 million for an effective rate of 32%.
Back to the difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate. In our non-GAAP tax rate, we exclude unusual or infrequent adjustments that do not reflect what we view as our normalized forward looking long-term rate.
In the current quarter, we recorded the following tax benefits in our GAAP provision but not in our non-GAAP tax expense. $13 million for the reversal of tax accruals, no longer required due to an expiration of statute of limitations and $4 million for benefits from the recognition of net operating loss carry-forward that were previously offset by evaluation allowance. Looking ahead, we expect our effective non-GAAP tax rate for 2010 to be 32%.
Turning to the balance sheet now, during the quarter we generated $63 million in positive cash flow from operations CapEx came in at $4 million for the quarter. DSO was 64 days from 61 in the prior quarter. And inventory turns were 5.6 times versus 5.9 at the end of the fourth quarter of last year.
At the end of the first quarter 2010, inventory in terms of dollars was $129 million, compared with $128 million at the end of the prior quarter. During the quarter we purchased 112,000 shares of our stock, at a cost of about $793,000.
We also returned almost $8 million to shareholders via our first quarter dividend. The actual number of shares outstanding at quarters end was about 800, I'm sorry, $385 million. Headcount at the end of the quarter stood at approximately 3,250 and book-to-bill for the quarter was solidly above one.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of this year, based on orders in Q1 backlog and given the overall market conditions, we are guiding for second quarter revenue to grow sequentially in a range between 10% and 12%. We expect gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter level, plus or minus a point or two depending again on product mix.
And while we previously guided for full year 2010 gross margins to be in the mid-40s range. We now anticipate improvement to the high 40s range, depending again on product and customer mix. We expect non-GAAP OpEx for the second quarter to be up in dollars in the low $140 million range, but down as a percent of revenue.
In addition, we expect the effective expensing equity based compensation in the second quarter will be about $7 million, split between operating expense and cost of goods sold.
So to recap, we made good progress in the first quarter. We saw solid year-over-year revenue growth with less than typical sequential seasonal decline and we’re guiding for sequential revenue growth.
Our expectations for full year gross margin performance are higher than they were in January. And while operating expenses are increasing in real dollars we’ll keep them to a lower percentage of revenue.
At this point, I’d like to open the floor to your questions. Tamika, we’re ready for the first question.

Thank you for your comments. Let me give you a couple of thoughts on the margin. You know, certainly our Q2 margin is where we have the best insight and we’re guiding for flat performance.
We do, inside that expect to see some growth in our access product which tend to have margins below our corporate averages. We see some of the ONTs returning to a more normal level. We also expect to see continued growth in our data product. So, kind of the, those two moving pieces tend to wash and at this point, we’re expecting around flat margins.
You know, as we look out into the balance of the year, we see the same kind of thing that we saw when we gave you guidance earlier that, we’re seeing early in the year robust sales of our cross-connects and data products. Our level of visibility in the balance of the year is not quite as clear. So I think at this point we wanted to up that vision.
We are seeing good solid margins here. They are above where we expected them to be. We’re certainly hopeful we can continue there but I think a note of caution is in order and that's what we are trying to do with that guidance.

I met with close to a hundred customers over that duration. It was a great show for us. But to go to your question, first of all, if you think about it, the biggest expense in a wireless network is for all the bay stations. And normally the packet core is bundled with the bay stations.
But in effort to reduce the biggest expense, having an independent packet core that interoperates with all the RAN vendors has a lot of value towards reducing net cell prices in the radio equipment itself.
So our first proposition is, we are an independent packet core vendor, not tied to any RAN. We'll interoperate with all your RAN vendors and help you drive down the biggest expense in your network. That’s the most compelling business reason.
Then when you look at our overall throughput, the -- all the internet demand of smartphones and tablets and so on, is having a big impact on the capacity of these packet core products.
And so, we have anywhere from six to eight times the overall capacity of some of the best-in-class competitors. We have over four times the packet data protocol throughput. We have some of the best deep packet inspection without degrading performance of the system. And our network management system with all of its analytics is, customers are saying it's some of the best in the industry.
Then when you couple that with Tellabs' expectations for high quality and reliability in our service and responsiveness, the customer was compelled based on that story to say, hey look, let's stop the orders that we have for this other competitor and let's go test Tellabs.

So we saw absolutely increases in North American revenue for both periods year-on-year and sequentially. We saw increase, I'm sorry, we saw decreases in international revenue in both periods.
And that's a function of strong activity we’re seeing in North America right now and slower uptick in some of the areas we've historically been strong in. As we look for the balance of the year, I would expect to see that as a percent -- by the end of the year that our international business will pick up as we see strength there both in terms of growth of the individual segment revenues, but also as a percent of the overall total.

It's driven dominantly by T1 demand whether that T1 is driven by enterprise, which is still out there today or mobile backhaul to get capacity out to a cell site.
Next, I wouldn't consider the 5500 in growth mode. Let me take a step back. You also asked Ethernet. There is a bunch of frame relay Ethernet, voice, video circuits that go over the Titan 5500 today, but they’re all encapsulated in a T1 equivalent that can manifest itself as a T1. It could be a DS3 interface. It could be optical carrier 3, 12 or 48 interfaces, which are all the interfaces on a Titan 5500.
I would not however put the 5500 in a growth mode or in the growth product category. We continue to invest to support the product, keep it relevant from a density and cost perspective. But I would -- the 5500 over its life cycle in a macro view, is in it's decline.

Let me touch on a couple drivers, let's talk about the access business where we have a great installed base or embedded base of products. But we also have an exciting platform that we think solves a lot of carrier issues.
So we certainly seen a decline in the business, as we refocused away from some of the big accounts and big contracts that we had. But we still continue to see a lot of interest in our portfolio and we’re excited about areas like the federal government and some of the other recent wins that we had there.
In the access, we’re also affected by the ONT -- the single family ONTs, which relate to a major North American carrier's rollout of fiber-to-the-home. We've seen relatively low sales. In fact, those sales come down significantly over the last two quarters. We expect that business to bounce back up and do expect to see a significant increase in this access revenue, as we go towards the end of the year.
In the managed access side, which really is made up of our 6300 and 8100, there’s kind of good news, bad news story there. The 8100 has had a long life, much like the 5500 and is really loved by our customers, both for its simplicity and the network manager.
What we are seeing is as those customers begin to migrate away from the product over toward our IP-based solutions in the 86 and 8800, the 6300 is also being impacted. I would expect that business to be, to continue somewhere in the area that it's in today.
So, short answer, we expect growth in the access business. We expect the managed access to be generally in this ballpark plus or minus depending on customer wins.

First of all, all the recognized revenue and any revenue that we’ve achieved so far is through WiMAX customers. That was our first release. When we bought this platform, we thought it was the best architecture from a hardware, software and management system perspective. But we always knew that we were going to evolve it into 3G and LTE.
Next, I had mentioned that, of roughly 18 field trials we have now, 11 are WiMAX and seven of them are 3G. So let's call the WiMAX 4G and seven of them are 3G GGSN trials.
We just released that software recently here and we’re now working on the LTE [TNS] gateway software to be released towards the second half of this year. And so all of our revenue is WiMAX, all of the trials are mix between 4G WiMAX and 3G, GGSN 11 and 7 respectively and we’re aspiring to get into LTE trials towards the second half of the year, when we release the software.

Two things I wanted to cover, one is that our OpEx costs are not completely fixed, there is some variable components. So as we see higher revenues, higher margins than we originally thought and higher profitability, there is some variable piece around incentive compensation.
The second area is that, we are really excited about what we see in the market today in the mobile backhaul and the challenges that our customers face a relative to smartphones. And we decided to spend additional R&D to try and capture that. We think we got a good position in the marketplace and want to leverage that.
So as I mentioned at tend of my comments, expect us -- expect to see our costs up as a in absolute dollars, but we’re driving management below, keep the percentage lower than it is today as we go forward.
So two areas where we see some non-variable or non-linear costs, one is in incentive and the other one we want to accelerate some R&D investments to take advantage of these market opportunities.

Tellabs is helping customers succeed with the mobile Internet. We achieved our goal of profitable revenue growth in the first quarter, including record revenue from our growth products. Our first quarter of 2010 revenu",705,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Tellabs is helping customers succeed with the mobile Internet. We achieved our goal of profitable revenue growth in the first quarter, including record revenue from our growth products. Our first quarter of 2010 revenue increased to $380 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter. Our growth product continue to gain traction, a record of 57% of our first quarter of 2010 revenue came from our growth products and services. That's up from 39% in the first quarter of 2009.
Also positively, data revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $131 million. That puts us at the high-end of our revenue and our gross margin guidance. We saw a strong customer demand for Mobile Solutions. Revenue for all three data products, Tellabs 8600, 8800 and 9100 increased both year-over-year and sequentially. It was a positive sign.
Our first quarter cash flow enabled us to invest 18% of revenue into back-end research and development, to pay our first cash dividend in February, and to add cash our balance sheet. In 2010, about 85% of our R&D investment is going into our growth products. That was around 50% in 2007. We continue to improve Tellabs' profitability and generate cash. GAAP gross profit margins improved to 50.7% from 44.2% a year ago. That was marking Tellabs' highest gross profit margins in the last 22 quarters, that since third quarter of 2004. 
GAAP operating earnings were $36 million up from $9 million a year ago. GAAP net earnings were at $46 million, up from $7 million a year ago. We delivered GAAP EPS of $0.12, that was up from $0.02 a year ago. We generated $63 million in cash from operations in the first quarter of 2010. And we added $42 million in cash to our balance sheet in the first quarter. We now hold $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and liquid financial instruments. And of course, we have no debt. 
Our strategy to innovate in growth markets such as the mobile Internet is working well. We are adding new customers around the world due to our growth products. We received great customer feedback on our mobile Internet solutions during Mobile World Congress and CTIA. I was at Mobile World Congress, for example, and we met with a Chief Technology Officer of a Tier 1 service provider. He found the value proposition of the SmartCore 9100 platform so compelling. In our meeting, he turned to the head of purchasing and asked that the orders that they are about to place for competitors' mobile packet core equipment be put on hold so they can trial our solution. The trial is now in process and is doing well.
During the quarter, 23 new customers placed orders for the Tellabs 8600 and 8800, primarily for Tellabs Mobile Backhaul Solutions. And this was done all over the world. In our new mobile packet core, we added two new customers. We also expanded our Clearwire business into Clearwire Spain. We now have seven customers for the Tellabs SmartCore 9100 platform, up from five last quarter.
We continue to work with customers, a now increased number of trials to 18 both WiMAX, and we introduced the 3G version of our SmartCore product, and we're now both in WiMAX and 3G trials around the world.
We both WiChorus for its industry-leading mobile packet core platform and now we're extending it beyond WiMAX into 3G and LTE [Long Term Evolution] . We also recognized revenue in the first quarter from four new Tellabs 7100 customers both in North America and Latin America. In the first quarter, Tellabs government systems received JITC certification, or Joint Interoperability Test Command certification, for our Access solutions and our Optical Networking solutions. We now can offer Tellabs optical LAN and optical transport with 40 gigabit to the United States government, including the Department of Defense.
In general, we've had a strong first quarter. Tim's going to share with you in a moment positive guidance for the second quarter. Tellabs' strategy is working. We continue to grow profitably by helping customers succeed in the mobile Internet. 
With my brief comments being over, I'll pass it over to Tim, and then we'll come back and we'll answer your questions."

In addition, to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, this morning's news release contains some comparisons of quarterly financial information",1624,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. In addition, to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, this morning's news release contains some comparisons of quarterly financial information on a sequential and non-GAAP basis. We provide this information in instances where we think it's a helpful addition to the year-over-year data. 
Looking at Q1, we saw a sequential growth in data and cross-connect revenue driven by strong demand in North America. Revenue from our growth portfolio increased to account for 57% of total revenue 
Revenue from Single Family ONTs [Optical Networking Terminal] declined on a sequential basis as anticipated. Operating expenses, less restructuring and intangible assets amortization were flat with the first quarter of 2009. And gross margin, operating income and net income were up nicely, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Let's get to the specifics. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2010, amounted to $380 million. While that's down 2% from $389 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, the seasonal decline from 4Q to 1Q is one of the lowest we've seen in recent years. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue was up 5% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and above the guidance range we gave you in January.
On a sequential quarterly basis, flat overall Broadband segment revenue was offset by lower revenue in the Transport and Services segments. Looking a little deeper into the Broadband segment, sequential growth in data revenue was offset by lower Access and Managed Access revenue. Within Transport, increased revenue from Digital Cross-Connect Systems offset lower revenue from Optical Transport Systems on a sequential basis.
GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2010, amounted to $46 million or $0.12 a share. On a sequential basis, that compares to $62 million, or $0.16 a share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a year-over-year basis, that's up from $6.5 million or $0.02 a share in the first quarter of 2009.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income excluding pretax charges for special items was $45 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. If you're wondering why our non-GAAP net income is less than our GAAP net income, it's due to some tax benefits that impact only GAAP expenses as I'll explain more fully when we talk about taxes.
Okay, if you take $45 million in non-GAAP net income and substract $5.6 million or $0.01 a share for equity based comp, that's to be consistent with the way FirstCall compiles and reports our estimates for Tellabs. The result is $0.10 in non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2009.
On a geographic basis, revenue from customers in North America grew to account for 72% of total revenue in the first quarter, up from 66% in the prior quarter. Let's take a look at the segment data for the first quarter.
Broadband segment revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was $191 million, consistent with the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, growth in data product revenue offset a decline In Access and Managed Access revenue. Data product revenue was $130.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 108% from $63 million in the first quarter of 2009. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8600 Managed Access system and the Tellabs 8800 Multiservice Router series increased in the year-over-year period, as we are participating in large network builds around the world.  The year-over-year increase in data revenue was driven by strong demand in North America. In addition, we recognized revenue from the Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform for the second consecutive quarter since acquiring that platform in December of 2009.
Turning to the Managed Access category. Revenue in the first quarter of 2010 came in at $30 million compared with $45 million in the prior quarter. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8100 and 6300 systems declined on a sequential basis as customers continue to migrate to data products.  Access revenue was $30 million in the first quarter compared with $56 million in the prior quarter driven primarily by an anticipated sequential decline in sales of Single Family ONTs.  Taking all that into account, Broadband segment profit for the first quarter of 2010 was $61 million, up 37.2% compared with $44 million in the fourth quarter of last year.  Segment profit increased primarily as higher level of revenue from data products offset lower revenue from Managed Access and Access products.
In the Transport segment, revenue of $128 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $133 million in the prior quarter. Increased revenue from Cross-Connect Systems offset a decline in revenue from Optical Transport Systems. Transport segment profit, driven primarily by a shift from lower margin Optical Transport products to a higher-margin Cross-Connect Systems was $45.3 million in the first quarter, up from $44.5 million in the prior quarter Services segment revenue was $61 million in Q1 compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Services segment profit amounted to $20 million compared with $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a portfolio basis, growth from growth products, and that includes the Tellabs 6300, 7100, 8600 and 8800 data products, professional services and the recently acquired Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform grew sequentially in the first quarter to account for 57% of total revenue compared with 48% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a gross margin basis, non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter of 2010 was better than anticipated at 50.9%. That's up 5.4 percentage points from 45.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross margin is dependent on product and customer mix. The mix shift this quarter was attributed primarily to two factors: A little more than four points of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from data products; and about 1.5 of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from Digital Cross-Connect Systems. In addition, the impact of lower ONT revenue on corporate gross margin was offset by lower Managed Access revenue.
Turning to operating expenses. Total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis came in at $134 million compared with $128 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, the increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of expenses for our recent WiChorus acquisition and higher incentive compensation.
In the first quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses came in at $67 million or slightly less than 18% of revenue. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $67 million. Other income amounted to $7 million in the quarter compared with $4 million in the prior quarter as we realized gains on the sales of marketable securities.
Our tax provision, our non-GAAP pretax income for the quarter was $21 million for an effective rate of 32%. Back to the difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate, in our non-GAAP tax rate, we exclude unusual or infrequent adjustments that do not reflect what we view as our normalized forward-looking long-term rate. In the current quarter, we recorded the filing tax benefits in our GAAP provision but not in our non-GAAP tax expense. $13 million for the reversal of tax accruals no longer required due to an expiration of statute of limitations and $4 million for benefits from the recognition of net operating loss carry forwards that were previously offset by a valuation allowance.  Looking ahead, we expect our effective non-GAAP tax rate for 2010 to be 32%.
Turning to the balance sheet now. During the quarter, we generated $63 million in positive cash flow from operations. CapEx came in at $4 million for the quarter. DSO were 64 days from 61 in the prior quarter. And inventory turns were 5.6x versus 5.9x at the end of the fourth quarter of last year.
At the end of the first quarter in 2010, inventory in terms of dollars was $129 million compared with $128 million at the end of the prior quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 112,000 shares of our stock at the cost of about $793,000. We also returned almost $8 million to shareholders via our first quarter dividend.  The actual number of shares outstanding at quarter's end was about 385 million. Headcount at the end of the quarter stood at approximately 3,250. And book-to-bill for the quarter was solidly above one.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of this year, based on orders in Q1, backlog, and given the overall market conditions, we are guiding for second quarter revenue to grow sequentially in a range between 10% and 12%. We expect gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter level plus or minus a point or two depending again on product mix.
And while we previously guided for full year 2010 gross margins to be in the mid-40s range, we now anticipate improvement to the high-40s range depending again on product and customer mix. We expect non-GAAP OpEx for the second quarter to be up in dollars in the low $140 million range but down as a percent of revenue.  In addition, we expect the effective expensing equity-based compensation in the second quarter will be about $7 million, split between operating expense and cost of goods sold. 
So to recap, we made good progress in the first quarter. We saw solid year-over-year revenue growth, with less than typical sequential seasonal decline and we are guiding for sequential revenue growth. Our expectations for full year gross margin performance are higher than they were in January. And while operating expenses are increasing in real dollars, we'll keep them to a lower percentage of revenue.
At this point, I'd like to open the floor to your questions. Tamika, we're ready for the first question."

Certainly, our Q2 margin is where we have the best insight and we're guiding for flat performance. We do inside that, expect to see some growth in our Access products, which tend to have margins below our corporate averages. We see some of the ONTs returning to more normal levels. We also expect to see continued growth in our data products. So kind of those two moving pieces tend to wash and at this point, we're expecting around flat margins. As we look out into the balance of the year, we see the same kind of thing that we saw when we gave you guidance earlier, that we're seeing early in the year robust sales of our Cross-Connects and data products. Our level of visibility and the balance of the year is not quite as clear. So I think at this point, we wanted to up that vision. We're seeing good solid margins here. They're above where we expect them to be. We're certainly hopeful we can continue there, but I think a note of caution is in order, and that's what we're trying to do with that guidance."

Given that, does that mean that the delta between the 7100 gross margin and the 5500 gross margin has come in a little bit and has narrowed a lot?

I've met with close to 100 customers over that duration, it was a great show for us. But to go to your question, first of all, if you think about it, the biggest expense in a wireless network is for all the base stations. And normally, the packet core is bundled with the base stations. But in an effort to reduce the biggest expense, having an independent packet core that interoperates with all the RAN [Radio Access Network] vendors has a lot of value towards reducing net sell prices in the radio equipment itself. So our first proposition is, we're an independent packet core vendor, not tied to any RAN. We'll interoperate with all your RAN vendors and help you drive down the biggest expense in your network. That's the most compelling business reason. Then when you look at our overall throughput, all of the Internet demand of smart phones and tablets and so on is having a big impact on the capacity of these packet core products. And so we have anywhere from 6x to 8x the overall capacity of some of the best-in-class competitors. We have over 4x the packet data protocol throughput. We have some of the best deep packet inspection without degrading the performance of the system. And our network management system, with all of its analytics, customers are saying is some of the best in the industry. Then when you couple that with Tellabs' expectations for high quality and reliability in our service and responsiveness, the customer was compelled base on that story to say, ""hey, look, let's stop the orders that we have for this other competitor, then let's go test Tellabs."""

There is a bunch of Frame Relay, Ethernet, voice, video circuits that go over the Titan 5500 today, but they're all encapsulated in a T-1 equivalent. That can manifest itself as a T-1. It could be a DS3 interface. It could be a Optical Carrier 3, 12 or 48 interfaces, which are all the interfaces on a Titan 5500. I would not, however, put the 5500 in a growth mode, or in the growth product category. We continue to invest to support the product, keep it relevant from a density and cost perspective.

But we still continue to see a lot of interest in our portfolio, and we're excited about areas like the federal government and some of the other recent wins that we've had there. In the Access, we're also affected by the Single Family ONTs, which relate to a major North American carrier's rollout of fiber-to-the-home. We've seen relatively low sales. In fact, those sales have come down significantly over the last two quarters. We expect that business to bounce back up, and do expect to see a significant increase in this Access revenue as we go toward the end of the year. In the Managed Access side, which really is made up of our 6300 and 8100, there's kind of a good news, bad news story there. The 8100 has had a long life, much like the 5500, and is really loved by our customers, both for its simplicity and the Network Manager. What we're seeing is those customers began to migrate away from that product over toward our IP-based solutions in the 8600 and 8800. The 6300 is also being impacted. I would expect that business to continue somewhere in the area that it's in today. So short answer, we expect growth in the Access business.

One is that our OpEx costs are not completely fixed. There is some variable component. So as we see higher revenues, higher margins than we originally thought and higher profitability, there is some variable piece around incentive compensation. The second area is that we're really excited about what we see in the market today in the Mobile Backhaul, and the challenges that our customers face relative to smartphones. And we decided to spend some additional R&D to try and capture that. We think we've got a good position in the marketplace and want to leverage that. So as I mentioned at the end of my comments, expect to see our costs up in absolute dollars. But we're driving to manage them below, keep the percentage lower than it is today as we go forward. So two areas where we see some non-variable or nonlinear costs, one is incentive and the other one is we want to accelerate some R&D investments to take advantage of these market opportunities."

Also positively, data revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $131 million. That puts us at the high-end of our revenue and our gross margin guidance. We saw a strong customer demand for Mobile Solutions. Revenue for all three data products, Tellabs 8600, 8800 and 9100 increased both year-over-year and sequentially. It was a positive sign.

In 2010, about 85% of our R&D investment is going into our growth products. That was around 50% in 2007. We continue to improve Tellabs' profitability and generate cash. GAAP gross profit margins improved to 50.7% from 44.2% a year ago. That was marking Tellabs' highest gross profit margins in the last 22 quarters, that since third quarter of 2004. 
GAAP operating earnings were $36 million up from $9 million a year ago. GAAP net earnings were at $46 million, up from $7 million a year ago. We delivered GAAP EPS of $0.12, that was up from $0.02 a year ago. We generated $63 million in cash from operations in the first quarter of 2010. And we added $42 million in cash to our balance sheet in the first quarter. We now hold $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and liquid financial instruments. And of course, we have no debt. 
Our strategy to innovate in growth markets such as the mobile Internet is working well. We are adding new customers around the world due to our growth products. We received great customer feedback on our mobile Internet solutions during Mobile World Congress and CTIA. I was at Mobile World Congress, for example, and we met with a Chief Technology Officer of a Tier 1 service provider. He found the value proposition of the SmartCore 9100 platform so compelling. In our meeting, he turned to the head of purchasing and asked that the orders that they are about to place for competitors' mobile packet core equipment be put on hold so they can trial our solution. The trial is now in process and is doing well.
During the quarter, 23 new customers placed orders for the Tellabs 8600 and 8800, primarily for Tellabs Mobile Backhaul Solutions. And this was done all over the world. In our new mobile packet core, we added two new customers. We also expanded our Clearwire business into Clearwire Spain. We now have seven customers for the Tellabs SmartCore 9100 platform, up from five last quarter.
We continue to work with customers, a now increased number of trials to 18 both WiMAX, and we introduced the 3G version of our SmartCore product, and we're now both in WiMAX and 3G trials around the world.
We both WiChorus for its industry-leading mobile packet core platform and now we're extending it beyond WiMAX into 3G and LTE [Long Term Evolution] . We also recognized revenue in the first quarter from four new Tellabs 7100 customers both in North America and Latin America. In the first quarter, Tellabs government systems received JITC certification, or Joint Interoperability Test Command certification, for our Access solutions and our Optical Networking solutions. We now can offer Tellabs optical LAN and optical transport with 40 gigabit to the United States government, including the Department of Defense.
In general, we've had a strong first quarter. Tim's going to share with you in a moment positive guidance for the second quarter. Tellabs' strategy is working. We continue to grow profitably by helping customers succeed in the mobile Internet. 
With my brief comments being over, I'll pass it over to Tim, and then we'll come back and we'll answer your questions."
35237,99159482,61327,"Tellabs Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Tellabs, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. In addition, to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, this morning's news release contains some comparisons of quarterly financial information",1623,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. In addition, to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, this morning's news release contains some comparisons of quarterly financial information on a sequential and non-GAAP basis. We provide this information in instances where we think it's a helpful addition to the year-over-year data. 
Looking at Q1, we saw a sequential growth in data and cross-connect revenue driven by strong demand in North America. Revenue from our growth portfolio increased to account for 57% of total revenue 
Revenue from Single Family ONTs [Optical Networking Terminal] declined on a sequential basis as anticipated. Operating expenses, less restructuring and intangible assets amortization were flat with the first quarter of 2009. And gross margin, operating income and net income were up nicely, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Let's get to the specifics. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2010, amounted to $380 million. While that's down 2% from $389 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, the seasonal decline from 4Q to 1Q is one of the lowest we've seen in recent years. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue was up 5% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and above the guidance range we gave you in January.
On a sequential quarterly basis, flat overall Broadband segment revenue was offset by lower revenue in the Transport and Services segments. Looking a little deeper into the Broadband segment, sequential growth in data revenue was offset by lower Access and Managed Access revenue. Within Transport, increased revenue from Digital Cross-Connect Systems offset lower revenue from Optical Transport Systems on a sequential basis.
GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2010, amounted to $46 million or $0.12 a share. On a sequential basis, that compares to $62 million, or $0.16 a share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a year-over-year basis, that's up from $6.5 million or $0.02 a share in the first quarter of 2009.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income excluding pretax charges for special items was $45 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. If you're wondering why our non-GAAP net income is less than our GAAP net income, it's due to some tax benefits that impact only GAAP expenses as I'll explain more fully when we talk about taxes.
Okay, if you take $45 million in non-GAAP net income and substract $5.6 million or $0.01 a share for equity based comp, that's to be consistent with the way FirstCall compiles and reports our estimates for Tellabs. The result is $0.10 in non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2009.
On a geographic basis, revenue from customers in North America grew to account for 72% of total revenue in the first quarter, up from 66% in the prior quarter. Let's take a look at the segment data for the first quarter.
Broadband segment revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was $191 million, consistent with the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, growth in data product revenue offset a decline In Access and Managed Access revenue. Data product revenue was $130.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 108% from $63 million in the first quarter of 2009. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8600 Managed Access system and the Tellabs 8800 Multiservice Router series increased in the year-over-year period, as we are participating in large network builds around the world.  The year-over-year increase in data revenue was driven by strong demand in North America. In addition, we recognized revenue from the Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform for the second consecutive quarter since acquiring that platform in December of 2009.
Turning to the Managed Access category. Revenue in the first quarter of 2010 came in at $30 million compared with $45 million in the prior quarter. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8100 and 6300 systems declined on a sequential basis as customers continue to migrate to data products. Access revenue was $30 million in the first quarter compared with $56 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by an anticipated sequential decline in sales of Single Family ONTs.  
Taking all that into account, Broadband segment profit for the first quarter of 2010 was $61 million, up 37.2% compared with $44 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Segment profit increased primarily as higher level of revenue from data products offset lower revenue from Managed Access and Access products.
In the Transport segment, revenue of $128 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a $133 million in the prior quarter. Increased revenue from Cross-Connect Systems offset a decline in revenue from Optical Transport Systems. Transport segment profit, driven primarily by a shift from lower margin Optical Transport products to higher-margin Cross-Connect Systems was $45.3 million in the first quarter, up from $44.5 million in the prior quarter. Services segment revenue was $61 million in Q1 compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Services segment profit amounted to $20 million compared with $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a portfolio basis, growth from growth products, and that includes the Tellabs 6300, 7100, 8600 and 8800 data products, professional services and the recently acquired Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform grew sequentially in the first quarter to account for 57% of total revenue compared with 48% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a gross margin basis, non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter 2010 was better than anticipated at 50.9%, that's up 5.4 percentage points from 45.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross margin is dependent on product and customer mix. The mix shift this quarter was attributed primarily to two factors: A little more than four points of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from data products; and about 1.5 of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from Digital Cross-Connect Systems. In addition, the impact of lower ONT revenue on corporate gross margin was offset by lower Managed Access revenue.
Turning to operating expenses. Total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis came in at $134 million compared with $128 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, the increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of expenses for our recent WiChorus acquisition and higher incentive compensation.
In the first quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses came in at $67 million or slightly less than 18% of revenue. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $67 million. Other income amounted to $7 million in the quarter compared with $4 million in the prior quarter, as we realized gains on the sales of marketable securities.
Our tax provision on non-GAAP pretax income for the quarter was $21 million for an effective rate of 32%. Back to the difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate. In our non-GAAP tax rate, we exclude unusual or infrequent adjustments that do not reflect what we view as our normalized forward-looking long-term rate. In the current quarter, we recorded the following tax benefits in our GAAP provision, but not in our non-GAAP tax expense. $13 million for the reversal of tax accruals, no longer required, due to an expiration of statute of limitations and $4 million for benefits from the recognition of net operating loss carry forwards that were previously offset by a valuation allowance. Looking ahead, we expect our effective non-GAAP tax rate for 2010 to be 32%.
Turning to the balance sheet now. During the quarter, we generated $63 million in positive cash flow from operations. CapEx came in at $4 million for the quarter. DSO were 64 days from 61 in the prior quarter, and inventory turns were 5.6x versus 5.9x at the end of the fourth quarter of last year.
At the end of the first quarter in 2010, inventory in terms of dollars was $129 million compared with $128 million at the end of the prior quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 112,000 shares of our stock at a cost of about $793,000. We also returned almost $8 million to shareholders via our first quarter dividend.  
The actual number of shares outstanding at quarter's end was about 385 million. Headcount at the end of the quarter stood at approximately 3,250, and book-to-bill for the quarter was solidly above one.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of this year. Based on orders in Q1, backlog and given the overall market conditions, we are guiding for second quarter revenue to grow sequentially in a range between 10% and 12%. We expect gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter level, plus or minus, a point or two depending again on product mix.
And while we previously guided for full year 2010 gross margins to be in the mid-40s range, we now anticipate improvement to the high-40s range depending again on product and customer mix. We expect non-GAAP OpEx for the second quarter to be up in dollars in the low $140 million range, but down as a percent of revenue. In addition, we expect the effective expensing equity-based compensation in the second quarter will be about $7 million, split between operating expense and cost of goods sold. 
So to recap, we made good progress in the first quarter. We saw solid year-over-year revenue growth, with less than typical sequential seasonal decline, and we are guiding for sequential revenue growth. Our expectations for full year gross margin performance are higher than they were in January, and while operating expenses are increasing in real dollars, we'll keep them to a lower percentage of revenue.
At this point, I'd like to open the floor to your questions. Tamika, we're ready for the first question."

Certainly, our Q2 margin is where we have the best insight and we're guiding for flat performance. We do inside that, expect to see some growth in our Access products, which tend to have margins below our corporate averages. We see some of the ONTs returning to more normal level. We also expect to see continued growth in our data products. So kind of those two moving pieces tend to wash, and at this point, we're expecting around flat margins. As we look out into the balance of the year, we see the same kind of thing that we saw when we gave you guidance earlier, that we're seeing early in the year robust sales of our Cross-Connects. In data products, our level of visibility in the balance of the year is not quite as clear. So I think at this point, we wanted to up that vision.

We're certainly hopeful we can continue there, but I think a note of caution is in order, and that's what we're trying to do with that guidance."

Given that most of them, aside from Starent and Cisco, come from a base station vendor, so how do you differentiate it?

I've met with close to 100 customers over that duration, it was a great show for us. But to go to your question, first of all, if you think about it, the biggest expense in a wireless network is for all the base stations. And normally, the packet core is bundled with the base stations. But in an effort to reduce the biggest expense, having an independent packet core that interoperates with all the RAN [Radio Access Network] vendors has a lot of value towards reducing net sell prices in the radio equipment itself. So our first proposition is, we're an independent packet core vendor, not tied to any RAN. We'll interoperate with all your RAN vendors and help you drive down the biggest expense in your network. That's the most compelling business reason. Then when you look at our overall throughput, all of the Internet demand of smart phones and tablets and so on is having a big impact on the capacity of these packet core products. And so we have anywhere from 6x to 8x the overall capacity of some of the best-in-class competitors. We have over 4x the packet data protocol throughput. We have some of the best deep packet inspection without degrading the performance of the system. And our network management system, with all of its analytics, customers are saying is some of the best in the industry. Then when you couple that with Tellabs' expectations for high quality and reliability in our service and responsiveness, the customer was compelled base on that story to say, ""hey, look, let's stop the orders that we have for this other competitor, then let's go test Tellabs."""

And that's a function of strong activity we're seeing in North America right now, and slower uptick in some of the areas we've historically been strong in. As we look for the balance of the year, I would expect to see that as a percent, by the end of the year that our international business will pick up as we see some strength there, both in terms of growth of the individual segment revenues, but also as a percent of the overall total.

Next, I wouldn't consider the 5500 in growth mode. Well, let me take a step back. You also had Ethernet. There is a bunch of Frame Relay, Ethernet, voice, video circuits that go over the Titan 5500 today, but they're all encapsulated in a T-1 equivalent. That can manifest itself as a T-1. It could be a DS3 interface. It could be a Optical Carrier 3, 12 or 48 interfaces, which are all the interfaces on a Titan 5500. I would not, however, put the 5500 in a growth mode, or in the growth product category. We continue to invest to support the product, keep it relevant from a density and cost perspective.

But we still continue to see a lot of interest in our portfolio, and we're excited about areas like the federal government and some of the other recent wins that we've had there. In the Access, we're also affected by the Single Family ONTs, which relate to a major North American carrier's rollout of fiber-to-the-home. We've seen relatively low sales. In fact, those sales have come down significantly over the last two quarters. We expect that business to bounce back up, and do expect to see a significant increase in this Access revenue as we go toward the end of the year. In the Managed Access side, which really is made up of our 6300 and 8100, there's kind of a good news, bad news story there. The 8100 has had a long life, much like the 5500, and is really loved by our customers, both for its simplicity and the Network Manager. What we're seeing is those customers began to migrate away from that product over toward our IP-based solutions in the 8600 and 8800. The 6300 is also being impacted.

Our first quarter of 2010 revenu",704,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Tellabs is helping customers succeed with the mobile Internet. We achieved our goal of profitable revenue growth in the first quarter, including record revenue from our growth products. Our first quarter of 2010 revenue increased to $380 million, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Our growth product continued to gain traction. A record of 57% of our first quarter of 2010 revenue came from our growth products and services. That's up from 39% in the first quarter of 2009.
Also positively, data revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $131 million. That puts us at the high-end of our revenue and our gross margin guidance. We saw a strong customer demand for Mobile Solutions. Revenue for all three data products, Tellabs 8600, 8800 and 9100 increased both year-over-year and sequentially. It was a positive sign.
Our first quarter cash flow enabled us to invest 18% of revenue back into research and development, to pay our first cash dividend in February, and to add cash to our balance sheet. In 2010, about 85% of our R&D investment is going into our growth products. That was around 50% in 2007. We continue to improve Tellabs' profitability and generate cash. GAAP gross profit margins improved to 50.7% from 44.2% a year ago. That was marking Tellabs' highest gross profit margins in the last 22 quarters, that since third quarter of 2004. 
GAAP operating earnings were $36 million, up from $9 million a year ago. GAAP net earnings were at $46 million, up from $7 million a year ago. We delivered GAAP EPS of $0.12, that was up from $0.02 a year ago. We generated $63 million in cash from operations in the first quarter of 2010. And we added $42 million in cash to our balance sheet in the first quarter. We now hold $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and liquid financial instruments. And of course, we have no debt. 
Our strategy to innovate in growth markets such as the mobile Internet is working well. We are adding new customers around the world due to our growth products. We received great customer feedback on our mobile Internet solutions during Mobile World Congress and CTIA. I was at Mobile World Congress, for example, and we met with a Chief Technology Officer of a Tier 1 service provider. He found the value proposition of the SmartCore 9100 platform so compelling, in our meeting, he turned to the Head of Purchasing and asked that the orders that they're about to place for a competitor's mobile packet core equipment be put on hold, so they can trial our solution. The trial is now in process and is doing well.
During the quarter, 23 new customers placed orders for the Tellabs 8600 and 8800, primarily for Tellabs Mobile Backhaul Solutions, and this was done all over the world. In our new mobile packet core, we added two new customers. We also expanded our Clearwire business into Clearwire Spain. We now have seven customers for the Tellabs SmartCore 9100 platform, up from five last quarter.
We continue to work with customers and now increased number of trials to 18 both WiMAX, and we introduced the 3G version of our SmartCore product, and we're now both in WiMAX and 3G trials around the world.
We bought WiChorus for its industry-leading mobile packet core platform, and now we're extending it beyond WiMAX into 3G and LTE [Long Term Evolution]. We also recognized revenue in the first quarter from four new Tellabs 7100 customers, both in North America and Latin America. In the first quarter, Tellabs Government Systems received JITC certification, or Joint Interoperability Test Command certification, for our Access solutions and our Optical Networking solutions. We now can offer Tellabs optical LAN and optical transport with 40 gigabit to the United States government, including the Department of Defense.
In general, we've had a strong first quarter. Tim's going to share with you, in a moment, positive guidance for the second quarter. Tellabs' strategy is working. We continue to grow profitably by helping customers succeed in the mobile Internet. 
With my brief comments being over, I'll pass it over to Tim, and then we'll come back and we'll answer your questions."
35237,99159482,66739,"Tellabs Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Tellabs, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. In addition to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, this morning's news release contains some comparisons of quarterly financial information",1621,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. In addition to all the normal year-over-year comparisons, a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, this morning's news release contains some comparisons of quarterly financial information on a sequential and non-GAAP basis. We provide this information in instances where we think it's a helpful addition to the year-over-year data. 
Looking at Q1, we saw a sequential growth in Data and cross-connect revenue driven by strong demand in North America. Revenue from our growth portfolio increased to account for 57% of total revenue. Revenue from Single Family ONTs [Optical Networking Terminal] declined on a sequential basis as anticipated. Operating expenses, less restructuring and intangible asset amortization, were flat with the first quarter of 2009. And gross margin, operating income and net income were up nicely, both sequentially and year-over-year.
Let's get to the specifics. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2010, amounted to $380 million. While that's down 2% from $389 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, the seasonal decline from 4Q to 1Q is one of the lowest we've seen in recent years. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue was up 5% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and above the guidance range we gave you in January.
On a sequential quarterly basis, flat overall Broadband segment revenue was offset by lower revenue in the Transport and Services segments. Looking a little deeper into the Broadband segment, sequential growth in data revenue was offset by lower Access and Managed Access revenue. Within Transport, increased revenue from Digital Cross-Connect Systems offset lower revenue from Optical Transport Systems on a sequential basis.
GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2010, amounted to $46 million or $0.12 a share. On a sequential basis, that compares to $62 million, or $0.16 a share in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a year-over-year basis, that's up from $6.5 million or $0.02 a share in the first quarter of 2009.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income excluding pretax charges for special items was $45 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. If you're wondering why our non-GAAP net income is less than our GAAP net income, it's due to some tax benefits that impact only GAAP expenses as I'll explain more fully when we talk about taxes. Okay, if you take $45 million of non-GAAP net income and substract $5.6 million or $0.01 a share for equity-based comp, that's to be consistent with the way FirstCall compiles and reports estimates for Tellabs. The result is $0.10 in non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2009.
On a geographic basis, revenue from customers in North America grew to account for 72% of total revenue in the first quarter, up from 66% in the prior quarter. Let's take a look at the segment data for the first quarter.
Broadband segment revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was $191 million, consistent with the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, growth in data product revenue offset a decline in Access and Managed Access revenue. Data product revenue was $130.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 108% from $63 million in the first quarter of 2009. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8600 Managed Edge System and the Tellabs 8800 Multiservice Router series increased in the year-over-year period, as we are participating in large network builds around the world.  
The year-over-year increase in data revenue was driven by strong demand in North America. In addition, we recognized revenue from the Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform for the second consecutive quarter since acquiring that platform in December of 2009.
Turning to the Managed Access category. Revenue in the first quarter of 2010 came in at $30 million compared with $45 million in the prior quarter. Revenue from both the Tellabs 8100 and 6300 systems declined on a sequential basis as customers continue to migrate to data products. Access revenue was $30 million in the first quarter compared with $56 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by an anticipated sequential decline in sales of Single Family ONTs.  
Taking all that into account, Broadband segment profit for the first quarter of 2010 was $61 million, up 37.2% compared with $44 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Segment profit increased primarily as higher level of revenue from data products offset lower revenue from Managed Access and Access products.
In the Transport segment, revenue of $128 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a $133 million in the prior quarter. Increased revenue from Cross-Connect Systems offset a decline in revenue from Optical Transport Systems. Transport segment profit, driven primarily by a shift from lower margin Optical Transport products to higher-margin Cross-Connect Systems was $45.3 million in the first quarter, up from $44.5 million in the prior quarter. Services segment revenue was $61 million in Q1 compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Services segment profit amounted to $20 million compared with $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a portfolio basis, growth from growth products, and that includes the Tellabs 6300, 7100, 8600 and 8800 data products, professional services and the recently acquired Tellabs 9100 SmartCore platform grew sequentially in the first quarter to account for 57% of total revenue compared with 48% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On a gross margin basis, non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter 2010 was better than anticipated at 50.9%, that's up 5.4 percentage points from 45.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross margin is dependent on product and customer mix. The mix shift this quarter was attributed primarily to two factors: A little more than four points of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from data products; and about 1.5 of improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from Digital Cross-Connect Systems. In addition, the impact of lower ONT revenue on corporate gross margin was offset by lower Managed Access revenue.
Turning to operating expenses. Total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis came in at $134 million compared with $128 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, the increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the inclusion of a full quarter of expenses for our recent WiChorus acquisition and higher incentive compensation.
In the first quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses came in at $67 million or slightly less than 18% of revenue. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $67 million. Other income amounted to $7 million in the quarter compared with $4 million in the prior quarter, as we realized gains on the sales of marketable securities.
Our tax provision on non-GAAP pretax income for the quarter was $21 million for an effective rate of 32%. Back to the difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate. In our non-GAAP tax rate, we exclude unusual or infrequent adjustments that do not reflect what we view as our normalized forward-looking long-term rate. In the current quarter, we recorded the following tax benefits in our GAAP provision, but not in our non-GAAP tax expense. $13 million for the reversal of tax accruals, no longer required, due to an expiration of statute of limitations and $4 million for benefits from the recognition of net operating loss carry forwards that were previously offset by a valuation allowance. Looking ahead, we expect our effective non-GAAP tax rate for 2010 to be 32%.
Turning to the balance sheet now. During the quarter, we generated $63 million in positive cash flow from operations. CapEx came in at $4 million for the quarter. DSO were 64 days from 61 in the prior quarter, and inventory turns were 5.6x versus 5.9x at the end of the fourth quarter of last year.
At the end of the first quarter in 2010, inventory in terms of dollars was $129 million compared with $128 million at the end of the prior quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 112,000 shares of our stock at a cost of about $793,000. We also returned almost $8 million to shareholders via our first quarter dividend.  
The actual number of shares outstanding at quarter's end was about 385 million. Headcount at the end of the quarter stood at approximately 3,250, and book-to-bill for the quarter was solidly above one.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of this year. Based on orders in Q1, backlog and given the overall market conditions, we are guiding for second quarter revenue to grow sequentially in a range between 10% and 12%. We expect gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter level, plus or minus, a point or two depending again on product mix.
And while we previously guided for full year 2010 gross margins to be in the mid-40s range, we now anticipate improvement to the high-40s range depending again on product and customer mix. We expect non-GAAP OpEx for the second quarter to be up in dollars in the low $140 million range, but down as a percent of revenue. In addition, we expect the effective expensing equity-based compensation in the second quarter will be about $7 million, split between operating expense and cost of goods sold. 
So to recap, we made good progress in the first quarter. We saw solid year-over-year revenue growth, with less than typical sequential seasonal decline, and we are guiding for sequential revenue growth. Our expectations for full year gross margin performance are higher than they were in January, and while operating expenses are increasing in real dollars, we'll keep them to a lower percentage of revenue.
At this point, I'd like to open the floor to your questions. Tamika, we're ready for the first question."

I've met with close to 100 customers over that duration. It was a great show for us. But to go to your question, first of all, if you think about it, the biggest expense in a wireless network is for all the base stations. And normally, the packet core is bundled with the base stations. But in an effort to reduce the biggest expense, having an independent packet core that inter-operates with all the RAN [Radio Access Network] vendors has a lot of value toward reducing net sell prices in the radio equipment itself. So our first proposition is, we're an independent packet core vendor, not tied to any RAN. We'll inter-operate with all your RAN vendors and help you drive down the biggest expense in your network.

So back to your question, so we saw absolute increases in North American revenue for both periods, year-on-year and sequentially. We saw decreases in international revenue in both periods. And that's a function of strong activity we're seeing in North America right now, and slower uptick in some of the areas we've historically been strong in. As we look for the balance of the year, I would expect to see that as a percent, by the end of the year that our international business will pick up as we see some strength there, both in terms of growth of the individual segment revenues, but also as a percent of the overall total. So we're hoping to see continued strength in North America for the balance of the year, but a strengthening in our International business as well.

We did see actually sequential growth in the 5500 revenue, which was positive. It's driven dominantly by T-1 demand; whether that T-1 is driven by enterprise, which is still out there today, or Mobile Backhaul to get more capacity out to a cell site. Next, I wouldn't consider the 5500 in growth mode. Well, let me take a step back. You also had Ethernet. There is a bunch of Frame Relay, Ethernet, voice, video circuits that go over the Titan 5500 today, but they're all encapsulated in a T-1 equivalent. That can manifest itself as a T-1. It could be a DS3 interface. It could be a Optical Carrier 3, 12 or 48 interfaces, which are all the interfaces on a Titan 5500. I would not, however, put the 5500 in a growth mode, or in the growth product category. We continue to invest to support the product, keep it relevant from a density and cost perspective. But the 5500, over its life cycle, in a macro view is in its decline. I believe it will have a long tail.

But we also have an exciting new platform that we think solves a lot of carrier issues. So we've certainly seen a decline in the business, such that we refocused away from some of the big accounts and big contracts that we had. But we still continue to see a lot of interest in our portfolio, and we're excited about areas like the federal government and some of the other recent wins that we've had there. In the Access, we're also affected by the Single Family ONTs, which relate to a major North American carrier's rollout of fiber-to-the-home. We've seen relatively low sales. In fact, those sales have come down significantly over the last two quarters. We expect that business to bounce back up, and do expect to see a significant increase in this Access revenue as we go toward the end of the year. In the Managed Access side, which really is made up of our 6300 and 8100, there's kind of a good news, bad news story there. The 8100 has had a long life, much like the 5500, and is really loved by our customers, both for its simplicity and the Network Manager. What we're seeing is those customers began to migrate away from that product over toward our IP-based solutions in the 8600 and 8800. The 6300 is also being impacted. I would expect that business to continue somewhere in the area that it's in today. So short answer, we expect growth in the Access business.

Today, I'll review Tellabs strategy, its customers and progress during the second quarter and the first half of 2010. If you look at our first half, we successfully executed Tellabs strategy and the results show. Our strategy is to focus on the mobile Internet and it's producing profitable revenue growth. Tellabs business continue to perform better and better. If you think about it, we're working now with over 140 customers around the world.
Now let's turn to our progress. Our second quarter revenue grew 10% from a year-ago quarter. Our GAAP gross profit margins increased to 53.5% which is the highest since 2004. We are in $0.16 per diluted share on a GAAP basis and that's up from $0.04 a share in the year-ago quarter. In a few minutes, Tim's going to give you more detailed overview of the second quarter.
Tellabs performance is driven by our focus on the growth of the mobile Internet. We're advancing our strategy by focusing on investments in growth products and services. Tellabs growth results from an understanding of our customer's businesses from bringing them new innovative ideas and for making Internet and IP technologies and our professional services.
What sets us apart is our focus on best-agreed products for specific applications, and our goal is to drive high performance in networks. That particularly important is smart phones proliferate and create unprecendented demands on mobile networks. Today, 85% of our research and development investment goes into our growth products. These include bojecan (ph) and IP data products that power the mobile Internet such as the Tellabs 8600, 8800 Systems and the Tellabs SmartCore 9100 platform.
We're also investing in advancing our optical and business service solutions with the Tellabs 7100 Optical Transport System, and we continue to invest in growing Tellabs professional services. Our strategy is working. We're winning new customers for all of our growth products. Its result, in the second quarter, 58% of our revenue came from growth products, that's up from around 52% in the year-ago quarter where we actually had a revenue recognition, a big revenue recognition for a customer in Asia-Pac.
We're now intensifying our focus on innovation and growth products. During 2010, we expect to invest about 17% of sales in Research and Development, and we're hiring and recruiting Engineers, sales executives and services professionals, all who have Internet and IP expertise, and we're doing this around the world. We're doing it in Finland, China, India, Silicon Valley and here in Naperville, just to name some of the locations.
We're also advancing our strategy by innovating in growth markets. Our focus is squarely on the mobile Internet. Customers are rapidly building network capacity to keep up with surging mobile data traffics from BlackBerries, iPhones, Androids, dangles and iPads to name a few. And we're only seeing the infancy of mobile video in a JumpTap-Campbell ( ph ) networks. Tellabs is primely positioned in the mobile Internet market with our mobile backhaul and, increasingly, our mobile packet core solutions.
During the quarter, as some of you saw, Tellabs' stock dropped and was based on information about one of our customers, AT&T. And I want to address this issue head on. While I can't speak for our customer, we do know that AT&T is trialing a third vendor in its mobile backhaul networks. At the same time Tellabs fee is good demand from AT&T. We're in the network now, we're seeing growth on the embedded base and we believe we offer the lowest risk and the least cost evolution to the long-term evolution in the mobile backhaul.
If you look at Tellabs today, worldwide, Tellabs remains the market leader in packets of backhaul networks. But as markets grow larger, we expect more competitors come in and we compete globally on a day-by-day basis. We are determined that Tellabs will compete for and win customers as they transition our mobile backhaul networks to Internet and long-term evolution. To be clear, we're going to offer two fast forward to LGE for our customers. First we offer, as we do today, Internet functionality on our existing platforms which we believe is the lowest risk in least cost migration to the LTE backhaul. Next, we're already working on the next generation solution for long-term evolution including the mobile internet. We expect both of these solutions to be both compelling and highly competitive.
Remember, as I mentioned as I kicked-off this call, Tellabs is working with more than 140 mobile customers around the world. And our mobile business continues to grow. Just to give you some flavor for this, in the second quarter, we recognized revenue from seven new Tellabs 8600 and 8800 customers in EMEA and Latin America. Recently, Tellabs won a mobile backhaul contract in partnership with Nokia-Siemens networks from Megaphone. As some of you may know, Megaphone is one of the top three mobile carriers in Russia. We're particularly optimistic about that future.
Also in the second quarter, the Tellabs 7100 optical transport system gained nine new customers both in Latin America and North America. One of these new Tellabs 7100 customers is AboveNet, which operates high bandwidth private optical networks in 15 U.S. cities and London. And they're expected to grow as well and we hope to grow with them. We also recognize revenue from three new customers for the Tellabs SmartCore 9100 platform. That brings us to a total of 10 customers for our newest platform, and we continue to work with customers in more than 20 ongoing trials, all with the SmartCore 9100 platform.
When I look back in the first half of 2010, it's clear that Tellabs strategy is working. We're investing in growth products, we're focusing in growth markets and we're winning new customers. We're also teaming up with world-class customers and partners. As we advance our strategy, we're achieving profitable revenue growth. We're excited about the opportunity to grow Tellabs business as we see the future of the mobile Internet unfold. With that, I'll turn it over to you Tim and we can go through more of the detail.

As Rob mentioned, total revenue for the quarter was $423 million and that was up 11% on a sequential basis and 10% on the year-over-year basis. R",1566,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning everyone. To begin with, I'd like to make a few observations about the quarter. As Rob mentioned, total revenue for the quarter was $423 million and that was up 11% on a sequential basis and 10% on the year-over-year basis. Revenue from our growth portfolio increased to account for 58% of our total revenue. We saw a sequential and year-over-year growth in both data and transport revenue driven by strong demand in North America. Gross margin is 54%, is up sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Operating expenses at $134 million were flat with the prior quarter and that excludes restructuring and other charges, intangible assets, amortization and equity-based comp. Non-GAAP net earnings were at $67 million, were up significantly both sequentially and year-over-year.
Let me get into the specifics. As I've just mentioned, total revenue for the second quarter of 2010 amounted to $423 million up 11% from $380 million in the prior quarter and at the mid-point of the guidance range we gave you in April. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue was up 10% compared with the second quarter of 2009. On a sequential basis, we saw our growth in Broadband and Transport segments.
Looking a little deeper into the Broadband segment, sequential growth in data and access revenue offset a slight decline in Managed Access revenue. Within Transport, we saw increased revenue from both the Digital Cross-Connect Systems and Optical Transport Systems. Revenue in the Service segment was essentially consistent with the prior quarters. GAAP net earnings grew into $64 million in the second quarter, up 40% from $46 million in the first quarter of this year.
On an EPS basis that translates to $0.16 per diluted share up from $0.12 for basic and diluted share in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, that compares with $16 million or $0.04 basic and diluted per share in the second quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis net earnings, excluding charges for special items, or $67 million or $0.17 per basic and diluted share. To take the $67 million in non-GAAP net income and subtract $7.5 million or $1.03 per share for equity base count and that's to be consistent with the way the First Call writers compile and report estimates for Tellabs, the result is $0.16 in non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter of 2010.
Looking at our revenue, on a portfolio basis, revenue from growth products which includes the Tellabs 6300 Managed Transport System, the Tellabs 7100 Optical Transport System, the Tellabs 7300 Ethernet Natural Series, Tellabs 8600 and 8800 Data Series, the Tellabs SmartCore Platform 9100 and professional services grew sequentially in the second quarter to account for 58% of the total revenue, up from 52% in the year-ago quarter and slightly higher than the first quarter of this year.
On a geographic basis, revenue from customers in North America grew to account for 78% of total revenue in the second quarter, up from 72% in the prior quarter. We anticipate that in the third quarter, the split between North America and international revenue will return to the more normal 2/3, 1/3 range we saw through the full year of 2009.
Let's take a look at the segment data for the second quarter. Broadband segment revenue for the second quarter of 2010 was $229 million up 19% from the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, growth in data and Access product revenue offset a slight decline in Managed Access revenue. Data product revenue driven by strong demand in North America, was $159 million in the second quarter of 2010, up 21% from $131 million in the first quarter of 2010.
For the second quarter in a row, the Tellabs 8800 Multiservice Router contributed more revenue than any other product. Both revenue and shipments from our Tellabs SmartCore 9100 platform were up sequentially. Shipments nearly doubled in 2Q over Q1 levels. We anticipate that revenue growth from this product will accelerate in the back half of the year.
Data is our largest product category accounting for 38% of total revenue. Looking at the first six months of 2010, compared with the first six months of last year, data revenue increased about 71% from $170 million to $290 million. Access revenue was $40 million in the second quarter, up 34% from $30 million in the prior quarter driven primarily by an anticipated sequential increase in single-family ONTs.
Turning to the managed access category, revenue in the second quarter of 2010 came in at $30 million consistent with the prior quarter. A slight increase in revenue from the Tellabs 8100 offset a slight decrease in revenue from our Tellabs 6300. Taking all that into account, broadband segment profit for the second quarter of 2010 was $86 million, up from $61 million in the first quarter of this year. Segment profit increased primarily from the higher level of revenue from data products.
In the transport segment, revenue was $133 million in the second quarter, up 4% from $128 million in the prior quarter. We saw increased revenue from both cross-connect systems and optical transport systems on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Transport segment profit driven primarily by the higher level of cross-connect revenue was $52 million in the second quarter, up 14% from $45 million in the prior quarter.
Services segment revenue was $61 million in Q2, essentially consistent with the prior quarter. Services segment profit amounted to $21 million, up from $20 million in the first quarter of 2010.
On a gross margin basis, non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2010 was better than anticipated at 53.8%. That is up 2.9 percentage points from 50.9% in the prior quarter. Gross profit is dependent upon product and customer mix. The shift to this quarter is primarily attributed to two factors. About half of the improvement was related to the higher level of revenue from data products and the balance was related to profitability improvements on optical networking systems and single-family ONTs.
Turning to operating expenses, total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis came in at $134 million, consistent with the prior quarter. That is below our prior guidance due largely to lower than planned R&D spend in the quarter. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the quarter were up slightly at $69 million or slightly more than 16% of revenue. SG&A expenses for the quarter declined to $65 million.
Other income amounted to $5 million in the second quarter compared with $7 million in the prior quarter primarily due to lower interest rates earned during this quarter. Our tax provision on non-GAAP pretax income for the quarter was $32 million for an effective tax rate of 32%. Looking ahead, we expect our effective non-GAAP tax rate for 2010 to be 32%.
I would like to turn to the balance sheet now. During the quarter we generated $110 million in positive cash flow from operations. CapEx was $10 million for the quarter. DSO was 63 days, down from 64 days in the prior quarter. Inventory turns was 5.7 times versus 5.6 at the end of the prior quarter. At the end of the second quarter inventory in terms of dollars was $136 million compared with $129 million at the end of the prior quarter. The increase in inventory is related to increased revenue and our efforts to mitigate the component and supply constraints.
During the quarter we purchased 1.8 million shares of our stock at a cost of $16 million. We also returned almost $8 million to shareholders via our quarterly cash dividend. The actual number of shares outstanding at quarter's end was $385 million. Headcount at the end of the quarter stood at 3300. Book-to-bill was just below one for the quarter and above one for the first six months.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter this year based on orders in 2Q, backlog and given the overall market conditions, we are guiding for third quarter revenue to be in the range between $425 million and $435 million. That is up sequential in what's typically a soft quarter for us. On a year-over-year basis it equates between 9% and 12% growth. We expect gross margin in the third quarter to be 51% plus or minus a point or two, depending again on product mix which we anticipate will shift toward less data revenue and more revenue from optical transport systems and single-family ONTs.
We expect non-GAAP OpEx for the third quarter to be up in dollars to approximately $140 million as we continue to ramp spend on R&D particularly for the SmartCore platform in combination with the anticipated spend on parts and prototypes. In addition, we expect the effective expensing equity based compensation in the third quarter will be about $8 million, split between operating expenses and cost of goods sold.
To recap then, we made solid progress in the second quarter and the first half of 2010. We saw a solid year-over-year revenue growth and we are guiding for the same in the third quarter. Gross margin was up both sequentially and year-over-year. While operating expenses are up on a year-over-year basis in real dollars, we have kept them to a lower percentage of total revenue and we generated $110 million in free cash flow from operations.
Having said that, we will open the floor to your questions. We are ready for the first question.

To that effect, when we look at the gross margins I know a lot of it has to do with mixed outlook but I think one can't help but notice for the past three quarters you pretty much beat gross margins by about 200 basis points.
So can you talk a little bit more about your gross margin guidance about the product mix versus are you building in some conservatism because given your cost restructuring and stuff, it just seems like you guys are really on track to maintaining these high levels of profitability so can you speak to that a little bit more detail?

One thing that we are trying to stress in our gross margin guidance is it is highly dependent on mix. You recall that we have been talking about a potential dip in the third quarter and that's why we went outside our normal guidance and offered guidance on our margins for the full year. The reason we are doing that was just to warn the Street that we saw a shift coming in the third quarter which would have more of our products that while they are improving and their margins are still below corporate average, one of the things that contributed in 2Q was improved profitability of our 7100 system and our single-family ONTs.
So what we saw was a very solid quarter in data. We will have another good quarter in 3Q but not at those levels likely and we see an increase in our business on those two lower margin products. So this is the dip we have been anticipating. If we end up having a stronger quarter in data or cross-connects, we could exceed the margins but we are trying to call them as we see them but as the business is very dependent on mix, the good news is that the mix has come in more favorable than we thought. But we do believe that the growth is going to return to these other products and we expect that away on our margins. So that's why we are providing the guidance we are today.

We're adding headcount in this packet core area and IP area. We've got some exciting prospects for the future. We think we're uniquely qualifying in terms of our install base.

So I believe we're on a steady and secular increase in these margins and we expect to continue to do that albeit slowly, it's kind of a slow battle not anything revolutionary but we just keep chipping away at it and over time you wake up and realize, these things have moved from not very good to at least respectable margins.

We look at the Tellabs' strategic focus on the smart mobile Internet, generated profitable revenue growth again in the third quarter. We had revenue up 10% and we doubled earnings per share compared with the year ago. We'll talk about the fourth quarter in a few minutes.
Over the past two years, we have advanced Tellabs' strategy by focusing our investments in growth products, growth services, and growth markets. That strategy is succeeding because Tellabs has a deep understanding of our customers' networks and their businesses. We've written down innovated new ideas, especially to address the pain points, such as growth of the mobile data traffic, while they have flattening average revenue per user or ARPUs.
We make our solutions work for our customers by combining best-of-breed products with expert professional services. As you know, our customers are building network capacity to keep up with the mobile data traffic growth. Tellabs is strongly positioned in our industry-leading mobile backhaul and increasingly our mobile packet core solutions.
Now let's look at the third quarter. Tellabs' third quarter story is one of strong year-over-year growth in international markets and in data and in transport. For the past couple of years, Tellabs has increased their sales and services resources in international markets. This is no news to any of you. We have particular emphasis in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Now, our international business initiative is clearly taking root.
In the third quarter, Tellabs won a dozen new international customers for our growth products. Year-to-date, 44 new international customers have chosen Tellabs' growth products. We're moving in the right direction.
Our third quarter international bookings were the highest in two years. Our third quarter international revenue rose 14% over a year ago and 42% sequentially, as we had indicated on our previous call.
As our international business gains momentum, Tellabs expects the higher percentage of our fourth quarter orders and revenue to come from international. Tellabs' international business is focused on growth products. About 52% of Tellabs' overall third quarter revenue came from growth products, up from about 45% a year ago.
Our data revenue grew 35% compared with the year-ago and Transport revenue was the strongest in 10 quarters, that's probably since the first quarter of 2008. Our Transport revenue was driven by strong digital cross-connect revenue and record revenue from the Tellabs 7100 Optical Transport System, which is increasingly deployed to enable mobile networks.
Tellabs profits grew in the third quarter. Our GAAP gross profit margins were 50.2%, up from 41.7% a year ago and GAAP earnings were $0.15 a share, up from $0.07 a share a year ago.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter. As we said early, international revenues expected to increase in fourth quarter. North American revenue is forecasted to be down. So in the fourth quarter we expect revenue to be in the range of probably $410 million to $430 million, which is up from $389 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
We expect fourth quarter gross margin to be 44% plus or minus one or two points. It will depend on product mix, but predominantly as a result of anticipated lower cross-connect sales. We expect fourth quarter 2010 non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the mid-to-high $140 million as a result of higher R&D spending predominantly on our growth products. This excludes approximately $6 million in equity-based compensation. In the fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate is going to be 32%.
Now let's look forward. We are determined that Tellabs will compete for and win customers in the mobile backhaul networks and the mobile packet core. We're going to give our customers two transition paths toward Ethernet and fourth-generation wireless; fourth-generation wireless being long-term evolution and WiMAX. We're going to evolve the embedded base and we're going to offer next generation products. 
We're going to offer higher density Ethernet to allow our customers transition to a fourth generation backhaul and the packet core. There's going to be a low risk, lease cost migration to evolve the embedded base. We're also evolving and developing next generation products for Ethernet optimization and 4G mobile backhaul. 
For example, we are extending the 8600 series with two new products announced yesterday. The Tellabs 8609 and 8611 systems are higher density products for Ethernet mobile backhaul and they'll come to market next year in 2011.
The 8609 has 10 gigabits of capacity in one rack unit. That's pretty impressive technology. Looking further into the future, we're working on next generation platforms for the mobile Internet.
To be clear, we're advancing our strategy. It's proven to be successful for Tellabs in the marketplace. We remain confident that Tellabs focus on the smart mobile Internet is the right one, and we're putting more muscle behind the mobile internet as we go forward.
Going forward, we're intensifying our focus on innovative growth products. Today, roughly 85% of our R&D investment goes into growth products. We're hiring all around the world. We're recruiting engineers, sales executives and service professionals who have Ethernet and IP expertise.
Now let's turn to customers. Service providers continue to choose Tellabs to help them succeed with the smart mobile Internet. Today, we are working with about 150 mobile customers around the world.
During the third quarter, the Tellabs 7100 Optical Transport System gained six new customers; two in North America and four in international markets. Last week, we announced our work with Telmex in Chile and as I mentioned other customers.
In the third quarter, the Tellabs 8600 and 8800 systems gained seven new customers. One in North America and six in the international markets and all markets both in Asia-Pac, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and North America. And the Tellabs 9100 SmartCore Platform gained two new customers, both in international. That brings us to a total of 12 SmartCore customers and in addition we keep on working on 20 active trials.
We continue to return capital to shareholders through our share buyback and dividends. During the third quarter Tellabs repurchased about 15.6 million shares at a cost of about $111 million. Over the past five years, we have bought more than 25% of Tellabs shares outstanding. 
Under previously announced Board authorizations, Tellabs still has room to buy around 275 million shares. Tellabs plans to continue returning capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now let's look at the mobile Internet. We're early in the game. Here's why I say that. One, user demands for smartphones and tablets is very strong and data traffic is surging. There is still a lot of room for growth. 
Two, so far, about a 150 mobile carriers have chosen Tellabs to power the mobile Internet. We are offering them two ways to transition to fourth generation networks, as I said a low cost migration in the embedded base and next-generation platforms.
Three, looking ahead at machine-to-machine communications are coming in a big way, as Smart Grids and other applications continue to be deployed. That's why we're confident in Tellabs ability to generate profitable revenue as we help customers succeed with the smart mobile Internet.
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Tim Wiggins, will share detailed results from the quarter and then both of us will take your questions.

To begin with I'd like to make a few observations about the quarter. We saw sequential revenue growth in what a seasonally a lower revenue quarter for us and solid year-over-year revenue growth.Gross margin continu",1553,"Thanks, Rob and good morning everyone. To begin with I'd like to make a few observations about the quarter. We saw sequential revenue growth in what a seasonally a lower revenue quarter for us and solid year-over-year revenue growth.
Gross margin continue to expand on a year-over-year basis. While operating expenses are up on a year-over-year in real dollar terms, we kept them flat as a percent of total revenue, and we generated $74 million in cash from operations, which enables us to pay a dividend and spent a $111 million to repurchase our shares, while maintaining nearly $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let's get to the specifics. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2010 increased to $429 million, up 2% from $423 million in the second quarter of this year and at the mid-point of the guidance range we gave you in July. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue for the quarter was up 10% compared with the third quarter of last year.
On a sequential basis, Transport segment revenue grew, the Service segment was essentially flat, and Broadband segment declined. Within Transport, we saw increased revenue from both digital cross-connect and optical transport systems. Looking at the Broadband segment, sequential growth in access and managed access products was offset by an anticipated decline in data product revenue.
GAAP net earnings were $57 million in the third quarter. That's nearly double the $29 million or $0.07 a share we achieved in the third quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, net earnings for the third quarter of 2010, excluding charges for special items were $59 million or $0.16 per share and $0.15 per diluted share.
If you take $59 million in non-GAAP net income and subtract $7.4 million or $1.03 a share for equity-based comp and that's to be consistent with the way First Call Reuters compiles and reports estimates for Tellabs, the result is $0.14 in diluted non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter.
On a portfolio basis, revenue from our growth portfolio, which includes the Tellabs 6300 Managed Transport System, the Tellabs 7100 Optical Transport System, the Tellabs 7300 Metro Ethernet Switching Series, Tellabs 8600 Managed Edge and Tellabs 8800 Multiservice Router Series, the Tellabs SmartCore 9100 Platform and professional services, accounted for 52% of total revenue in the third quarter. Year-to-date the growth portfolio accounts for 55% of total revenue.
On a geographic basis, revenue from customers outside North America grew as expected to account for 31% of total revenue in the third quarter, up from 22% in the prior quarter.
Let's take a look at the segment data for the third quarter. Broadband segment revenue for the third quarter of 2010 was $199 million and that compares with $229 million in the prior quarter.
Our data product family includes the Tellabs 7300 Metro Ethernet Switching Series, the Tellabs 8600 Managed Edge System, the Tellabs 8800 Multiservice Router and the Tellabs 9100 Platform. The 7300 system, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the platform, is a family of Ethernet aggregation devices that work together with our 8800, 8600 and 7100 platforms to deliver carrier Ethernet services. While revenue from this product was insignificant this quarter, we expect the 7300 will be a growing part of our data portfolio.
Revenue from the data product category was $111 million in the third quarter of 2010. While that's down as anticipated from the record $159 million we achieved in the second quarter of 2010, it's our third best revenue quarter in data. Increased revenue from the Tellabs 8600 Managed Edge Systems was offset by lower revenue from the Tellabs 8800 Multiservice Router product.
Looking at the first nine months of 2010, data continues to be our fastest growing product category. Data revenue grew 59% to $400 million in the first nine months of 2010 compared with the comparable period of last year.
Access revenue grew to $58 million in the third quarter, up 44% from $40 million in the prior quarter. While we saw increased revenue from all products in the access category, the sequential growth was largely driven by an anticipated increase in sales of single-family ONTs.
Turning to the managed access category, revenue in the third quarter of 2010 came in at $30 million consistent with the prior quarter. Higher revenue from our Tellabs 6300 Managed Transport System was offset by lower revenue from the Tellabs 8100 Managed Access System. 
Taking all that into account, Broadband segment profit for the third quarter of 2010, driven primarily by lower level of data revenue, was $49 million compared with $86 million in the prior quarter.
In the Transport segment, revenue grew to $170 million in the third quarter of 2010, up 28% from $133 million in the prior quarter. We saw increased revenue from both digital cross-connect and optical transport systems on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.
Transport segment profit, driven primarily by the higher overall revenue level, was $71 million in the third quarter, up 38% from $52 million in the prior quarter. Services segment revenue was $60 million in 3Q and $61 million in 2Q. Services segment profit amounted to $23 million, up $2 million on lower cost from $21 million in the second quarter of 2010.
On a gross margin basis, non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2010 was 50.5%, that's down 3.3 percentage points from 53.8% in the prior quarter and consistent with the guidance we gave you in July. Gross margin is dependent on product and customer mix, as Rob mentioned. The shift this quarter is attributed to a number of moving pieces, the largest of which was lower level of data product revenue which contributed about 4.5 points of margin decline.
The effective increased revenue from lower margin ONTs and Optical Transport Systems was more than offset by increased revenue from higher-margin digital cross-connect and SDH transport systems. This shift provided about a half a point of improvement. In addition, we saw another half a point of overall margin improvement from higher services gross margin.
Turning to operating expenses, total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis came in $138 million. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the quarter grew to $174 million or slightly more than 17% of revenue. SG&A expenses for the quarter declined to $64 million. Other income amounted to $7 million in the third quarter compared with $5 million in the prior quarter, due largely to gains on sales of marketable securities.
Moving forward, we expect other income in the fourth quarter to decline as a result of lower anticipated gains on the sales of marketable securities. Our tax provision, our non-GAAP pretax income for the quarter was $28 million for an effective tax rate of 32%.
Turning to the balance sheet now, during the quarter we generated $74 million in cash flow from operations. CapEx was $17 million for the quarter and DSO was 63 days consistent with the prior quarter. Inventory turns were 5.8 times up from 5.7 at the end of the second quarter. At the end of the third quarter, inventory in terms of dollars was $142 million compared with $136 million at the end of the prior quarter. The increase in inventory is related to our efforts to mitigate component and supply constraints.
During the quarter, we returned almost $8 million to shareholders via our quarterly cash dividend, at the same time we purchased 15.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of about $111 million. Back in August of $2009, the Board of Directors directed management to actively repurchase 200 million shares of our common stock over the following four quarters.
Since that time, we purchased 29.4 million shares at a cost of $202 million. 275 million remains under previously authorized $600 million repurchase program and we intend to continue to repurchase shares. The actual number of shares outstanding at quarter's end was about 370 million down from 385 million at the end of Q2. Headcount at the end of quarter stood at approximately 3,300. Book-to-bill was just below 1 for the quarter and above 1 for the first nine months of the year.
Turning to our outlook for the final quarter of this year, based on orders in 3Q backlog and given the overall market conditions, we are guiding for fourth quarter revenue to be in a range between $410 million and $430 million. On a year-over-year basis, that equates to between 5% and 10% revenue growth.
We expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be 44%, plus or minus a point or two. A lower level of revenue from digital cross-connect systems drives most of this anticipated change and mix shift within data products and higher revenue from ONTs also contributes to the lower overall gross margin guidance.
We expect non-GAAP OpEx for the fourth quarter to be up in dollars and land in the mid-to-high $140 million range, as we continue to spend on R&D particularly for growth products in combination with the anticipated spend on parts and prototypes. In addition, we expect the effective expensing equity-based compensation in the fourth quarter will be about $6 million split between operating expenses and cost of goods sold.
Having said all that, we're now ready to open the floor to your questions. Susan, we're ready for the first question.

We expect that our cross-connects will be down more than slightly. In fact, they're likely going to be somewhere in the range of about half of what they were in the third quarter. If you look at our Transport segment, which was nearly a $170 million in 3Q our current information suggest that Transport segment would be similar to levels that we saw in 2Q of 2010, which is in the mid-130 range. So with that exception of weakness in the cross-connect, we see strength in the 7100 and we see potentially growth in each of our other categories, access, managed access, and data, between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So this is very much a cross-connect story in the fourth quarter, and that's why we've also had a significant change to our margin guidance in the fourth quarter as well.

Those of you that follow the story recall that as we went around and people asked us what we thought our steady state margin was. A year ago, I would tell people somewhere in the range where we were, but we quickly always add that our business is a function of mix. 
We have a series of products there at margins above our corporate average and several that are below and depending on how that mix was playing out, in terms of your question in 2010, it was a combination of strong sales of our data products where we saw a significant growth in combination with some growth in our cross-connects, and so I wouldn't call it abnormal, I think it's a function of what customers' needs are and what kind of mix of our products are we selling. So, the 4Q you are seeing a significant fall off of the cross-connects as we mentioned and growth of the other product categories. 
So in terms of next year, I wish I knew. We certainly didn't anticipate the kind of slowdown that we're guiding toward in the fourth quarter. So it's a little hard for us to digest or to tell. But certainly, it's a function of what kinds of mixes we're seeing and I guess that's what they pay you guys the big bucks for as to make those assumptions in your model.

A lower level of revenue from digital cross-connect systems drives most of this change, I think a little over five points. When I'm to say a mix shift within data products, as I mentioned, we see more 86 than 88 and higher revenue from ONTs also contributes to the overall gross margin guidance. I think the combination is about a point. So we're talking a little over 6 out of the 6.5 in those three board items. Hopefully that's helpful.

So, this third quarter set of data that you're seeing here has our concentration very similar in total amounts to where it was at the end of last year, down significantly from 2Q, just was the difference between which customer is the largest and which one is the second largest.

The 8800 has had higher concentration given a certain deployments the 8600 tends to be a lot more customers and smaller deployments. So, if this plays out the way we think which means we see growth in data in 4Q, we'd also see a lot of growth in the 8600 which I mentioned has a small mix impact on our 4Q margins.
