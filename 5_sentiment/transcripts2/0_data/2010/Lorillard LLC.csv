Lorillard’s financial and marketplace results achieved in 2009 were very positive in our opinion given the unprecedented increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes that occurred in April of 2009. As a result of",831,"Thanks David. Good morning everyone. Lorillard’s financial and marketplace results achieved in 2009 were very positive in our opinion given the unprecedented increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes that occurred in April of 2009. As a result of this increase, as well as the state excise tax increases, we believe that consumption patterns were disrupted and that a degree of down trading occurred affecting the premium price brand segment.
On an overall basis, this is evident in the decline of the industry’s domestic wholesale shipments during 2009 versus 2008 of 8.6% as well as a shift of approximately just over 200 basis points of these shipments from premium brands to price-discounted brands. Despite the challenges that faced the industry and our company, Lorillard’s operating income gain of 8.9% in 2009 over 2008 reflects the strength of the company’s brand portfolio (inaudible) Newport’s leading menthol brand retail share position and average profitable unit volume gains in the discount segment.
Newport achieved a 10.28% retail share of the domestic market; a gain of 0.36 points in 2009 versus 2008 and Maverick gained almost 0.5 share point resulting in a 1.14% share of the retail market for 2009. These results reflect a consistency of Lorillard’s longstanding strategic objective of balancing profitability and Newport’s market share growth. We will continue to follow this path as we move into 2010, and we will also continue to monitor our performance variable, and the industry and brand trends to ensure we are in a position to make adjustments to our promotional plans as may be appropriate. Although industry wholesale shipments were off 8.6% and there was one last shipping day in 2009 versus 2008 on an adjusted basis that was 8.2% versus 2008. Lorillard outperformed its major competitors with a decline of 3.9% unadjusted or 3.5% at the wholesale level adjusted for the same period.
Newport’s wholesale shipments were down 6.6% on an adjusted basis and 6.9% unadjusted in 2009 versus 2008. According to our proprietary retail database, Newport achieved a 35% share of the menthol segment, which reflected an increase of 0.5 segment share point in 2009 versus 2008. This performance was due solely to organic growth of the brand i.e. without line extensions or steps of promotional support. I would also like to announce today that Lorillard will be entering into the moist smokeless tobacco market in the not-too-distant future. And we look forward to further extending our participation in that growing segment of the tobacco category.
Lastly, I would like to briefly comment on an issue that is on the minds of many investors these days and that is the FDA’s regulatory authority and its upcoming review of the use of menthol in cigarettes. As you know, the FDA will empower a Scientific Advisory Committee to review the signs relating to the health effects of menthol as a flavoring in cigarettes. The panel is likely to be named shortly and we expect that its first meeting may be somewhere in the March timeframe of this year. As we said before, we believe that the weight of the scientific evidence does not support a conclusion that menthol cigarettes confer greater health risks than non-menthol cigarettes. We also believe that the Scientific Advisory Committee will indeed form its conclusion and recommendations based on scientific evidence before it. We therefore continue to believe that the Scientific Advisory Committee will not make a recommendation to the FDA that it banned menthol.
Furthermore under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the FDA must take into account other information in connection with its decision on whether or how to regulate all cigarettes, regular or menthol, including specifically weather event or other limitations would lead to, and I quote “the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the standard set by the FDA for tobacco products. We believe that a ban on menthol would indeed lead to a massive black market for contraband mentholated cigarettes and encourage the entry of totally unregulated products into the marketplace that would not meet even the basic standards for product integrity and quality.
There has been much speculation in the hypothesis offered for who may comprise the membership of the committee, or on how the committee process will unfold, or on what evidence they will reach a conclusion, or what that conclusion might be, and what the FDA will eventually do in response to the committee’s recommendation whatever that might be. Of course all of this speculation is based almost entirely on conjecture. So we must avoid jumping to conclusions and use speculation with an appropriate attitude. We expect that the process will proceed with the appropriate respect for the science and an appropriate assessment of all other public policies issues involved. Nothing we have seen or heard has changed or believed that a ban on menthol products is highly unlikely.
And now I am going to turn the proceedings back to David Taylor.

I will spend a few minutes reviewing the numbers and then we will open the line for questions.Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1.378 billion compared to $1.088 billion in fourth quarter of 2008. Excludi",898,"Thanks Marty and good morning again. I will spend a few minutes reviewing the numbers and then we will open the line for questions.
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1.378 billion compared to $1.088 billion in fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding excise taxes, net sales increased $20 million or 2.2% from $912 million to $932 million. There are a number of factors that play impacting net sales for the quarter. Higher net average selling prices were positive but were largely offset by total unit volume and a less favorable product mix along with the impact of higher sales promotional cost, which are accounted for as a reduction in net sales.
The impact of Maverick's significant growth combined with Newport’s unit volume decline has resulted in a less favorable and profitable mix in 2009 than in 2008. This growth in the price/value brand as a percentage of our total will tend to dampen the net revenues per pack if one were to calculate that in simple arithmetic. Maverick units accounted for over 10% of our total unit volume compared to roughly 7.25% last year. For all of 2009, net sales were $5.233 billion compared to $4.204 billion for 2008. Excluding excise taxes the net increase in sales in 2009 amounted to $194 million or 5.6%.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter 2009 declined by $12 million to $481 million or 51.6% of sales excluding excise taxes from $493 million or 54.1% of sales excluding excise taxes in the fourth quarter of 2008. While the 51.6% gross margin is lower than our 2008 fourth quarter, it is in line with and approximate our 2009 annual gross margin rates of 51.7%. Gross profit per unit shipped in the fourth quarter of 2009 is up 1.7% from last year’s fourth quarter as the impact of price increases was largely offset by the impact in the mix shift I mentioned a minute ago, the higher promotional spending, and the increases in our manufacturing and settlement costs.
As we reported in prior quarters, cost of goods sold in 2009 has been impacted by higher raw material costs, higher pension costs, the new added DAVs [ph] and the impact of the excise tax on our LIFO inventory valuations. Our wrapping costs were also up in 2009 as we moved more production towards cigarettes that comply with the lower ignition propensity standards. And now 100% of our production is compliant with these standards. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $17 million compared to last year’s fourth quarter as a result of the inflation factors in those agreements and the increase in our market share. The impact of the lower industry unit volume did not fully offset these things.
I should point out that although wholesale inventory fluctuations did not play a significant role in comparing our fourth quarter volumes, the significant disruption we saw in the first two quarters of 2009 as a result of last April’s federal excise taxes increases will impact our quarterly volume comparisons in the first half of 2010.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $4 million to $83 million in fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is primarily the result of higher legal and pension costs in 2009 compared to 2008. As in prior quarters, we continued to incur higher defense costs for the Engle progeny cases underway in Florida among other things.
Operating income declined 3.9% to $398 million from 42.7% of sales excluding taxes in the fourth quarter of 2009 from $414 million or 45.4% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating income per unit shipped remained roughly flat with last year’s fourth quarter. Interest expense fell $9 million in fourth quarter of 2009 and reflects the interest expense on our $750 million senior notes issued net of the effect of the interest rate swap we entered into in the third quarter. Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 37.9%, the same as in 2008, but up slightly from the third quarter and the annual effective rate due to certain state tax expenses.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $242 million or $1.52 per share compared to $258 million or $1.53 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Now, for the year ended December of 2009, net sales excluding excise taxes increased 5.6% from roughly $3.7 billion in 2009 from roughly $3.5 billion in 2008. Operating income increased 8.9% to $1.541 billion from $1.415 billion last year. Earnings per share were up 11.8% in 2009 to $5.76 a share compared to $5.15 last year. The $0.61 per share improvement in EPS in 2009 includes positive impact of the lower average share count and the impact of lower average share count is $0.25 a share.
The $750 million share repurchase program that the company announced last summer has now been completed. Under that program as of January 19, the company repurchased an aggregate of 9.8 million shares at an average purchase price of $76.80 per share for the total of $750 million. So cumulatively from the data separation, the separation from Lowe’s, we have repurchased 19.3 million shares for approximately 11.1% of the additional issue.
With that, I would like to open the line for questions. Operator, you can help us.

It was through a double landing, if you will, in a relatively short period of time. I do believe longer term, I hope actually and believe, that there should be a degree of stabilization that might occur. So I think a lot of the down trading is a byproduct of the combination of economic factors as well as pricing shift. Even though we all recognize that the gap between high and low price brands actually narrowed on a percentage basis, I think that clearly we are now looking and have witnessed a degree of the so called flicker shot [ph] factor. I hope so that even though the GAAP is not - the GAAP was pretty important for many years, it still is important, I would not minimize it but I think that your (inaudible) that occurred earlier last year.

When you talk about MSA per unit, again there is a number of things going on there. Remember the higher our market share and the higher our profitability, the higher our MSA per unit. And in addition, remember if you just compare an MSA per unit in the fourth quarter of last year, you may recall that the first three quarters of 2008, we were accruing at a higher assumed inflation rate than what we really had.

It could be used for share repurchases or as you know any other good corporate purpose. As soon as we know Thilo, you will know.

So, we will have and I am not going to discuss what our projected sort of cost factors may or may not be for this thing.
We will manage the process, we do not envision it to have a certainly not initially any sort of substantial, material impact on our financials. We will manage it as we manage all other things. I think we were in the Snus tech market for a couple of years and it did not bankrupt us. So there should be no fear that we are going to take our eye off the ball. Our core strategy remains that it is, it is centered on cigarettes. We are entering into the moist smokeless market. It is simply what we looked at as a said earlier, an opportunistic situation for us. We think we can generate some business there and certainly we hope it would be incremental to what we have today.

Lorillard’s very positive first quarter 2010 results fundamentally reflects consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand Newport. As many of you are aware there is a degree of noise surrounding the cigarette industry and individual company unit shipping patterns comparing quarter-over-quarter performance. When gauging Lorillard’s relative performance within the industry in terms of market and segment share and operating profit per thousand cigarettes shipped, it is clear that Lorillard’s continues to achieve a solid balance between profitability and marketplace share results.
I am not going to get into too much detail regarding the reasons for the wholesale inventory differences between the first quarters of 2010 and 2009 other than to acknowledge that Lorillard was affected by the upward adjustments of wholesale inventories during the first quarter of 2010 and that has tended to distort our wholesale shipment comparisons with the first quarter of 2009 in the manner not too similar to some of our competitors.
Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers increased their purchases at levels above what we believe the demand trends would imply. Consequently, it is believed that some of this excess inventory at the pipeline will be flushed out in the not too distant future.
We would further anticipate that the second quarter of 2010 will have its own unique set of variables affecting comparisons between that quarter and the second quarter of 2009. As such, we would suggest that any observations regarding industry and company trends for 2010 as compared with the prior year be deferred until a full six months worth of data is available for 2010 and then compare it with first six months of 2009.
Present impulses on unit volume numbers and rate of change to subject to any number of distortion. We think it is more constructive to briefly review share of market data that is more indicative of relative market performance. And during the first quarter of 2010, Lorillard achieved its highest retail share of 12.61% , an overall increase of 1.17 market share point lead by Newport 10.9% share of market, a gain of 0.75 points and Maverick’s 1.37% share of the retail market, an increase of 0.44 point when compared with the first quarter of 2009.
Newport gained 1.21 menthol segment share points in the first quarter of ‘10 over the first quarter of 2009 reaching a share of 36 points almost 5% of the menthol segment for the quarter. Viewing our retail data sequentially between the fourth quarter of ’09 and the first quarter of ’10, a positive pattern emerges. Lorillard increased its domestic retail share by 0.67 points and Newport was up 0.58 points.
And Lorillard was the only major company to increase both its retail share and rate of volume change between the fourth and the first quarter as I just mentioned
Lorillard’s operating income per thousand cigarettes shipped achieved for the first quarter of 2010 was $43.10 per thousand versus Philip Morris USA at 36.87 and RJR at $27.06. These results reflect percent increases over the first quarter of ’09 of 16.1%, 7.5% and 6.7% respectively to each company.
While we are very pleased with our results for the first quarter of this year, as they do reflect solid fundamentals for the business, we obviously have to look at the first quarter of last year and the second quarter of ’09 that were greatly affected by the events leading up to an out of the timing for the April Federal Excise tax increase creating a very difficult basis for comparing year-over-year results, however we do feel that we are well positioned to effectively compete in this environment and continue our strategy of balancing Newport’s market share performance and operate - and optimizing profitability.
Now, I’ll turn the discussion over to David Taylor who will review our financials for you.

I’ll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers and then we’ll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to 917 million for the first quarter of 2009.Exclud",793,"Thank you and good morning. I’ll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers and then we’ll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to 917 million for the first quarter of 2009.
Excluding excise taxes, net sales increased by $156 million or 20.3% from 767 million to 923 million. Total wholesale shipments increased 12.1% compared to last year’s first quarter. Higher average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for the reduction of net sales also contributed to the increase in net sales.
Of course, as Martin pointed out, simple comparison to last year can be misleading. This year not only did we not see the kind of cash driven inventory reduction that occurred in last year’s first quarter, we saw wholesale inventory fill during the quarter further skewing reasonable comparisons.
As we look into our upcoming second quarter, the impact of the wholesale inventory rebuild in last year’s second quarter will obviously negatively impact volume and if the wholesale inventory increase that occurred in this year’s first quarter that I mentioned just a moment ago reverses itself, as Marty mentioned, this comparability issue will be even more dramatic.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2010 increased by $95 million to $478 million or 51.8% of sales, excluding excise tax from $383 million or 49.9% of sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter of last year. (inaudible) first quarter of 2010 as compared to first quarter of 2009 reflects increases for certain raw material cost such as tobacco and wrapping costs and the new FDA fees.
Amount due under the state settlement agreements increased $29 million compared to last year’s first quarter as a result of the unit volume increase and the inflation factors in those agreements. Those increases were partially offset by certain other favorable adjustments in the quarter. Selling general and administrative costs increased 7 million to 96 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of higher personnel costs, compensation and healthcare costs combined with an increase in legal cost in 2010 when compared to 2009. As in prior quarters, the continuing defense costs for the Engle progeny in cases underway in Florida impacted this quarter and will be with us for quite some time.
First quarter operating income increased roughly 30% to 382 million or 41.4% of sales excluding excise taxes from 294 million or 38.3% of net sales excluding excise taxes in last year’s first quarter. Operating income per unit shipped increased approximately 16% compared with last year’s first quarter, a reflection of the higher unit volume this year.
Interest expense totaled $10 million for the first quarter of this year and reflect interest expense on our $750 million note this year, net of the effect of the interest rate swap that we entered in the third quarter of last year. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 37.8%, slightly more than the 37.7% that we saw in 2009. As a result of the passage of the much publicized healthcare bill which included a review of the tax benefits related to the Medicare part B subsidies, income tax expense include the one-time charge of $2 million. This increase was partly offset by an increase in the manufacturers deduction in 2010 compared to 2009. We estimate that the effective income tax rate for the year will approximate 37.4%.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was 232 million or $1.50 per share compared to $184 million or a $9 per share in the first quarter 2009. The $0.41 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of a lower average share count which amounts to about $0.12 a share. Another word of caution. As a we did a comparisons of volumes in the first quarters of 2010 to last year is tricky and can lead to erroneous conclusions both about volume and about earnings trends.
In February, we announced a $250 million share repurchase program and during the quarter we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock in open market transaction at an average price of $75.50 per share. As of March, 31, 2010 we had approximately $136 million remaining for repurchases under that program, which is still underway.
I know many of you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of the recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity, but as of this date I cannot comment on what, when or how much the Board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future.
With that I would like to open the line for questions, Alisha?

I think it is a continuation of our strategy as we said in our release and I think I said it in my own comments, the execution of our strategy which is the - very targeted with respect to where we support the Newport brand and market-by-market and conceivably certain decisions made by our competitors that are helping us is of course helping themselves.
But beyond that nothing has changed for us. We have consistently executed, our target marketing approach, reduction in spending by that I mean promotion support for Newport in select markets based on their potential for profitable return or share growth.
Obviously it continues to work well for us. With respect to the excess inventory in the system, we estimate there’s about 200 million units, mostly Newport that will - that are in the system that are likely to be flushed out as I indicated sometime in the second quarter. Hard to say when, we don’t know specifically what the motivation of the purchases - behind the purchases were, but if it was related to price then somebody is holding on in until they might see a price increase. But we don’t know that for a fact.

I think each company has its own unique set of issues, at least each major company has its unique set of issues that make it difficult from - at this stage of the game to sort of step back and look at it and say here it is kind of where it is heading.
I still think that we are going to be slightly worse than the industry. We will be slightly worse than historical trends with respect to overall shipment declines 2010 versus 2009. What the magic percentage is? I don’t know, actually I think somewhere in the range of 4% to 5%. I don’t know how accurate that is. It is still very difficult to surmise what is actually going to happen out there.
We had some noise in the first quarter from the volume standpoint, not only because of the upward adjustment on the wholesale inventory side, but because one of our major competitors introduced a line extension and it had a huge impact unit volume wise on the industry downwards, obviously. It inflated the universe [ph].

Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.
As many of you are aware, there's a degree of noise surrounding the cigarette industry and individual company unit shipment patterns, comparing quarter-over-quarter performance. When gauging Lorillard's relative performance within the industry in terms of market and segment shares and operating profit per thousand cigarettes shipped, it is clear that Lorillard continues to achieve a solid balance between profitability and market pledge share results.
I'm not going to get into too much detail regarding the reasons for the wholesale inventory differences between the first quarters of 2010 and 2009, other than to acknowledge that Lorillard was affected by the upward adjustment to wholesale inventories during the first quarter of 2010 and that tended to distort our wholesale shipment comparisons with the first quarter of 2009 in a manner not dissimilar to some of our competitors.
Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers increased their purchases at levels above what we believe the demand trends would imply. Consequently, it is believed that some of this excess inventory in the pipeline will be flushed out in the not-too-distant future. We would further anticipate that the second quarter of 2010 will have its own unique set of variables affecting comparisons between that quarter and the second quarter of 2009. As such, we would suggest that any observations regarding industry & company trends for 2010 as compared with the prior year be deferred until a full six months worth of data is available for 2010 and then compare with the first six months of 2009.
Let me focus on unit volume numbers and rates of change that's subject to any number of distortions. We think it more constructive to briefly review share of market data that is more indicative of relative market performance. And during the first quarter of 2010, Lorillard achieved its highest retail share of 12.61%, an overall increase of 1.17 market share points. Led by Newport, 10.9% share of market, a gain of 0.75 points and Maverick's 1.37% share of the retail market, an increase of 0.44 points when compared with the first quarter of 2009. Newport gained 1.21 menthol segment share points in the first quarter of '10 over the first quarter of 2009, reaching a share of 36 points, almost 5% of the menthol segment for the quarter.
Doing our retail data, sequentially, between the fourth quarter of '09 and the first quarter of '10, a positive pattern emerges. Lorillard increased its domestic retail share by 0.27 points and Newport was up 0.58 points. Lorillard was the only major company to increase or hold steady both its retail share and rate of volume change between the fourth and the first quarters just mentioned. Lorillard's operating income per 1,000 units shipped achieved for the first quarter of 2010 was $43.10 per 1,000 versus Phillip Morris USA, $36.87 and RJR's $27.06.
These results reflect percent increases over the first quarter of '09 of 16.1%, 7.5% and 6.7% respectively to each company. While we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter of this year, as they do reflect solid fundamentals for the business, we obviously have to look at the first quarter of last year and the second quarter of '09 that were greatly affected by events leading up to an out of the timing for the April federal excise tax increase, creating a very difficult basis for comparing year-over-year results. However, we do feel that we are well-positioned to effectively compete in this environment and continue our strategy of balancing Newport's market share performance and optimizing profitability. And now, I'll turn the discussion over to David Taylor who will review our financials for you."

I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding",794,"Thank you and good morning. I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding excise taxes, net sales increased by $156 million or 20.3% from $767 million to $923 million. Total wholesale shipments increased 12.1% compared to last year's first quarter. Higher average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for this reduction of net sales also contributed to the increase in net sales.
Of course, as Marty pointed out, simple comparisons to last year can be misleading. This year, not only did we not see the kind of tax driven inventory reduction that occurred in last year's first quarter, we saw wholesale inventories built during the quarter, further skewing reasonable comparisons. As we look into our upcoming second quarter, the impact of the wholesale inventory rebuild in last year's second quarter will obviously negatively impact volume comparisons. And if the wholesale inventory increase that occurred in this year's first quarter that was mentioned just a moment ago reverses itself, as Marty mentioned, this comparability issue will be even more dramatic.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2010 increased by $95 million to $478 million or 51.8% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $383 million or 49.9% of sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter last year. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009 reflect increases for certain raw material costs such as tobacco and wrapping costs and a new FDA fee.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $29 million compared to last year's first quarter as a result of a unit volume increase and the inflation factors in those agreements. Both increases were partially offset by certain other favorable adjustments in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million to $96 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of higher personnel costs, compensation in healthcare costs combined with an increase in legal costs in 2010 compared to 2009. As in prior quarters, the continuing defense costs for the Engle Progeny Cases underway in Florida impacted this quarter and will be with us for quite some time. First quarter operating income increased roughly 30% to $382 million or 41.4% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $294 million or 38.3% of net sales excluding excise taxes in last year's first quarter. Operating income per unit shipped increased approximately 16% compared with last year's first quarter, a reflection of the higher unit volume this year.
Interest expense totaled $10 million for the first quarter of this year and reflects interest expense on our $750 million notes issue, net of the effect of the interest rate swap that we entered in the third quarter of last year. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 37.8%, slightly more than the 37.7% that we saw in 2009. As a result of the passage of the much-publicized health care bill, which included a repeal of the tax benefits related to the Medicare Part D subsidies, income tax expense includes a one-time charge of $2 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the manufactures deduction in 2010 compared to 2009. We estimate that the effective income tax rate for the year will approximate 37.4%.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $232 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $184 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The $0.41 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of a lower average share count, which amounts to about $0.12 a share. Another word of caution, as we've said, comparisons of volumes in the first two quarters of 2010 to last year are tricky and can lead to erroneous conclusions both about volume and about earnings trends.
In February, we announced the $250 million share repurchase program and during the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock in open market transactions  at average price of $75.60 per share. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately $136 million remaining for repurchases under that program, which is still underway. I know many of you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of the recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity, but as of this date visit, I cannot comment on what, when or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future. With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Alicia?"

They're not a byproduct of line extending, filling pipelines with new versions of Newport. I think it's a continuation of our strategy, as we said in our release and I think I said in my own comments, the execution of our strategy, which is to be very targeted with respect to where we support the Newport brand and market by market and conceivably, certain decisions made by our competitors that are helping us as opposed to helping themselves. But beyond that, nothing's changed for us. We've consistently executed our target-marketed approach to investment spending, and by that I mean, promotion support for Newport in select markets, based on their potential for profitable return of share growth. And that's obviously it continues to work well for us. With respect to the excess inventory in the system, we estimate that it's about $200 million units, mostly Newport that are in the system that are likely to be flushed out as I indicated sometime in the second quarter. It's hard to say when. We don't know specifically what the motivation of the purchases, behind the purchases were, but if it was related to price then somebody's holding on until there might be a price increase. But we don't know that for a fact."

Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.As many of you are aware, there's a",635,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.
As many of you are aware, there's a degree of noise surrounding the cigarette industry and individual company unit shipment patterns, comparing quarter-over-quarter performance. When gauging Lorillard's relative performance within the industry in terms of market and segment shares and operating profit per thousand cigarettes shipped, it is clear that Lorillard continues to achieve a solid balance between profitability and market pledge share results.
I'm not going to get into too much detail regarding the reasons for the wholesale inventory differences between the first quarters of 2010 and 2009, other than to acknowledge that Lorillard was affected by the upward adjustment of wholesale inventories during the first quarter of 2010, and that tended to distort our wholesale shipment comparisons with 
the first quarter of 2009 in a manner not dissimilar to some of our competitors.
Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers increased their purchases at levels above what we believe the demand trends would imply. Consequently, it is believed that some of this excess inventory in the pipeline will be flushed out in the not-too-distant future. We would further anticipate that the second quarter of 2010 will have its own unique set of variables affecting comparisons between that quarter and the second quarter of 2009. As such, we would suggest that any observations regarding industry and company trends for 2010 as compared with the prior year be deferred until a full six months worth of data is available for 2010 and then compare with the first six months of 2009.
Let me then focus on unit volume numbers and rate of change that's subject to any number of distortion. We think it more constructive to briefly review share of market data that is more indicative of relative market performance. And during the first quarter of 2010, Lorillard achieved its highest retail share of 12.61%, an overall increase of 1.17 market share points, led by Newport, 10.9% share of market, a gain of 0.75 points; and Maverick's 1.37% share of the retail market, an increase of 0.44 points when compared with the first quarter of 2009. Newport gained 1.21 menthol segment share points in the first quarter of '10 over the first quarter of 2009, reaching a share of 36 points, almost 5% of 
the menthol segment for the quarter.
Viewing our retail data, sequentially, between the fourth quarter of '09 and the first quarter of '10, a positive pattern emerges. Lorillard increased its domestic retail share by 0.67 points, and Newport was up 0.58 points. Lorillard was the only major company to increase or hold steady both its retail share and rate of volume change between the fourth and the first quarters just mentioned. Lorillard's operating income per 1,000 units shipped achieved for the first quarter of 2010 was $43.10 per 1,000 versus Philip Morris USA, $36.87, and RJR's $27.06.
These results reflect percent increases over the first quarter of '09 of 16.1%, 7.5% and 6.7%, respectively to each company. While we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter of this year, as they do reflect solid fundamentals for the business, we obviously have to look at the first quarter of last year and the second quarter of '09 
that were greatly affected by events leading up to an out of the timing for the April federal excise tax increase, creating a very difficult basis for comparing year-over-year results. However, we do feel that we are well positioned to effectively compete in this environment and continue our strategy of balancing Newport's market share performance and optimizing profitability. And now I'll turn the discussion over to David Taylor who will review our financials for you."

Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding excise taxes, net sales increased by $156 million or 20.3% from $767 million to $923 million. Total wholesale shipments increased 12.1% compared to last year's first quarter. Higher average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a  reduction of net sales also contributed to the increase in net sales.
Of course, as Marty pointed out, simple comparisons to last year can be misleading. This year, not only did we not see the kind of tax-driven inventory reduction that occurred in last year's first quarter, we saw wholesale inventories build during the quarter, further skewing reasonable comparisons. As we look into our upcoming second quarter, the 
impact of the wholesale inventory rebuild in last year's second quarter will obviously negatively impact volume comparisons. And if the wholesale inventory increase that occurred in this year's first quarter that was mentioned just a moment ago reverses itself, as Marty mentioned, this comparability issue will be even more dramatic.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2010 increased by $95 million to $478 million or 51.8% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $383 million or 49.9% of sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter last year. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009 reflect increases for certain raw material costs 
such as tobacco and wrapping costs and a new FDA fee.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $29 million compared to last year's first quarter as a result of a unit volume increase and the inflation factors in those agreements. Both increases were partially offset by certain other favorable adjustments in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million to $96 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of higher personnel costs, compensation in healthcare costs combined with an increase in legal costs in 2010 compared to 2009. As in prior quarters, the continuing 
defense costs for the Engle Progeny Cases underway in Florida impacted this quarter and will be with us for quite some time. First quarter operating income increased roughly 30% to $382 million or 41.4% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $294 million or 38.3% of net sales excluding excise taxes in last year's first quarter. Operating income per unit 
shipped increased approximately 16% compared with last year's first quarter, a reflection of the higher unit volume this year.
Interest expense totaled $10 million for the first quarter of this year and reflects interest expense on our $750 million notes issue, net of the effect of the interest rate swap that we entered in the third quarter of last year. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 37.8%, slightly more than the 37.7% that we saw in 2009. 
As a result of the passage of the much-publicized health care bill, which included a repeal of the tax benefits related to the Medicare Part D subsidies, income tax expense includes a one-time charge of $2 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the manufactures deduction in 2010 compared to 2009. We estimate that the effective income tax rate for the year will approximate 37.4%.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $232 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $184 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The $0.41 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of a lower average share count, which amounts to about $0.12 a share. Another word of caution, as we've said, comparisons of volumes in 
the first two quarters of 2010 to last year are tricky and can lead to erroneous conclusions both about volume and about earnings trends.
In February, we announced the $250 million share repurchase program and during the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock in open market transactions at average price of $75.60 per share. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately $136 million remaining for repurchases under that program, which is still underway. I know many of 
you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of the recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity, but as of this date visit, I cannot comment on what, when or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future. With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Alicia?"

They're not a by-product of line extending and filling pipelines with the new versions of Newport. I think it's a continuation of our strategy, as we said in our release and I think I said in my own comments, the execution of our strategy, which is to be very targeted with respect to where we support the Newport brand and market by market and conceivably, certain decisions made by our competitors that are helping us as opposed to helping themselves. But beyond that, nothing's changed for us. We've consistently executed our target-marketed approach to investment spending, and by that, I mean promotion support for Newport in select markets based on their potential for profitable return of share growth. And that's -- obviously, it continues to work well for us. With respect to the excess inventory in the system, we estimate that it's about 200 million units, mostly Newport that are in the system that are likely to be flushed out, as I indicated, sometime in the second quarter. It's hard to say when. We don't know specifically what the motivation of the purchases, behind the purchases were, but if it was related to price, then somebody's holding on until there might be a price increase.

I still think that we're going to be slightly worse than the industry. We'll be slightly worse than historical trends, with respect to overall shipment decline for 2010 versus 2009, with the magic percentages, I don't know. I've said somewhere in the range of 4% to 5%. I don't know how accurate that is. It's still very difficult to surmise what is actually going to happen out there.

Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.As many of you are aware, there's a",635,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.
As many of you are aware, there's a degree of noise surrounding the cigarette industry and individual company unit shipment patterns, comparing quarter-over-quarter performance. When gauging Lorillard's relative performance within the industry in terms of market and segment shares and operating profit per thousand cigarettes shipped, it is clear that Lorillard continues to achieve a solid balance between profitability and market pledge share results.
I'm not going to get into too much detail regarding the reasons for the wholesale inventory differences between the first quarters of 2010 and 2009, other than to acknowledge that Lorillard was affected by the upward adjustment of wholesale inventories during the first quarter of 2010, and that tended to distort our wholesale shipment comparisons with 
the first quarter of 2009 in a manner not dissimilar to some of our competitors.
Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers increased their purchases at levels above what we believe the demand trends would imply. Consequently, it is believed that some of this excess inventory in the pipeline will be flushed out in the not-too-distant future. We would further anticipate that the second quarter of 2010 will have its own unique set of variables affecting comparisons between that quarter and the second quarter of 2009. As such, we would suggest that any observations regarding industry and company trends for 2010 as compared with the prior year be deferred until a full six months worth of data is available for 2010 and then compare with the first six months of 2009.
Let me then focus on unit volume numbers and rate of change that's subject to any number of distortion. We think it more constructive to briefly review share of market data that is more indicative of relative market performance. And during the first quarter of 2010, Lorillard achieved its highest retail share of 12.61%, an overall increase of 1.17 market share points, led by Newport, 10.9% share of market, a gain of 0.75 points; and Maverick's 1.37% share of the retail market, an increase of 0.44 points when compared with the first quarter of 2009. Newport gained 1.21 menthol segment share points in the first quarter of '10 over the first quarter of 2009, reaching a share of 36 points, almost 5% of 
the menthol segment for the quarter.
Viewing our retail data, sequentially, between the fourth quarter of '09 and the first quarter of '10, a positive pattern emerges. Lorillard increased its domestic retail share by 0.67 points, and Newport was up 0.58 points. Lorillard was the only major company to increase or hold steady both its retail share and rate of volume change between the fourth and the first quarters just mentioned. Lorillard's operating income per 1,000 units shipped achieved for the first quarter of 2010 was $43.10 per 1,000 versus Philip Morris USA, $36.87, and RJR's $27.06.
These results reflect percent increases over the first quarter of '09 of 16.1%, 7.5% and 6.7%, respectively to each company. While we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter of this year, as they do reflect solid fundamentals for the business, we obviously have to look at the first quarter of last year and the second quarter of '09 
that were greatly affected by events leading up to an out of the timing for the April federal excise tax increase, creating a very difficult basis for comparing year-over-year results. However, we do feel that we are well positioned to effectively compete in this environment and continue our strategy of balancing Newport's market share performance and optimizing profitability. And now I'll turn the discussion over to David Taylor who will review our financials for you."

I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding",794,"Thank you and good morning. I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding excise taxes, net sales increased by $156 million or 20.3% from $767 million to $923 million. Total wholesale shipments increased 12.1% compared to last year's first quarter. Higher average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a  reduction of net sales also contributed to the increase in net sales.
Of course, as Marty pointed out, simple comparisons to last year can be misleading. This year, not only did we not see the kind of tax-driven inventory reduction that occurred in last year's first quarter, we saw wholesale inventories build during the quarter, further skewing reasonable comparisons. As we look into our upcoming second quarter, the 
impact of the wholesale inventory rebuild in last year's second quarter will obviously negatively impact volume comparisons. And if the wholesale inventory increase that occurred in this year's first quarter that was mentioned just a moment ago reverses itself, as Marty mentioned, this comparability issue will be even more dramatic.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2010 increased by $95 million to $478 million or 51.8% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $383 million or 49.9% of sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter last year. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009 reflect increases for certain raw material costs 
such as tobacco and wrapping costs and a new FDA fee.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $29 million compared to last year's first quarter as a result of a unit volume increase and the inflation factors in those agreements. Both increases were partially offset by certain other favorable adjustments in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million to $96 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of higher personnel costs, compensation in healthcare costs combined with an increase in legal costs in 2010 compared to 2009. As in prior quarters, the continuing 
defense costs for the Engle Progeny Cases underway in Florida impacted this quarter and will be with us for quite some time. First quarter operating income increased roughly 30% to $382 million or 41.4% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $294 million or 38.3% of net sales excluding excise taxes in last year's first quarter. Operating income per unit 
shipped increased approximately 16% compared with last year's first quarter, a reflection of the higher unit volume this year.
Interest expense totaled $10 million for the first quarter of this year and reflects interest expense on our $750 million notes issue, net of the effect of the interest rate swap that we entered in the third quarter of last year. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 37.8%, slightly more than the 37.7% that we saw in 2009. 
As a result of the passage of the much-publicized health care bill, which included a repeal of the tax benefits related to the Medicare Part D subsidies, income tax expense includes a one-time charge of $2 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the manufactures deduction in 2010 compared to 2009. We estimate that the effective income tax rate for the year will approximate 37.4%.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $232 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $184 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The $0.41 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of a lower average share count, which amounts to about $0.12 a share. Another word of caution, as we've said, comparisons of volumes in 
the first two quarters of 2010 to last year are tricky and can lead to erroneous conclusions both about volume and about earnings trends.
In February, we announced the $250 million share repurchase program and during the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock in open market transactions at average price of $75.60 per share. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately $136 million remaining for repurchases under that program, which is still underway. I know many of 
you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of the recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity, but as of this date visit, I cannot comment on what, when or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future. With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Alicia?"

They're not a by-product of line extending and filling pipelines with the new versions of Newport. I think it's a continuation of our strategy, as we said in our release and I think I said in my own comments, the execution of our strategy, which is to be very targeted with respect to where we support the Newport brand and market by market and conceivably, certain decisions made by our competitors that are helping us as opposed to helping themselves. But beyond that, nothing's changed for us. We've consistently executed our target-marketed approach to investment spending, and by that, I mean promotion support for Newport in select markets based on their potential for profitable return of share growth. And that's -- obviously, it continues to work well for us. With respect to the excess inventory in the system, we estimate that it's about 200 million units, mostly Newport that are in the system that are likely to be flushed out, as I indicated, sometime in the second quarter. It's hard to say when. We don't know specifically what the motivation of the purchases, behind the purchases were, but if it was related to price, then somebody's holding on until there might be a price increase. But we don't know that for a fact."

I don't know how accurate that is. It's still very difficult to surmise what is actually going to happen out there.

Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.As many of you are aware, there's a",635,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.
As many of you are aware, there's a degree of noise surrounding the cigarette industry and individual company unit shipment patterns, comparing quarter-over-quarter performance. When gauging Lorillard's relative performance within the industry in terms of market and segment shares and operating profit per thousand cigarettes shipped, it is clear that Lorillard continues to achieve a solid balance between profitability and market pledge share results.
I'm not going to get into too much detail regarding the reasons for the wholesale inventory differences between the first quarters of 2010 and 2009, other than to acknowledge that Lorillard was affected by the upward adjustment of wholesale inventories during the first quarter of 2010, and that tended to distort our wholesale shipment comparisons with the first quarter of 2009 in a manner not dissimilar to some of our competitors.
Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers increased their purchases at levels above what we believe the demand trends would imply. Consequently, it is believed that some of this excess inventory in the pipeline will be flushed out in the not-too-distant future. We would further anticipate that the second quarter of 2010 will have its own unique set of variables affecting comparisons between that quarter and the second quarter of 2009. As such, we would suggest that any observations regarding industry and company trends for 2010 as compared with the prior year be deferred until a full six months worth of data is available for 2010 and then compare with the first six months of 2009.
Let me then focus on unit volume numbers and rate of change that's subject to any number of distortion. We think it more constructive to briefly review share of market data that is more indicative of relative market performance. And during the first quarter of 2010, Lorillard achieved its highest retail share of 12.61%, an overall increase of 1.17 market share points, led by Newport, 10.9% share of market, a gain of 0.75 points; and Maverick's 1.37% share of the retail market, an increase of 0.44 points when compared with the first quarter of 2009. Newport gained 1.21 menthol segment share points in the first quarter of '10 over the first quarter of 2009, reaching a share of 36 points, almost 5% of the menthol segment for the quarter.
Viewing our retail data, sequentially, between the fourth quarter of '09 and the first quarter of '10, a positive pattern emerges. Lorillard increased its domestic retail share by 0.67 points, and Newport was up 0.58 points. Lorillard was the only major company to increase or hold steady both its retail share and rate of volume change between the fourth and the first quarters just mentioned. Lorillard's operating income per 1,000 units shipped achieved for the first quarter of 2010 was $43.10 per 1,000 versus Philip Morris USA, $36.87, and RJR's $27.06.
These results reflect percent increases over the first quarter of '09 of 16.1%, 7.5% and 6.7%, respectively to each company. While we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter of this year, as they do reflect solid fundamentals for the business, we obviously have to look at the first quarter of last year and the second quarter of '09 that were greatly affected by events leading up to an out of the timing for the April federal excise tax increase, creating a very difficult basis for comparing year-over-year results. However, we do feel that we are well positioned to effectively compete in this environment and continue our strategy of balancing Newport's market share performance and optimizing profitability. And now I'll turn the discussion over to David Taylor who will review our financials for you."

I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding",794,"Thank you and good morning. I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding excise taxes, net sales increased by $156 million or 20.3% from $767 million to $923 million. Total wholesale shipments increased 12.1% compared to last year's first quarter. Higher average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a  reduction of net sales also contributed to the increase in net sales.
Of course, as Marty pointed out, simple comparisons to last year can be misleading. This year, not only did we not see the kind of tax-driven inventory reduction that occurred in last year's first quarter, we saw wholesale inventories build during the quarter, further skewing reasonable comparisons. As we look into our upcoming second quarter, the impact of the wholesale inventory rebuild in last year's second quarter will obviously negatively impact volume comparisons. And if the wholesale inventory increase that occurred in this year's first quarter that was mentioned just a moment ago reverses itself, as Marty mentioned, this comparability issue will be even more dramatic.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2010 increased by $95 million to $478 million or 51.8% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $383 million or 49.9% of sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter last year. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009 reflect increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and a new FDA fee.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $29 million compared to last year's first quarter as a result of a unit volume increase and the inflation factors in those agreements. Both increases were partially offset by certain other favorable adjustments in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million to $96 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of higher personnel costs, compensation in healthcare costs combined with an increase in legal costs in 2010 compared to 2009. As in prior quarters, the continuing defense costs for the Engle Progeny Cases underway in Florida impacted this quarter and will be with us for quite some time. First quarter operating income increased roughly 30% to $382 million or 41.4% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $294 million or 38.3% of net sales excluding excise taxes in last year's first quarter. Operating income per unit 
shipped increased approximately 16% compared with last year's first quarter, a reflection of the higher unit volume this year.
Interest expense totaled $10 million for the first quarter of this year and reflects interest expense on our $750 million notes issue, net of the effect of the interest rate swap that we entered in the third quarter of last year. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 37.8%, slightly more than the 37.7% that we saw in 2009. 
As a result of the passage of the much-publicized health care bill, which included a repeal of the tax benefits related to the Medicare Part D subsidies, income tax expense includes a one-time charge of $2 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the manufactures deduction in 2010 compared to 2009. We estimate that the effective income tax rate for the year will approximate 37.4%.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $232 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $184 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The $0.41 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of a lower average share count, which amounts to about $0.12 a share. Another word of caution, as we've said, comparisons of volumes in the first two quarters of 2010 to last year are tricky and can lead to erroneous conclusions both about volume and about earnings trends.
In February, we announced the $250 million share repurchase program and during the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock in open market transactions at average price of $75.60 per share. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately $136 million remaining for repurchases under that program, which is still underway. I know many of you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of the recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity, but as of this date visit, I cannot comment on what, when or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future. With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Alicia?"

They're not a by-product of line extending and filling pipelines with the new versions of Newport. I think it's a continuation of our strategy, as we said in our release and I think I said in my own comments, the execution of our strategy, which is to be very targeted with respect to where we support the Newport brand and market by market and conceivably, certain decisions made by our competitors that are helping us as opposed to helping themselves. But beyond that, nothing's changed for us. We've consistently executed our target-marketed approach to investment spending, and by that, I mean promotion support for Newport in select markets based on their potential for profitable return of share growth. And that's -- obviously, it continues to work well for us. With respect to the excess inventory in the system, we estimate that it's about 200 million units, mostly Newport that are in the system that are likely to be flushed out, as I indicated, sometime in the second quarter. It's hard to say when. We don't know specifically what the motivation of the purchases, behind the purchases were, but if it was related to price, then somebody's holding on until there might be a price increase.

I think each company has its own unique set of issues. Each major company has its unique set of issues that make it difficult at this stage of the game to sort of step back and look at it and say here's kind of where it's heading. I still think that we're going to be slightly worse than the industry. We'll be slightly worse than historical trends, with respect to overall shipment decline for 2010 versus 2009, with the magic percentages, I don't know. I've said somewhere in the range of 4% to 5%. I don't know how accurate that is. It's still very difficult to surmise what is actually going to happen out there. We had some noise in the first quarter from a volume standpoint, not only because of the upward adjusted on the wholesale inventories side, but because one of our major competitors introduced a line extension and had a huge impact, unit volume wise, on the industry numbers obviously.

Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.As many of you are aware, there's a",635,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Lorillard's very positive first quarter 2010, results fundamentally reflect consistent execution of our business strategy and the underlying strength of our flagship brand, Newport.
As many of you are aware, there's a degree of noise surrounding the cigarette industry and individual company unit shipment patterns, comparing quarter-over-quarter performance. When gauging Lorillard's relative performance within the industry in terms of market and segment shares and operating profit per thousand cigarettes shipped, it is clear that Lorillard continues to achieve a solid balance between profitability and market pledge share results.
I'm not going to get into too much detail regarding the reasons for the wholesale inventory differences between the first quarters of 2010 and 2009, other than to acknowledge that Lorillard was affected by the upward adjustment of wholesale inventories during the first quarter of 2010, and that tended to distort our wholesale shipment comparisons with the first quarter of 2009 in a manner not dissimilar to some of our competitors.
Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers increased their purchases at levels above what we believe the demand trends would imply. Consequently, it is believed that some of this excess inventory in the pipeline will be flushed out in the not-too-distant future. We would further anticipate that the second quarter of 2010 will have its own unique set of variables affecting comparisons between that quarter and the second quarter of 2009. As such, we would suggest that any observations regarding industry and company trends for 2010 as compared with the prior year be deferred until a full six months worth of data is available for 2010 and then compare with the first six months of 2009.
Let me then focus on unit volume numbers and rate of change that's subject to any number of distortion. We think it more constructive to briefly review share of market data that is more indicative of relative market performance. And during the first quarter of 2010, Lorillard achieved its highest retail share of 12.61%, an overall increase of 1.17 market share points, led by Newport, 10.9% share of market, a gain of 0.75 points; and Maverick's 1.37% share of the retail market, an increase of 0.44 points when compared with the first quarter of 2009. Newport gained 1.21 menthol segment share points in the first quarter of '10 over the first quarter of 2009, reaching a share of 36 points, almost 5% of the menthol segment for the quarter.
Viewing our retail data, sequentially, between the fourth quarter of '09 and the first quarter of '10, a positive pattern emerges. Lorillard increased its domestic retail share by 0.67 points, and Newport was up 0.58 points. Lorillard was the only major company to increase or hold steady both its retail share and rate of volume change between the fourth and the first quarters just mentioned. Lorillard's operating income per 1,000 units shipped achieved for the first quarter of 2010 was $43.10 per 1,000 versus Philip Morris USA, $36.87, and RJR's $27.06.
These results reflect percent increases over the first quarter of '09 of 16.1%, 7.5% and 6.7%, respectively to each company. While we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter of this year, as they do reflect solid fundamentals for the business, we obviously have to look at the first quarter of last year and the second quarter of '09 that were greatly affected by events leading up to an out of the timing for the April federal excise tax increase, creating a very difficult basis for comparing year-over-year results. However, we do feel that we are well positioned to effectively compete in this environment and continue our strategy of balancing Newport's market share performance and optimizing profitability. And now I'll turn the discussion over to David Taylor who will review our financials for you."

I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding",794,"Thank you and good morning. I'll spend the next few minutes talking about the numbers, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.36 billion compared to $917 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding excise taxes, net sales increased by $156 million or 20.3% from $767 million to $923 million. Total wholesale shipments increased 12.1% compared to last year's first quarter. Higher average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a  reduction of net sales also contributed to the increase in net sales.
Of course, as Marty pointed out, simple comparisons to last year can be misleading. This year, not only did we not see the kind of tax-driven inventory reduction that occurred in last year's first quarter, we saw wholesale inventories build during the quarter, further skewing reasonable comparisons. As we look into our upcoming second quarter, the impact of the wholesale inventory rebuild in last year's second quarter will obviously negatively impact volume comparisons. And if the wholesale inventory increase that occurred in this year's first quarter that was mentioned just a moment ago reverses itself, as Marty mentioned, this comparability issue will be even more dramatic.
Gross profit in the first quarter of 2010 increased by $95 million to $478 million or 51.8% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $383 million or 49.9% of sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter last year. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009 reflect increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and a new FDA fee.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $29 million compared to last year's first quarter as a result of a unit volume increase and the inflation factors in those agreements. Both increases were partially offset by certain other favorable adjustments in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million to $96 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of higher personnel costs, compensation in healthcare costs combined with an increase in legal costs in 2010 compared to 2009. As in prior quarters, the continuing defense costs for the Engle Progeny Cases underway in Florida impacted this quarter and will be with us for quite some time. First quarter operating income increased roughly 30% to $382 million or 41.4% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $294 million or 38.3% of net sales excluding excise taxes in last year's first quarter. Operating income per unit shipped increased approximately 16% compared with last year's first quarter, a reflection of the higher unit volume this year.
Interest expense totaled $10 million for the first quarter of this year and reflects interest expense on our $750 million notes issue, net of the effect of the interest rate swap that we entered in the third quarter of last year. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 37.8%, slightly more than the 37.7% that we saw in 2009. 
As a result of the passage of the much-publicized health care bill, which included a repeal of the tax benefits related to the Medicare Part D subsidies, income tax expense includes a one-time charge of $2 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the manufactures deduction in 2010 compared to 2009. We estimate that the effective income tax rate for the year will approximate 37.4%.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $232 million or $1.50 per share, compared to $184 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The $0.41 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of a lower average share count, which amounts to about $0.12 a share. Another word of caution, as we've said, comparisons of volumes in the first two quarters of 2010 to last year are tricky and can lead to erroneous conclusions both about volume and about earnings trends.
In February, we announced the $250 million share repurchase program and during the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock in open market transactions at average price of $75.60 per share. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately $136 million remaining for repurchases under that program, which is still underway. I know many of you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of the recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity, but as of this date visit, I cannot comment on what, when or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future. With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Alicia?"

They're not a by-product of line extending and filling pipelines with the new versions of Newport. I think it's a continuation of our strategy, as we said in our release and I think I said in my own comments, the execution of our strategy, which is to be very targeted with respect to where we support the Newport brand and market by market and conceivably, certain decisions made by our competitors that are helping us as opposed to helping themselves. But beyond that, nothing's changed for us. We've consistently executed our target-marketed approach to investment spending, and by that, I mean promotion support for Newport in select markets based on their potential for profitable return of share growth. And that's -- obviously, it continues to work well for us. With respect to the excess inventory in the system, we estimate that it's about 200 million units, mostly Newport that are in the system that are likely to be flushed out, as I indicated, sometime in the second quarter. It's hard to say when. We don't know specifically what the motivation of the purchases, behind the purchases were, but if it was related to price, then somebody's holding on until there might be a price increase.

And any speculation that might grow out of that posturing, the reality is as we've said repeatedly, the weight of the evidence from an demonological standpoint and other aspects of studies that have been conducted would not reflect that menthol is any different in terms of its effect on the public health than non-menthol cigarettes are.

It's been pretty much consistent frankly, for the last year or so. So there's really nothing of any major consequence promotionally that's affecting the business. To be honest with you, Judy, it's very difficult to reach a conclusion as I think I've indicated, with respect to where the trends are, with respect to the industry itself. I think each company has its own unique set of issues. Each major company has its unique set of issues that make it difficult at this stage of the game to sort of step back and look at it and say here's kind of where it's heading. I still think that we're going to be slightly worse than the industry. We'll be slightly worse than historical trends, with respect to overall shipment decline for 2010 versus 2009, with the magic percentages, I don't know. I've said somewhere in the range of 4% to 5%. I don't know how accurate that is. It's still very difficult to surmise what is actually going to happen out there. We had some noise in the first quarter from a volume standpoint, not only because of the upward adjusted on the wholesale inventories side, but because one of our major competitors introduced a line extension and had a huge impact, unit volume wise, on the industry numbers obviously. It inflated the [indiscernible]. So it's real tough at this stage of the game to determine where it's going to come out."

We’re pleased with the company’s performance for both the second quarter and the first six months of 2010. Lorillard and the Newport brand achieved record wholesale and retail shipment market share, and the company’s domestic wholesale unit volume performance outperformed the industry when comparing 2010 with 2009 for the second quarter and the first 6 months of the year. 
As most of you are aware, comparing performance trends for the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 is difficult on face value and can be misleading due to distortions in wholesale and retail trade inventory purchase behavior, which resulted from the effect of the federal excise tax increase that occurred on April 1 last year. As such, a clearer picture of market performance is reflected in the first six month comparison each year, which will tend to wash out the anomalies that occurred in 2009. 
Total Lorillard domestic wholesale shipment unit volume increased 5.3% in the first half of 2010 versus 2009, compared with an industry decline of 4.9% for the same period. Newport was up 2.5% for the same six months of comparison. Wholesale shipment domestic market share for Lorillard increased by 1.10 points for the first six months of 2010, resulting in a total share of 12.16% and Newport shipment share of the domestic market for the first half of 2010 was 10.44%, an increase of 0.75 points over the first half of 2009.
At the retail level, based on our data, Newport achieved a 10.93% share in the first six months of this year, an increase of 0.66 points over the same period in 2009. (Inaudible) grew 0.44 points for the same period with comparison, achieving a 1.44 retail share of market. 
Lorillard’s performance for the first six months of 2010 reflects a continuation of the success of our core business strategy of balancing Newport’s market share performance and profitability. 
And now I’d like to turn it over to David Taylor for a recap of our financial performance.

I’ll briefly review the results and then we’ll open the line for questions. Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $1.52 billion, compared to $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Roughly flat",780,"Thanks Marty, and good morning everyone. I’ll briefly review the results and then we’ll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $1.52 billion, compared to $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Roughly flat with last year’s second quarter. 
In last quarter’s call, we pointed out that the disruptions in shipment patterns caused by last year’s federal excise tax increase make quarter to quarter comparisons for 2009 tricky, and cautioned that a better comparison would be the first six months of 2010. When we look at the first six months, our net sales, excluding excise taxes, increased 8.8% to $1.96 billion from $1.8 billion last year. 
Total wholesale shipments declined by just under 1% for the second quarter, but increased 4.9% for the six month period. Higher net average selling prices for the second quarter essentially offset the effects of the lower volume mix and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales. When these higher average selling prices are compounded by an increase in volume, such as we saw for the six-month period, the result is the almost 9% increase in net sales before excise taxes. 
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2010 declined by $10 million to $542 million, or 52.2% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $552 million or 53.4% of sales excluding excise taxes in the second quarter of 2009. 
Cost of sales in the second quarter of 2010 reflect increases for certain raw materials costs such as tobacco and wrapping costs and the new FDA fees when compared to last year’s second quarter, the same sorts of dynamics we saw in the first quarter. Amounts due under the state settlement agreements increased $4 million compared to last year’s second quarter as a result of the inflation factors in those agreements, which was partially offset by volume and market share adjustments.
Selling, general, and administrative costs remained roughly flat, increasing $1 million to $97 million in the second quarter of 2010 from last year’s $96 million. 
Second quarter operating income decreased roughly 2.4% to $445 million, or 2.9% of sales excluding excise taxes, from $456 million, or 44.1% of net sales excluding excise taxes in last year’s second quarter.
When the first six months of 2010 are compared to the same period last year, you see an increase in operating income of over 10% to $827 million from $751 million last year. Operating income per unit shipped for the six-month period increased approximately 5% compared to the first half of last year.
Interest expense totaled $28 million in the second quarter of 2010 and reflects interest expense on our senior notes net of the effect of the interest rate swap which lowered our interest expense by $6 million in the second quarter.
Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 37.1%, the same as last year’s quarter, and we currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the full year will approximate 37.2%.
Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $263 million or $1.73 per share compared to $286 million or $1.71 per share in the second quarter of 2009. 
Earnings per share for the first six months of 2010 was $3.22 per diluted share compared to $2.80 per diluted share for the first six months of last year. The $0.42 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of the lower average share count, which amounted to about $0.28 per share.
As we have said, comparisons of volumes in the first two quarters of 2010 to last year can be confusing. So we think investors and others should look at the first half of 2010 and compare it to last year. When those comparisons are made, with most of the noise surrounding last year’s excise tax increase equalized, the picture is impressive: a unit volume increase of almost 5%, a sales increase of almost 9%, an operating income increase of 10%, and an EPS increase of 15%. A successful first half by almost any measure. 
In February, we announced a $250 million share repurchase program, which was completed during the quarter after having purchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76.29 under that program.
I know that many of you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of our recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity, but as of this date I cannot comment on what, when, or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future.
With that, I’d like to open the line for questions. Madge, could you do that for us?

I don’t really know what it is. As I said, it wasn’t very significant, and I don’t think that the early buying in the second quarter for the third quarter is going to have any sort of real material impact on third-quarter numbers. 
And we have not seen, yet, any effects of consumer takeaway based on the pricing that’s now in effect in New York City and New York State. So, right now we perform pretty well in the past following excise tax increases in New York State, some of which have been rather substantial in nature. 
Again, that’s not a guarantee that the future will perform the same way, but clearly, and it’s not an encouraging situation to be in with the kinds of increases that took place in New York, but nonetheless, we have to view it as we do excise tax increases in any state. There tends to be an adjustment on the part of consumers over time. 
We may, may, and I emphasize that, see some negative impact in the short term at some point following this excise tax increase, but we’re reasonably confident that over time we will perform reasonably well. Our market share in New York State has actually been growing rather substantially over the past couple of years, even in light of what took place following all of those tax increases. 
So we’re very cautious about what the situation is there and feel reasonably confident that it will not have a major, major impact on us.

We’re wondering about ourselves when they’re going to look at it since it’s written into the law and it’s a critical component for consideration and evaluation of the effects of any decision made regarding menthol. We’ve been encouraging the FDA to keep this as a major agenda item. We don’t know yet when they will get to it or how they will view it. So that’s a big unknown at this point although at some point in time it must be taken into account. So while it has not been done in the first two meetings, we fully expect at some point it will be an item for discussion and an item that must be taken seriously in their deliberations on the issue. 
You asked about expectations, we don’t have any expectation necessarily of outcomes here. The only thing I can say about the first two sessions that occurred, or the first two meetings that occurred by the panel is that there were really no surprises. I think I said that following the initial meeting of the FDA group earlier this year. The script for many of the cast of scientists that are on the panel is fairly consistent with most of their past expressions and articulations of their views. 
To be honest with you I think it’s a little disappointing that some members of the panel are not necessarily pursuing the issue on the basis of discovering facts and validating facts. It seems that some tend to just regurgitate things that they’ve said in the past without really looking at the science necessarily. And this is not a surprise. I think we need to wait and as this process unfolds, and see where it goes. So we don’t have any expectations at this point.

We are pleased with the company's performance about  the second quarter and the first six months of 2010. Lorillard and the Newport brand achieved record wholesale and retail shipment market shares, and the company's domestic wholesale unit volume performance outperformed the industry when comparing 2010 with 2009 for the second quarter and the first six months of the year. 
As most of you are aware, comparing performance trends for the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 is difficult on face value and can be misleading due to distortions in wholesale and retail trade inventory purchase behavior, which resulted from the effects of the federal excise tax increases that occurred on April 1 last year. As such, a clearer picture of the market performance is reflected in the first six-month comparisons each year, which will tend to wash out the anomalies that occurred in 2009. 
Total Lorillard domestic wholesale shipment unit volume increased 5.3% in the first half of 2010 versus 2009 compared with an industry decline of 4.9% for the same period. Newport was up 2 1/2% for the same six-month period of comparison. Wholesale shipment domestic market share for Lorillard increased by 1.10 points for the first six months of 2010, resulting in a total share of 12.16%, and Newport shipment share of the domestic market for the first half of 2010 was 10.44%, an increase of 0.75 points over the first half of 2009. 
At the retail level, based on our data, Newport achieved a 10.93% share in the first six months of this year, an increase 0.66 points over the same period in 2009. Maverick grew 0.44 points for the same periods of comparison, achieving a 1.44% retail share of market. Lorillard's performance for the first six months of 2010 reflects the continuation of the success of our core business strategy of balancing Newport's market share performance and profitability. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to David Taylor for a recap of our financial performances."

I'll briefly review the results, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $1.52 billion compared to $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009, roughly flat wi",781,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly review the results, and then we'll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $1.52 billion compared to $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009, roughly flat with last year's second quarter. In last quarter's call, we pointed out that the disruptions in shipment patterns caused by last year's federal excise tax increase, make quarter-to-quarter comparisons of 2009 tricky and cautions that a better comparison would be the first six months of 2010. 
When we look at the first six months, our net sales, excluding excise taxes, increased 8.8% to $1.96 billion from $1.8 billion last year. Total wholesale shipments declined by just under 1% for the second quarter but increased 4.9% for the six-month period. Higher net average selling prices during the second quarter essentially offset the effects of the lower volume mix and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales. When these higher average selling prices are compounded by an increase in volume, such as we saw for the first six-month period, the result is the almost 9% increase in net sales before excise taxes.
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2010 declined by $10 million to $542 million or 52.2% of sales, excluding excise taxes again, from $552 million or 53.4% of sales, excluding excise taxes, in the second quarter of 2009. Cost of sales in the second quarter of 2010 reflect increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and the new FDA fees, when compared to last year's second quarter, the same sorts of dynamics that we saw in the first quarter. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $4 million when compared to last year's second quarter as a result of the inflation factors in those agreements, which was partially offset by volume and market share adjustments. 
Selling, general and administrative costs remain roughly flat, increasing $1 million to $97 million in the second quarter of 2010 from last year's $96 million.
Second quarter operating income decreased roughly 2.4% to $445 million or 42.9% of sales, excluding excise taxes, from $456 million or 44.1% of net sales, excluding excise taxes, in last year's second quarter. When the first six months of 2010  are compared to the same period last year, you see an increase in operating income of over 10% to $827 million from $751 million last year. Operating income per unit shipped for the six-month period increased approximately 5% compared to the first half of last year. Interest expense totaled $28 million in the second quarter of 2010 and reflects interest expense on our senior notes, net of the effect of the interest rate swap, which lowered our interest expense by $6 million in the second quarter.
Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 37.1%, the same as last year's quarter, and we currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the full year will approximate 37.2%. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $263 million or $1.73 per share compared to $286 million or $1.71 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Earnings per share for the first six months of 2010 was $3.22 per diluted share compared to $2.80 per diluted share for the first six months of last year. The $0.42 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of the lower average share count, which amounted to about $0.28 a share.
As we have said, comparisons of volumes in the first two quarters of 2010 to last year can be confusing, so we think investors and others should look at the first half of 2010 and compare it to last year. When those comparisons are made, with most of the noise surrounding last year's excise tax increase equalized, the picture is impressive: a unit volume increase of almost 5%, a sales increase of almost 9%, an operating income increase of 10% and an EPS increase of 15%, a successful first half by almost any measure.
In February, we announced the $250 million share repurchase program, which was completed during the quarter, after having purchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76.29 under that program. 
I know that many of you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of our recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity. But as of this date, I cannot comment on what, when or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future. 
With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Madge, could you do that for us?"

Again, that's not a guarantee that the future will perform the same way, but clearly, and it's not an encouraging situation to be in with the kinds of increases that took place in New York. But nonetheless, we have to view it as we do excise tax increases in any state. There tends to be an adjustment on the part of consumers over time. We may, may, and I emphasize that, see some negative impact in the short term at some point, following this excise tax increase, but we're reasonably confident that over time, we will perform reasonably well.

Although, at some point in time, it must be taken into account. So whether it's been -- while it has not been done in the first two meetings, we fully expect at some point, it will be an item for discussion and an item that must be taken seriously in their deliberations on the issue. You've asked about expectation. We don't have any expectation necessarily of the outcomes here. The only thing I can say about the first two sessions that occurred or the first two meetings that occurred by the panel is that there are really no surprises. I think I said that following the initial meeting of the FDA group earlier this year. The script for many of the cast of scientists that were on the panel is fairly consistent with most of their past expressions and articulations of their views. To be honest with you, I think it's a little disappointing that some members of the panel are not necessarily pursuing the issue on the basis of discovering facts and validating facts. It seems that some tend to just refer to take things that they've said in the past without really looking at the science necessarily. And this is not a surprise. I think we need to wait as this process unfolds and see where it goes. So we don't have any expectation at this point."

We are pleased with the company's performance about  the second quarter and the first six months of 2010.

We are pleased with the company's performance about  the second quarter and the first six months of 2010. Lorillard and the Newport brand achieved record wholesale and retail shipment market shares, and the company's domestic wholesale unit volume performance outperformed the industry when comparing 2010 with 2009 for the second quarter and the first six months of the year. 
As most of you are aware, comparing performance trends for the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 is difficult on face value and can be misleading due to distortions in wholesale and retail trade inventory purchase behavior, which resulted from the effects of the federal excise tax increases that occurred on April 1 last year. As such, a clearer picture of the market performance is reflected in the first six-month comparisons each year, which will tend to wash out the anomalies that occurred in 2009. 
Total Lorillard domestic wholesale shipment unit volume increased 5.3% in the first half of 2010 versus 2009 compared with an industry decline of 4.9% for the same period. Newport was up 2 1/2% for the same six-month period of comparison. Wholesale shipment domestic market share for Lorillard increased by 1.10 points for the first six months of 2010, resulting in a total share of 12.16%, and Newport shipment share of the domestic market for the first half of 2010 was 10.44%, an increase of 0.75 points over the first half of 2009. 
At the retail level, based on our data, Newport achieved a 10.93% share in the first six months of this year, an increase 0.66 points over the same period in 2009. Maverick grew 0.44 points for the same periods of comparison, achieving a 1.44% retail share of market. Lorillard's performance for the first six months of 2010 reflects the continuation of the success of our core business strategy of balancing Newport's market share performance and profitability. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to David Taylor for a recap of our financial performances."

I'll briefly review the results, and then we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $1.52 billion compared to $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009, roughly flat wi",781,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly review the results, and then we'll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $1.52 billion compared to $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009, roughly flat with last year's second quarter. In last quarter's call, we pointed out that the disruptions in shipment patterns caused by last year's federal excise tax increase, make quarter-to-quarter comparisons of 2009 tricky and cautions that a better comparison would be the first six months of 2010. 
When we look at the first six months, our net sales, excluding excise taxes, increased 8.8% to $1.96 billion from $1.8 billion last year. Total wholesale shipments declined by just under 1% for the second quarter but increased 4.9% for the six-month period. Higher net average selling prices during the second quarter essentially offset the effects of the lower volume mix and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales. When these higher average selling prices are compounded by an increase in volume, such as we saw for the first six-month period, the result is the almost 9% increase in net sales before excise taxes.
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2010 declined by $10 million to $542 million or 52.2% of sales, excluding excise taxes again, from $552 million or 53.4% of sales, excluding excise taxes, in the second quarter of 2009. Cost of sales in the second quarter of 2010 reflect increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and the new FDA fees, when compared to last year's second quarter, the same sorts of dynamics that we saw in the first quarter. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements increased $4 million when compared to last year's second quarter as a result of the inflation factors in those agreements, which was partially offset by volume and market share adjustments. 
Selling, general and administrative costs remain roughly flat, increasing $1 million to $97 million in the second quarter of 2010 from last year's $96 million.
Second quarter operating income decreased roughly 2.4% to $445 million or 42.9% of sales, excluding excise taxes, from $456 million or 44.1% of net sales, excluding excise taxes, in last year's second quarter. When the first six months of 2010  are compared to the same period last year, you see an increase in operating income of over 10% to $827 million from $751 million last year. Operating income per unit shipped for the six-month period increased approximately 5% compared to the first half of last year. Interest expense totaled $28 million in the second quarter of 2010 and reflects interest expense on our senior notes, net of the effect of the interest rate swap, which lowered our interest expense by $6 million in the second quarter.
Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 37.1%, the same as last year's quarter, and we currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the full year will approximate 37.2%. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $263 million or $1.73 per share compared to $286 million or $1.71 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Earnings per share for the first six months of 2010 was $3.22 per diluted share compared to $2.80 per diluted share for the first six months of last year. The $0.42 improvement in EPS in 2010 includes the positive impact of the lower average share count, which amounted to about $0.28 a share.
As we have said, comparisons of volumes in the first two quarters of 2010 to last year can be confusing, so we think investors and others should look at the first half of 2010 and compare it to last year. When those comparisons are made, with most of the noise surrounding last year's excise tax increase equalized, the picture is impressive: a unit volume increase of almost 5%, a sales increase of almost 9%, an operating income increase of 10% and an EPS increase of 15%, a successful first half by almost any measure.
In February, we announced the $250 million share repurchase program, which was completed during the quarter, after having purchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76.29 under that program. 
I know that many of you will want to know whether we intend to use the proceeds of our recently completed bond offering to further increase our share repurchase activity. But as of this date, I cannot comment on what, when or how much the board may authorize the company to repurchase in the future. 
With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Madge, could you do that for us?"

And we have not seen yet any effects of consumer takeaway based on the pricing that's now in effect in New York City and New York State. So right now, we've performed pretty well in the past following excise tax increases in New York State, some of which have been rather substantial in nature. Again, that's not a guarantee that the future will perform the same way, but clearly, and it's not an encouraging situation to be in with the kinds of increases that took place in New York. But nonetheless, we have to view it as we do excise tax increases in any state. There tends to be an adjustment on the part of consumers over time. We may, may, and I emphasize that, see some negative impact in the short term at some point, following this excise tax increase, but we're reasonably confident that over time, we will perform reasonably well. Our market share in New York State has actually been growing rather substantially over the past couple of years, even in light of what took place following all of those tax increases. So we're very cautious about what the situation is there and feel reasonably confident that it will not have a major, major impact on this."

So whether it's been -- while it has not been done in the first two meetings, we fully expect at some point, it will be an item for discussion and an item that must be taken seriously in their deliberations on the issue. You've asked about expectation. We don't have any expectation necessarily of the outcomes here. The only thing I can say about the first two sessions that occurred or the first two meetings that occurred by the panel is that there are really no surprises. I think I said that following the initial meeting of the FDA group earlier this year. The script for many of the cast of scientists that were on the panel is fairly consistent with most of their past expressions and articulations of their views. To be honest with you, I think it's a little disappointing that some members of the panel are not necessarily pursuing the issue on the basis of discovering facts and validating facts. It seems that some tend to just refer to take things that they've said in the past without really looking at the science necessarily. And this is not a surprise. I think we need to wait as this process unfolds and see where it goes. So we don't have any expectation at this point."

What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST. For those of you don't know me, I look forward to getting to know you",1681,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST. For those of you don't know me, I look forward to getting to know you as quickly as possible. But for now, know this, as has always been the case in the past, you can expect my management team and me to be accessible, transparent and relentlessly focused on building shareholder value. 
Some initial observations after my first six weeks in the job. I'd always admired Lorillard as an outsider, and as a result, has high expectations walking in the door. Those expectations have been dramatically exceeded, as I have gotten to know the business and the talented people that work at the company. It's a tribute to my predecessor, Marty Orlowsky. He has much to be proud of.
Having the unique perspective of having worked at several top consumer packaged goods companies in general and tobacco specifically, I can tell you that there is something very different about Lorillard that in my opinion, makes it a standout performer. First and foremost, the underlying volume trend on our lead brand, Newport, is organic and long term. There is no chase for volume, scrambling the launch of new products or quarter-end promotions. Newport sales today almost the same number of sticks it did 10 years ago, while during the same time, the industry has declined 27%. And as you saw in our release, Newport volume this year is growing, up 2.6% through nine months.
It is my opinion that this growth stems from the superior product, consistent message and a carefully crafted regional promotional strategy that ensures Newport remains price competitively. With the backdrop of a solid organic growth trend and the absence of quarterly fire drills, the organization focused on doing what's right for the long term. I would say this perspective is also the result of the company's policy not to provide guidance above the original stated goals to deliver double-digit shareholder returns on a consistent and sustainable basis.
And there are, of course, other drivers of high-performance, like tight cost control, a commitment to returning cash to shareholders and as I previously stated, a talented and committed workforce. For a perspective, Lorillard has returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends since separating from Lowe's in June 2008. All of these has resulted in high quality EPS growth and a track record of exceeding other tobacco companies on almost every measure from net sales growth to operating profit per stick.
EPS has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 7.5% over the last three years, which not only exceeds the combined growth rate of the other top tobacco companies in the U.S. and abroad, but it also exceeds many of the top-tier consumer packaged goods companies in the U.S. Some have argued this strong performance has not been reflected in the company's multiple as Lorillard continues to trade at a discount right along with the other U.S. tobacco companies. Notwithstanding the uncertainty related to the FDA regulatory review of menthol, Lorillard, in our opinion, is undervalued.
While there is clearly no need for course direction on the business of Lorillard, I'm also encouraged to say for all the great things I see in the company, I do think there are further opportunities for growth. It's premature to discuss those at this point, but just what you would expect for a new CEO joining the company, the management team and our board are currently engaged in a strategic review process. This review will take place over the next several months with the objective to ensure that the high performance you'll come to expect from us in the past is sustained over the long term.
I will share the results for that process early next year, which in any case will build upon our already strong current strategy. An example would be Smokeless. The company had previously indicated it would be entering the smokeless tobacco category later this year. That launch now will depend on the results from this strategic planning process.
Let me emphasize two things in regard to strategy. First -- and I'm repeating myself here. Lorillard is not in need of a course direction. Any evolution of the current strategy will start with the basic premise of focusing on the core. And second, good strategies evolve when the external environment changes, and our external environment is clearly in a state of change.
I'll now turn to a brief overview of the third quarter and nine-month results. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Taylor, will provide a more in-depth financial overview in just a few moments. 
Starting with volume. Total Lorillard volume shipped to its domestic customers increased 5.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the nine months. This strong quarterly performance was driven by Newport, which increased 2.9%, and our discount brand, Maverick, which increased 30.9% for the quarter. There was some deloading of trade inventory in the third quarter of last year making the comparison somewhat easier.
When looking at our retail data, Lorillard continued to gain share during the quarter of up 1 full share point from last year's third quarter. On a nine-month basis, Lorillard share reached a record 12.8%, up 1.1 points versus a year ago, and Newport share was 10.9%, up 60 basis points.
The quarter did not include any volume associated with the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol. That product, which has received positive feedback from our customers, began shipping the last week in October.
This volume growth combined with price increases resulted in a robust 10.4% increase in net sales for the quarter. EPS was up 26% versus a year ago for the quarter, tracing a volume growth and price increases leading to a double-digit increase in operating profit, which was further enhanced by accretion associated with our share repurchase program. While we don't expect that level of growth every quarter, it is a reflection of the solid fundamentals I previously discussed.
Finally, a word on the TPSAC [Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee] review and on upcoming recommendations regarding menthol. I've read a number of your reviews and for the most part, I think many of you had it right. That is, first and foremost, Lorillard believes that based on the overwhelming body of scientific evidence, menthol cigarettes are not more harmful than non-menthol cigarettes. A cigarette is a cigarette. All cigarettes are dangerous. A recommendation to ban menthol cannot be justified based on sound science. 
Second, Lorillard believes that a ban of menthol would not have intended consequence of improving public health. In contrast, the unintended consequences of a ban, including the almost certain and huge contraband market in menthol products could more likely result in an adverse impact on public health. Further, there is little research regarding the intended and unintended consequences of a menthol ban  and thus far TPSAC has neither studied the issue nor to our knowledge commissioned such research.
All advisory committees to the FDA had been charged by Commissioner Hamburg to follow the science. Time will tell if the TPSAC committee will indeed be driven by science or by personal agendas and politics. At times, it's been hard to tell. Encouragingly, the most recent TPSAC meeting on October 7, at least acknowledged that more research may be needed.
Importantly, I'd like to take a minute to make sure our investors are clear on the process. As we understand it, the TPSAC is charged to provide a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA by March 2011. There was some discussion of a delay at the last TPSAC meeting, but there is no indication at this point that an extension will be sought by the committee or granted, if sought.
Once TPSAC recommendation is made, the FDA is not obligated to implement the recommendation. However, we do believe FDA will conduct its own review of menthol with consideration given to the TPSAC recommendation and other relevant information, including information provided by Lorillard and others in the industry.
After its evaluation, the FDA may publish a proposed rule if it deals such action is warranted. The FDA is under no time constraint to publish a proposed rule and can choose not to do so at all, particularly, if it deals with sound science that does not support any action. 
If the FDA decides to take action by issuing a new tobacco standard, the FDA must follow prescribed rule-making procedures. This includes publishing a proposed rule and allowing at least 60 days for public comments. Any member of the public, including the tobacco industry, can submit comments to the FDA during this period. At that point, the FDA can make modifications to its proposed rule or withdraw the proposal entirely. If the FDA publishes a final rule, it is unlikely that it would take effect before one year after its publication. The FDA has the discretion to take longer on any of these steps if it deals it is necessary. All the while, if Lorillard believes sound science did not guide the process and the decision, then the company would vigorously defend its freedom to operate through the administrative and legal system. We certainly hope it won't come to that, and for now, have no reason to believe that it will.
I want to reinforce that while we acknowledge that there will be some headlines along the way in this process, that could create some volatility in our stock, down or up. We do not believe that menthol will ultimately be banned. The science simply doesn't justify it. 
So once again, it's great to be back in the saddle. The company is having an outstanding year and as always, we will stay focused on growing our business profitably while at the same time, navigating through the many external issues that face our industry. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"
4180255,114406691,81379,"Lorillard, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2010",2010-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Lorillard, LLC","Executives","Thanks Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009 driven by the",719,"Thanks Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results we'll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009 driven by the increasing unit shift, higher net average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs, which are accounted for as a reduction in sale.
The 5.8% increase in unit shipped when compared to last year's third quarter is driven by two factors. First and foremost, the fundamental strength of the Newport franchise and the continued growth of Maverick, but also by some changes in wholesale inventory patterns in both this year's third quarter and last year's third quarter.
Total wholesale inventories increased modestly during the quarter this year, while they declined during the third quarter last year. This impacts the comparison of our shipment volume between quarters, and we estimate that effect to be about two percentage points of the 5.8% increase. Continuing the trend we saw during the first six months of 2010, the increasing volume in the third quarter combined with the higher average net selling prices drive the increasing net sales before excise taxes of over 12.5% for the third quarter and over 10% for the year-to-date period.
Gross profit in the third quarter of 2010 increased by $78 million to $566 million when compared to the third quarter of last year. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2010 reflects increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and FDA fees when we compare it to last year's third quarter, similar to what we have experienced all year.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreement increased $30 million compared to last year's third quarter as a result in the inflation factors in those agreements, combined with the relevant volume and market share adjustments.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $5 million from last year's third quarter, mainly from legal fees and expenses associated with the increased activity surrounding the Engle progeny cases. 
Third quarter operating income increased 18.6% to $465 million or 29.7% of sales from $392 million or 27.6% of sales in last year's third quarter. Operating income per unit shipped for the year-to-date 2010 period has increased approximately 7.5% compared with 2009.
Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2010 was 37.3% as compared to 37.7% in last year's third quarter. We currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the year will approximate this 37.3%.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 25.7% and reflect the strong performance we've already discussed, but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count increased reported EPS of $0.14 per share or about 10 percentage points of the 25.7% increase.
The modest increase in wholesale inventories during the third quarter that I referred to a moment ago is temporary, just as they always are. And we don't know when that might turn around. But when it does, it may have some impact on our quarterly volume comparisons.
So for the quarter, we saw unit volumes increased, market share increased, net sales increased, gross margins increased, operating margins increased, operating income per unit increased, and along with fewer shares outstanding during the quarter, all of which combined for the dramatic increase in EPS. Obviously, a very impressive follow up to the strong first half of 2010.
We announced a 12% increase in our dividend during the third quarter, and we announced the share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. So we are continuing to deliver value to shareholders on many levels. Through September 30, we had repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $81.10 per share. 
I won't comment on the future pace of share repurchases during this call, nor will I be able to comment about the potential timing of any future capital structure activities, such as further debt issuances and so forth. We have not changed our longer-term leverage target of approximately 1.5x EBITDA nor our long-term target of paying dividends approximately 70%, 75% of earnings. 
Once again, we're very pleased with the company's performance this quarter on virtually every measures. And with that, we'd like to open the lines for questions. Sarah?"

And then the second question is, with Newport Non-Menthol coming out and the buydown being pretty steep, I'm just trying to figure out, how should we be thinking about how the net pricing will look in the fourth quarter?

But at this level of discounting as I've gone out into the marketplace to get trial, is what we have learned by studying the industry and what it takes to launch a successful new product in the absence of sort of the old traditional tool of television, advertising, et cetera. So this is not something remarkably unique by Lorillard, I think you'll find that most of the new product launches have a similar discount or average pack price for introductory pack price, I should say. I have worked retail, I went out and I am not witnessing what you're saying net relative to shelf space. I went out there. I haven't gone to a lot of markets yet, but I did do a few and especially depending on where we're stronger and where we're not strong. Newport has a great presence, I don't see levels of out-of-stocks. Our contracts like everybody else's sort of dictate that we get our share of the market or we request that, and for the most part I believe that, that's achieved. I think we also benefit from the fact that unlike our competitors, we have a very narrow product line. So I mean, I think you want to make sure the product is visible and that you don't run out of stocks and I don't see any challenge to that."

The brand comes as it's launched from a much greater position of strength. Our share is almost 50% higher than it was at the time of the last launch.

What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST. For those of you don't know me, I look forward to getting to know you",1680,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST. For those of you don't know me, I look forward to getting to know you as quickly as possible. But for now, know this, as has always been the case in the past, you can expect my management team and me to be accessible, transparent and relentlessly focused on building shareholder value. 
Some initial observations after my first six weeks in the job. I'd always admired Lorillard as an outsider, and as a result, had high expectations walking in the door. Those expectations have been dramatically exceeded, as I have gotten to know the business and the talented people that work at the company. It's a tribute to my predecessor, Marty Orlowsky. He has much to be proud of.
Having the unique perspective of having worked at several top consumer packaged goods companies in general and tobacco specifically, I can tell you that there is something very different about Lorillard that, in my opinion, makes it a standout performer. First and foremost, the underlying volume trend on our lead brand, Newport, is organic and long term. There is no chase for volume, scrambling to launch new products or quarter-end promotions. Newport sells today almost the same number of sticks it did 10 years ago, while during the same time, the industry has declined 27%. And as you saw in our release, Newport volume this year is growing, up 2.6% through nine months.
It is my opinion that this growth stems from a superior product, consistent message and a carefully crafted regional promotional strategy that ensures Newport remains priced competitively. With a backdrop of a solid organic growth trend and the absence of quarterly fire drills, the organization is focused on doing what's right for the long term. I would say this perspective is also the result of the company's policy not to provide guidance above the original stated goals to deliver double-digit shareholder returns on a consistent and sustainable basis.
And there are, of course, other drivers of high performance, like tight cost control, a commitment to returning cash to shareholders and, as I previously stated, a talented and committed workforce. For perspective, Lorillard has returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends since separating from Loews in June 2008. All of this has resulted in high quality EPS growth and a track record of exceeding other tobacco companies on almost every measure from net sales growth to operating profit per stick.
EPS has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 7 1/2% over the last three years, which not only exceeds the combined growth rate of the other top tobacco companies in the U.S. and abroad, but it also exceeds many of the top-tier consumer packaged goods companies in the U.S. Some have argued this strong performance has not been reflected in the company's multiple as Lorillard continues to trade at a discount right along with the other U.S. tobacco companies. Notwithstanding the uncertainty related to the FDA regulatory review of menthol, Lorillard, in our opinion, is undervalued.
While there is clearly no need for course direction on the business at Lorillard, I'm also encouraged to say for all the great things I see in the company, I do think there are further opportunities for growth. It's premature to discuss those at this point, but just as you would expect for a new CEO joining the company, the management team and our board are currently engaged in a strategic review process. This review will take place over the next several months with the objective to ensure that the high performance you have come to expect from us in the past is sustained over the long term.
I will share the results of that process early next year, which in any case, will build upon our already strong current strategy. An example would be Smokeless. The company had previously indicated it would be entering the smokeless tobacco category later this year. That launch now will depend on the results from this strategic planning process.
Let me emphasize two things in regard to strategy. First -- and I'm repeating myself here. Lorillard is not in need of a course correction. Any evolution of the current strategy will start with the basic premise of focusing on the core. And second, good strategies evolve when the external environment changes, and our external environment is clearly in a state of change.
I'll now turn to a brief overview of the third quarter and nine-month results. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Taylor, will provide a more in-depth financial overview in just a few moments. 
Starting with volume. Total Lorillard volume shipped to its domestic customers increased 5.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the nine months. This strong quarterly performance was driven by Newport, which increased 2.9%, and our discount brand, Maverick, which increased 30.9% for the quarter. There was some deloading of trade inventory in the third quarter of last year, making the comparison somewhat easier.
When looking at our retail data, Lorillard continued to gain share during the quarter, up one full share point from last year's third quarter. On a nine-month basis, Lorillard’s share reached a record 12.8%, up 1.1 points versus a year ago, and Newport share was 10.9%, up 60 basis points.
The quarter did not include any volume associated with the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol. That product, which has received positive feedback from our customers, began shipping the last week in October.
This volume growth combined with price increases resulted in a robust 10.4% increase in net sales for the quarter. EPS was up 26% versus a year ago for the quarter, tracing the volume growth and price increases leading to a double-digit increase in operating profit, which was further enhanced by accretion associated with our share repurchase program. While we don't expect that level of growth every quarter, it is a reflection of the solid fundamentals I previously discussed.
Finally, a word on the TPSAC [Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee] review and upcoming recommendations regarding menthol. I've read a number of your reviews and for the most part, I think many of you have it right. That is, first and foremost, Lorillard believes that based on the overwhelming body of scientific evidence, menthol cigarettes are not more harmful than non-menthol cigarettes. A cigarette is a cigarette. All cigarettes are dangerous. A recommendation to ban menthol cannot be justified based on sound science. 
Second, Lorillard believes that a ban of menthol would not have the intended consequence of improving public health. In contrast, the unintended consequences of a ban, including the almost certain and huge contraband market in menthol products, could more likely result in an adverse impact on public health. Further, there is little research regarding the intended and unintended consequences of a menthol ban, and thus far TPSAC has neither studied the issue nor, to our knowledge, commissioned such research.
All advisory committees to the FDA have been charged by Commissioner Hamburg to follow the science. Time will tell if the TPSAC committee will indeed be driven by science or by personal agendas and politics. At times, it's been hard to tell. Encouragingly, the most recent TPSAC meeting on October 7 at least acknowledged that more research may be needed.
Importantly, I'd like to take a minute to make sure our investors are clear on the process. As we understand it, the TPSAC is charged to provide a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA by March 2011. There was some discussion of a delay at the last TPSAC meeting, but there is no indication at this point that an extension will be sought by the committee or granted, if sought.
Once TPSAC’s recommendation is made, the FDA is not obligated to implement the recommendation. However, we do believe FDA will conduct its own review of menthol with consideration given to the TPSAC recommendation and other relevant information, including information provided by Lorillard and others in the industry.
After its evaluation, the FDA may publish a proposed rule if it feels such action is warranted. The FDA is under no time constraint to publish a proposed rule and can choose not to do so at all, particularly if it feels that sound science does not support any action.
If the FDA decides to take action by issuing a new tobacco standard, the FDA must follow prescribed rule-making procedures. This includes publishing a proposed rule and allowing at least 60 days for public comments. Any member of the public, including the tobacco industry, can submit comments to the FDA during this period. At that point, the FDA can make modifications to its proposed rule or withdraw the proposal entirely. If the FDA publishes a final rule, it is unlikely that it would take effect before one year after its publication. The FDA has the discretion to take longer on any of these steps if it feels it is necessary. All the while, if Lorillard believes sound science did not guide the process in the decision, then the company would vigorously defend its freedom to operate through the administrative and legal system. We certainly hope it won't come to that, and for now, have no reason to believe that it will.
I want to reinforce that while we acknowledge that there will be some headlines along the way in this process that could create some volatility in our stock, down or up, we do not believe that menthol will ultimately be banned. The science simply doesn't justify it. 
So once again, it's great to be back in the saddle. The company is having an outstanding year and as always, we will stay focused on growing our business profitably while at the same time, navigating the many external issues that face our industry. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?"

After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by th",726,"Thanks Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by the increase in units shipped, higher net average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs, which are accounted for as a reduction in sales.
The 5.8% increase in units shipped when compared to last year's third quarter is driven by two factors: First and foremost, the fundamental strength of the Newport franchise and the continued growth of Maverick, but also by some changes in wholesale inventory patterns in both this year's third quarter and last year's third quarter.
Total wholesale inventories increased modestly during the quarter this year, while they declined during the third quarter last year. This impacts the comparison of our shipment volume between quarters, and we estimate that effect to be about two percentage points of the 5.8% increase. Continuing the trend we saw during the first six months of 2010, the increase in volume in the third quarter combined with the higher average net selling prices drives the increasing net sales before excise taxes of over 12 1/2% for the third quarter and over 10% for the year-to-date period.
Gross profit in the third quarter of 2010 increased by $78 million to $566 million when compared to the third quarter of last year. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2010 reflects increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and FDA fees when we compare it to last year's third quarter, similar to what we have experienced all year.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreement increased $30 million compared to last year's third quarter as a result in the inflation factors in those agreements, combined with the relevant volume and market share adjustments.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $5 million from last year's third quarter, mainly from legal fees and expenses associated with the increased activity surrounding the Engle progeny cases. 
Third quarter operating income increased 18.6% to $465 million or 29.7% of sales from $392 million or 27.6% of sales in last year's third quarter. Operating income per unit shipped for the year-to-date 2010 period has increased approximately 7 1/2% compared with 2009.
Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2010 was 37.3% as compared to 37.7% in last year's third quarter. We currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the year will approximate this 37.3%.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 25.7% and reflects the strong performance we've already discussed, but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count increased reported EPS of $0.14 per share or about 10 percentage points of the 25.7% increase.
The modest increase in wholesale inventories during the third quarter that I referred to a moment ago is temporary, just as they always are. And we don't know when that might turn around. But when it does, it may have some impact on our quarterly volume comparisons.
So for the quarter, we saw unit volumes increase, market share increase, net sales increase, gross margins increase, operating margins increase, operating income per unit increase and along with fewer shares outstanding during the quarter, all of which combined for the dramatic increase in EPS. Obviously, a very impressive follow up to the strong first half of 2010.
We announced a 12 1/2% increase in our dividend during the third quarter, and we announced a share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. So we are continuing to deliver value to shareholders on many levels. Through September 30, we had repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $81.10 per share. 
I won't comment on the future pace of share repurchases during this call, nor will I be able to comment about the potential timing of any future capital structure activities, such as further debt issuances and so forth. We have not changed our longer-term leverage target of approximately 1 1/2x EBITDA nor our long-term target of paying dividends approximately 70% to 75% of earnings. 
Once again, we're very pleased with the company's performance this quarter on virtually every measure. And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?"

But a success a year from now regardless of the share is that, once it has been established and once trial has been gotten that we saw that it was incremental to the company and there were good repeat purchase levels and a base to build on. Tobacco launches take very long in my opinion. My experience at UST when I launched is, it's not like a traditional consumer packaged goods where you're trying to get out there and see if you have a success in six months.

So this is not something remarkably unique by Lorillard. I think you'll find that most of the new product launches have a similar discount or average pack price, or introductory pack price, I should say. I have worked retail. I went out and I am not witnessing what you're saying, Nik, relative to shelf space. I went out there. I haven't gone to a lot of markets yet, but I’ve been to a few and especially depending on where we're stronger, where we're not strong, Newport has a great presence. I don't see levels of out-of-stocks. Our contracts, like everybody else's, sort of dictate that we get our share of the market or we request that, and for the most part I believe that, that's achieved.

What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST. For those of you don't know me, I look forward to getting to know you",1680,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST. For those of you don't know me, I look forward to getting to know you as quickly as possible. But for now, know this, as has always been the case in the past, you can expect my management team and me to be accessible, transparent and relentlessly focused on building shareholder value. 
Some initial observations after my first six weeks in the job. I'd always admired Lorillard as an outsider, and as a result, had high expectations walking in the door. Those expectations have been dramatically exceeded, as I have gotten to know the business and the talented people that work at the company. It's a tribute to my predecessor, Marty Orlowsky. He has much to be proud of.
Having the unique perspective of having worked at several top consumer packaged goods companies in general and tobacco specifically, I can tell you that there is something very different about Lorillard that, in my opinion, makes it a standout performer. First and foremost, the underlying volume trend on our lead brand, Newport, is organic and long term. There is no chase for volume, scrambling to launch new products or quarter-end promotions. Newport sells today almost the same number of sticks it did 10 years ago, while during the same time, the industry has declined 27%. And as you saw in our release, Newport volume this year is growing, up 2.6% through nine months.
It is my opinion that this growth stems from a superior product, consistent message and a carefully crafted regional promotional strategy that ensures Newport remains priced competitively. With a backdrop of a solid organic growth trend and the absence of quarterly fire drills, the organization is focused on doing what's right for the long term. I would say this perspective is also the result of the company's policy not to provide guidance above the original stated goals to deliver double-digit shareholder returns on a consistent and sustainable basis.
And there are, of course, other drivers of high performance, like tight cost control, a commitment to returning cash to shareholders and, as I previously stated, a talented and committed workforce. For perspective, Lorillard has returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends since separating from Loews in June 2008. All of this has resulted in high quality EPS growth and a track record of exceeding other tobacco companies on almost every measure from net sales growth to operating profit per stick.
EPS has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 7 1/2% over the last three years, which not only exceeds the combined growth rate of the other top tobacco companies in the U.S. and abroad, but it also exceeds many of the top-tier consumer packaged goods companies in the U.S. Some have argued this strong performance has not been reflected in the company's multiple as Lorillard continues to trade at a discount right along with the other U.S. tobacco companies. Notwithstanding the uncertainty related to the FDA regulatory review of menthol, Lorillard, in our opinion, is undervalued.
While there is clearly no need for course direction on the business at Lorillard, I'm also encouraged to say for all the great things I see in the company, I do think there are further opportunities for growth. It's premature to discuss those at this point, but just as you would expect for a new CEO joining the company, the management team and our board are currently engaged in a strategic review process. This review will take place over the next several months with the objective to ensure that the high performance you have come to expect from us in the past is sustained over the long term.
I will share the results of that process early next year, which in any case, will build upon our already strong current strategy. An example would be Smokeless. The company had previously indicated it would be entering the smokeless tobacco category later this year. That launch now will depend on the results from this strategic planning process.
Let me emphasize two things in regard to strategy. First -- and I'm repeating myself here. Lorillard is not in need of a course correction. Any evolution of the current strategy will start with the basic premise of focusing on the core. And second, good strategies evolve when the external environment changes, and our external environment is clearly in a state of change.
I'll now turn to a brief overview of the third quarter and nine-month results. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Taylor, will provide a more in-depth financial overview in just a few moments. 
Starting with volume. Total Lorillard volume shipped to its domestic customers increased 5.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the nine months. This strong quarterly performance was driven by Newport, which increased 2.9%, and our discount brand, Maverick, which increased 30.9% for the quarter. There was some deloading of trade inventory in the third quarter of last year, making the comparison somewhat easier.
When looking at our retail data, Lorillard continued to gain share during the quarter, up one full share point from last year's third quarter. On a nine-month basis, Lorillard’s share reached a record 12.8%, up 1.1 points versus a year ago, and Newport share was 10.9%, up 60 basis points.
The quarter did not include any volume associated with the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol. That product, which has received positive feedback from our customers, began shipping the last week in October.
This volume growth combined with price increases resulted in a robust 10.4% increase in net sales for the quarter. EPS was up 26% versus a year ago for the quarter, tracing the volume growth and price increases leading to a double-digit increase in operating profit, which was further enhanced by accretion associated with our share repurchase program. While we don't expect that level of growth every quarter, it is a reflection of the solid fundamentals I previously discussed.
Finally, a word on the TPSAC [Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee] review and upcoming recommendations regarding menthol. I've read a number of your reviews and for the most part, I think many of you have it right. That is, first and foremost, Lorillard believes that based on the overwhelming body of scientific evidence, menthol cigarettes are not more harmful than non-menthol cigarettes. A cigarette is a cigarette. All cigarettes are dangerous. A recommendation to ban menthol cannot be justified based on sound science. 
Second, Lorillard believes that a ban of menthol would not have the intended consequence of improving public health. In contrast, the unintended consequences of a ban, including the almost certain and huge contraband market in menthol products, could more likely result in an adverse impact on public health. Further, there is little research regarding the intended and unintended consequences of a menthol ban, and thus far TPSAC has neither studied the issue nor, to our knowledge, commissioned such research.
All advisory committees to the FDA have been charged by Commissioner Hamburg to follow the science. Time will tell if the TPSAC committee will indeed be driven by science or by personal agendas and politics. At times, it's been hard to tell. Encouragingly, the most recent TPSAC meeting on October 7 at least acknowledged that more research may be needed.
Importantly, I'd like to take a minute to make sure our investors are clear on the process. As we understand it, the TPSAC is charged to provide a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA by March 2011. There was some discussion of a delay at the last TPSAC meeting, but there is no indication at this point that an extension will be sought by the committee or granted, if sought.
Once TPSAC’s recommendation is made, the FDA is not obligated to implement the recommendation. However, we do believe FDA will conduct its own review of menthol with consideration given to the TPSAC recommendation and other relevant information, including information provided by Lorillard and others in the industry.
After its evaluation, the FDA may publish a proposed rule if it feels such action is warranted. The FDA is under no time constraint to publish a proposed rule and can choose not to do so at all, particularly if it feels that sound science does not support any action.
If the FDA decides to take action by issuing a new tobacco standard, the FDA must follow prescribed rule-making procedures. This includes publishing a proposed rule and allowing at least 60 days for public comments. Any member of the public, including the tobacco industry, can submit comments to the FDA during this period. At that point, the FDA can make modifications to its proposed rule or withdraw the proposal entirely. If the FDA publishes a final rule, it is unlikely that it would take effect before one year after its publication. The FDA has the discretion to take longer on any of these steps if it feels it is necessary. All the while, if Lorillard believes sound science did not guide the process in the decision, then the company would vigorously defend its freedom to operate through the administrative and legal system. We certainly hope it won't come to that, and for now, have no reason to believe that it will.
I want to reinforce that while we acknowledge that there will be some headlines along the way in this process that could create some volatility in our stock, down or up, we do not believe that menthol will ultimately be banned. The science simply doesn't justify it. 
So once again, it's great to be back in the saddle. The company is having an outstanding year and as always, we will stay focused on growing our business profitably while at the same time, navigating the many external issues that face our industry. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?

After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by th",726,"Thanks Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. 
Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by the increase in units shipped, higher net average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs, which are accounted for as a reduction in sales.
The 5.8% increase in units shipped when compared to last year's third quarter is driven by two factors: First and foremost, the fundamental strength of the Newport franchise and the continued growth of Maverick, but also by some changes in wholesale inventory patterns in both this year's third quarter and last year's third quarter.
Total wholesale inventories increased modestly during the quarter this year, while they declined during the third quarter last year. This impacts the comparison of our shipment volume between quarters, and we estimate that effect to be about two percentage points of the 5.8% increase. Continuing the trend we saw during the first six months of 2010, the increase in volume in the third quarter combined with the higher average net selling prices drives the increasing net sales before excise taxes of over 12 1/2% for the third quarter and over 10% for the year-to-date period.
Gross profit in the third quarter of 2010 increased by $78 million to $566 million when compared to the third quarter of last year. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2010 reflects increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and FDA fees when we compare it to last year's third quarter, similar to what we have experienced all year.
Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreement increased $30 million compared to last year's third quarter as a result in the inflation factors in those agreements, combined with the relevant volume and market share adjustments.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $5 million from last year's third quarter, mainly from legal fees and expenses associated with the increased activity surrounding the Engle progeny cases. 
Third quarter operating income increased 18.6% to $465 million or 29.7% of sales from $392 million or 27.6% of sales in last year's third quarter. Operating income per unit shipped for the year-to-date 2010 period has increased approximately 7 1/2% compared with 2009.
Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2010 was 37.3% as compared to 37.7% in last year's third quarter. We currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the year will approximate this 37.3%.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 25.7% and reflects the strong performance we've already discussed, but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count increased reported EPS of $0.14 per share or about 10 percentage points of the 25.7% increase.
The modest increase in wholesale inventories during the third quarter that I referred to a moment ago is temporary, just as they always are. And we don't know when that might turn around. But when it does, it may have some impact on our quarterly volume comparisons.
So for the quarter, we saw unit volumes increase, market share increase, net sales increase, gross margins increase, operating margins increase, operating income per unit increase and along with fewer shares outstanding during the quarter, all of which combined for the dramatic increase in EPS. Obviously, a very impressive follow up to the strong first half of 2010.
We announced a 12 1/2% increase in our dividend during the third quarter, and we announced a share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. So we are continuing to deliver value to shareholders on many levels. Through September 30, we had repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $81.10 per share. 
I won't comment on the future pace of share repurchases during this call, nor will I be able to comment about the potential timing of any future capital structure activities, such as further debt issuances and so forth. We have not changed our longer-term leverage target of approximately 1 1/2x EBITDA nor our long-term target of paying dividends approximately 70% to 75% of earnings. 
Once again, we're very pleased with the company's performance this quarter on virtually every measure. And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?

So if you start from a basic premise that we’re 10 or 12 share and there's hundreds of billions of sticks out there that are being sold in segments where we haven't penetrated, then I think you would have to look at what that opportunity could be. And is that continuing to grow in menthol? I mean for even our size in menthol, we're only 36% of the menthol market. There's a whole lot of volume opportunity out there within menthol. You'd seen the company is in the process of launching a non-menthol cigarette. So we’ll go through the exercise and the discipline to make sure that anything we do creates value. But I see a lot of opportunity for the company. I'm pretty excited about it, Judy.

I haven't gone to a lot of markets yet, but I’ve been to a few and especially depending on where we're stronger, where we're not strong, Newport has a great presence. I don't see levels of out-of-stocks. Our contracts, like everybody else's, sort of dictate that we get our share of the market or we request that, and for the most part I believe that, that's achieved.

And I read through the epidemiology, I read through sort of the logic relative to the intended and unintended consequences. And no matter how I cut it, if this FDA is to go through a true scientific review, there is no difference on causation. There is not a case to be made for banning menthol. No matter how you cut this thing, there is not a case to be made for it. Now some of the TPSAC -- I looked at it and said, ""Boy, this TPSAC group has got some members of the committee that at the very least are conflicted.” And how do I feel about whether they'll truly follow science? We'll see. I'm optimistic, I'm hopeful. But I really believe that once it get into the hands of the FDA though, they'll do the right thing and follow the science.

What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST.

What a pleasure it is to be back at the helm of a great company like Lorillard. Most of you know me extremely well from my many years at UST. For those of you don't know me, I look forward to getting to know you as quickly as possible. But for now, know this, as has always been the case in the past, you can expect my management team and me to be accessible, transparent and relentlessly focused on building shareholder value.
 Some initial observations after my first six weeks in the job. I'd always admired Lorillard as an outsider, and as a result, had high expectations walking in the door. Those expectations have been dramatically exceeded, as I have gotten to know the business and the talented people that work at the company. It's a tribute to my predecessor, Marty Orlowsky. He has much to be proud of.
 Having the unique perspective of having worked at several top consumer packaged goods companies in general and tobacco specifically, I can tell you that there is something very different about Lorillard that, in my opinion, makes it a standout performer. First and foremost, the underlying volume trend on our lead brand, Newport, is organic and long term. There is no chase for volume, scrambling to launch new products or quarter-end promotions. Newport sells today almost the same number of sticks it did 10 years ago, while during the same time, the industry has declined 27%. And as you saw in our release, Newport volume this year is growing, up 2.6% through nine months.
 It is my opinion that this growth stems from a superior product, consistent message and a carefully crafted regional promotional strategy that ensures Newport remains priced competitively. With a backdrop of a solid organic growth trend and the absence of quarterly fire drills, the organization is focused on doing what's right for the long term. I would say this perspective is also the result of the company's policy not to provide guidance above the original stated goals to deliver double-digit shareholder returns on a consistent and sustainable basis.
 And there are, of course, other drivers of high performance, like tight cost control, a commitment to returning cash to shareholders and, as I previously stated, a talented and committed workforce. For perspective, Lorillard has returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends since separating from Loews in June 2008. All of this has resulted in high quality EPS growth and a track record of exceeding other tobacco companies on almost every measure from net sales growth to operating profit per stick.
 EPS has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 7 1/2% over the last three years, which not only exceeds the combined growth rate of the other top tobacco companies in the U.S. and abroad, but it also exceeds many of the top-tier consumer packaged goods companies in the U.S. Some have argued this strong performance has not been reflected in the company's multiple as Lorillard continues to trade at a discount right along with the other U.S. tobacco companies. Notwithstanding the uncertainty related to the FDA regulatory review of menthol, Lorillard, in our opinion, is undervalued.
 While there is clearly no need for course direction on the business at Lorillard, I'm also encouraged to say for all the great things I see in the company, I do think there are further opportunities for growth. It's premature to discuss those at this point, but just as you would expect for a new CEO joining the company, the management team and our board are currently engaged in a strategic review process. This review will take place over the next several months with the objective to ensure that the high performance you have come to expect from us in the past is sustained over the long term.
 I will share the results of that process early next year, which in any case, will build upon our already strong current strategy. An example would be Smokeless. The company had previously indicated it would be entering the smokeless tobacco category later this year. That launch now will depend on the results from this strategic planning process.
 Let me emphasize two things in regard to strategy. First -- and I'm repeating myself here. Lorillard is not in need of a course correction. Any evolution of the current strategy will start with the basic premise of focusing on the core. And second, good strategies evolve when the external environment changes, and our external environment is clearly in a state of change.
 I'll now turn to a brief overview of the third quarter and nine-month results. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Taylor, will provide a more in-depth financial overview in just a few moments.
 Starting with volume. Total Lorillard volume shipped to its domestic customers increased 5.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the nine months. This strong quarterly performance was driven by Newport, which increased 2.9%, and our discount brand, Maverick, which increased 30.9% for the quarter. There was some deloading of trade inventory in the third quarter of last year, making the comparison somewhat easier.
 When looking at our retail data, Lorillard continued to gain share during the quarter, up one full share point from last year's third quarter. On a nine-month basis, Lorillard’s share reached a record 12.8%, up 1.1 points versus a year ago, and Newport share was 10.9%, up 60 basis points.
 The quarter did not include any volume associated with the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol. That product, which has received positive feedback from our customers, began shipping the last week in October.
 This volume growth combined with price increases resulted in a robust 10.4% increase in net sales for the quarter. EPS was up 26% versus a year ago for the quarter, tracing the volume growth and price increases leading to a double-digit increase in operating profit, which was further enhanced by accretion associated with our share repurchase program. While we don't expect that level of growth every quarter, it is a reflection of the solid fundamentals I previously discussed.
 Finally, a word on the TPSAC [Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee] review and upcoming recommendations regarding menthol. I've read a number of your reviews and for the most part, I think many of you have it right. That is, first and foremost, Lorillard believes that based on the overwhelming body of scientific evidence, menthol cigarettes are not more harmful than non-menthol cigarettes. A cigarette is a cigarette. All cigarettes are dangerous. A recommendation to ban menthol cannot be justified based on sound science.
 Second, Lorillard believes that a ban of menthol would not have the intended consequence of improving public health. In contrast, the unintended consequences of a ban, including the almost certain and huge contraband market in menthol products, could more likely result in an adverse impact on public health. Further, there is little research regarding the intended and unintended consequences of a menthol ban, and thus far TPSAC has neither studied the issue nor, to our knowledge, commissioned such research.
 All advisory committees to the FDA have been charged by Commissioner Hamburg to follow the science. Time will tell if the TPSAC committee will indeed be driven by science or by personal agendas and politics. At times, it's been hard to tell. Encouragingly, the most recent TPSAC meeting on October 7 at least acknowledged that more research may be needed.
 Importantly, I'd like to take a minute to make sure our investors are clear on the process. As we understand it, the TPSAC is charged to provide a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA by March 2011. There was some discussion of a delay at the last TPSAC meeting, but there is no indication at this point that an extension will be sought by the committee or granted, if sought.
 Once TPSAC’s recommendation is made, the FDA is not obligated to implement the recommendation. However, we do believe FDA will conduct its own review of menthol with consideration given to the TPSAC recommendation and other relevant information, including information provided by Lorillard and others in the industry.
 After its evaluation, the FDA may publish a proposed rule if it feels such action is warranted. The FDA is under no time constraint to publish a proposed rule and can choose not to do so at all, particularly if it feels that sound science does not support any action.
 If the FDA decides to take action by issuing a new tobacco standard, the FDA must follow prescribed rule-making procedures. This includes publishing a proposed rule and allowing at least 60 days for public comments. Any member of the public, including the tobacco industry, can submit comments to the FDA during this period. At that point, the FDA can make modifications to its proposed rule or withdraw the proposal entirely. If the FDA publishes a final rule, it is unlikely that it would take effect before one year after its publication. The FDA has the discretion to take longer on any of these steps if it feels it is necessary. All the while, if Lorillard believes sound science did not guide the process in the decision, then the company would vigorously defend its freedom to operate through the administrative and legal system. We certainly hope it won't come to that, and for now, have no reason to believe that it will.
 I want to reinforce that while we acknowledge that there will be some headlines along the way in this process that could create some volatility in our stock, down or up, we do not believe that menthol will ultimately be banned. The science simply doesn't justify it.
 So once again, it's great to be back in the saddle. The company is having an outstanding year and as always, we will stay focused on growing our business profitably while at the same time, navigating the many external issues that face our industry.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to David Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. David?

After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions. Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by t",726," Thanks Murray, and good morning, everyone. After I briefly go through the financial results, we'll open the line for questions.
 Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 10.4% to $1.567 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by the increase in units shipped, higher net average selling prices and lower sales promotion costs, which are accounted for as a reduction in sales.
 The 5.8% increase in units shipped when compared to last year's third quarter is driven by two factors: First and foremost, the fundamental strength of the Newport franchise and the continued growth of Maverick, but also by some changes in wholesale inventory patterns in both this year's third quarter and last year's third quarter.
 Total wholesale inventories increased modestly during the quarter this year, while they declined during the third quarter last year. This impacts the comparison of our shipment volume between quarters, and we estimate that effect to be about two percentage points of the 5.8% increase. Continuing the trend we saw during the first six months of 2010, the increase in volume in the third quarter combined with the higher average net selling prices drives the increasing net sales before excise taxes of over 12 1/2% for the third quarter and over 10% for the year-to-date period.
 Gross profit in the third quarter of 2010 increased by $78 million to $566 million when compared to the third quarter of last year. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2010 reflects increases for certain raw material costs, such as tobacco and wrapping costs and FDA fees when we compare it to last year's third quarter, similar to what we have experienced all year.
 Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreement increased $30 million compared to last year's third quarter as a result in the inflation factors in those agreements, combined with the relevant volume and market share adjustments.
 Selling, general and administrative costs increased $5 million from last year's third quarter, mainly from legal fees and expenses associated with the increased activity surrounding the Engle progeny cases.
 Third quarter operating income increased 18.6% to $465 million or 29.7% of sales from $392 million or 27.6% of sales in last year's third quarter. Operating income per unit shipped for the year-to-date 2010 period has increased approximately 7 1/2% compared with 2009.
 Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2010 was 37.3% as compared to 37.7% in last year's third quarter. We currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the year will approximate this 37.3%.
 Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 25.7% and reflects the strong performance we've already discussed, but also the effect of a lower average share count this year. The lower share count increased reported EPS of $0.14 per share or about 10 percentage points of the 25.7% increase.
 The modest increase in wholesale inventories during the third quarter that I referred to a moment ago is temporary, just as they always are. And we don't know when that might turn around. But when it does, it may have some impact on our quarterly volume comparisons.
 So for the quarter, we saw unit volumes increase, market share increase, net sales increase, gross margins increase, operating margins increase, operating income per unit increase and along with fewer shares outstanding during the quarter, all of which combined for the dramatic increase in EPS. Obviously, a very impressive follow up to the strong first half of 2010.
 We announced a 12 1/2% increase in our dividend during the third quarter, and we announced a share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. So we are continuing to deliver value to shareholders on many levels. Through September 30, we had repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $81.10 per share.
 I won't comment on the future pace of share repurchases during this call, nor will I be able to comment about the potential timing of any future capital structure activities, such as further debt issuances and so forth. We have not changed our longer-term leverage target of approximately 1 1/2x EBITDA nor our long-term target of paying dividends approximately 70% to 75% of earnings.
 Once again, we're very pleased with the company's performance this quarter on virtually every measure. And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sarah?

So if you start from a basic premise that we’re 10 or 12 share and there's hundreds of billions of sticks out there that are being sold in segments where we haven't penetrated, then I think you would have to look at what that opportunity could be. And is that continuing to grow in menthol? I mean for even our size in menthol, we're only 36% of the menthol market. There's a whole lot of volume opportunity out there within menthol. You'd seen the company is in the process of launching a non-menthol cigarette. So we’ll go through the exercise and the discipline to make sure that anything we do creates value.

But the company has been active. As it relates to me, I think it's a great question. And as I went through an exercise of looking to join this company, I had to go through the same exercise an investor would go through. And I read through the epidemiology, I read through sort of the logic relative to the intended and unintended consequences. And no matter how I cut it, if this FDA is to go through a true scientific review, there is no difference on causation. There is not a case to be made for banning menthol. No matter how you cut this thing, there is not a case to be made for it. Now some of the TPSAC -- I looked at it and said, ""Boy, this TPSAC group has got some members of the committee that at the very least are conflicted.” And how do I feel about whether they'll truly follow science? We'll see. I'm optimistic, I'm hopeful. But I really believe that once it get into the hands of the FDA though, they'll do the right thing and follow the science.
