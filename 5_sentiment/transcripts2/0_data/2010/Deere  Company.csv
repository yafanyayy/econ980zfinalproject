This morning, John Deere reported results for the first quarter of 2010, and what a quarter it was. In spite of a decline in sales, earnings were up 19% from a year ago. The improvement was led by our Ag & Turf and Credit businesses, bot",2765,"Thank you, Marie. This morning, John Deere reported results for the first quarter of 2010, and what a quarter it was. In spite of a decline in sales, earnings were up 19% from a year ago. The improvement was led by our Ag & Turf and Credit businesses, both of which are experiencing improved conditions. Disciplined costs and asset management were again major stories, with SA&G expense, a little changed and trade receivables and inventories, down by $1.4 billion. Finally, our full-year forecast for earnings has been increased significantly to $1.3 billion. All in all, it was an impressive performance. Now let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3.First quarter net income attributable to Deere & Company was $243 million or $0.57 per share on net sales and revenues of $4.8 billion. It was the second highest earnings total for any first quarter in the company's history, trailing only the first quarter of 2008. As shown on Slide 4, total worldwide Equipment Operations net sales were down 7% in the first quarter versus first quarter of 2009. Currency translation on net sales was positive by about five points, with about two points of positive price realization.Turning to Slide 5, worldwide production tonnage was down 20% in the quarter. However, demand has been better than expected for large Ag and international Forestry product, accounting for the improvement in our tonnage forecast. For the full year, projected production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 5%. Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 6. Second quarter sales are expected to be up 4% to 6% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Currency translation is expected to be positive by about five points, with about two points of positive price realization. For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up 6% to 8% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about three points of positive currency translation and one to two points of positive price realization. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $1.3 billion for the year.Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 7. In the quarter, net sales were down 6%, with production tonnage down 20%. Operating profit was $352 million in the quarter. Lower raw material costs, positive price realizations and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and product mix, offset lower sales volumes and higher post-retirement benefit costs. A&T is starting to see benefits from last year's organizational realignment, resulting in the creation of the Ag & Turf division. Ongoing rationalization of processes, facilities and resources is allowing the division to more efficiently meet customer needs and reduce overall costs.Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business starting on Slide 8. Commodity prices for the '09, '10 crop have risen modestly since our last forecast. Corn acreage is expected to increase 1.5 million acres in 2010 to meet growing demand for feed, export and ethanol. What's more? Corn is expected to be more profitable this year. According to Informa, profits from corn will be $77 an acre more than soybeans in 2010. This is an additional $15 an acre above the 2009 levels.For soybeans, continued robust export demand will keep prices relatively high in the near term. Finally, cotton prices remain well above the year ago level, driven by lower production in Asia and the rapidly recovering Asian economy. Turning to Slide 9, forecast prices as you can see are below the very high levels of 2008, but remain strong on a historical basis. On Slide 10, 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 4% from 2009 levels. The biggest changes in the Livestock sector were milk prices have continued to climb and things are generally headed in the right direction.Slide 11 highlights farm net income in Brazil and Argentina. Argentina is recovering from the 2009 drought, driving increased demand for tractors, combines, sprayers and storage equipment. In Brazil, 2010 farm net income is expected to double from last year's level. Normally, when we talk about Brazil, we talk about soybeans. However, the primary driver if increased farm net income in 2010 is the large improvement in sugar. International sugar prices are extremely strong. Demand is higher than production due to a drastic drought-driven reduction in sugar output from India and China. Strong demand for sugar is only part of the story in Brazil. Other positive factors include demand for Brazilian commodities globally, as well as government sponsored low rate finance programs like FINAME and Mais Alimentos. These are all contributing to positive producer attitudes, which translate into higher spending on farm equipment.Putting all that together, as you can see on Slide 12, our outlook for industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada is comparable to 2009. This is up significantly from our previous forecast of down about 10%. The strength we've seen in our order book is driving this increase. For example, the combine early order program ended in January with a significantly higher than expected response rate. Demand for large tractors has been higher than expected as well. On the 8R Series Tractor, we have added schedule as orders have come in, effective availability in September 2010. The story is same on the 9000 Series Tractors, with effective availability in May 2010. Conditions in Western Europe are weak, with Ag sales there expected to be down 10% to 15% in the year. Farmer sentiment is low and used equipment inventories remain high due to the lack of products going to Central Europe. We expect sales in Central Europe and the CIS to remain under pressure as well. Things look better in South America, where sales are projected to increase 10% to 15%.  Turning to another product category, we expect retail sales of Turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the U.S. and Canada to be flat for the year, after a sharp drop in 2009.On Slide 13, Deere sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are projected to be up 4% to 6% in the year versus our previous forecast of down about 4%. Currency translation is projected to be positive about four points. As just discussed, demand for large Ag equipment is much stronger than anticipated. Product mix has shifted in our favor as well. In November, we talked about product mix, referring to sales of different categories of equipment being a factor in our lower 2010 outlook. At the time, we expected sales of large Ag products to be down almost 10%, with the large absorption of these products negatively affecting operating margins. In our current forecast, the anticipated improvement in large Ag will change the mix. We now expect mix to be neutral in 2010.The division will benefit from operating improvements made in 2009, as well as from positive price realization, lower material costs and the positive effects of currency. Conversely, about $300 million of the increase in pension OPEB expense will be charged to Ag & Turf. Also, the division will see higher R&D expense, primarily for Interim Tier 4, the Regulatory Engine Emission Standards in the U.S. and Stage III B in Europe.In Turf, we are encouraged by strong retail demand in commercial mowing and golf and turf equipment in January. For the year, the A&T division's operating margin is forecast to be around 10%. Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14.With continuing weak markets in the U.S. and abroad, net sales were down 15% in the quarter. Production tonnage was down 22%. The division reported an operating loss of $37 million. Again this quarter, C&F demonstrated commitment to its trough management plan through tight expense control but higher pension and OPEB expense, as well as higher R&D expense, mainly associated with Interim Tier 4 spending resulted in a decremental margin of about 50%. Without these two items, C&F's decremental margin would have been in the mid-20s. Through the aggressive management of production level, the division has continued to successfully manage inventories. At the end of January, based on inventory levels reported to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Deere Construction dealers in the U.S. and Canada were carrying about 1/3 less the inventory than the rest of the industry based on percent of days on hand.On Slide 15, Construction & Forestry sales are now expected to be up about 21% in 2010, up from the very low levels of 2009 and from our previous forecast of up about 18%. On the Construction side as you see from the chart, U.S. economic indicators for 2010 indicate the retail market will remain weak. Non-residential spending is forecast to be down again in 2010 due to ripple effects from the depressed housing sector coupled with tight credit conditions. Overall, we believe the retail market for Construction Equipment will be down 5% to 10% in 2010. Things are looking a little better however, for global forestry markets. Improving global economic conditions, better pulp prices and low-field inventories will benefit the Forestry segment in 2010. Again, this is in comparison with the very low levels of 2009. Deere's C&F division will benefit from higher production and sales. However, these will be offset by a higher charge of about $100 million for pension and OPEB expense. Other headwinds include higher R&D expenses, primarily for Interim Tier 4, as well as a possible material cost increase and roughly flat pricing. As a result, the C&F division's operating margins are expected to be similar to 2009.Let's move now to our credit operations. Slide 16 shows the worldwide credit operations provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average portfolio. In the first quarter, the provision on an annualized basis ran 52 basis points. Write-offs in the Construction & Forestry portfolios were lower than expected and lower than a year ago in absolute dollars. While this is encouraging, we aren't prepared to say we've turned the corner. The full-year provision is still forecast to run around 89 basis points, roughly the same as last year.On Slide 17, past dues for the worldwide Credit operation are about flat with last year. Annualized write-offs continue to reflect the excellent performance of our Ag portfolio. The Construction & Forestry rate has increased, but as noted a few moments ago, write-offs in dollars are lower than a year ago. The percentage is higher because the portfolio, the denominator, is lower. This reflects the steep decline in U.S. Construction Equipment sales since 2006.Moving to Slide 18, worldwide Credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company was $81 million in the quarter versus $45 million last year. The biggest factor was an improvement in financing spreads. This resulted from interest rates returning to more historical spreads following the interest rate volatility in late 2008 and early 2009. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide Credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $260 million in 2010.Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment operations and take a look at receivables and inventory on Slide 19. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were down roughly $1.4 billion in the quarter. Since our last outlook, in light of the higher than anticipated production levels expected in the fourth quarter, we are forecasting receivables and inventory to be up about $450 million in 2010. Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales.Slide 20 presents the product category details for the month of January expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were down 7%. Deere was down less than the industry. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 32%, Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel-drive tractor industry sales were up 5%. Deere was up a single-digit but more than the industry. Combine industry sales were up 14%. Deere was up more than the industry. Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart for row-crop tractors, Deere ended January with inventories at 21% of trailing 12 month sales. Combine inventories were at 6% of sales. As January percentage trailing 12 months retail sales have seen a slight uptick for row crop tractors year-over-year. At the end of January, the absolute number of units in inventory for both row-crop tractors and combines, as a percent of trailing 12 month sales, was lower than a year ago.Turning to Slide 21. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were down double digits and combines were up double digits in January. Deere's retail sales of selected Turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up a single-digit in the month. Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada on both first-in-the-dirt and settlement basis were down double digits for the month.Slide 22 shows raw material and logistics costs down about $160 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $150 million for the year. This is slightly lower than our previous forecast, reflecting higher commodity price projections for inputs like steel. This estimate could deteriorate further if commodity prices rise more than anticipated and the dollar weakens from its present level. The Ag & Turf division savings is forecasted at about $150 million. For Construction & Forestry, due to the currency impact on partner products, we are now forecasting C&F material costs to be flat to up $25 million.Looking at R&D expense on Slide 23, R&D was up about 7% in the first quarter, with currency translation accounting for about two points. R&D expense is expected to be up about 12% in fiscal 2010 with currency accounting for about one point. The bulk of the increase is accounted for by Interim Tier 4 emission spending.Moving now to Slide 24, pension expense in the first quarter was about $110 million. As discussed last quarter, the 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $400 million in pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to a change in the discount rate. Of the $400 million change, about $325 million will hit cost of sales, leading about $75 million in SA&G. Ag & Turf has responsibility for about $300 million of the additional expense while the increase for C&F is about $100 million.On Slide 25, equipment operations SA&G expense was up about 1% in the quarter. Currency translation accounted for about four points. Pension and OPEB added about three points. Excluding these two items, SA&G expense would've been down about six points in the quarter. For fiscal 2010, we now project SA&G to be up about eight points. Pension and OPEB accounts for about three points. Variable incentive compensation contributes about three points of the change and currency about two points.Moving to the tax rate on Slide 26. The implied first quarter tax rate for the equipment operations was about 36%. For 2010, the full-year effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Before touching on cash flow, currency movements, both translation and transactions or trade flows increased operating profit by about $75 million in the first quarter.On Slide 27, you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations even in years of tough market conditions. This reflects in large part, our success managing assets and controlling working capital levels. We anticipate strong cash flow from the equipment operations in 2010, $1.9 billion, up from last year's $1.4 billion. Such strong cash flow is further testament to the execution and success of the SVA model.On Slide 28, capital expenditures are now expected to be about $900 million, primarily driven by Interim Tier 4. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $600 million. Our forecast currently includes about $600 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year and capital spending for financial services is forecasted around $200 million in 2010, primarily for wind projects. In closing, John Deere has started 2010 on a strongly positive note and is looking for further improvement in the year ahead. Our performance in the face of stubbornly weak global economic conditions reflects the solid execution of our operating and marketing plans, and our success in taking costs and asset discipline to a new level. We remained squarely focused on our customers as well, expanding our global customer base and extending our competitive position. As a result of these factors, we continue to believe that our company is well prepared to capitalize on an eventual upturn in the economy and well-positioned to meet the world's growing need for food, fuel, shelter and infrastructure in the years to come."

This morning, John Deere reported results for the first quarter of 2010, and what a quarter it was. In spite of a decline in sales, earnings were up 19% from a year ago. The improvement was led by our Ag & Turf and Credit businesses, bot",2765,"Thank you, Marie. This morning, John Deere reported results for the first quarter of 2010, and what a quarter it was. In spite of a decline in sales, earnings were up 19% from a year ago. The improvement was led by our Ag & Turf and Credit businesses, both of which are experiencing improved conditions. Disciplined costs and asset management were again major stories, with SA&G expense, a little changed and trade receivables and inventories, down by $1.4 billion. Finally, our full-year forecast for earnings has been increased significantly to $1.3 billion. All in all, it was an impressive performance. Now let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3.First quarter net income attributable to Deere & Company was $243 million or $0.57 per share on net sales and revenues of $4.8 billion. It was the second highest earnings total for any first quarter in the company's history, trailing only the first quarter of 2008. As shown on Slide 4, total worldwide Equipment Operations net sales were down 7% in the first quarter versus first quarter of 2009. Currency translation on net sales was positive by about five points, with about two points of positive price realization.Turning to Slide 5, worldwide production tonnage was down 20% in the quarter. However, demand has been better than expected for large Ag and international Forestry product, accounting for the improvement in our tonnage forecast. For the full year, projected production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 5%. Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 6. Second quarter sales are expected to be up 4% to 6% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Currency translation is expected to be positive by about five points, with about two points of positive price realization. For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up 6% to 8% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about three points of positive currency translation and one to two points of positive price realization. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $1.3 billion for the year.Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 7. In the quarter, net sales were down 6%, with production tonnage down 20%. Operating profit was $352 million in the quarter. Lower raw material costs, positive price realizations and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and product mix, offset lower sales volumes and higher post-retirement benefit costs. A&T is starting to see benefits from last year's organizational realignment, resulting in the creation of the Ag & Turf division. Ongoing rationalization of processes, facilities and resources is allowing the division to more efficiently meet customer needs and reduce overall costs.Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business starting on Slide 8. Commodity prices for the '09, '10 crop have risen modestly since our last forecast. Corn acreage is expected to increase 1.5 million acres in 2010 to meet growing demand for feed, export and ethanol. What's more? Corn is expected to be more profitable this year. According to Informa, profits from corn will be $77 an acre more than soybeans in 2010. This is an additional $15 an acre above the 2009 levels.For soybeans, continued robust export demand will keep prices relatively high in the near term. Finally, cotton prices remain well above the year ago level, driven by lower production in Asia and the rapidly recovering Asian economy. Turning to Slide 9, forecast prices as you can see are below the very high levels of 2008, but remain strong on a historical basis. On Slide 10, 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 4% from 2009 levels. The biggest changes in the Livestock sector were milk prices have continued to climb and things are generally headed in the right direction.Slide 11 highlights farm net income in Brazil and Argentina. Argentina is recovering from the 2009 drought, driving increased demand for tractors, combines, sprayers and storage equipment. In Brazil, 2010 farm net income is expected to double from last year's level. Normally, when we talk about Brazil, we talk about soybeans. However, the primary driver if increased farm net income in 2010 is the large improvement in sugar. International sugar prices are extremely strong. Demand is higher than production due to a drastic drought-driven reduction in sugar output from India and China. Strong demand for sugar is only part of the story in Brazil. Other positive factors include demand for Brazilian commodities globally, as well as government sponsored low rate finance programs like FINAME and Mais Alimentos. These are all contributing to positive producer attitudes, which translate into higher spending on farm equipment.Putting all that together, as you can see on Slide 12, our outlook for industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada is comparable to 2009. This is up significantly from our previous forecast of down about 10%. The strength we've seen in our order book is driving this increase. For example, the combine early order program ended in January with a significantly higher than expected response rate. Demand for large tractors has been higher than expected as well. On the 8R Series Tractor, we have added schedule as orders have come in, effective availability in September 2010. The story is same on the 9000 Series Tractors, with effective availability in May 2010. Conditions in Western Europe are weak, with Ag sales there expected to be down 10% to 15% in the year. Farmer sentiment is low and used equipment inventories remain high due to the lack of products going to Central Europe. We expect sales in Central Europe and the CIS to remain under pressure as well. Things look better in South America, where sales are projected to increase 10% to 15%.  Turning to another product category, we expect retail sales of Turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the U.S. and Canada to be flat for the year, after a sharp drop in 2009.On Slide 13, Deere sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are projected to be up 4% to 6% in the year versus our previous forecast of down about 4%. Currency translation is projected to be positive about four points. As just discussed, demand for large Ag equipment is much stronger than anticipated. Product mix has shifted in our favor as well. In November, we talked about product mix, referring to sales of different categories of equipment being a factor in our lower 2010 outlook. At the time, we expected sales of large Ag products to be down almost 10%, with the large absorption of these products negatively affecting operating margins. In our current forecast, the anticipated improvement in large Ag will change the mix. We now expect mix to be neutral in 2010.The division will benefit from operating improvements made in 2009, as well as from positive price realization, lower material costs and the positive effects of currency. Conversely, about $300 million of the increase in pension OPEB expense will be charged to Ag & Turf. Also, the division will see higher R&D expense, primarily for Interim Tier 4, the Regulatory Engine Emission Standards in the U.S. and Stage III B in Europe.In Turf, we are encouraged by strong retail demand in commercial mowing and golf and turf equipment in January. For the year, the A&T division's operating margin is forecast to be around 10%. Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14.With continuing weak markets in the U.S. and abroad, net sales were down 15% in the quarter. Production tonnage was down 22%. The division reported an operating loss of $37 million. Again this quarter, C&F demonstrated commitment to its trough management plan through tight expense control but higher pension and OPEB expense, as well as higher R&D expense, mainly associated with Interim Tier 4 spending resulted in a decremental margin of about 50%. Without these two items, C&F's decremental margin would have been in the mid-20s. Through the aggressive management of production level, the division has continued to successfully manage inventories. At the end of January, based on inventory levels reported to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Deere Construction dealers in the U.S. and Canada were carrying about 1/3 less the inventory than the rest of the industry based on percent of days on hand.On Slide 15, Construction & Forestry sales are now expected to be up about 21% in 2010, up from the very low levels of 2009 and from our previous forecast of up about 18%. On the Construction side as you see from the chart, U.S. economic indicators for 2010 indicate the retail market will remain weak. Non-residential spending is forecast to be down again in 2010 due to ripple effects from the depressed housing sector coupled with tight credit conditions. Overall, we believe the retail market for Construction Equipment will be down 5% to 10% in 2010. Things are looking a little better however, for global forestry markets. Improving global economic conditions, better pulp prices and low-field inventories will benefit the Forestry segment in 2010. Again, this is in comparison with the very low levels of 2009. Deere's C&F division will benefit from higher production and sales. However, these will be offset by a higher charge of about $100 million for pension and OPEB expense. Other headwinds include higher R&D expenses, primarily for Interim Tier 4, as well as a possible material cost increase and roughly flat pricing. As a result, the C&F division's operating margins are expected to be similar to 2009.Let's move now to our credit operations. Slide 16 shows the worldwide credit operations provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average portfolio. In the first quarter, the provision on an annualized basis ran 52 basis points. Write-offs in the Construction & Forestry portfolios were lower than expected and lower than a year ago in absolute dollars. While this is encouraging, we aren't prepared to say we've turned the corner. The full-year provision is still forecast to run around 89 basis points, roughly the same as last year.On Slide 17, past dues for the worldwide Credit operation are about flat with last year. Annualized write-offs continue to reflect the excellent performance of our Ag portfolio. The Construction & Forestry rate has increased, but as noted a few moments ago, write-offs in dollars are lower than a year ago. The percentage is higher because the portfolio, the denominator, is lower. This reflects the steep decline in U.S. Construction Equipment sales since 2006.Moving to Slide 18, worldwide Credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company was $81 million in the quarter versus $45 million last year. The biggest factor was an improvement in financing spreads. This resulted from interest rates returning to more historical spreads following the interest rate volatility in late 2008 and early 2009. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide Credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $260 million in 2010.Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment operations and take a look at receivables and inventory on Slide 19. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were down roughly $1.4 billion in the quarter. Since our last outlook, in light of the higher than anticipated production levels expected in the fourth quarter, we are forecasting receivables and inventory to be up about $450 million in 2010. Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales.Slide 20 presents the product category details for the month of January expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were down 7%. Deere was down less than the industry. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 32%, Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel-drive tractor industry sales were up 5%. Deere was up a single-digit but more than the industry. Combine industry sales were up 14%. Deere was up more than the industry. Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart for row-crop tractors, Deere ended January with inventories at 21% of trailing 12 month sales. Combine inventories were at 6% of sales. As January percentage trailing 12 months retail sales have seen a slight uptick for row crop tractors year-over-year. At the end of January, the absolute number of units in inventory for both row-crop tractors and combines, as a percent of trailing 12 month sales, was lower than a year ago.Turning to Slide 21. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were down double digits and combines were up double digits in January. Deere's retail sales of selected Turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up a single-digit in the month. Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada on both first-in-the-dirt and settlement basis were down double digits for the month.Slide 22 shows raw material and logistics costs down about $160 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $150 million for the year. This is slightly lower than our previous forecast, reflecting higher commodity price projections for inputs like steel. This estimate could deteriorate further if commodity prices rise more than anticipated and the dollar weakens from its present level. The Ag & Turf division savings is forecasted at about $150 million. For Construction & Forestry, due to the currency impact on partner products, we are now forecasting C&F material costs to be flat to up $25 million.Looking at R&D expense on Slide 23, R&D was up about 7% in the first quarter, with currency translation accounting for about two points. R&D expense is expected to be up about 12% in fiscal 2010 with currency accounting for about one point. The bulk of the increase is accounted for by Interim Tier 4 emission spending.Moving now to Slide 24, pension expense in the first quarter was about $110 million. As discussed last quarter, the 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $400 million in pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to a change in the discount rate. Of the $400 million change, about $325 million will hit cost of sales, leading about $75 million in SA&G. Ag & Turf has responsibility for about $300 million of the additional expense while the increase for C&F is about $100 million.On Slide 25, equipment operations SA&G expense was up about 1% in the quarter. Currency translation accounted for about four points. Pension and OPEB added about three points. Excluding these two items, SA&G expense would've been down about six points in the quarter. For fiscal 2010, we now project SA&G to be up about eight points. Pension and OPEB accounts for about three points. Variable incentive compensation contributes about three points of the change and currency about two points.Moving to the tax rate on Slide 26. The implied first quarter tax rate for the equipment operations was about 36%. For 2010, the full-year effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Before touching on cash flow, currency movements, both translation and transactions or trade flows increased operating profit by about $75 million in the first quarter.On Slide 27, you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations even in years of tough market conditions. This reflects in large part, our success managing assets and controlling working capital levels. We anticipate strong cash flow from the equipment operations in 2010, $1.9 billion, up from last year's $1.4 billion. Such strong cash flow is further testament to the execution and success of the SVA model.On Slide 28, capital expenditures are now expected to be about $900 million, primarily driven by Interim Tier 4. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $600 million. Our forecast currently includes about $600 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year and capital spending for financial services is forecasted around $200 million in 2010, primarily for wind projects. In closing, John Deere has started 2010 on a strongly positive note and is looking for further improvement in the year ahead. Our performance in the face of stubbornly weak global economic conditions reflects the solid execution of our operating and marketing plans, and our success in taking costs and asset discipline to a new level. We remained squarely focused on our customers as well, expanding our global customer base and extending our competitive position. As a result of these factors, we continue to believe that our company is well prepared to capitalize on an eventual upturn in the economy and well-positioned to meet the world's growing need for food, fuel, shelter and infrastructure in the years to come."

266112,83440447,62226,"Deere & Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May 19, 2010",2010-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Marie. John Deere's strong performance continued in the second quarter of 2010. Earnings were up 16% on a sales increase of 6%. Results would've been higher without a charge related to the recent enactment of U.S. Healthcare legislation. The qua",3269,"Thanks, Marie. John Deere's strong performance continued in the second quarter of 2010. Earnings were up 16% on a sales increase of 6%. Results would've been higher without a charge related to the recent enactment of U.S. Healthcare legislation. 
The quarter's improvement was broad based. The gain was led by Ag & Turf, but all three divisions had higher profit. Among the highlights, our Construction & Forestry business saw its first year-over-year profit increase in nine quarters.
Solid execution of our business plans was again a big story for the quarter as was disciplined cost and asset management. Trade receivables of inventory declined by some $900 million.
Finally, in line with improved business conditions, our full year earnings forecast has been increased and now totals approximately $1.6 billion. All in all, it was a productive quarter, and John Deere seems well on its way to a very good year.
Now let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3. This is a supplemental slide illustrating the impact of the tax charge for U.S. Healthcare legislation taken in the quarter excluding the approximately $130 million charge, net income attributable to Deere & Co. would have been $677 million or $1.58 per share.
On Slide 4, we show that net income attributable to Deere & Co. on a reported basis was $547 million. As we mentioned, that was a 16% increase in profit on a 6% increase in net sales and revenues.
Turning to Slide 5. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 6% to $6.5 billion, Deere's second-highest sales on record in a second quarter. Currency translation on net sales was positive by four points and price realization was positive by two points. Both equipment divisions had positive price realization in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Worldwide production tonnage was up 7% in the quarter. Construction & Forestry tonnage was up considerably, in large part due to easy comparisons with the second quarter of 2009 when tonnage was down 62% from the previous year's level.
In addition, improving global economic conditions, better pulp prices and low field inventory are benefiting the Forestry segment in 2010. Tonnage outside the U.S. and Canada increased due to strength in Argentina and Brazil, China, India and Mexico. For the full year, worldwide production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 11%.
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 7. Third quarter sales are expected to be up 21% to 23% compared with the third quarter of 2009. In the financial forecast, currency translation on net sales is expected to be positive by about two points.
For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up 11% to 13% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about three points of positive currency translation and approximately 1.5 points of positive price realization. This in line with our previous guidance of one to two points.
Net income attributable to Deere & Co. is now forecast to be about $1.6 billion for the year versus our prior guidance of about $1.3 billion. That includes the second quarter tax charge of approximately $130 million for U.S. healthcare legislation.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Ag & Turf on Slide 8. In the quarter, net sales were up 1% and so was production tonnage. Operating profit, however, improved by nearly $250 million or 35% to $952 million. The increase was primarily due to improved price realization, higher production volume, the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower raw material cost. These factors were partially offset by higher post-retirement benefit cost.
You might notice, we didn't include the A&T incremental margin this quarter. It calculates at about 498% due to the very large swing in operating profit on the small increase in sales. A&T executed well with an operating margin in the quarter of about 17%.
The division is benefiting again this year from strong sales of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Compared with a normal year, a favorable mix contributed one point of margin in the quarter.
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business starting on Slide 9. Commodity prices for the '09/'10 crop have remained steady at attractive level since our last forecast with soybean seeing an improvement. Soybean exports have remained at good level despite a strong South American crop, and the good weather we have been experiencing here in the U.S. tends to favor more corn planting.
Cotton prices remain well above year-ago level driven by strong Chinese demand and a reduction in the global cotton supply. On Slide 10, we have included Deere's estimate of U.S. acres planted for 2010/2011. They are the same as the USDA estimates. Corn acreage is expected to increase 2.3 million acres to 88.8 million in order to meet growing demand for feed, exports and ethanol.
Turning to Slide 11. 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 5% from 2009 level, a slight improvement from our last forecast. Livestock is driving the increase in 2010 receipts.  The industry should finally expect profits this year after two years of losses. As you can see, 2011 farm cash receipts are expected to be up slightly from 2010 level.
Deere's outlook for the EU-27 is shown on Slide 12. We are beginning to see stabilization in this market but at very low levels. We don't expect any real recovery in 2010. Farmers' sentiment in the region remains negative. Small grain, pork and beef prices are expected to remain under pressure, and used-equipment inventories remain at high level due to the lack of product going to Central Europe. The industry forecast for 2010 unit tractor sales is slightly below levels seen during the last recession in the early 1990s.
Slide 13 highlights farm net income in Brazil and Argentina. Income from two main crops, soybean and sugarcane, drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil. So going forward, we will provide a breakout of these two crops when discussing farm net income. Corn, paddy rice and cotton make up the other category.
2010 farm net income is driven by the strength in sugar due to a drastic drought-driven reduction in output from India and China. Demand for sugar, though, is only part of the story in Brazil. Other positive factors include demand for Brazilian commodities globally as well as government-sponsored low-rate finance programs like FINAME and Mais Alimentos. These are all contributing to positive producer attitude which translate into higher spending on farm equipment.
In April, the Brazilian government announced the FINAME financing program would be extended through the end of December. For loans taken through the end of June, the interest rate will remain at 4.5%. For loans taken from July through December, the interest rate will be 5.5%, still an extremely attractive rate in the Brazilian market.
Argentina is recovering from the severe 2009 drought with ag commodity production up over 40% in 2010, with farm net income about $6 billion higher than 2009. We are seeing increased demand for tractor, combines, sprayers and forage equipment. Clearly, the markets are improving and there's a lot of good news out of Brazil. 
The next two slides illustrate the long-term potential we see in the country. Slide 14 shows Deere estimates for planted acres and production of soybeans in Brazil over the next eight years. Planted acres are expected to increase about 45% and production about 60%. The story is similar for sugarcane. On Slide 15, you can see we expect sugarcane planted acres to increase about 65% and production about 55%.
To take advantage of this opportunity, Deere opened a tractor factory in Brazil in 2007 to complement our combine factory. And in 2008, we announced an $80 million expansion, adding capacity to both factories. Of course, we didn't undertake this without the buy-in of our dealers, who are committed to representing John Deere and willing to invest in their own businesses.
Moving to Slide 16. You can see we have added almost 70 dealer locations in the last six years. And on Slide 17, we have expanded our product offerings to meet the needs of our customers. In fact, in 2010 and 2011, we will add 50 new or updated products to our lineup, covering a broad array of categories, from tractors and combines to turf equipment and precision technology. It's an exciting picture for Brazil, and it's clear why Deere and its dealers are looking forward to the opportunity that lies ahead and preserving our growing customer base there.
Turning to another great opportunity for John Deere as you can see on Slide 18. On the heels of a slight pickup in activity and loosening of liquidity in Russia, John Deere celebrated the grand opening of its Domodedovo manufacturing and parts center outside of Moscow last month. We began limited assembly of large tractor, combines, motor graders and 4WD loaders.
Slide 19 highlights our 2010 industry outlook. Sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are now forecasted to be up 5% to 10%. That's quite a change from our February forecast of comparable to 2009, and our November 2009 forecast of down about 10%.
We continue to see our order books strengthen especially for large ag equipment. Remember, the combine early order program ended in January with a significantly higher-than-expected response rate. Demand for large tractors has been higher than expected as well.
The new 8R Series tractor has been very well received in the marketplace. We have continued to add schedules throughout the first half of the year and effective availability is November 2010. Effective availability for the 9000 Series tractors is September 2010.
Conditions in Western Europe remain weak with ag sales there is still expected to be down 10% to 15% in the year. Although Russia is up slightly, other countries in the region remain down. Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to remain under pressure. And based on the factors we covered earlier, South America is now projected to increase about 25%.
Turning to another product category. We expect retail sales of turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the U.S. and Canada to be up 5% to 10% in the year. We remain cautiously optimistic for this market as we have witnessed a slow, steady movement in the right direction. Economic indicators are improving. Weather has been favorable for sales, and we have had a very good start to the all-important spring selling season.
Putting this all together on Slide 20. Deere sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are now projected to be up 9% to 11% in the year versus our previous forecast of up 4% to 6%. Currency translation on net sales is projected to be positive about three points.  For the year, the A&T division's operating margin is forecast to be around 12% to 13%.
Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 21. With dealers replenishing their fleet and global forestry market strengthening from a very low base, Deere's net sales were up 52% in the quarter. Production tonnage was up 82%. The division reported an operating profit of $36 million due to the very large volume increases from last year's very low base and positive price realization, C&F's incremental margin was about 36%.
On Slide 22, although we are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be down about 5% for the full year, we feel the market has reached its bottom. We are encouraged by a number of positive development. Independent rental companies are in talks and in some cases beginning to purchase earth-moving equipment. Also, Deere dealers are starting to see an improvement in rental utilization and used-equipment turns. As mentioned earlier, global forestry markets are improving, with pulp prices up significantly from last year and U.S. lumber production increasing. 
On Slide 23, Construction & Forestry sales are now expected to be up 30% in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009. Our previous forecast was up about 21%. Our forecast now has C&F operating margin slightly above break even for the year. Previously, the division had been forecasted to lose money.
Let's move now to our credit operation. Slide 24 shows the worldwide credit operations provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average portfolio. Year-to-date on an annualized basis, the provision is 52 basis points. In the first half of the year, write-offs in the Construction & Forestry portfolio have been considerably lower than expected. We are encouraged by improvement in recovery rate and increased pricing on repossessions. However, we do continue to have high levels of repossessions and delinquent accounts. Consequently, we remain conservative in our forecast provision. The full-year provision for John Deere Credit is forecast to run about 71 basis points, which is an improvement over our prior forecast of about 88 basis points.
On Slide 25, past dues for the worldwide credit operations are about flat with last year. Another promising sign is the C&F revolving charge and financing lease past dues are all lower than a year ago. Annualized write-off continue to reflect the excellent performance of our Ag portfolio, coupled with improvements in the other portfolios. 
Moving to Slide 26. Worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Co. was $84 million in the quarter versus $68 million last year. The biggest factors were an improvement in financing spreads, a lower provision for credit losses, growth in the portfolio and higher commissions from crop insurance. These were partially offset by lower tax credits related to wind energy projects and higher SA&G.  Looking ahead, we are now projecting worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Co. of about $300 million in 2010.
Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment operations and take a look at receivables and inventory on Slide 27. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were down roughly $900 million in the second quarter versus second quarter 2009. We are now forecasting receivables and inventories to be up about $700 million for the year. The increase of $250 million from our outlook last quarter is a result of increasing production level especially in the fourth quarter.
Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. On Slide 28, you see the product categories for U.S. and Canada for the month of April expressed in units. For utility tractors, industry sales were down 6%. Deere was down low-double digits. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 6% and Deere was up less than the industry. 4WD tractor industry sales were up 40%. Deere was up more than the industry. And for combines, the industry was up 21%. Deere was up a single digit. Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart, for row-crop tractors, Deere ended April with inventories of 18% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 8% of sales.
Turning to Slide 29. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were down a single digit and combines were down double digits in April. Deere's retail sales of selected turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up several digits in the month. Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada, on both a First-in-the-Dirt and settlement basis, were up double digits in the month.
Slide 30 shows raw material and logistics cost down about $70 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $100 million for the year. This is slightly lower than our previous forecast, reflecting higher commodity price projections for inputs like steel. By division, the Ag & Turf savings are forecast at about $125 million. For Construction &  Forestry, we are now forecasting a material cost increase of about $25 million. This is due to the currency impact on partner products and higher steel prices.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 31, R&D was up about 4% in the quarter with currency translation accounting for about one point. Year-to-date, R&D expense is up about 6%. For the full year, R&D expense is expected to be up about 13%. We expect R&D to ramp up in the second half of the year due to Interim Tier 4 durability build and feasibility testing on products that have Interim Tier 4 production dates after 2011.
Moving now to Slide 32. Pension expense in the second quarter was up about $70 million. The 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $350 million in pension and OPEB expense, which is down from our previous forecast of about $400 million. Of the $350 million, about $300 million will hit cost of sales, leaving about $50 million in SA&G. Approximately $275 million of the additional expense is attributable to the Ag & Turf division, while the increase for C&F is about $75 million.
On Slide 33, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 8% in the quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about five points and currency translation added about three points.
For fiscal 2010, we now project SA&G to be up about nine points. Variable incentive compensation is expected to contribute about four points of the change as profitability improve. In fiscal 2009, when profitability was lower, variable incentive compensation was about six points lower than it was in 2008. Pension and OPEB accounts were about two points and currency translation about two points.
Moving to the tax rate on Slide 34. The second quarter tax rate includes the charge for U.S. healthcare legislation of about $130 million. For 2010, the full year effective tax rate is expected to be about 40%. This includes the $130 million charge. Excluding the charge, the forecast effective tax rate for 2010 is 34% to 35%.
Before touching on cash flow, currency movements both translation and transaction or trade flows, increased operating profit by about $80 million in the second quarter, predominantly in Ag & Turf.
On Slide 35, you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations even in the areas of tough market conditions like 2009. This reflects in large part our success managing assets and controlling working capital level. We anticipate strong cash flow from the equipment operations in 2010 about $2.5 billion, up from last year's $1.4 billion. Such strong cash flow is further testament to the successful execution of the SVA [Shareholder Value Added] model.
On Slide 36, capital expenditures are expected to be about $900 million for the year primarily driven by Interim Tier 4. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $550 million. Our forecast currently includes about $600 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year.
In closing, John Deere has reached the halfway mark of 2010 on a strong pace. We're looking forward to delivering a solid second half of the year. Our performance, no doubt, reflects some improvement in overall economic condition. It certainly reflects strong demand for large farm machinery in the United States and other key markets. 
By the same token, we are benefiting from the solid execution of our operating and marketing plan, allowing us to quickly capitalize on this positive move in the marketplace. We've been quite successful extending our competitive position as well, increasing capacity and adding productive new model of equipment to serve an expanding global customer base. As a result, we believe our company is well positioned to benefit from a growing worldwide economy and to continue delivering value to our customers and investors for the long haul.

You've got $1.8 billion of sales growth, sequentially, I'm talking. And on the segment profits, the first half, you did about $1.3 billion. The back half guidance roughly implies $1.2 billion. So again, we're saying sales we're going up $1.8 billion sequentially, but profits go down $100 million. Now I can see the R&D, first half to second half does go up 100. You get a little D&A help, a little pension help. But let's call that 100, I understand the 1.3 going to 1.2. But on the revenue growth of $1.8 billion, if I think of a typical incremental margin of 25% that you would get, that you're saying we're not going to get at all. Sequentially, not year-over-year, sequentially, that's implying your price versus cost in the back half of the year is like negative 3%."

But in many other areas, we are very low, as we talked about in Europe and in Russia, for example, although recovering in the smaller products, like compact utility tractors and the turf and et cetera, et cetera. And you have Brazil recovering, or I should say maybe more broadly, South America recovering,  but still not to the very high levels or the good levels that they would have been. So as we think about where we are relative to our total opportunity, we would tell you that we're again below our ""average sales opportunity."" That said, Susan did point out that we are benefiting in the quarter. And actually, this would be true for the full year by about a point because of the heavy mix of large ag equipment. We also have good pricing, as we talked about in the quarter, and a tailwind on raw materials that will flip in the second half of the year. You're right. By our calculations, going back, that 17% is very, very strong and compares against -- we think as we calculate our previous peak in the second quarter, would have been about 15%. So I would say there is additional upside, certainly in terms of volumes, to summarize. But you do need to bear in mind that we have a very favorable mix of global large equipment and it's worth about eight points. And again, I want to emphasize that point is not year-over-year.

Regarding the Mais Alimentos program, at least as far as last week, we still had not have heard anything from the government as to whether or not it would be continued conventional wisdom in Brazil, does believe it will be continued. So I wouldn't see a decline in the fourth quarter. We had originally talked about that when we assume that the FINAME rates went back to more normal levels. As we look forward into 2011, again absent any other information, you have to assume that, that special FINAME rate will end at the end of December. At least, that's what for planning purposes what you would expect. It will affect sales though a little bit further into our fiscal 2011, because you usually have to commit with the bank sometime. We expect it would be by the end of November. And then you have a few months after that to actually take delivery on the equipment. So that would get us into sometime into our second quarter.

And Deere as a whole and lately in Construction & Forestry, this obsession with working capital has caused some pretty extraordinary swings in production tonnage and operating leverage. And it's resulted in volatility of operating earnings, with EPS down 40% in '09 and then back up 42% in '10. So what I'm getting from investors is that they really view Deere as more of a short-term speculative vehicle and not so much a long-term investment. And the incentive system inside Deere is SVA-based, has a very sharp focus on capital employed. So we can expect these huge swings in production schedules on a regular basis going forward. So I guess my question is, do we have a situation here of misaligned interests? And would it be better to smooth earnings a little bit over the cycles by ultimately over and underproducing over time, better than panicking, cutting production and quickly raising production when we find ourselves short competitively of inventory? Do you have any thoughts on that?"

Results would've been higher without a charge related to the recent enactment of U.S. Healthcare legislation. The qua",3272,"Thanks, Marie. John Deere's strong performance continued in the second quarter of 2010. Earnings were up 16% on a sales increase of 6%. Results would've been higher without a charge related to the recent enactment of U.S. Healthcare legislation. 
The quarter's improvement was broad based. The gain was led by Ag & Turf, but all three divisions had higher profit. Among the highlights, our Construction & Forestry business saw its first year-over-year profit increase in nine quarters.
Solid execution of our business plans was again a big story for the quarter as was disciplined cost and asset management. Trade receivables of inventory declined by some $900 million.
Finally, in line with improved business conditions, our full year earnings forecast has been increased and now totals approximately $1.6 billion. All in all, it was a productive quarter, and John Deere seems well on its way to a very good year.
Now let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3. This is a supplemental slide illustrating the impact of the tax charge for U.S. Healthcare legislation taken in the quarter excluding the approximately $130 million charge, net income attributable to Deere & Co. would have been $677 million or $1.58 per share.
On Slide 4, we show that net income attributable to Deere & Co. on a reported basis was $547 million. As we mentioned, that was a 16% increase in profit on a 6% increase in net sales and revenues.
Turning to Slide 5. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 6% to $6.5 billion, Deere's second-highest sales on record in a second quarter. Currency translation on net sales was positive by four points and price realization was positive by two points. Both equipment divisions had positive price realization in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Worldwide production tonnage was up 7% in the quarter. Construction & Forestry tonnage was up considerably, in large part due to easy comparisons with the second quarter of 2009 when tonnage was down 62% from the previous year's level.
In addition, improving global economic conditions, better pulp prices and low field inventory are benefiting the Forestry segment in 2010. Tonnage outside the U.S. and Canada increased due to strength in Argentina and Brazil, China, India and Mexico. For the full year, worldwide production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 11%.
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 7. Third quarter sales are expected to be up 21% to 23% compared with the third quarter of 2009. In the financial forecast, currency translation on net sales is expected to be positive by about two points.
For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up 11% to 13% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about three points of positive currency translation and approximately 1.5 points of positive price realization. This in line with our previous guidance of one to two points.
Net income attributable to Deere & Co. is now forecast to be about $1.6 billion for the year versus our prior guidance of about $1.3 billion. That includes the second quarter tax charge of approximately $130 million for U.S. healthcare legislation.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Ag & Turf on Slide 8. In the quarter, net sales were up 1% and so was production tonnage. Operating profit, however, improved by nearly $250 million or 35% to $952 million. The increase was primarily due to improved price realization, higher production volume, the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower raw material cost. These factors were partially offset by higher post-retirement benefit cost.
You might notice, we didn't include the A&T incremental margin this quarter. It calculates at about 498% due to the very large swing in operating profit on the small increase in sales. A&T executed well with an operating margin in the quarter of about 17%.
The division is benefiting again this year from strong sales of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Compared with a normal year, a favorable mix contributed one point of margin in the quarter.
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business starting on Slide 9. Commodity prices for the '09/'10 crop have remained steady at attractive level since our last forecast with soybean seeing an improvement. Soybean exports have remained at good level despite a strong South American crop, and the good weather we have been experiencing here in the U.S. tends to favor more corn planting.
Cotton prices remain well above year-ago level driven by strong Chinese demand and a reduction in the global cotton supply. On Slide 10, we have included Deere's estimate of U.S. acres planted for 2010/2011. They are the same as the USDA estimates. Corn acreage is expected to increase 2.3 million acres to 88.8 million in order to meet growing demand for feed, exports and ethanol.
Turning to Slide 11. 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 5% from 2009 level, a slight improvement from our last forecast. Livestock is driving the increase in 2010 receipts.  The industry should finally expect profits this year after two years of losses. As you can see, 2011 farm cash receipts are expected to be up slightly from 2010 level.
Deere's outlook for the EU-27 is shown on Slide 12. We are beginning to see stabilization in this market but at very low levels. We don't expect any real recovery in 2010. Farmers' sentiment in the region remains negative. Small grain, pork and beef prices are expected to remain under pressure, and used-equipment inventories remain at high level due to the lack of product going to Central Europe. The industry forecast for 2010 unit tractor sales is slightly below levels seen during the last recession in the early 1990s.
Slide 13 highlights farm net income in Brazil and Argentina. Income from two main crops, soybean and sugarcane, drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil. So going forward, we will provide a breakout of these two crops when discussing farm net income. Corn, paddy rice and cotton make up the other category.
2010 farm net income is driven by the strength in sugar due to a drastic drought-driven reduction in output from India and China. Demand for sugar, though, is only part of the story in Brazil. Other positive factors include demand for Brazilian commodities globally as well as government-sponsored low-rate finance programs like FINAME and Mais Alimentos. These are all contributing to positive producer attitude which translate into higher spending on farm equipment.
In April, the Brazilian government announced the FINAME financing program would be extended through the end of December. For loans taken through the end of June, the interest rate will remain at 4.5%. For loans taken from July through December, the interest rate will be 5.5%, still an extremely attractive rate in the Brazilian market.
Argentina is recovering from the severe 2009 drought with ag commodity production up over 40% in 2010, with farm net income about $6 billion higher than 2009. We are seeing increased demand for tractor, combines, sprayers and forage equipment. Clearly, the markets are improving and there's a lot of good news out of Brazil. 
The next two slides illustrate the long-term potential we see in the country. Slide 14 shows Deere estimates for planted acres and production of soybeans in Brazil over the next eight years. Planted acres are expected to increase about 45% and production about 60%. The story is similar for sugarcane. On Slide 15, you can see we expect sugarcane planted acres to increase about 65% and production about 55%.
To take advantage of this opportunity, Deere opened a tractor factory in Brazil in 2007 to complement our combine factory. And in 2008, we announced an $80 million expansion, adding capacity to both factories. Of course, we didn't undertake this without the buy-in of our dealers, who are committed to representing John Deere and willing to invest in their own businesses.
Moving to Slide 16. You can see we have added almost 70 dealer locations in the last six years. And on Slide 17, we have expanded our product offerings to meet the needs of our customers. In fact, in 2010 and 2011, we will add 50 new or updated products to our lineup, covering a broad array of categories, from tractors and combines to turf equipment and precision technology. It's an exciting picture for Brazil, and it's clear why Deere and its dealers are looking forward to the opportunity that lies ahead and to serving our growing customer base there.
Turning to another great opportunity for John Deere, as you can see on Slide 18. On the heels of a slight pickup in activity and loosening of liquidity in Russia, John Deere celebrated the grand opening of its Domodedovo, our manufacturing and parts center outside of Moscow last month. We began limited assembly of large tractor, combines, motor graders and 4WD loaders.
Slide 19 highlights our 2010 industry outlook. Sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are now forecasted to be up 5% to 10%. That's quite a change from our February forecast of comparable to 2009, and our November 2009 forecast of down about 10%.
We continue to see our order books strengthen especially for large ag equipment. Remember, the combine early order program ended in January with a significantly higher-than-expected response rate. Demand for large tractors has been higher than expected as well.
The new 8R Series tractor has been very well received in the marketplace. We have continued to add schedules throughout the first half of the year, and effective availability is November 2010. Effective availability for the 9000 Series tractors is September 2010.
Conditions in Western Europe remain weak with ag sales there is still expected to be down 10% to 15% in the year. Although Russia is up slightly, other countries in the region remain down. Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to remain under pressure. And based on the factors we covered earlier, South America is now projected to increase about 25%.
Turning to another product category. We expect retail sales of turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the U.S. and Canada to be up 5% to 10% in the year. We remain cautiously optimistic for this market as we have witnessed a slow, steady movement in the right direction. Economic indicators are improving. Weather has been favorable for sales, and we have had a very good start to the all-important spring selling season.
Putting this all together on Slide 20. Deere sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are now projected to be up 9% to 11% in the year versus our previous forecast of up 4% to 6%. Currency translation on net sales is projected to be positive about three points.  For the year, the A&T division's operating margin is forecast to be around 12% to 13%.
Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 21. With dealers replenishing their fleet and global forestry market strengthening from a very low base, Deere's net sales were up 52% in the quarter. Production tonnage was up 82%. The division reported an operating profit of $36 million. Due to the very large volume increases from last year's very low base and positive price realization, C&F's incremental margin was about 36%.
On Slide 22, although we are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be down about 5% for the full year, we feel the market has reached its bottom. We are encouraged by a number of positive development. Independent rental companies are in talks, and in some cases, beginning to purchase earth-moving equipment. Also, Deere dealers are starting to see an improvement in rental utilization and used-equipment turns. As mentioned earlier, global forestry markets are improving, with pulp prices up significantly from last year and U.S. lumber production increasing. 
On Slide 23, Construction & Forestry sales are now expected to be up about 30% in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009. Our previous forecast was up about 21%. Our forecast now has C&F operating margin slightly above breakeven for the year. Previously, the division have been forecasted to lose money.
Let's move now to our credit operations. Slide 24 shows the worldwide credit operations provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average portfolio. Year-to-date on an annualized basis, the provision is 52 basis points. In the first half of the year, write-offs in the Construction & Forestry portfolio have been considerably lower than expected. We are encouraged by improvement in recovery rate and increased pricing on repossessions. However, we do continue to have high levels of repossessions and delinquent accounts. Consequently, we remain conservative in our forecast provision. The full-year provision for John Deere Credit is forecast to run about 71 basis points, which is an improvement over our prior forecast of about 88 basis points.
On Slide 25, past dues for the worldwide credit operations are about flat with last year. Another promising sign is the C&F revolving charge and financing lease past dues are all lower than a year ago. Annualized write-offs continue to reflect the excellent performance of our Ag portfolio, coupled with improvements in the other portfolios. 
Moving to Slide 26. Worldwide credit operations' net income attributable to Deere & Co. was $84 million in the quarter versus $68 million last year. The biggest factors were an improvement in financing spreads, a lower provision for credit losses, growth in the portfolio and higher commissions from crop insurance. These were partially offset by lower tax credits related to wind energy projects and higher SA&G. Looking ahead, we are now projecting worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Co. of about $300 million in 2010.
Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment operations and take a look at receivables and inventory on Slide 27. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were down roughly $900 million in the second quarter versus second quarter of 2009. We are now forecasting receivables and inventories to be up about $700 million for the year. The increase of $250 million from our outlook last quarter is a result of increasing production levels, especially in the fourth quarter.
Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. On Slide 28, you see the product categories for U.S. and Canada for the month of April expressed in units. For utility tractors, industry sales were down 6%. Deere was down low double-digits. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 6% and Deere was up less than the industry. 4WD tractor industry sales were up 40%. Deere was up more than the industry. And for combines, the industry was up 21%. Deere was up a single digit. Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart, for row-crop tractors, Deere ended April with inventories of 18% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 8% of sales.
Turning to Slide 29. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were down a single digit and combines were down double digits in April. Deere's retail sales of selected turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up several digits in the month. Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada, on both a First-in-the-Dirt and settlement basis, were up double digits in the month.
Slide 30 shows raw material and logistics cost down about $70 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $100 million for the year. This is slightly lower than our previous forecast, reflecting higher commodity price projections for inputs like steel. By division, the Ag & Turf savings are forecast at about $125 million. For Construction &  Forestry, we are now forecasting a material cost increase of about $25 million. This is due to the currency impact on partner products and higher steel prices.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 31, R&D was up about 4% in the quarter with currency translation accounting for about one point. Year-to-date, R&D expense is up about 6%. For the full year, R&D expense is expected to be up about 13%. We expect R&D to ramp up in the second half of the year due to Interim Tier 4 durability build and feasibility testing on products that have Interim Tier 4 production dates after 2011.
Moving now to Slide 32. Pension expense in the second quarter was up about $70 million. The 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $350 million in pension and OPEB expense, which is down from our previous forecast of about $400 million. Of the $350 million, about $300 million will hit cost of sales, leaving about $50 million in SA&G. Approximately $275 million of the additional expense is attributable to the Ag & Turf division, while the increase for C&F is about $75 million.
On Slide 33, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 8% in the quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about five points and currency translation added about three points.
For fiscal 2010, we now project SA&G to be up about nine points. Variable incentive compensation is expected to contribute about four points of the change as profitability improve. In fiscal 2009, when profitability was lower, variable incentive compensation was about six points lower than it was in 2008. Pension and OPEB accounts were about two points and currency translation about two points.
Moving to the tax rate on Slide 34. The second quarter tax rate includes the charge for U.S. healthcare legislation of about $130 million. For 2010, the full year effective tax rate is expected to be about 40%. This includes the $130 million charge. Excluding the charge, the forecast effective tax rate for 2010 is 34% to 35%.
Before touching on cash flow, currency movements both translation and transaction or trade flows, increased operating profit by about $80 million in the second quarter, predominantly in Ag & Turf.
On Slide 35, you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations even in the areas of tough market conditions like 2009. This reflects in large part our success managing assets and controlling working capital level. We anticipate strong cash flow from the equipment operations in 2010 about $2.5 billion, up from last year's $1.4 billion. Such strong cash flow is further testament to the successful execution of the SVA [Shareholder Value Added] model.
On Slide 36, capital expenditures are expected to be about $900 million for the year primarily driven by Interim Tier 4. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $550 million. Our forecast currently includes about $600 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year.
In closing, John Deere has reached the halfway mark of 2010 on a strong pace. We're looking forward to delivering a solid second half of the year. Our performance, no doubt, reflects some improvement in overall economic condition. It certainly reflects strong demand for large farm machinery in the United States and other key markets. 
By the same token, we are benefiting from the solid execution of our operating and marketing plan, allowing us to quickly capitalize on this positive move in the marketplace. We've been quite successful extending our competitive position as well, increasing capacity and adding productive new model of equipment to serve an expanding global customer base. As a result, we believe our company is well positioned to benefit from a growing worldwide economy and to continue delivering value to our customers and investors for the long haul.

That said, Susan did point out that we are benefiting in the quarter. And actually, this would be true for the full year by about a point because of the heavy mix of large ag equipment. We also have good pricing, as we talked about in the quarter, and a tailwind on raw materials that will flip in the second half of the year. You're right. By our calculations, going back, that 17% is very, very strong and compares against -- we think as we calculate our previous peak in the second quarter, would have been about 15%.

So I wouldn't see a decline in the fourth quarter. We had originally talked about that when we assume that the FINAME rates went back to more normal levels. As we look forward into 2011, again absent any other information, you have to assume that, that special FINAME rate will end at the end of December.

And Deere as a whole and lately in Construction & Forestry, this obsession with working capital has caused some pretty extraordinary swings in production tonnage and operating leverage. And it's resulted in volatility of operating earnings, with EPS down 40% in '09 and then back up 42% in '10. So what I'm getting from investors is that they really view Deere as more of a short-term speculative vehicle and not so much a long-term investment. And the incentive system inside Deere is SVA-based, has a very sharp focus on capital employed. So we can expect these huge swings in production schedules on a regular basis going forward. So I guess my question is, do we have a situation here of misaligned interests? And would it be better to smooth earnings a little bit over the cycles by ultimately over and underproducing over time, better than panicking, cutting production and quickly raising production when we find ourselves short competitively of inventory? Do you have any thoughts on that?"

And then my last question, just on your 2011 farm cash receipts forecast, again, another stellar year. It's probably the second best year in U.S. farmer history. Under what scenario would 2011 sales be down in the U.S., just based on your cash receipt forecast. Am I missing something why it's not going to be up, I guess?"

Earnings were the highest for any third quarter in the company's history and sales were the second-highest. The gain wa",3064,"Thank you, Marie. John Deere's strong performance continued in the third quarter of 2010. Income was up 47% on a sales increase of 18%. Earnings were the highest for any third quarter in the company's history and sales were the second-highest. The gain was led by Ag & Turf, which had another blockbuster quarter. 
Construction & Forestry had its highest profits in seven quarters and our Credit Operations had another solid performance. The company is being helped by somewhat improved business conditions, but tailwinds are only part of the story. After all, construction markets are still weak by historical standards and some Ag markets, such as Europe and the CIS, remain under pressure.
What our results clearly show is the disciplined execution of our business plan and our focus on serving customers with advanced products and services. This has allowed us to fully capitalize on the current market conditions. 
Now let's look at the quarter in more detail, starting with Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 16% to $6.8 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Co. was $617 million, and as just, mentioned up 47% compared with the third quarter last year and our highest-ever income for the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 4. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 18% to $6.2 billion. Currency translation on net sales was flat versus our May forecast for currency to be up about two points in the third quarter.  Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points.
On Slide 5, worldwide production tonnage was up 31% in the quarter. This slide illustrates that, with one exception, tonnage in each SBU and region was up in line with the forecast provided a quarter ago. The exception was outside the U.S. and Canada, where tonnage came in lower than anticipated due to continued weakness in Western Europe. For the full year, worldwide production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 14%.  
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 6. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 32% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Currency translation on net sales is expected to be negative by about one point. Net income attributable to Deere & Co. is forecast to be approximately $375 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up about 12% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about two points of positive currency translation and approximately two points of positive price realization.
Turning to review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 7. Production tonnage was up 24% in the quarter on a 12% increase in sales. Operating profit, however, jumped by nearly $345 million or 72% to $824 million. The increase was primarily due to higher shipment and production volume and improved price realization, partially offset by higher post-retirement benefit cost. As you can see, margins were impressive. The division had an operating margin of approximately 16% in the quarter and an incremental margin of about 61%. 
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business, starting on Slide 8. On the heels of the recent commodity price increases, the outlook for most crop prices is up considerably for the 2010/'11 crop year. Corn prices are being helped by increasing global demand and have moved in sympathy with the poor-trading crops in many areas of the world. We project that 2009/2010 stock in the U.S. and Canada will end 250 million bushels below a year ago and fall another 150 million bushels in the coming year.
Soybean exports have remained strong. Growing level consumption is expected to keep soybean prices at extremely favorable levels for the '10/'11 crop. Global wheat stocks have tightened with lower winter wheat planting as well as yield losses in Western Europe, and to an even greater extent, in the CIS.
2010/'11 cotton prices remain well above the '08/'09 level, driven by the recovery in global demand and a reduction in the global cotton supply.
Turning to Slide 9. 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 6% from 2009 to about $317 billion. That's about $4 billion higher than our last forecast, and is driven by increased crop receipts. 2011 farm cash receipts are forecast to be slightly above the 2010 level.
Deere's outlook for the EU-27 is shown on Slide 10. The recent upward movement in grain prices might seem at odds with our rather subdued 2010 industry sales outlook for Western Europe. No doubt, some customers are locking in crop sales at attractive prices, which should provide support for 2011. That said, industry sales of new goods have been weak this year, particularly in combines. While European farmer sentiment is slowly improving, the dairy and livestock sector is still reeling from losses of prior years. Throughout, has hurt yields or customers in many areas and used equipment inventories remain at high levels.
Slide 11 illustrates the extreme heat and drought conditions in Russia and Eastern Europe. These conditions have sparked wildfires, and the picture on the right depicts some of the smoke from those fires visible from our Domodedovo facility outside Moscow. 
Last week, the USDA estimated the 2010/'11 FSU-12 wheat production would be down about 23%. Some industry observers believe the losses could go even higher. Although Russia is reporting success controlling the fires, the consequence of a severe drought and its impact on global grain markets won't be fully known for some time.
Farm net income in Brazil and Argentina is on Slide 12. We continue to see good farm income from soybeans and sugarcane, the two crops that drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil.
Other positive factors include strong global demand for Brazilian commodities, a 5% to 10% decrease in input cost and strong government-sponsored low-rate finance programs that run through at least the end of calendar year 2010. These all contribute to positive-producer attitude, which translate into higher spending on farm equipment.
We have increased our forecast for 2010 farm net income in Argentina. With milk and beef prices high, we continue to see increased demand for tractors, combines, sprayers and forage equipment. Although too early to predict, we are closely monitoring the development of a La Niña weather pattern that could result in lower production and yields in 2011.
Slide 13 highlights the latest additions to our tractor lineup in India. In June, we introduced the 5036C and 5041B (sic) [5041C] tractor models. These tractors were designed and developed in India, with features tailored to the India market.
These 35- and 41-horsepower tractors joined the recently introduced 5038 D, expanding our presence in the targeted 31- to 40-horsepower market. This Horsepower segment makes up almost 50% of the tractor industry in India.
Our 2010 industry outlooks are on Slide 14. Sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be at 5% to 10%. We continue to see strength in our order books and have Early Order Programs in place for our seasonal equipment. Although very early, the combine Early Order Program is progressing well and as planned. In absolute numbers, orders are well ahead of last year. 
In the Sprayer, Planter and Tillage Equipment programs, we are seeing strong results very similar to last year. Demand for large tractors has been strong as well. The 8R series tractor introduced last year has been very well-received and we've continued to add schedules throughout the year. 
We are just now introducing the Interim Tier 4 compliance 8R to our dealers and are encouraged by the initial orders of over 1,000 units, well over half of retail sold, with customer names on the order. Effective availability for 8R series tractors is February 2011. Effective availability for our 4WD tractors is November 2010.
Earlier, we touched on the conditions in Western Europe. While fundamentals are promising as we enter 2011, current market conditions are weak, and we are therefore, lowering our industry forecast. We now expect Ag sales to be down 15% to 20% in the year. Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to remain under pressure. And based on the factors we covered earlier, we are increasing our industry forecast for South America to up 25% to 30%.
Turning to another product category. We expect retail sales of Turf and Utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up 10% of 15% in 2010 from the very low levels of a year ago. We have seen an uptick in the commercial milling, riding lawn equipment and golf markets. However, with general economic conditions still uncertain, our optimism for this segment remains tempered with caution.
Putting these all together on Slide 15, Deere sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are now projected to be up 8% in the year. Currency translation on net sales is projected to be positive, about two points. For the year, the A&T division's operating margin is forecast to be around 13%.
The division continued to benefit from strong sales of large Ag equipment in the United States and Canada, with relatively weak sales in the Turf and Utility segment. In May's call, we said favorable mix added one point of margin to Ag & Turf's second quarter results. Now with our new forecast, for the full year, this favorable mix is expected to add about two points to the division's margin in relation to its typical year.
Let's focus now on construction and forestry on Slide 16. Deere's net sales were up 59% in the quarter, while production tonnage nearly doubled, being up 96%. The division reported operating profit of $66 million.
On Slide 17, although we are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be down about 2% for the full year, we believe the market has reached its bottom. The business is experiencing a slow improvement. We are encouraged by the activity we have seen with independent rental companies and in the Highway Construction segment. Also encouraging, Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment turns. Still, we remain cautious. 
Uncertainty over the economic recovery persists, and we have lowered our outlook for 2011 housing starts. Meanwhile, global forestry markets are up significantly from the very low levels of last year, and our factories have responded quickly to the increased demand. We are now forecasting Construction Forestry sales to dealers to be up about 35% in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009. The division's full year operating margin is forecast to be in the low single digits.
Let's move now to our Credit Operations. Slide 18 shows the worldwide Credit Operations provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average owned portfolio. Year-to-date, on an annualized basis, the provision is 49 basis points. Write-offs in the Construction and Forestry portfolios continue to improve. Recovery rates are improving steadily. We are seeing fewer repossessions and increased pricing from the repossessions that are occurring, about 9% to 10% since last fall.
The full year provision for John Deere Credit is forecast to runaround 55 basis points, an improvement over our prior forecast of about 71 basis points.
On Slide 19, past dues for the worldwide Credit Operations are lower than last year, with Construction & Forestry being the main driver of improvement. Annualized write-offs reflect a significant improvement in C&S losses.
Moving to Slide 20. Worldwide Credit Operations' net income attributable to Deere & Co. was $95 million in the quarter versus $99 million last year. The biggest factors were an improvement in financing strength and a lower provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower tax credits related to wind energy projects. Looking ahead, we are now projecting worldwide Credit Operations net income attributable to Deere & Co. of about $325 million in 2010.
Now let's turn our focus back to the Equipment Operations and take a look at receivables and inventories on Slide 21.  For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were up roughly $450 million in the third quarter versus third quarter 2009.
Keep in mind, we ended fiscal 2009 with receivables and inventories at rock-bottom levels. In fact, they were $1.3 billion lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. For fiscal year 2010, we are now forecasting receivables and inventories to be up about $950 million. This reflects higher production volumes in the fourth quarter versus the very low volumes in the fourth quarter last year.
These higher production volumes are intended in part to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4. They also reflect higher demand in the Construction & Forestry division and some Ag & Turf markets.
Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 22 presents the product category detail in the U.S. and Canada for the month of July expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were up 3%. Deere sales were up several digits. Row-crop industry tractor sales were down 10%. Deere was down in line with the industry. 4WD industry sales were down 2%. Deere was down double digits. Combine industry sales were down 7% and Deere was down slightly less than the industry.
Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart. For row-crop tractors, Deere ended July, with inventories at 18% of trailing 12 months sales. Combine inventories were at 19% of sales.
Turning to Slide 23. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were up double digits and combines were down double digits in July. Deere's retail sales of selected Turf & Utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up a single digit in the month. Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada on both a First-in-the-Dirt and Settlement basis were up double digits for the month.
Slide 24 shows raw material and logistics cost up about $10 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $150 million for the year. By division, the Ag & Turf savings are forecast at about $175 million. For Construction & Forestry, we continue to forecast a material cost increase of about $25 million. This is due to the currency impact on partner products and higher steel prices.
While this forecast is an improvement over last quarter, remember that prices for many commodities have been moving up recently and our cost increases, typically lag the commodity market by three to six months.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 25, R&D was up about 5% in the third quarter with currency translation accounting for negative approximately two points. Year-to-date, R&D expense is up about 6%. For the full year, R&D expense is expected to be up about 10%. We expect R&D spending to increase in the fourth quarter as we approach significant product launches with Interim Tier 4 engines and remain at high levels over the next three years as we approach the Final Tier 4 admission standards.
Moving now to Slide 26. Pension and OPEB expense in the third quarter was up about $100 million. The 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $350 million in pension and OPEB expense, unchanged from our previous forecast. We have had a slight change in the split between cost of sales and SA&G. Of the $350 million, about $275 million will hit cost of sales with about $75 million now in SA&G. Approximately $275 million of the additional expenses is attributable to the Ag & Turf division, while the increase in C&F is about $75 million.
On Slide 27, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 17% in the quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about eight points, and currency translation added about three points. For fiscal 2010, we project SA&G to be up about nine points, unchanged from our previous forecast. 
Variable incentive compensation is expected to account for about five points of the change as the company's performance has contributed -- improved. Pension and OPEB accounts were about two points and currency translation, about one point.
Moving to the income tax rate on Slide 28. The third quarter effective tax rate for the equipment operations was about 34%. The full year 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be about 40%. That includes the tax expense of about $130 million related to U.S. healthcare legislation recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the charge, the forecast of effective tax rate for 2010 would be about 34%.
Before touching on cash flow, the combined effect of translation and transaction, or trade flows, increased operating profit by about $60 million in the third quarter, primarily in Ag & Turf.
On Slide 29, you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations even in years of tough market conditions, like last year. This reflects, in large part, our success managing assets and controlling working capital levels. We anticipate cash flow from equipment operations of about $2.4 billion for the year, a $1 billion increase over 2009. Such strong cash flow is further testament to our successful execution of the SDA model.
As you can see on Slide 30, in accordance with our stated use of cash priority, we resume share repurchase in the quarter, buying back some 1.7 million shares. As we generate good cash flow, share repurchases will continue to be an avenue we consider when accessing our use of cash.
Turning to Slide 31. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $850 million for the year, primarily driven by the Interim Tier 4 emissions rule. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $550 million. Our forecast currently includes about $700 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year.
In closing, John Deere enters the last quarter of 2010 on a strong pace. Our performance reflects somewhat more positive economic conditions and strong demand for large farm machinery, particularly in the United States. At the same time, John Deere remains focused on serving a growing global customer base, steadily increasing capacity, adding productive new models of equipment and successfully extending our competitive position throughout the world. As a result, we believe the company is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from a growing economy and to help meet the world's increasing need for food, feed, fuel, shelter and infrastructure well into the future.

In fact, instead of just addressing Ag & Turf, let me look at it for the full company in relation to our full guidance, and just give you some of the numbers that are in implicit in our guidance. With the increased profitability for the company, incentive compensation is rising, and in the fourth quarter over last year, it would be about a $90 million expense. Again, very low levels of activity in the fourth quarter last year. Material, which has been either a neutral or a tailwind for us in the first three quarters of this year will be an expense in our projection, it's $75 million. R&D, we have a pretty significant jump. That's why Susan called out the fact that, year-to-date, we're up 6%. For the forecast, we're up 10%. That's about $55 million in the fourth quarter. That is a lot of money and that is very much impacted by IT4 as we're getting ready to enter into this very significant launch phase. And remember, we've got Final Tier 4 following on the heels in just, like, three years. Another factor is overhead absorption, and we estimate that at about $50 million. I shouldn't say overhead absorption, it's overhead expense. We have a very significant spend in R&D. Likewise, we have a very significant spend in capital expenditures ahead of us in the fourth quarter. And that is disruptive to the factory efficiency as you bring new machine tooling in, as you train operators. And so, we've provisioned for that in our outlook.

It is not as likely, therefore, you will have much crop, much herd expansion globally in the face of these rising feed cost. But overall, for the farm sector, it would appear to be very positive as you look into 2011. Some of the other factors though, Ann, that we're considering as we ourselves look into the future. Obviously, with the events of the last couple of weeks regarding the global economy, which seems to vary day by day. People are perhaps a little less certain than they were and that does raise a note of caution, especially a lot of talk about the U.S. economy, which would affect certainly our Construction Equipment business and our Turf & Utility. And frankly, even the small Ag sector because a lot of that is economically sensitive because it goes into homeowners and large property owners, et cetera. The other thing that you would want to think about is rising commodity costs affecting our materials as we go into 2011. I mentioned in the first question that I was answering of yours, that we have had a tailwind or neutral in the first three quarters of the year. That's worth about $250 million. If raw material costs just stay where they are today, obviously, that's something that would not be repeated. And the other thing I would just note is that we are and are going to be in the midst of this iT4 transition, we are very encouraged by the early results on it. We've got some good orders as Susan mentioned on the 8000 but it's very early. So you're really looking at a very small base. And so we'll see how that plays out as we look ahead. Jim, do you want to add anything?"

Susan's comments about the two points overall for the year, really, relates to a typical year. So we're not looking at something that -- because remember, we have a very good mix of large Ag in 2009 as well. So wouldn't really be a year-over-year factor. If you look at the third quarter and said just generally, how does that compare to a typical year? Then, yes, it would be about two points. If you look at absorption, last year in the third quarter, we dropped receivables inventory. I think it's like $1.7 billion. And this year, it was, I don't know, $300 million or $400 million or so. There is a favorable absorption impact in our third quarter results. And that is for the Ag & Turf division, it's about $90 million in their operating margin."

John Deere’s strong performance continued in the third quarter of 2010. Income was up 47%, on a sales increase of 18%. Earnings were the highest for any third quarter in the company’s history, and sales were the second highest.The g",3087,"Thank you Marie. John Deere’s strong performance continued in the third quarter of 2010. Income was up 47%, on a sales increase of 18%. Earnings were the highest for any third quarter in the company’s history, and sales were the second highest.
The gain was led by ag and turf, which had another blockbuster quarter. Construction and forestry had its highest profits in seven quarters, and our credit operations had another solid performance.
The company is being helped by somewhat improved business conditions, but tailwinds are only part of the story. After all, construction markets are still weak by historical standards, and some ag markets, such as Europe and the CIS, remain under pressure. 
What our results clearly show is the disciplined execution of our business plan, and our focus on serving customers with advanced products and services. This has allowed us to fully capitalize on the current market conditions.
Now let’s look at the quarter in more detail, starting with slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 16% to $6.8 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $617 million, and as just mentioned, up 47% compared with the third quarter last year, and our highest ever income for a third quarter.
Turning to slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 18% to $6.2 billion. Currency translation on net sales was flat versus our May forecast for currency to be up about 2 points in the third quarter. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. 
On slide 5, worldwide production tonnage was up 31% in the quarter. The slide illustrates that with one exception, tonnage in each SBU and region, was up in line with the forecast provided a quarter ago. The exception was outside the U.S. and Canada, where tonnage came in lower than anticipated due to continued weakness in Western Europe. For the full year, worldwide production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 14%. 
Let’s turn to the company outlook on slide 6. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 32% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Currency translation on net sales is expected to be negative by about 1 point. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be approximately $375 million in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up about 12% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about 2 points of positive currency translation and approximately 2 points of positive price realization. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let’s start with agriculture and turf on slide 7. Production tonnage was up 24% in the quarter, on a 12% increase in sales. Operating profits, however, jumped by nearly $345 million, or 72%, to $824 million. 
The increase was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by higher post-retirement benefit costs. As you can see, margins were impressive. The division had an operating margin of approximately 16% in the quarter, and an incremental margin of about 61%.
Before we review the sales outlook, let’s look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business, starting on slide 8. On the heels of the recent commodity price increases, the outlook for most crop prices is up considerably for the 2010-11 crop year. 
Corn prices are being helped by increasing global demand, and have moved in sympathy with the core grain crops in many areas of the world. We project that 2009-10 stock in the U.S. and Canada will end 250 million bushels below a year ago, and fall another 150 million bushels in the coming year.
Soybean exports have remained strong. Growing global consumption is expected to keep soybean prices at extremely favorable levels for the 10-11 crop. Global wheat stocks have tightened, with lower winter wheat planting as well as yield losses in Western Europe and to an even greater extent in the CIS. 2010-11 cotton prices remain well above the 08-09 levels, driven by the recovery in global demand and a reduction in the global cotton supply.
Turning to slide 9, 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 6% from 2009, to about $317 billion. That’s about $4 billion higher than our last forecast, and is driven by increased crop receipts. 2011 farm cash receipts are forecast to be slightly above the 2010 level.
Deere’s outlook for the EU27 is shown on slide 10. The recent upward movement in grain prices might seem at odds with our rather subdued 2010 industry sales outlook for Western Europe. No doubt, some customers are locking in crop sales at attractive prices, which should provide support for 2011. 
That said, industry sales of new goods have been weak this year, particularly in combines. While European farmer sentiment is slowly improving, the dairy and livestock sector is still reeling from the losses of prior years. Drought has hurt yields for customers in many areas, and used equipment inventories remain at high levels. 
Slide 11 illustrates the extreme heat and drought conditions in Russia and Eastern Europe. These conditions have sparked wildfires and the picture on the right depicts some of the smoke from those fires, visible from our Domodedovo facility outside Moscow. 
Last week, the USDA estimated that 2010-11 FSU12 wheat production would be down about 23%. Some industry observers believe the losses could go even higher. Although Russia is reporting success controlling the fires, the consequence of the severe drought, and its impact on global grain markets, won’t be fully known for some time.
Farm net income in Brazil and Argentina is on slide 12. We continue to see good farm income from soybeans and sugarcane, the two crops that drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil. Other positive factors include strong global demand for Brazilian commodities, a 5% to 10% decrease in input costs, and strong government-sponsored low rate finance programs that run through at least the end of calendar year 2010. These all contribute to positive producer attitudes, which translate into higher spending on farm equipment. 
We have increased our forecast for 2010 farm net income in Argentina. With milk and beef prices high, we continue to see increased demand for tractors, combines, sprayers, and forage equipment. Although too early to predict, we are closely monitoring the development of a La Nina weather pattern that could result in lower production and yields in 2011.
Slide 13 highlights the latest additions to our tractor lineup in India. In June we introduced the 5036C and 5041C tractor models. These tractors were designed and developed in India with features tailored to the India market. These 25 and 41 horse power tractors join the recently introduced 5038D, expanding our presence in the targeted 31-40 horse power market. This horse power segment makes up almost 50% of the tractor industry in India.
Our 2010 industry outlooks are on slide 14. Sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be up 5% to 10%. We continue to see strength in our order books, and have early order programs in place for our seasonal equipment. Although very early, the combine early order program is progressing well, and as planned. 
In absolute numbers, orders are well ahead of last year. In the sprayer, planter, and tillage equipment programs we are seeing strong results, very similar to last year. Demand for large tractors has been strong as well. The 8R series tractor introduced last year has been very well received, and we have continued to [add schedules] throughout the year.
We are just now introducing the Interim Tier 4 compliant 8R to our dealers, and are encouraged by the initial orders of over 1,000 units. Well over half are retail sold, with customer names on the order. Effective availability for 8R series tractors is February 2011. Effective availability for our 4-wheel drive tractors is November 2010.
Earlier, we touched on the conditions in Western Europe. While fundamentals are promising as we enter 2011, current market conditions are weak, and we are therefore lowering our industry forecast. We now expect ag sales to be down 15% to 20% in the year. Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to remain under pressure, and based on the factors we covered earlier, we are increasing our industry forecast for South America to up 25% to 30%.
Turning to another product category, we expect retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up 10% to 15% in 2010 from the very low levels of a year ago. We have seen an uptick in the commercial mowing, riding lawn equipment, and golf markets. However, with general economic conditions still uncertain, our optimism for this segment remains tempered with caution. 
Putting this all together, on slide 15, Deere sales for worldwide ag and turf are now projected to be up about 8% in the year. Currency translation on net sales is projected to be positive, about 2 points. For the year, the A&T division’s operating margin is forecast to be around 13%. The division continues to benefit from strong sales of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada, with relatively weak sales in the turf and utility segment.
In May’s call, we said favorable mix added 1 point of margin to ag and turf second quarter results. Now, with our new forecast, for the full year this favorable mix is expected to add about 2 points to the division’s margin in relation to its typical year.
Let’s focus now on construction and forestry on slide 16. Deere’s net sales were up 59% in the quarter, while production tonnage nearly doubled, being up 96%. The division reported operating profit of $66 million. 
On slide 17, although we are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be down about 2% for the full year, we believe the market has reached its bottom. The business is experiencing a slow improvement. We are encouraged by the activity we have seen with independent rental companies and in the highway construction segment.
Also encouraging, Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment turns. Still, we remain cautious. Uncertainty over the economic recovery persists, and we have lowered our outlook for 2011 housing starts. 
Meanwhile, global forestry markets are up significantly from the very low levels of last year, and our factories have responded quickly to the increased demand. We are now forecasting construction forestry sales to dealers to be up about 35% in 2010, from the very levels of 2009. The division’s full year operating margin is forecast to be in the low single digits. 
Let’s move now to our credit operations. Slide 18 shows the worldwide credit operations provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average owned portfolio. Year to date, on an annualized basis, the provision is 49 basis points. Write-offs in the construction and forestry portfolios continue to improve. Recovery rates are improving steadily. We are seeing fewer repossessions and increased pricing on the repossessions that are occurring, up 9% to 10% since last fall. The full year provision for John Deere credit is forecast to run around 55 basis points, an improvement over our prior forecast of about 71 basis points. 
On slide 19, past dues for the worldwide credit operations are lower than last year, with construction and forestry being the main driver of improvement. Annualized write-offs reflect a significant improvement in C&F losses.
Moving to slide 20, worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company was $95 million in the quarter, versus $99 million for last year. The biggest factors were an improvement in financing [spreads] and a lower provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower tax credits related to wind energy projects. Looking ahead, we are now projecting worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $325 million in 2010.
Now let’s turn our focus back to the equipment operations, and take a look at receivables and inventories on slide 21. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were up roughly $450 million in the third quarter versus third quarter 2009. Keep in mind we ended fiscal 2009 with receivables and inventories at rock bottom levels. In fact, they were $1.3 billion lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. 
For fiscal year 2010, we are now forecasting receivables and inventories to be up about $950 million. This reflects higher production volumes in the fourth quarter versus the very low volumes in the fourth quarter last year. These higher production volumes are intended in part to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4. It also reflects higher demand in our construction and forestry divisions and some ag and turf markets. 
Now let’s discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 22 presents the product category detail in the U.S. and Canada for the month of July, expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were up 3%. Deere sales were up double digits. Row crop industry tractor sales were down 10%. Deere was down in line with the industry. Four wheel drive industry sales were down 2%. Deere was down double digits. Combine industry sales were down 7%, and Deere was down slightly less than the industry. Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart, for row crop tractors Deere ended July with inventories at 18% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 19% of sales. 
Turning to slide 23, in Western Europe sales of John Deere tractors were up double digits, and combines were down double digits in July. Deere’s retail sales of selected turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up a single digit in the month. Construction and forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada, on both a [first in the dirt] and settlement basis were up double digits for the month. 
Slide 24 shows raw material and logistics costs up about $10 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $150 million for the year. By division, the ag and turf savings are forecast at about $175 million. For construction and forestry, we continue to forecast a material cost increase of about $25 million. This is due to the currency impact on partner products and higher steel prices. 
While this forecast is an improvement over last quarter, remember that prices for many commodities have been moving up recently, and our cost increases typically lag the commodity markets by three to six months.
Now let’s look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on slide 25, R&D was up about 5% in the third quarter, with currency translation accounting for negative approximately 2 points. Year to date, R&D expense is up about 6%. For the full year, R&D expense is expected to be up about 10%. We expect R&D spending to increase in the fourth quarter, as we approach significant product launches with Interim Tier 4 engines and remain at high levels over the next three years as we approach the final Tier 4 emissions standards.
Moving now to slide 26. Pension and OPEB expense in the third quarter was up about $100 million. The 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $350 million in pension and OPEB expense, unchanged from our previous forecast. 
We have had a slight change in the split between cost of sales and SA&G. Of the $350 million, about $275 million will hit cost of sales, with about $75 million now in SA&G. Approximately $275 million of the additional expense is attributable to the ag and turf division, while the increase for C&F is about $75 million. 
On slide 27, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 17% in the quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about 8 points, and currency translation added about 3 points. For fiscal 2010, we project SA&G to be up about 9 points, unchanged from our previous forecast. Variable incentive compensation is expected to account for about 5 points of the change, as the company’s performance has continued to improve. Pension and OPEB accounts for about 2 points, and currency translation about 1 point.
Moving to the income tax rate, on slide 28, the third quarter effective tax rate for the equipment operations was about 34%. The full year 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be about 40%. That includes the tax expense of about $130 million related to U.S. health care legislation recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the charge, the forecasted effective tax rate for 2010 would be about 34%.
Before touching on cash flow, the combined effect of translation and transaction, or [unintelligible], increased operating profit by about $60 million in the third quarter, primarily in ag and turf. On slide 29 you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations, even in years of tough market conditions like last year. This reflects in large part our success managing assets and controlling working capital levels. 
We anticipate cash flow from equipment operations of about $2.4 billion for the year, a $1 billion increase over 2009. Such strong cash flow is further testament to our successful execution of the [FCA] model. As you can see on slide 30, in accordance with our stated use of cash priorities, we resumed share repurchase in the quarter, buying back some 1.7 million shares. As we generate good cash flow, share repurchases will continue to be an avenue we consider when assessing our use of cash.
Turning to slide 31, capital expenditures are expected to be about $850 million for the year, primarily driven by the Interim Tier 4 emissions rules. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $550 million. Our forecast currently includes about $700 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year.
In closing, John Deere enters the last quarter of 2010 on a strong pace. Our performance reflects somewhat more positive economic conditions and strong demand for large farm machinery, particularly in the United States. At the same time, John Deere remains focused on serving a growing global customer base, steadily increasing capacity, adding productive new models of equipment, and successfully extending our competitive positions throughout the world. 
As a result, we believe the company is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from a growing economy and to help meet the world’s increasing need for food, feed, fuel, shelter, and infrastructure, well into the future.

In fact, instead of just addressing ag and turf, let me look at it for the full company, in relation to our full guidance, and just give you some of the numbers that are implicit in our guidance. 
With the increased profitability for the company, incentive compensation is rising, and in the fourth quarter, over last year, it will be about a $90 million expense. Again, very low levels of activity in the fourth quarter last year. 
Materials, which has been either a neutral or a tailwind for us in the first three quarters of this year, will be an expense and our projection is $75 million. R&D, we have a pretty significant jump. That’s why Susan called out the fact that year to date we’re up 6%. For the forecast we’re up 10%. That’s about $55 million in the fourth quarter. 
That is a lot of money and that is very much impacted by IT4 as we’re getting ready to enter into this very significant launch phase and remember, we’ve got final Tier 4 following on the heels in just, like, 3 years. 
Another factor is overhead absorption, and we estimate that at about $50 million. And I shouldn’t say overhead absorption, it’s overhead expense. We have a very significant spend in R&D. Likewise, we have a very significant spend in capital expenditures ahead of us in the fourth quarter, and that is disruptive to the factory efficiency as you bring new machine tooling in, as you train operators, and so we’ve provisioned for that in our outlook. 
And then the only other thing of note would be SA&G is a little higher as well.

You correctly note that the livestock sector is a little more concerned, obviously, with what’s happened, especially just having come out of two years of very very difficult financial situations. It is not as likely, therefore, you will have much crop - much herd expansion globally in the face of these rising feed costs. But overall, for the farm sector it would appear to be very positive as you look into 2011. Some of the other factors, though, that we are considering as we ourselves look into the future, obviously, with the events of the last couple of weeks regarding the global economy, which seems to vary day by day, people are perhaps a little less certain than they were. And that does raise a note of caution, especially a lot of talk about the U.S. economy which would effect, certainly, our construction equipment business and our turf and utility and frankly even the small ag sector, because a lot of that is economically sensitive, because it goes into homeowners and large property owners, etc. 
The other thing that you’d want to think about is rising commodity costs affecting our materials as we go into 2011. I mentioned in the first question that I was answering of yours that we had had a tailwind or neutral in the first three quarters of the year. That’s worth about $250 million. If raw material costs just stay where they are today, obviously that’s something that would not be repeated. 
And the other thing I would just note is that we are going to be in the midst of this IT4 transition. We are very encouraged by the early results on it. We’ve got some good orders, as Susan mentioned, on the 8000s, but it’s very early, so you’re really looking at a very small base. So we’ll see how that plays out as we look ahead.

The other factor is just as we’re getting closer to the first of January we’re starting to land on some of our plans, so we know a little bit more precisely how some of the transitions are going to occur. And also very candidly, demand is looking pretty good. It’s very early, you’re looking at small numbers, so I want to be very careful, put this in the appropriate context, but the demand for the product’s early order program seem to be going fairly well. Again, early. So that’s encouraged us. If you look at our tonnage increases for the full year, and the fact that our third quarter tonnage basically came in as projected, that tells you all of that increase is really happening in the fourth quarter, so it will take time for that production to actually translate into a retail sell, because you’ve got to work it through the factory and through the receivable. So we actually feel pretty good. Actually, Jim took a look at our receivables and inventories by historic standards and they look really quite good. Do you want to talk to that?

They put in - I don’t know if you’ll recall but it was about a 40% increase and they had about 25 points of the 40 in and I expect that the remaining 15 will be available, I don’t know if by the end of this year but sometime in the not too distant future. So that will provide some additional assistance. Harvester had a 30% capacity increase that was in place really by - really would have been fully available to us this year. And so that’s there and ready to be used as required. And then there have been capacity adds in other facilities as well.

In our planning we’re assuming that interest rates could rise from the current 5.5%, but that they would be unlikely to go all the way up to a market rate, which - the rate before these current low rate programs that come into play was 9.5%, and so perhaps you got closer to 9.5% but maybe not all the way there.

John Deere's strong performance continued in the third quarter of 2010. Income was up 47% on a sales increase of 18%. Earnings were the highest for any third quarter in the company's history and sales were the second-highest. The gain was led by Ag & Turf, which had another blockbuster quarter. 
Construction & Forestry had its highest profits in seven quarters and our Credit Operations had another solid performance. The company is being helped by somewhat improved business conditions, but tailwinds are only part of the story. After all, construction markets are still weak by historical standards and some Ag markets, such as Europe and the CIS, remain under pressure.
What our results clearly show is the disciplined execution of our business plan and our focus on serving customers with advanced products and services. This has allowed us to fully capitalize on the current market conditions. 
Now let's look at the quarter in more detail, starting with Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 16% to $6.8 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Co. was $617 million, and as just, mentioned up 47% compared with the third quarter last year and our highest-ever income for the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 4. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 18% to $6.2 billion. Currency translation on net sales was flat versus our May forecast for currency to be up about two points in the third quarter.  Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points.
On Slide 5, worldwide production tonnage was up 31% in the quarter. This slide illustrates that, with one exception, tonnage in each SBU and region was up in line with the forecast provided a quarter ago. The exception was outside the U.S. and Canada, where tonnage came in lower than anticipated due to continued weakness in Western Europe. For the full year, worldwide production tonnage is now forecast to be up about 14%.  
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 6. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 32% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Currency translation on net sales is expected to be negative by about one point. Net income attributable to Deere & Co. is forecast to be approximately $375 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up about 12% compared with fiscal year 2009. This includes about two points of positive currency translation and approximately two points of positive price realization.
Turning to review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 7. Production tonnage was up 24% in the quarter on a 12% increase in sales. Operating profit, however, jumped by nearly $345 million or 72% to $824 million. The increase was primarily due to higher shipment and production volume and improved price realization, partially offset by higher post-retirement benefit cost. As you can see, margins were impressive. The division had an operating margin of approximately 16% in the quarter and an incremental margin of about 61%. 
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business, starting on Slide 8. On the heels of the recent commodity price increases, the outlook for most crop prices is up considerably for the 2010/'11 crop year. Corn prices are being helped by increasing global demand and have moved in sympathy with the poor-trading crops in many areas of the world. We project that 2009/2010 stock in the U.S. and Canada will end 250 million bushels below a year ago and fall another 150 million bushels in the coming year.
Soybean exports have remained strong. Growing level consumption is expected to keep soybean prices at extremely favorable levels for the '10/'11 crop. Global wheat stocks have tightened with lower winter wheat planting as well as yield losses in Western Europe, and to an even greater extent, in the CIS.
2010/'11 cotton prices remain well above the '08/'09 level, driven by the recovery in global demand and a reduction in the global cotton supply.
Turning to Slide 9. 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 6% from 2009 to about $317 billion. That's about $4 billion higher than our last forecast, and is driven by increased crop receipts. 2011 farm cash receipts are forecast to be slightly above the 2010 level.
Deere's outlook for the EU-27 is shown on Slide 10. The recent upward movement in grain prices might seem at odds with our rather subdued 2010 industry sales outlook for Western Europe. No doubt, some customers are locking in crop sales at attractive prices, which should provide support for 2011. That said, industry sales of new goods have been weak this year, particularly in combines. While European farmer sentiment is slowly improving, the dairy and livestock sector is still reeling from losses of prior years. Throughout, has hurt yields or customers in many areas and used equipment inventories remain at high levels.
Slide 11 illustrates the extreme heat and drought conditions in Russia and Eastern Europe. These conditions have sparked wildfires, and the picture on the right depicts some of the smoke from those fires visible from our Domodedovo facility outside Moscow. 
Last week, the USDA estimated the 2010/'11 FSU-12 wheat production would be down about 23%. Some industry observers believe the losses could go even higher. Although Russia is reporting success controlling the fires, the consequence of a severe drought and its impact on global grain markets won't be fully known for some time.
Farm net income in Brazil and Argentina is on Slide 12. We continue to see good farm income from soybeans and sugarcane, the two crops that drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil.
Other positive factors include strong global demand for Brazilian commodities, a 5% to 10% decrease in input cost and strong government-sponsored low-rate finance programs that run through at least the end of calendar year 2010. These all contribute to positive-producer attitude, which translate into higher spending on farm equipment.
We have increased our forecast for 2010 farm net income in Argentina. With milk and beef prices high, we continue to see increased demand for tractors, combines, sprayers and forage equipment. Although too early to predict, we are closely monitoring the development of a La Niña weather pattern that could result in lower production and yields in 2011.
Slide 13 highlights the latest additions to our tractor lineup in India. In June, we introduced the 5036C and 5041B (sic) [5041C] tractor models. These tractors were designed and developed in India, with features tailored to the India market.
These 35- and 41-horsepower tractors joined the recently introduced 5038 D, expanding our presence in the targeted 31- to 40-horsepower market. This Horsepower segment makes up almost 50% of the tractor industry in India.
Our 2010 industry outlooks are on Slide 14. Sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be at 5% to 10%. We continue to see strength in our order books and have Early Order Programs in place for our seasonal equipment. Although very early, the combine Early Order Program is progressing well and as planned. In absolute numbers, orders are well ahead of last year. 
In the Sprayer, Planter and Tillage Equipment programs, we are seeing strong results, very similar to last year. Demand for large tractors has been strong as well. The 8R series tractor introduced last year has been very well received and we've continued to add schedules throughout the year. 
We are just now introducing the Interim Tier 4 compliance 8R to our dealers and are encouraged by the initial orders of over 1,000 units, well over half are retail sold, with customer names on the order. Effective availability for 8R series tractors is February 2011. Effective availability for our four-wheel drive tractors is November 2010.
Earlier, we touched on the conditions in Western Europe. While fundamentals are promising as we enter 2011, current market conditions are weak, and we are therefore lowering our industry forecast. We now expect Ag sales to be down 15% to 20% in the year. Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to remain under pressure. And based on the factors we covered earlier, we are increasing our industry forecast for South America to up 25% to 30%.
Turning to another product category. We expect retail sales of Turf and Utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up 10% of 15% in 2010 from the very low levels of a year ago. We have seen an uptick in the commercial mowing, riding lawn equipment and golf markets. However, with general economic conditions still uncertain, our optimism for this segment remains tempered with caution.
Putting these all together on Slide 15, Deere sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are now projected to be up 8% in the year. Currency translation on net sales is projected to be positive, about two points. For the year, the A&T division's operating margin is forecast to be around 13%.
The division continued to benefit from strong sales of large Ag equipment in the United States and Canada, with relatively weak sales in the Turf and Utility segment. In May's call, we said favorable mix added one point of margin to Ag & Turf's second quarter results. Now with our new forecast, for the full year, this favorable mix is expected to add about two points to the division's margin in relation to its typical year.
Let's focus now on construction and forestry on Slide 16. Deere's net sales were up 59% in the quarter, while production tonnage nearly doubled, being up 96%. The division reported operating profit of $66 million.
On Slide 17, although we are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be down about 2% for the full year, we believe the market has reached its bottom. The business is experiencing a slow improvement. We are encouraged by the activity we have seen with independent rental companies and in the highway construction segment. Also encouraging, Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment turns. Still, we remain cautious. 
Uncertainty over the economic recovery persists, and we have lowered our outlook for 2011 housing starts. Meanwhile, global forestry markets are up significantly from the very low levels of last year, and our factories have responded quickly to the increased demand. We are now forecasting Construction Forestry sales to dealers to be up about 35% in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009. The division's full year operating margin is forecast to be in the low single digits.
Let's move now to our Credit Operations. Slide 18 shows the worldwide Credit Operations provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average owned portfolio. Year-to-date, on an annualized basis, the provision is 49 basis points. Write-offs in the Construction and Forestry portfolios continue to improve. Recovery rates are improving steadily. We are seeing fewer repossessions and increased pricing on the repossessions that are occurring, about 9% to 10% since last fall.
The full year provision for John Deere Credit is forecast to runaround 55 basis points, an improvement over our prior forecast of about 71 basis points.
On Slide 19, past dues for the worldwide Credit Operations are lower than last year, with Construction & Forestry being the main driver of improvement. Annualized write-offs reflect a significant improvement in C&F losses.
Moving to Slide 20. Worldwide Credit Operations' net income attributable to Deere & Company was $95 million in the quarter versus $99 million last year. The biggest factors were an improvement in financing strength and a lower provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower tax credits related to wind energy projects. Looking ahead, we are now projecting worldwide Credit Operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $325 million in 2010.
Now let's turn our focus back to the Equipment Operations and take a look at receivables and inventories on Slide 21.  For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were up roughly $450 million in the third quarter versus third quarter 2009.
Keep in mind, we ended fiscal 2009 with receivables and inventories at rock-bottom levels. In fact, they were $1.3 billion lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. For fiscal year 2010, we are now forecasting receivables and inventories to be up about $950 million. This reflects higher production volumes in the fourth quarter versus the very low volumes in the fourth quarter last year.
These higher production volumes are intended in part to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4. They also reflect higher demand in the Construction & Forestry division and some Ag & Turf markets.
Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 22 presents the product category detail in the U.S. and Canada for the month of July expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were up 3%. Deere sales were up several digits. Row-crop industry tractor sales were down 10%. Deere was down in line with the industry. Four-wheel drive industry sales were down 2%. Deere was down double digits. Combine industry sales were down 7% and Deere was down slightly less than the industry.
Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart. For row-crop tractors, Deere ended July with inventories at 18% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 19% of sales.
Turning to Slide 23. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors were up double digits and combines were down double digits in July. Deere's retail sales of selected Turf & Utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up a single digit in the month. Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada on both a First-in-the-Dirt and Settlement basis were up double digits for the month.
Slide 24 shows raw material and logistics cost up about $10 million in the quarter. We now forecast material cost decreases of approximately $150 million for the year. By division, the Ag & Turf savings are forecast at about $175 million. For Construction & Forestry, we continue to forecast a material cost increase of about $25 million. This is due to the currency impact on partner products and higher steel prices.
While this forecast is an improvement over last quarter, remember that prices for many commodities have been moving up recently and our cost increases, typically lag the commodity market by three to six months.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 25, R&D was up about 5% in the third quarter with currency translation accounting for negative approximately two points. Year-to-date, R&D expense is up about 6%. For the full year, R&D expense is expected to be up about 10%. We expect R&D spending to increase in the fourth quarter as we approach significant product launches with Interim Tier 4 engines and remain at high levels over the next three years as we approach the Final Tier 4 admission standards.
Moving now to Slide 26. Pension and OPEB expense in the third quarter was up about $100 million. The 2010 forecast calls for an increase of about $350 million in pension and OPEB expense, unchanged from our previous forecast. We have had a slight change in the split between cost of sales and SA&G. Of the $350 million, about $275 million will hit cost of sales with about $75 million now in SA&G. Approximately $275 million of the additional expenses is attributable to the Ag & Turf division, while the increase in C&F is about $75 million.
On Slide 27, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 17% in the quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about eight points, and currency translation added about three points. For fiscal 2010, we project SA&G to be up about nine points, unchanged from our previous forecast. 
Variable incentive compensation is expected to account for about five points of the change as the company's performance has contributed -- improved. Pension and OPEB accounts were about two points and currency translation, about one point.
Moving to the income tax rate on Slide 28. The third quarter effective tax rate for the equipment operations was about 34%. The full year 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be about 40%. That includes the tax expense of about $130 million related to U.S. healthcare legislation recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the charge, the forecast of effective tax rate for 2010 would be about 34%.
Before touching on cash flow, the combined effect of translation and transaction, or trade flows, increased operating profit by about $60 million in the third quarter, primarily in Ag & Turf.
On Slide 29, you see the strong cash flow from our equipment operations even in years of tough market conditions, like last year. This reflects, in large part, our success managing assets and controlling working capital levels. We anticipate cash flow from equipment operations of about $2.4 billion for the year, a $1 billion increase over 2009. Such strong cash flow is further testament to our successful execution of the SDA model.
As you can see on Slide 30, in accordance with our stated use of cash priority, we resume share repurchase in the quarter, buying back some 1.7 million shares. As we generate good cash flow, share repurchases will continue to be an avenue we consider when accessing our use of cash.
Turning to Slide 31. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $850 million for the year, primarily driven by the Interim Tier 4 emissions rule. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $550 million. Our forecast currently includes about $700 million of pension and OPEB contributions in the year.
In closing, John Deere enters the last quarter of 2010 on a strong pace. Our performance reflects somewhat more positive economic conditions and strong demand for large farm machinery, particularly in the United States. At the same time, John Deere remains focused on serving a growing global customer base, steadily increasing capacity, adding productive new models of equipment and successfully extending our competitive position throughout the world. As a result, we believe the company is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from a growing economy and to help meet the world's increasing need for food, feed, fuel, shelter and infrastructure well into the future.

In fact, instead of just addressing Ag & Turf, let me look at it for the full company in relation to our full guidance, and just give you some of the numbers that are in implicit in our guidance. With the increased profitability for the company, incentive compensation is rising, and in the fourth quarter over last year, it would be about a $90 million expense. Again, very low levels of activity in the fourth quarter last year. Material, which has been either a neutral or a tailwind for us in the first three quarters of this year will be an expense in our projection, it's $75 million. R&D, we have a pretty significant jump. That's why Susan called out the fact that, year-to-date, we're up 6%. For the forecast, we're up 10%. That's about $55 million in the fourth quarter. That is a lot of money and that is very much impacted by IT4 as we're getting ready to enter into this very significant launch phase. And remember, we've got Final Tier 4 following on the heels in just, like, three years. Another factor is overhead absorption, and we estimate that at about $50 million. I shouldn't say overhead absorption, it's overhead expense. We have a very significant spend in R&D. Likewise, we have a very significant spend in capital expenditures ahead of us in the fourth quarter. And that is disruptive to the factory efficiency as you bring new machine tooling in, as you train operators. And so, we've provisioned for that in our outlook. And then the only other thing of note would be SA&G is a little higher as well."

You correctly note that livestock sector is a little more concerned, obviously, with what's happened and especially just having come out of two years of very, very difficult financial situations. It is not as likely, therefore, you will have much crop, much herd expansion globally in the face of these rising feed cost. But overall, for the farm sector, it would appear to be very positive as you look into 2011. Some of the other factors though, Ann, that we're considering as we ourselves look into the future. Obviously, with the events of the last couple of weeks regarding the global economy, which seems to vary day by day. People are perhaps a little less certain than they were and that does raise a note of caution, especially a lot of talk about the U.S. economy, which would affect certainly our Construction Equipment business and our Turf & Utility. And frankly, even the small Ag sector because a lot of that is economically sensitive because it goes into homeowners and large property owners, et cetera. The other thing that you would want to think about is rising commodity costs affecting our materials as we go into 2011. I mentioned in the first question that I was answering of yours, that we have had a tailwind or neutral in the first three quarters of the year. That's worth about $250 million. If raw material costs just stay where they are today, obviously, that's something that would not be repeated. And the other thing I would just note is that we are and are going to be in the midst of this iT4 transition, we are very encouraged by the early results on it. We've got some good orders as Susan mentioned on the 8000 but it's very early. So you're really looking at a very small base. And so we'll see how that plays out as we look ahead.

Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of",3868,"Thanks, Tony. Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. 
Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of the year. Total revenues climbed 35%. The improvement was broad based but led by Ag & Turf, which had another strong quarter. Our other divisions, Construction & Forestry and Credit, reported dramatically higher profit as well.
Our performance for both the quarter and full year reflected a disciplined approach to executing the company's business plans and a sharper strategic focus. It also reflected positive conditions in the U.S. farm sector, which led to a highly favorable sales mix of larger equipment. Even so, these results were achieved in spite of weakness in key regions, such as Europe, and key businesses, such as construction equipment. 
For the year as a whole, John Deere registered its second highest ever level of sales, earnings and enterprise cash flow. All that said, the ultimate measure of how well we did in 2010 may be found in the generation of economic profit or what we call SVA, shareholder value added. For the last decade, it has been one of our primary metrics in managing the comedy.
SVA for the full year was $1.714 billion, the highest ever. That maybe the best of our success in delivering a high level of profit, while managing costs and assets. It was, in summary, a great quarter and a good year. And it puts the company and position for what we see as an even stronger performance in 2011.
Let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3. As this previewed, net sales and revenues were up 35% to $7.2 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $457 million, the highest ever income for our fourth quarter.
Slide 4 outlines the expenses incurred in fiscal 2009 for goodwill impairment related to the John Deere Landscapes reporting unit and voluntary employee separation associated with the formation of the Agriculture & Turf division. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was up more than threefold, excluding these two charges.
Turning to Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 39% to $6.6 billion, the second highest fourth quarter in net sales total ever. Currency translation on net sales was positive, adding one point, and price realization in the quarter was positive by three points.
On Slide 6, worldwide production tonnage was up 59% in the quarter and up 15% in the fiscal year. Both SBU are higher tonnage in the quarter as a result of continued strong demand for large ag equipment, strength in South America and construction and forestry markets rebounding from the very low levels of 2009. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, worldwide production tonnage is forecast to be up about 39% and for the full year, up approximately 8%.
Slide 7 illustrates the year-over-year change in tonnage by quarter. As you see, the year-over-year pace of change increased as we went through 2010. In contrast, 2011 will start strong then decelerate in the second half. Partly, this is because are up against some tough comparisons. But also, production will be strongest in the first half of the year to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4. 
In addition, 2011 will be a year of significant new model introductions due in large part to the engine conversion. Associated with this change, we will experience some production limits and transitional issues.
In addition, construction and forestry production level will be front-end loaded due to their implementation of SAP. Both the Davenport and the will be shut down for approximately two weeks in the year as they switch to the new system.
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 8. First quarter sale are expected to be up approximately 34% compared with the first quarter of 2010. Currency translation on net sales have a negative impact by about two points. For the full year, net equipment sales and forecast to be up 10% of 12% compared with fiscal year 2010. This includes about one point of negative currency translation and approximately two points of a price realization. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2011.
During the review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 9. Production tonnage was up 50% in the quarter, an easy comparison and strong retail demand. Sales increased 33%. Operating profit was $662 million. The profit improvement was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes and improved price realization, partially offset by higher incentive-compensation expenses and increased raw material costs. The division had an operating margin of about 12% in the quarter and an incremental margin of approximately 24% when you strip out the goodwill impairment and voluntary employee-separation expenses taken in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business starting on Slide 10. Extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world had led to lower yields and concerns over tight supplies. That has sent the outlook up considerably for crop prices in the 2010 and 2011 crop year. 
Our first look at the '11/'12 crop year has prices remaining at strong levels. Corn prices are being held by increased global demand. We project that 2010, 2011 corn stock in the U.S. and Canada will end below $1 billion bushels and not significantly increase in 2011, 2012. 
Growing global consumption for soybeans is expected to keep exports from the U.S. at strong levels helping to maintain soybean prices at favorable levels. 2010, 2011, global wheat stocks are projected to be down about 12% from the '09, '10 level keeping prices strong. 2010, 2011 pattern prices remained strong driven by the recovery in global demand.
Turning to Slide 11, 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 9% from 2009 from, rising to about $332 billion. Our forecast for 2011 has farm cash receipts increasing to nearly $347 billion. This would surpass the all-time high at $330.5 billion recorded in 2008 by almost 5%. Farm cash receipts for both the current and prior year are an important driver of Ag equipment sales.
Deere's outlook for the EU 27 as shown on Slide 12. First, grain prices are at very attractive levels, and milk and beef prices continue to rise. European farmer sentiment is improving, but some fundamentals are weighing on producers' mind and they're outlines on the slide. Bottom line, however, and for the first time in the last two years, we are starting to see a turnaround in demand for agricultural equipment in Europe.
Net farming income from Brazil and Argentina is on Slide 13. In Brazil, farm net income is expected to be up 180% from 2011 led by soybean increases in sugarcane and soy beans. These are the two crops that drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil. Contributing to strength in the region is strong global demand for Brazilian commodities, lower production costs and government-sponsored, low-rate finance programs like that has been extended through the end of March 2011. 
Although we highlighted our new or updated products in Brazil in the second quarter call, Slide 14 thus so again. These products were launched in May with full availability for fiscal 2011. And we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that October was Deere's biggest big month ever for tractor and combines sale in Brazil. Further, we added about 25 dealer locations in 2010, enhancing our ability to meet the product support and service needs of our growing customer base. We currently have approximately 200 dealer locations in Brazil.
Slide 15 highlights two exciting events of that took place in the quarter in India for the Ag & Turf and Construction & Forestry divisions. In late September, Ag & Turf had a groundbreaking ceremony, and in October, began construction of a combines sector factory in India. This marks John Deere's entry into the harvesting business.  Full production is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2012. 
You've heard us talk about our joint venture with Ashok Leyland for some time. The inauguration of the 200,000 square-foot facility took place on October 21. Hiring is underway, and production initially is expected to begin in the first half of 2011.
Our 2011 industry outlook are on Slide 16. Fundamentals in the U.S. and Canadian farm sectors remain robust but reflecting the transition to Interim Tier 4 in the three sales of agricultural equipment in the region are forecast to be about flat in 2011. With respect to tier, we continue to see strength in our order book. The combine early-order program is progressing well and as planned. In absolute numbers, orders are ahead of last year. 
In the sprayer, planter and tillage equipment program, we are seeing strong results even above last year. And demand for large tractors remains strong. The 8R series tractor with its Interim Tier 4 engine is being very well accepted. We have conducted aggressive training on the new 8R in the areas of technology, capability and support. 
Also, customers are excited about the performance of and the new telematics on the tractor. In fact, dealers report that some customers who estimated orders early to receive 8R tractors with Tier 3 engines have changed their order to later in the year to receive an Interim Tier 4-compliant machine. Also, some customers who bought a new 8R tractor in 2010 are already discussing trades for the 2011 machines. 
We are encouraged by the initial orders of more than 2 500 8R units, all, of which are retail sold. Effective availability for date our series tractors is May 2011.
Earlier, we touched on the conditions in Western Europe. As noted earlier, we are encouraged that demand is beginning to turn. In 2011, we expect Ag sales to be up 5% to 10% in Western Europe. 
Sales in Central Europe and the CASA are expected to see moderate gains from the depressed levels of 2010. Asia's sales are expected to increase moderately from the very strong levels of 2010. And industry sales in South America are expected to be flat in 2011 from the strong levels of 2010. Although the underlying economic fundamentals are positive, our industry retail forecast includes it's lower sales from Brazilian government programs that target small farmers and a return to higher interest rate if the PSI extension expires on March 31. In summary, with Deere's line up of new products, we are excited about our prospects in South America.
Turning to another product category. After rising almost 15% in 2010, we expect retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be about flat in 2011. We have seen an uptick in the Commercial Mowing segment, and our new utility vehicles have experienced an extremely successful launch. Putting this all together on Slide 17, Deere's sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are projected to be up 7% to 9% for 2011 with an operating margin around 13%.
In 2010, the Ag & Turf division's operating margin benefited by about two points due to the mix of large ag sales in comparison with a normal year. That effect is expected to moderate somewhat in 2011 as small ag equipment sales recover from their fairly low levels of the past two years. The mixed impact in 2011 will be about one point.
Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 18. Deere's net sales were up 75% in the quarter, while production tonnage was up 129%. The division's operating profit of $54 million was impacted by higher shipment and production volumes, incentive-compensation expenses, raw material costs and postretirement-benefit expenses.
On Slide 19, following a 41% increase in 2010, net sales in Construction & Forestry are forecast to be up 25% to 30% in fiscal 2011. To put these numbers in perspective and to truly appreciate the severity of the decline in C&F market, this year's increase will put the division sales at about what has historically been considered a trough level. 
We are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be up about that 5% for the full year. Growth is slower coming out of that this recession and others, but we are encouraged by the activity we have seen from the independent real companies and intergovernmental segment. Also encouraging Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment market.
Meanwhile, global forestry markets were up significantly in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009. And we expected to be up further in 2011. Globally, the industry was up about 50% in 2010, and our current forecast calls for further increase of 25% to 30% in 2011. The full year operating margins for Deere's C&F division is forecast to be in the mid-single-digit.
Let's move now to our Credit Operations. Slide 20 shows the worldwide Credit Operations for provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average-owned portfolio. For fiscal 2010, the provision was 48 basis points. Write-offs from the Construction & Forestry portfolios continue to improve. We are seeing fewer repossessions and increased pricing on the repossessions that are occurring as well as improving recovery rates. The 2011 full year provision for credit losses as a percent of the average-owned portfolio is forecast to run around 45 basis points.
On Slide 21, past dues for the worldwide Credit Operations were lower in 2009 overall. 
Moving to Slide 22, worldwide Credit Operations net income attributable to Deere & Company was $91 million in the quarter versus a net loss of $22 million last year. The biggest factors were the reversal and apparel of wind energy tax credits eligible for cash grants this year, a lower provision for credit losses, improved financing strength and growth in the portfolio.
Speaking of wind, as previously announced, we had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Wind Energy business. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in December, a charge of about $20 million after tax is included in the fourth quarter results. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide Credit Operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $360 million in 2011.
Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment ops and take a look at receivables and inventories on Slide 23. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were up roughly $1.5 billion in 2010 versus 2009. Keep in mind, we ended fiscal 2009 with receivables and inventories at extremely low levels. They were $1.3 billion lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. 
Also, 2010 year end inventories were higher due to strong end markets and the timing of Interim Tier 4 transition. At the end of fiscal 2011, receivables and inventories are expected to be down about $675 million.
now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 24 presents the product category detail in the U.S. and Canada for the month of October expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were up 11%, Deere was up more than the industry. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 40%, Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel drive industry sales were up 63%, Deere was up more. And the combine industry sales were up 18%. Again, Deere was up more than the industry.
Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart for row-crop tractors, Deere ended October with inventories at 16% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were up 2% of sales.
Turning to Slide 25. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors and combines were up double digits in October. Deere's retail sales of selected turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up double digits in the month. And Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada on both the first in the dirt and settlement basis were up double digits for the month.
Slide 26 shows raw material and logistics cost up about $80 million in the quarter and down about $135 million for fiscal 2010. Our fiscal 2011 calls for raw material and logistics cost to be up about $250 million compared with last year. By division, this includes about $175 million increase for Ag & Turf and about $75 million for Construction & Forestry. The significant material costs tailwind of about $230 million in the first half of 2010 is not forecast to be repeated in 2011.
Now look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at our R&D expense on Slide 27, R&D was up about 14% in the fourth quarter with currency translation being negative by about two points. For fiscal 2010, R&D expense was up about 8%. For fiscal 2011, R&D expense is expected to be up about 15%. 
As we stated last quarter, R&D spending is expected to remain at high levels as we approach significant product launches with Interim Tier 4 engines, and soon thereafter, we respond to Final Tier 4 emission standards. Also included in the increase is the ongoing new product development expense for our growing global customer base.
Moving now to Slide 28. Pension and OPEB expense in the fourth quarter was up about $70 million, bringing the full year increase to about $345 million. Pension and OPEB expense is expected to be about flat in fiscal 2011. 
On Slide 29, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 15% in the fourth quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for out about 11 points of the increase, while pension and OPEB expense added about two points. For fiscal 2010, SA&G was up about 10 points. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about six points of the change as the company performance continued to improve. One factor was record-setting SVA, reflecting our continued focus on execution and asset efficiency.
Pension and OPEB accounted for about two points of the SA&G increase and currency translation, about two points. SA&G is expected to be up about six points for fiscal 2011. In line with our growth objective, growth will account for about two points of the change with variable incentive-compensation accounted for about one point.
Moving to the tax rate on Slide 30. The fourth quarter effective tax rate for the equipment operations was about 42%. The full year 2010 effective tax rate was about 41%, including the tax expense of about $130 million related to U.S. healthcare legislation recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the charge, the effective tax rate for 2010 would have been about 36%. For 2011, our effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 35% to 37%.
On Slide 31, you see our record of strong cash flow from Deere's equipment operations. We anticipate cash flow from equipment ops of about $3 billion in fiscal 2011. Such strong cash generation speaks to successful execution of our SVA model, which emphasizes high returns from a lean slate of assets. In light of such strong cash flow, we thought it appropriate to review our use of cash priorities on Slide 32.
First is the importance of a single A rating. Deere's worldwide Credit Operations provide a strategic advantage in funding customer purchases. But this is true only so long as we can access the credit market on a cost-effective basis. One of the key elements to this end is maintaining a single A rating, which is our top priority. 
The rating agencies expect 12 months of debt maturities to be covered by cash and/or on cap's credit facility. This also applies appropriately funding our pension and OPEB benefits, which we have done proactively and prudently over the years. In fact, at the end of fiscal 2010, the accumulated benefit obligation for Deere's U.S. hourly and salaried plants was 102% funded, while the projected benefit obligations was up 98% funded.
Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations. Such as the two facilities in India that we just referenced, or the that was open earlier in the year. A third priority is for buy for the common stock dividend. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we're mindful of the mandated dividend and not growing at beyond a point that can be comfortably sustained our cash flow.
Share repurchase as our method of deploying axis cash was the previous requirements are met come and as long as the share repurchase is viewed as value enhancing.
Slide 33 addresses unsecured term debt maturities over the next two years, nearly $3 billion in 2011 and approximately $5 billion in 2012. The relatively high level and timing of maturities in 2012 will affect the amount of cash we are targeting for year end 2011. 
Slide 34 summarizes share repurchases by [indiscernible]. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for about $255 million, bringing total shares repurchased this year to over $5 million. Looking into 2011, given our projected cash flow and use of cash priorities, it is fair to say that our forecast contemplates additional share repurchases in the coming year.
Finally, Slide 35 summarizes sources and uses of cash since we restarted the share repurchase program back in 2004 and began a run of seven dividend increases. You'll note that we have returned over $7 billion of cash to shareholders over this time, representing about 55% of the cash generated by operation. This accomplishment demonstrates our focus on delivering value to investors.
Turning to Slide 36, capital expenditures were $735 million in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by the interim Tier 4 emission rules. Depreciation and amortization was about $550 million. Pension and OPEB contributions were about $840 million in the year. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2011, as Slide 37 illustrates, capital expenditures are expected to be about $1 billion in the year. The increase is due to new product development and new market, such as our entry into the Harvesting business in India, as mentioned earlier. Depreciation and amortization for 2011 is expected to be about $550 million, with pension and OPEB contributions of about $300 million.
In closing, John Deere enters 2011 on a strong pace. We are looking for further improvement in the year ahead as a result of some pickup in overall economic conditions, and the farm sectors that remain very sound in general and is gaining strength in some of our key markets. At the same time, the company is aiming to capitalize on this positive environment by pursuing new market, adding productive new models and equipment and expanding its competitive position throughout the world.
John Deere's plan for helping meet the world's growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure are well on track and moving ahead at an accelerated rate. That's one of the reasons we remain highly confident about the company's increasingly attractive future prospects and about our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future."

I mean, if we assume a $27.5 million sales increase, which is the midpoint of your guidance and you said mid-single-digit margins, I'm trying to figure out why margins would be that low? I mean that get you to $4.7 billion in sales, it's about $100 million lower than 2008. And at that point, you're almost 10% margin.

So even with at every significant increase, Jamie, that just puts us in the bottom of where would normally be operating. The other thing I would point out and this will certainly have an effect on the Ag & Turf division as well, is that although we have good volume increases, we talked about raw material costs, we talked about R&D and SA&G. We have some other expenses that I'm going to give the number for the company, because I don't have them split by division, but they are important for the Construction & Forestry division as well. And that would include IT4 product costs. We have raw material costs, that's inflation adjustments, if you will. But these you IT4-compliant machines cost more money, because there's more hardware on them. And the cost for the company is about $135 million we estimate for next year. And we actually do have a little bit of a split, we think it's $100 million for the Ag & Turf and about $35 million for the Construction & Forestry. We also have some higher overhead expenses due to just the fact that we will be in transition to the Construction & Forestry will have a two-week shutdown as they transition of SAP. We've got some additional human resources assigned to help facilitate that. And then in addition, this near transition to IT4, which causes some inefficiencies, if you will, in the factory. Then the third thing, that again affects the company, less so Construction but something to note is that, that absorption is about $100 million in 2011. So when you look at those factors, you can see why we have the kinds of margins that the do. We will continue to work to improve our margins. Obviously, you've heard us talk about our aspirations, which are a 12% operating margin on average over time and a peak margin of about 14.5%. And those are still very much in place. But in 2011"

In South America, again, the guidance specifically is looking at tractors and combines, which is certainly very important part of the market. And it does not include what's happening in sugarcane and cotton. The other thing I want to point out is in the tractor market is, as we look at it, we assume, because we don't know what will happen, that the very attractive 5.5% rates that the non-BSI offering will end and not be extended beyond the end of March. Because we simply don't know. And that's what's in our forecast. The other factors, there are two state government programs in Brazil that appear to be ending in December, and I repeat, those are targeted at small farms and small farms and lower horsepower equipment. So those two end. And we think there's been a very significant number of tractor sold under NDA, which is more food program federal program in Brazil. Sales in the last two years represented about 30% of the industry. And we think that based on the market dynamics, we think that we actually see that segment slowing down, maybe off as much as a third/3 next year. And so, that's what's incorporated in our industry guidance. Again, that's the industry. When you look at Deere, we have all these new products. we've got very exciting line up ahead, and we're very enthused about our prospects into 2011."

Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of",3870,"Thanks, Tony. Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. 
Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of the year. Total revenues climbed 35%. The improvement was broad-based, but led by Ag & Turf, which had another strong quarter. Our other divisions, Construction & Forestry and Credit, reported dramatically higher profit as well.
Our performance for both the quarter and full year reflected a disciplined approach to executing the company's business plans and a sharper strategic focus. It also reflected positive conditions in the U.S. farm sector, which led to a highly favorable sales mix of larger equipment. Even so, these results were achieved in spite of weakness in key regions, such as Europe, and key businesses, such as construction equipment. 
For the year as a whole, John Deere registered its second highest ever level of sales, earnings and enterprise cash flow. All that said, the ultimate measure of how well we did in 2010 may be found in the generation of economic profit, or what we call SVA, shareholder value added. For the last decade, it has been one of our primary metrics in managing the company.
SVA for the full year was $1.714 billion, the highest ever. That maybe the best yardstick of our success in delivering a high level of profit while managing costs and assets. It was, in summary, a great quarter and a good year, and it puts the company in position for what we see as an even stronger performance in 2011.
Let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3. As this previewed, net sales and revenues were up 35% to $7.2 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $457 million, the highest ever income for a fourth quarter.
Slide 4 outlines the expenses incurred in fiscal 2009 for goodwill impairment related to the John Deere Landscapes reporting unit and voluntary employee-separation associated with the formation of the Agriculture & Turf division. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was up more than threefold, excluding these two charges.
Turning to Slide 5. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 39% to $6.6 billion, the second highest fourth quarter net sales total ever. Currency translation on net sales was positive, adding one point, and price realization in the quarter was positive by three points.
On Slide 6. Worldwide production tonnage was up 59% in the quarter and up 15% in the fiscal year. Both SBU saw higher tonnage in the quarter as a result of continued strong demand for large ag equipment, strength in South America and Construction & Forestry markets rebounding from the very low levels of 2009. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, worldwide production tonnage is forecast to be up about 39%, and for the full year, up approximately 8%.
Slide 7 illustrates the year-over-year change in tonnage by quarter. As you see, the year-over-year pace of change increased as we went through 2010. In contrast, 2011 will start strong then decelerate in the second half. Partly, this is because we are up against some tough comparisons. But also, production will be strongest in the first half of the year to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4. In addition, 2011 will be a year of significant new model introductions due in large part to the engine conversion. Associated with this change, we will experience some production limits and transitional issues.
In addition, Construction & Forestry's production level will be front-end loaded due to their implementation of SAP. Both the Davenport and Dubuque Works will be shut down for approximately two weeks in the year as they switch to the new system.
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 8. First quarter sale are expected to be up approximately 34% compared with the first quarter of 2010. Currency translation on net sales have a negative impact by about two points. For the full year, net equipment sales is forecast to be up 10% to 12% compared with fiscal year 2010. This includes about one point of negative currency translation and approximately two points of positive price realizations. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2011.
During the review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 9. Production tonnage was up 50% in the quarter, an easy comparison and strong retail demand. Sales increased 33%. Operating profit was $662 million. The profit improvement was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes and improved price realizations, partially offset by higher incentive-compensation expenses and increased raw material costs. The division had an operating margin of about 12% in the quarter and an incremental margin of approximately 24% when you strip out the goodwill impairment and voluntary employee-separation expenses taken in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business, starting on Slide 10. Extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world had led to lower yields and concerns over tight supplies. That has sent the outlook up considerably for crop prices in the 2010 and 2011 crop year. 
Our first look at the '11/'12 crop year has prices remaining at strong levels. Corn prices are being held by increased global demand. We project that 2010, 2011 corn stock in the U.S. and Canada will end below 1 billion bushels and not significantly increase in 2011, 2012. 
Growing global consumption for soybeans is expected to keep exports from the U.S. at strong levels, helping to maintain soybean prices at favorable levels. 2010, 2011 global wheat stocks are projected to be down about 12% from the '09, '10 levels, keeping prices strong. 2010, 2011 cotton prices remained strong, driven by the recovery in global demand.
Turning to Slide 11. 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 9% from 2009, rising to about $322 billion. Our forecast for 2011 has farm cash receipts increasing to nearly $347 billion. This would surpass the all-time high at $330.5 billion recorded in 2008 by almost 5%. Farm cash receipts for both the current and prior year are an important driver of ag equipment sales.
Deere's outlook for the EU-27 is shown on Slide 12. First, grain prices are at very attractive levels. And milk and beef prices continue to rise. European farmer sentiment is improving, but some fundamentals are weighing on producers' minds and they're outlined on the slide. Bottom line, however, is for the first time in the last two years, we are starting to see a turnaround in demand for agricultural equipment in Europe.
Net farm income in Brazil and Argentina is on Slide 13. In Brazil, farm net income is expected to be up 180% from 2011, led by [ph] surge increases in sugarcane and soy beans. These are the two crops that drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil. Contributing to strength in the region is strong global demand for Brazilian commodities, lower production costs and government-sponsored low-rate finance programs like FINAME PSI, that has been extended through the end of March 2011. 
Although we highlighted our new or updated products in Brazil in the second quarter call, Slide 14 thus so again. These products were launched in May with full availability for fiscal 2011, and we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that October was Deere's biggest big month ever for tractor and combines sales in Brazil. Further, we added about 25 dealer locations in 2010, enhancing our ability to meet the product support and service needs of our growing customer base. We currently have approximately 200 dealer locations in Brazil.
Slide 15 highlights two exciting events that took place this quarter in India for the Ag & Turf and Construction & Forestry divisions. In late September, Ag & Turf had a groundbreaking ceremony. And in October, began construction of a combines sector in India. This marks John Deere's entry into the Harvesting business there. Full production is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2012. 
You've heard us talk about our joint venture with Ashok Leyland for some time. The inauguration of the 200,000 square foot facility took place on October 21. Hiring is underway, and production, initially of backhoes, is expected to begin in the first half of 2011.
Our 2011 industry outlooks are on Slide 16. Fundamentals in the U.S. and Canadian farm sectors remain robust but reflecting the transition to Interim Tier 4. Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the region are forecast to be about flat in 2011. With respect to Deere, we continue to see strength in our order books. The combine Early Order program is progressing well and as planned. In absolute numbers, orders are ahead of last year. 
In the sprayer, planter and tillage equipment programs, we are seeing strong results, even above last year, and demand for large tractors remains strong. The 8R Series tractor, with its Interim Tier 4 engine, is being very well accepted. We have conducted aggressive training on the new 8R in the areas of technology, capability and support. Also, customers are excited about the performance of and the new telematics on the tractor. In fact, dealers report that some customers, who estimated orders early to receive 8R tractors with Tier 3 engines, have changed their order to later in the year to receive an Interim Tier 4-compliant machine. Also, some customers who bought a new 8R tractor in 2010 are already discussing trades for the 2011 machine. We are encouraged by the initial orders of more than 2500 8R units, all of which are retail sold. Effective availability for the 8R Series tractors is May 2011.
Earlier, we touched on the conditions in Western Europe. As noted earlier, we are encouraged that demand is beginning to turn. In 2011, we expect Ag sales to be up 5% to 10% in Western Europe. 
Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to see moderate gains from the depressed levels of 2010. Asia's sales are expected to increase moderately from the very strong levels of 2010, and industry sales in South America are expected to be flat in 2011 from the strong levels of 2010. Although the underlying economic fundamentals are positive, our industry retail forecast includes lower sales from Brazilian government programs that target small farmers and a return to higher interest rate if the FINAME PSI extension expires on March 31. In summary, with Deere's line up of new products, we are excited about our prospects in South America.
Turning to another product category. After rising almost 15% in 2010, we expect retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be about flat in 2011. We have seen an uptick in the Commercial Mowing segment, and our new utility vehicles have experienced an extremely successful launch. Putting this all together on Slide 17, Deere's sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are projected to be up 7% to 9% for 2011, with an operating margin around 13%.
In 2010, the Ag & Turf division's operating margin benefited by about two points, due to the mix of large ag sales in comparison with a normal year. That effect is expected to moderate somewhat in 2011, as small ag equipment sales recover from their fairly low levels of the past few years. The mixed impact in 2011 will be about one point.
Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 18. Deere's net sales were up 75% in the quarter, while production tonnage was up 129%. The division's operating profit of $54 million was impacted by higher shipment and production volumes, incentive-compensation expenses, raw material costs and postretirement-benefit expenses.
On Slide 19, following a 41% increase in 2010, net sales in Construction & Forestry are forecast to be up 25% to 30% in fiscal 2011. To put these numbers in perspective, and to truly appreciate the severity of the decline in the C&F market, this year's increase will put the division sales at about what has historically been considered a trough level. 
We are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be up about 25% for the full year. Growth is slower coming out of this recession and others, but we are encouraged by the activity we have seen from the independent rental companies and intergovernmental segments. Also encouraging, Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment markets.
Meanwhile, global forestry markets were up significantly in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009 and are expected to be up further in 2011. Globally, the industry was up about 50% in 2010, and our current forecast calls for a further increase of 25% to 30% in 2011. The full year operating margins for Deere's C&F division is forecast to be in the mid-single digits.
Let's move now to our credit operations. Slide 20 shows the worldwide credit operations' provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average-owned portfolio. For fiscal 2010, the provision was 48 basis points. Write-offs from the Construction & Forestry portfolios continue to improve. We are seeing fewer repossessions and increased pricing on the repossessions that are occurring, as well as improving recovery rates. The 2011 full year provision for credit losses as a percent of the average-owned portfolio is forecast to run around 45 basis points.
On Slide 21, past-dues for the worldwide credit operations were lower than 2009 overall. 
Moving to Slide 22. Worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company was $91 million in the quarter versus a net loss of $22 million last year. The biggest factors were the reversal and deferral of wind energy tax credits eligible for cash grants this year, a lower provision for credit losses, improved financing spreads and growth in the portfolio.
Speaking of wind, as previously announced, we had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Wind Energy business. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in December. A charge of about $20 million after tax is included in the fourth quarter results. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $360 million in 2011.
Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment ops and take a look at receivables and inventories on Slide 23. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were up roughly $1.5 billion in 2010 versus 2009. Keep in mind, we ended fiscal 2009 with receivables and inventories at extremely low levels. They were $1.3 billion lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. 
Also, 2010 year-end inventories were higher due to strong end markets and the timing of Interim Tier 4 transitions. At the end of fiscal 2011, receivables and inventories are expected to be down about $675 million.
Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 24 presents the product category detail in the U.S. and Canada for the month of October, expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were up 11%, Deere was up more than the industry. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 40%, Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel drive industry sales were up 63%, Deere was up more. And the combine industry sales were up 18%, again, Deere was up more than the industry.
Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart for row-crop tractors, Deere ended October with inventories at 16% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 2% of sales.
Turning to Slide 25. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors and combines were up double digits in October. Deere's retail sales of selected turf & utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up double digits in the month. And Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada, on both the first-in-the-dirt and settlement basis, were up double digits for the month.
Slide 26 shows raw material and logistics costs up about $80 million in the quarter and down about $135 million for fiscal 2010. Our fiscal 2011 calls for raw material and logistics costs to be up about $250 million compared with last year. By division, this includes about $175 million increase for Ag & Turf and about $75 million for Construction & Forestry. The significant material cost tailwind of about $230 million in the first half of 2010 is not forecast to be repeated in 2011.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 27, R&D was up about 14% in the fourth quarter with currency translation being negative by about two points. For fiscal 2010, R&D expense was up about 8%. For fiscal 2011, R&D expense is expected to be up about 15%. 
As we stated last quarter, R&D spending is expected to remain at high levels as we approach significant product launches with Interim Tier 4 engines. And soon thereafter, we respond to Final Tier 4 emission standards. Also included in the increase is the ongoing new product development expense for our growing global customer base.
Moving now to Slide 28. Pension and OPEB expense in the fourth quarter was up about $70 million, bringing the full year increase to about $345 million. Pension and OPEB expense is expected to be about flat in fiscal 2011. 
On Slide 29, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 15% in the fourth quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about 11 points of the increase, while pension and OPEB expense added about two points. For fiscal 2010, SA&G was up about 10 points. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about six points of the change as the company's performance continued to improve. One factor was record-setting SVA, reflecting our continued focus on execution and asset efficiency.
Pension and OPEB accounted for about two points of the SA&G increase, and currency translation, about two points. SA&G is expected to be up about six points for fiscal 2011. In line with our growth objective, growth will account for about two points of the change with variable incentive-compensation accounting for about one point.
Moving to the tax rates on Slide 30. The fourth quarter effective tax rate for the equipment operations was about 42%. The full year 2010 effective tax rate was about 41%, including the tax expense of about $130 million related to U.S. healthcare legislation recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the charge, the effective tax rate for 2010 would have been about 36%. For 2011, our effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 35% to 37%.
On Slide 31, you see our record of strong cash flow from Deere's equipment operations. We anticipate cash flow from equipment ops of about $3 billion in fiscal 2011. Such strong cash generation speaks to successful execution of our SVA model, which emphasizes high returns from a lean slate of assets. In light of such strong cash flow, we thought it appropriate to review our use of cash priorities, as outlined on Slide 32.
First is the importance of a single A rating. Deere's worldwide credit operations provides a strategic advantage in funding customer purchases. But this is true only so long as we can access the credit markets on a cost-effective basis. One of the key elements to this end is maintaining a single A rating, which is our top priority. 
The rating agencies expect 12 months of debt maturities to be covered by cash and/or untapped credit facilities. This also implies appropriately funding our pension and OPEB benefits, which we have done proactively and prudently over the years. In fact, at the end of fiscal 2010, the accumulated benefit obligation for Deere's U.S. hourly and salary plans was 102% funded, while the projected benefit obligations was 98% funded.
Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations, such as the two facilities in India that we just referenced, or our factory in Domodedovo, Russia that was opened earlier in the year. A third priority is for buys in the common stock dividends. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and such not growing it beyond a point that can be comfortably sustained by our cash flow.
Share repurchase is our method of deploying excess cash once the previous requirements are met and as long as the share repurchase is viewed as value-enhancing.
Slide 33 addresses unsecured term debt maturities over the next two years, nearly $3 billion in 2011 and approximately $5 billion in 2012. The relatively high level and timing of maturities in 2012 will affect the amount of cash we are targeting for year-end 2011. 
Slide 34 summarizes share repurchases by fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for about $255 million, bringing total shares repurchased this year to over $5 million. Looking into 2011, given our projected cash flow and use of cash priorities, it is fair to say that our forecast contemplates additional share repurchases in the coming year.
Finally, Slide 35 summarizes sources and uses of cash since we restarted the share repurchase program back in 2004 and began a run of seven dividend increases. You'll note that we have returned over $7 billion of cash to shareholders over this time, representing about 55% of the cash generated by operations. This accomplishment demonstrates our focus on delivering value to investors.
Turning to Slide 36, capital expenditures were $735 million in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by the Interim Tier 4 emission rules. Depreciation and amortization was about $550 million. Pension and OPEB contributions were about $840 million in the year. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2011, as Slide 37 illustrates, capital expenditures are expected to be about $1 billion in the year. The increase is due to new product development in new markets, such as our entry into the Harvesting business in India, as mentioned earlier. Depreciation and amortization for 2011 is expected to be about $550 million, with pension and OPEB contributions of about $300 million.
In closing, John Deere enters 2011 on a strong pace. We are looking for further improvements in the year ahead as a result of some pickup in overall economic conditions and the farm sector that remained very sound in general and is gaining strength in some of our key markets. At the same time, the company is aiming to capitalize on this positive environment by pursuing new markets, adding productive new models of equipment and extending its competitive position throughout the world.
John Deere's plans for helping meet the world's growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure are well on track and moving ahead at an accelerated rate. That's one of the reasons we remain highly confident about the company's increasingly attractive future prospects and about our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future."

Because, I mean, that gets you to that $4.7 billion in sales. It's about $100 million lower than 2008. And at that point, you had almost a 10% margin. So I'm just trying to figure out how you think about that and whether you feel that's sort of acceptable internally, for your margins to be half of what they would on a similar sales level?"

First of all, as Susan pointed out, this is about 70% of our average or typical volume. So even with that very significant increase, Jamie, that just puts us at the bottom of where we would normally be operating. The other thing I would point out, and this will certainly have an impact on the Ag & Turf division as well, is that although we have good volume increases, we talked about raw material costs, we talked about R&D and SA&G, we have some other expenses that -- I'm going to give the number for the company, because I don't have them split by division, but they are important for the Construction & Forestry division as well. And that would include IT4 product costs. We have raw material costs, that's inflation adjustments, if you will, but these new IT4-compliant machines cost more money because there's more hardware on them. And the cost for the company is about $135 million, we estimate, for next year. And actually, do have a little bit of a split. We think it's about $100 million for the Ag & Turf and about $35 million for the Construction & Forestry. We also have some higher overhead expenses due to just the fact that we will be in transition. Susan mentioned that Construction & Forestry will have a two-week shutdown as they transition of SAP. We've got some additional human resources assigned to help facilitate that. And then additionally, just the near transition to IT4, which causes some inefficiencies, if you will, in the factory. Then the third thing that, again, affects the company less so, Construction, but nonetheless something to note, is that absorption is about $100 million test in 2011. So when you look at those factors, you can see why we have the kinds of margins that we do. We will continue to work to improve our margins. Obviously, you've heard us talk about our aspirations, which are a 12% operating margin on average over time and a peak margin of about 14.5%. And those are still very much in play in 2011. [ph] Yes, a unique circumstance."

But because of the need to manage emissions credits, and as we've talked a lot already about the transitions and the fact that you have some capacity that's taking out effectively because of those transitions, we think that the markets will be affected in 2011 by that. So that's, maybe, in North America. In South America, again, the guidance specifically is looking at tractors and combines, which is certainly a very important part of the market. And it does not include what's happening in sugarcane and cotton. The other thing I want to point out is in the tractor market, is as we look at it, we assume, because we don't know what will happen, that the very attractive 5.5% rate that the FINAME PSI has been offering will end and not be extended beyond the end of March because we simply don't know. And that's what's in our forecast. The other factors, there are two state government programs in Brazil that appear to be ending in December and not repeated. Those are targeted at small farms and lower horsepower equipment. So those two. And we think that there's been a very significant number of tractor sold under MDA, which is the Mais Alimentos, which is the More Food program. That's a the Federal program in Brazil. Sales in the last two years each has represented about 30% of the industry. And we think that, based on the market dynamics, we think that we actually may see that segment slowing down, maybe off as much as a third next year. And so that's what's incorporated in our industry guidance. Again, that's the industry. When you look at Deere, we have all these new products. We've got a very exciting line up ahead, and we're very enthused about our prospects into 2011."

266112,83440454,89283,"Deere & Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2010",2010-11-24,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of",3868,"Thanks, Tony. Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. 
Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of the year. Total revenues climbed 35%. The improvement was broad-based, but led by Ag & Turf, which had another strong quarter. Our other divisions, Construction & Forestry and Credit, reported dramatically higher profit as well.
Our performance for both the quarter and full year reflected a disciplined approach to executing the company's business plans and a sharper strategic focus. It also reflected positive conditions in the U.S. farm sector, which led to a highly favorable sales mix of larger equipment. Even so, these results were achieved in spite of weakness in key regions, such as Europe, and key businesses, such as construction equipment. 
For the year as a whole, John Deere registered its second highest ever level of sales, earnings and enterprise cash flow. All that said, the ultimate measure of how well we did in 2010 may be found in the generation of economic profit, or what we call SVA, shareholder value added. For the last decade, it has been one of our primary metrics in managing the company.
SVA for the full year was $1.714 billion, the highest ever. That maybe the best yardstick of our success in delivering a high level of profit while managing costs and assets. It was, in summary, a great quarter and a good year, and it puts the company in position for what we see as an even stronger performance in 2011.
Let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3. As this previewed, net sales and revenues were up 35% to $7.2 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $457 million, the highest ever income for a fourth quarter.
Slide 4 outlines the expenses incurred in fiscal 2009 for goodwill impairment related to the John Deere Landscapes reporting unit and voluntary employee-separation associated with the formation of the Agriculture & Turf division. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was up more than threefold, excluding these two charges.
Turning to Slide 5. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 39% to $6.6 billion, the second highest fourth quarter net sales total ever. Currency translation on net sales was positive, adding one point, and price realization in the quarter was positive by three points.
On Slide 6. Worldwide production tonnage was up 59% in the quarter and up 15% in the fiscal year. Both SBU saw higher tonnage in the quarter as a result of continued strong demand for large Ag equipment, strength in South America and Construction & Forestry markets rebounding from the very low levels of 2009. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, worldwide production tonnage is forecast to be up about 39%, and for the full year, up approximately 8%.
Slide 7 illustrates the year-over-year change in tonnage by quarter. As you see, the year-over-year pace of change increased as we went through 2010. In contrast, 2011 will start strong then decelerate in the second half. Partly, this is because we are up against some tough comparisons. But also, production will be strongest in the first half of the year to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4. In addition, 2011 will be a year of significant new model introductions due in large part to the engine conversion. Associated with this change, we will experience some production limits and transitional issues.
In addition, Construction & Forestry's production level will be front-end loaded due to their implementation of SAP. Both the Davenport and Dubuque Works will be shut down for approximately two weeks in the year as they switch to the new system.
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 8. First quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 34% compared with the first quarter of 2010. Currency translation on net sales have a negative impact by about two points. For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up 10% to 12% compared with fiscal year 2010. This includes about one point of negative currency translation and approximately two points of positive price realizations. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2011.
During the review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 9. Production tonnage was up 50% in the quarter, an easy comparison and strong retail demand. Sales increased 33%. Operating profit was $662 million. The profit improvement was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes and improved price realizations, partially offset by higher incentive-compensation expenses and increased raw material costs. The division had an operating margin of about 12% in the quarter and an incremental margin of approximately 24% when you strip out the goodwill impairment and voluntary employee-separation expenses taken in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business, starting on Slide 10. Extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world had led to lower yields and concerns over tight supplies. That has sent the outlook up considerably for crop prices in the 2010 and 2011 crop year. 
Our first look at the '11/'12 crop year has prices remaining at strong levels. Corn prices are being held by increased global demand. We project that 2010, 2011 corn stock in the U.S. and Canada will end below 1 billion bushels and not significantly increase in 2011, 2012. 
Growing global consumption for soybeans is expected to keep exports from the U.S. at strong levels, helping to maintain soybean prices at favorable levels. 2010, 2011 global wheat stocks are projected to be down about 12% from the '09, '10 levels, keeping prices strong. 2010, 2011 cotton prices remained strong, driven by the recovery in global demand.
Turning to Slide 11. 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 9% from 2009, rising to about $322 billion. Our forecast for 2011 has farm cash receipts increasing to nearly $347 billion. This would surpass the all-time high at $330.5 billion recorded in 2008 by almost 5%. Farm cash receipts for both the current and prior year are an important driver of Ag equipment sales.
Deere's outlook for the EU-27 is shown on Slide 12. First, grain prices are at very attractive levels. And milk and beef prices continue to rise. European farmer sentiment is improving, but some fundamentals are weighing on producers' minds and they're outlined on the slide. Bottom line, however, is for the first time in the last two years, we are starting to see a turnaround in demand for agricultural equipment in Europe.
Net farm income in Brazil and Argentina is on Slide 13. In Brazil, farm net income is expected to be up 180% from 2011, led by surge increases in sugarcane and soy beans. These are the two crops that drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil. Contributing to strength in the region is strong global demand for Brazilian commodities, lower production costs and government-sponsored low-rate finance programs like FINAME PSI, that has been extended through the end of March 2011. 
Although we highlighted our new or updated products in Brazil in the second quarter call, Slide 14 does so again. These products were launched in May with full availability for fiscal 2011, and we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that October was Deere's biggest month ever for tractor and combines sales in Brazil. Further, we added about 25 dealer locations in 2010, enhancing our ability to meet the product support and service needs of our growing customer base. We currently have approximately 200 dealer locations in Brazil.
Slide 15 highlights two exciting events that took place this quarter in India for the Ag & Turf and Construction & Forestry divisions. In late September, Ag & Turf had a groundbreaking ceremony. And in October, began construction of a combines factory in India. This marks John Deere's entry into the Harvesting business there. Full production is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2012. 
You've heard us talk about our joint venture with Ashok Leyland for some time. The inauguration of the 200,000 square foot facility took place on October 21. Hiring is underway, and production, initially of backhoes, is expected to begin in the first half of 2011.
Our 2011 industry outlooks are on Slide 16. Fundamentals in the U.S. and Canadian farm sectors remain robust but reflecting the transition to Interim Tier 4. Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the region are forecast to be about flat in 2011. With respect to Deere, we continue to see strength in our order books. The combine Early Order program is progressing well and as planned. In absolute numbers, orders are ahead of last year. 
In the sprayer, planter and tillage equipment programs, we are seeing strong results, even above last year, and demand for large tractors remains strong. The 8R Series tractor, with its Interim Tier 4 engine, is being very well accepted. We have conducted aggressive training on the new 8R in the areas of technology, capability and support. Also, customers are excited about the performance of and the new telematics on the tractor. In fact, dealers report that some customers, who submitted orders early to receive 8R tractors with Tier 3 engines, have changed their order to later in the year to receive an Interim Tier 4-compliant machine. Also, some customers who bought a new 8R tractor in 2010 are already discussing trades for the 2011 machine. We are encouraged by the initial orders of more than 2500 8R units, all of which are retail sold. Effective availability for the 8R Series tractors is May 2011.
Earlier, we touched on the conditions in Western Europe. As noted earlier, we are encouraged the demand is beginning to turn. In 2011, we expect Ag sales to be up 5% to 10% in Western Europe. 
Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to see moderate gains from the depressed levels of 2010. Asia's sales are expected to increase moderately from the very strong levels of 2010, and industry sales in South America are expected to be flat in 2011 from the strong levels of 2010. Although the underlying economic fundamentals are positive, our industry retail forecast includes lower sales from Brazilian government programs that target small farmers and a return to higher interest rate if the FINAME PSI extension expires on March 31. In summary, with Deere's line up of new products, we are excited about our prospects in South America.
Turning to another product category. After rising almost 15% in 2010, we expect retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be about flat in 2011. We have seen an uptick in the Commercial Mowing segment, and our new utility vehicles have experienced an extremely successful launch. Putting this all together on Slide 17, Deere's sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are projected to be up 7% to 9% for 2011, with an operating margin around 13%.
In 2010, the Ag & Turf division's operating margin benefited by about two points, due to the mix of large Ag sales in comparison with a normal year. That effect is expected to moderate somewhat in 2011, as small Ag equipment sales recover from their fairly low levels of the past few years. The mixed impact in 2011 will be about one point.
Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 18. Deere's net sales were up 75% in the quarter, while production tonnage was up 129%. The division's operating profit of $54 million was impacted by higher shipment and production volumes, incentive-compensation expenses, raw material costs and post-retirement-benefit expenses.
On Slide 19, following a 41% increase in 2010, net sales in Construction & Forestry are forecast to be up 25% to 30% in fiscal 2011. To put these numbers in perspective, and to truly appreciate the severity of the decline in the C&F market, this year's increase will put the division sales at about what has historically been considered a trough level. 
We are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be up about 25% for the full year. Growth is slower coming out of this recession and others, but we are encouraged by the activity we have seen from the independent rental companies and inter-governmental segments. Also encouraging, Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment markets.
Meanwhile, global forestry markets were up significantly in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009 and are expected to be up further in 2011. Globally, the industry was up about 50% in 2010, and our current forecast calls for a further increase of 25% to 30% in 2011. The full year operating margins for Deere's C&F division is forecast to be in the mid-single digits.
Let's move now to our credit operations. Slide 20 shows the world-wide credit operations' provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average-owned portfolio. For fiscal 2010, the provision was 48 basis points. Write-offs from the Construction & Forestry portfolios continue to improve. We are seeing fewer repossessions and increased pricing on the repossessions that are occurring, as well as improving recovery rates. The 2011 full year provision for credit losses as a percent of the average-owned portfolio is forecast to run around 45 basis points.
On Slide 21, past-dues for the worldwide credit operations were lower than 2009 overall. 
Moving to Slide 22. Worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company was $91 million in the quarter versus a net loss of $22 million last year. The biggest factors were the reversal and deferral of wind energy tax credits eligible for cash grants this year, a lower provision for credit losses, improved financing spreads and growth in the portfolio.
Speaking of wind, as previously announced, we had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Wind Energy business. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in December. A charge of about $20 million after tax is included in the fourth quarter results. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $360 million in 2011.
Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment ops and take a look at receivables and inventories on Slide 23. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were up roughly $1.5 billion in 2010 versus 2009. Keep in mind, we ended fiscal 2009 with receivables and inventories at extremely low levels. They were $1.3 billion lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. 
Also, 2010 year-end inventories were higher due to strong end markets and the timing of Interim Tier 4 transitions. At the end of fiscal 2011, receivables and inventories are expected to be down about $675 million.
Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 24 presents the product category detail in the U.S. and Canada for the month of October, expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were up 11%, Deere was up more than the industry. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 40%, Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel drive industry sales were up 63%, Deere was up more. And the combine industry sales were up 18%, again, Deere was up more than the industry.
Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart for row-crop tractors, Deere ended October with inventories at 16% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 2% of sales.
Turning to Slide 25. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors and combines were up double digits in October. Deere's retail sales of selected turf & utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up double digits in the month. And Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada, on both the first-in-the-dirt and settlement basis, were up double digits for the month.
Slide 26 shows raw material and logistics costs up about $80 million in the quarter and down about $135 million for fiscal 2010. Our fiscal 2011 calls for raw material and logistics costs to be up about $250 million compared with last year. By division, this includes about $175 million increase for Ag & Turf and about $75 million for Construction & Forestry. The significant material cost tailwind of about $230 million in the first half of 2010 is not forecast to be repeated in 2011.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 27, R&D was up about 14% in the fourth quarter with currency translation being negative by about two points. For fiscal 2010, R&D expense was up about 8%. For fiscal 2011, R&D expense is expected to be up about 15%. 
As we stated last quarter, R&D spending is expected to remain at high levels as we approach significant product launches with Interim Tier 4 engines. And soon thereafter, we respond to Final Tier 4 emission standards. Also included in the increase is the ongoing new product development expense for our growing global customer base.
Moving now to Slide 28. Pension and OPEB expense in the fourth quarter was up about $70 million, bringing the full year increase to about $345 million. Pension and OPEB expense is expected to be about flat in fiscal 2011. 
On Slide 29, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 15% in the fourth quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about 11 points of the increase, while pension and OPEB expense added about two points. For fiscal 2010, SA&G was up about 10 points. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about six points of the change as the company's performance continued to improve. One factor was record-setting SVA, reflecting our continued focus on execution and asset efficiency.
Pension and OPEB accounted for about two points of the SA&G increase, and currency translation, about two points. SA&G is expected to be up about six points for fiscal 2011. In line with our growth objective, growth will account for about two points of the change with variable incentive-compensation accounting for about one point.
Moving to the tax rates on Slide 30. The fourth quarter effective tax rate for the equipment operations was about 42%. The full year 2010 effective tax rate was about 41%, including the tax expense of about $130 million related to U.S. healthcare legislation recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the charge, the effective tax rate for 2010 would have been about 36%. For 2011, our effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 35% to 37%.
On Slide 31, you see our record of strong cash flow from Deere's equipment operations. We anticipate cash flow from equipment ops of about $3 billion in fiscal 2011. Such strong cash generation speaks to successful execution of our SVA model, which emphasizes high returns from a lean slate of assets. In light of such strong cash flow, we thought it appropriate to review our use of cash priorities, as outlined on Slide 32.
First is the importance of a single A rating. Deere's worldwide credit operations provides a strategic advantage in funding customer purchases. But this is true only so long as we can access the credit markets on a cost-effective basis. One of the key elements to this end is maintaining a single A rating, which is our top priority. 
The rating agencies expect 12 months of debt maturities to be covered by cash and/or untapped credit facilities. This also implies appropriately funding our pension and OPEB benefits, which we have done proactively and prudently over the years. In fact, at the end of fiscal 2010, the accumulated benefit obligation for Deere's U.S. hourly and salary plans was 102% funded, while the projected benefit obligations was 98% funded.
Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations, such as the two facilities in India that we just referenced, or our factory in Domodedovo, Russia that was opened earlier in the year. A third priority is for buys in the common stock dividends. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and such not growing it beyond a point that can be comfortably sustained by our cash flow.
Share repurchase is our method of deploying excess cash once the previous requirements are met and as long as the share repurchase is viewed as value-enhancing.
Slide 33 addresses unsecured term debt maturities over the next two years, nearly $3 billion in 2011 and approximately $5 billion in 2012. The relatively high level and timing of maturities in 2012 will affect the amount of cash we are targeting for year-end 2011. 
Slide 34 summarizes share repurchases by fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for about $255 million, bringing total shares repurchased this year to over $5 million. Looking into 2011, given our projected cash flow and use of cash priorities, it is fair to say that our forecast contemplates additional share repurchases in the coming year.
Finally, Slide 35 summarizes sources and uses of cash since we restarted the share repurchase program back in 2004 and began a run of seven dividend increases. You'll note that we have returned over $7 billion of cash to shareholders over this time, representing about 55% of the cash generated by operations. This accomplishment demonstrates our focus on delivering value to investors.
Turning to Slide 36, capital expenditures were $735 million in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by the Interim Tier 4 emission rules. Depreciation and amortization was about $550 million. Pension and OPEB contributions were about $840 million in the year. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2011, as Slide 37 illustrates, capital expenditures are expected to be about $1 billion in the year. The increase is due to new product development in new markets, such as our entry into the Harvesting business in India, as mentioned earlier. Depreciation and amortization for 2011 is expected to be about $550 million, with pension and OPEB contributions of about $300 million.
In closing, John Deere enters 2011 on a strong pace. We are looking for further improvements in the year ahead as a result of some pickup in overall economic conditions and the farm sector that remained very sound in general and is gaining strength in some of our key markets. At the same time, the company is aiming to capitalize on this positive environment by pursuing new markets, adding productive new models of equipment and extending its competitive position throughout the world.
John Deere's plans for helping meet the world's growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure are well on track and moving ahead at an accelerated rate. That's one of the reasons we remain highly confident about the company's increasingly attractive future prospects and about our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future."

First of all, as Susan pointed out, this is about 70% of our average or typical volume. So even with that very significant increase, Jamie, that just puts us at the bottom of where we would normally be operating. The other thing I would point out, and this will certainly have an impact on the Ag & Turf division as well, is that although we have good volume increases, we talked about raw material costs, we talked about R&D and SA&G, we have some other expenses that -- I'm going to give the number for the company, because I don't have them split by division, but they are important for the Construction & Forestry division as well. And that would include IT4 product costs. We have raw material costs, that's inflation adjustments, if you will, but these new IT4-compliant machines cost more money because there's more hardware on them. And the cost for the company is about $135 million, we estimate, for next year. And actually, we do have a little bit of a split. We think it's about $100 million for the Ag & Turf and about $35 million for the Construction & Forestry. We also have some higher overhead expenses due to just the fact that we will be in transition. Susan mentioned that Construction & Forestry will have a two-week shutdown as they transition of SAP. We've got some additional human resources assigned to help facilitate that. And then additionally, just the near transition to IT4, which causes some inefficiencies, if you will, in the factory. Then the third thing that, again, affects the company less so, Construction, but nonetheless something to note, is that absorption is about $100 million test in 2011. So when you look at those factors, you can see why we have the kinds of margins that we do. We will continue to work to improve our margins. Obviously, you've heard us talk about our aspirations, which are a 12% operating margin on average over time and a peak margin of about 14.5%. And those are still very much in play in 2011. We have unique circumstances."

That will have some impact on our ability to respond to customers' requirements. We will do our very best. But because of the need to manage emissions credits, and as we've talked a lot already about the transitions and the fact that you have some capacity that's taking out effectively because of those transitions, we think that the markets will be affected in 2011 by that. So that's, maybe, in North America. In South America, again, the guidance specifically is looking at tractors and combines, which is certainly a very important part of the market. And it does not include what's happening in sugarcane and cotton. The other thing I want to point out is in the tractor market, is as we look at it, we assume, because we don't know what will happen, that the very attractive 5.5% rate that the FINAME PSI has been offering will end and not be extended beyond the end of March because we simply don't know. And that's what's in our forecast. The other factors, there are two state government programs in Brazil that appear to be ending in December and not repeated. Those are targeted at small farms and lower horsepower equipment. So those two. And we think that there's been a very significant number of tractor sold under MDA, which is the Mais Alimentos, which is the More Food program. That's the Federal program in Brazil. Sales in the last two years each has represented about 30% of the industry. And we think that, based on the market dynamics, we think that we actually may see that segment slowing down, maybe off as much as a third next year. And so that's what's incorporated in our industry guidance. Again, that's the industry. When you look at Deere, we have all these new products. We've got a very exciting line up ahead, and we're very enthused about our prospects into 2011."

266112,83440454,96186,"Deere & Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2010",2010-11-24,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of",3866,"Thanks, Tony. Today, John Deere wrapped up 2010 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all, it was an excellent quarter and an extremely good year. 
Fourth quarter earnings were $457 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of the year. Total revenues climbed 35%. The improvement was broad-based, but led by Ag & Turf, which had another strong quarter. Our other divisions, Construction & Forestry and Credit, reported dramatically higher profit as well.
Our performance for both the quarter and full year reflected a disciplined approach to executing the company's business plans and a sharper strategic focus. It also reflected positive conditions in the U.S. farm sector, which led to a highly favorable sales mix of larger equipment. Even so, these results were achieved in spite of weakness in key regions, such as Europe, and key businesses, such as construction equipment. 
For the year as a whole, John Deere registered its second highest ever level of sales, earnings and enterprise cash flow. All that said, the ultimate measure of how well we did in 2010 may be found in the generation of economic profit, or what we call SVA, shareholder value added. For the last decade, it has been one of our primary metrics in managing the company.
SVA for the full year was $1.714 billion, the highest ever. That may be the best yardstick of our success in delivering a high level of profit while managing costs and assets. It was, in summary, a great quarter and a good year, and it puts the company in position for what we see as an even stronger performance in 2011.
Let's look at the quarter in more detail starting with Slide 3. As just previewed, net sales and revenues were up 35% to $7.2 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $457 million, the highest ever income for a fourth quarter.
Slide 4 outlines the expenses incurred in fiscal 2009 for goodwill impairment related to the John Deere Landscapes reporting unit and voluntary employee separation associated with the formation of the Agriculture & Turf division. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was up more than threefold, excluding these two charges.
Turning to Slide 5. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 39% to $6.6 billion, the second highest fourth quarter net sales total ever. Currency translation on net sales was positive, adding one point, and price realization in the quarter was positive by three points.
On Slide 6. Worldwide production tonnage was up 59% in the quarter and up 15% in the fiscal year. Both SBUs saw higher tonnage in the quarter as a result of continued strong demand for large Ag equipment, strength in South America and Construction & Forestry markets rebounding from the very low levels of 2009. For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, worldwide production tonnage is forecast to be up about 39% and for the full year, up approximately 8%.
Slide 7 illustrates the year-over-year change in tonnage by quarter. As you see, the year-over-year pace of change increased as we went through 2010. In contrast, 2011 will start strong then decelerate in the second half. Partly, this is because we are up against some tough comparisons. But also, production will be strongest in the first half of the year to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4. In addition, 2011 will be a year of significant new model introductions due in large part to the engine conversions. Associated with this change, we will experience some production limits and transitional issues.
In addition, Construction & Forestry's production level will be front-end loaded due to their implementation of SAP. Both the Davenport and Dubuque Works will be shut down for approximately two weeks in the year as they switch to the new system.
Let's turn to the company outlook on Slide 8. First quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 34% compared with the first quarter of 2010. Currency translation on net sales has a negative impact by about two points. For the full year, net equipment sales are forecast to be up 10% to 12% compared with fiscal year 2010. This includes about one point of negative currency translation and approximately two points of positive price realizations. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2011.
Turning to review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 9. Production tonnage was up 50% in the quarter on easy comparisons and strong retail demand. Sales increased 33%. Operating profit was $662 million. The profit improvement was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes and improved price realizations, partially offset by higher incentive-compensation expenses and increased raw material costs. The division had an operating margin of about 12% in the quarter and an incremental margin of approximately 24% when you strip out the goodwill impairment and voluntary employee-separation expenses taken in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Before we review the sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business, starting on Slide 10. Extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world had led to lower yields and concerns over tight supplies. That has sent the outlook up considerably for crop prices in the 2010/2011 crop year. 
Our first look at the '11/'12 crop year has prices remaining at strong levels. Corn prices are being held by increased global demand. We project that 2010/2011 corn stock in the U.S. and Canada will end below 1 billion bushels and not significantly increase in 2011/2012. 
Growing global consumption for soybeans is expected to keep exports from the U.S. at strong levels, helping to maintain soybean prices at favorable levels. 2010/2011 global wheat stocks are projected to be down about 12% from the '09/'10 levels, keeping prices strong. 2010/2011 cotton prices remained strong, driven by the recovery in global demand.
Turning to Slide 11. 2010 U.S. farm cash receipts are now forecast to be up about 9% from 2009, rising to about $322 billion. Our forecast for 2011 has farm cash receipts increasing to nearly $347 billion. This would surpass the all-time high at $330.5 billion recorded in 2008 by almost 5%. Farm cash receipts for both the current and prior year are an important driver of Ag equipment sales.
Deere's outlook for the EU-27 is shown on Slide 12. First, grain prices are at very attractive levels. And milk and beef prices continue to rise. European farmer sentiment is improving, but some fundamentals are weighing on producers' minds and they're outlined on the slide. Bottom line, however, is for the first time in the last two years, we are starting to see a turnaround in demand for agricultural equipment in Europe.
Net farm income in Brazil and Argentina is on Slide 13. In Brazil, farm net income is expected to be up 180% from 2011, led by big increases in sugarcane and soybeans. These are the two crops that drive the bulk of equipment purchases in Brazil. Contributing to strength in the region is strong global demand for Brazilian commodities, lower production costs and government-sponsored low-rate finance programs like FINAME PSI, that has been extended through the end of March 2011. 
Although we highlighted our new or updated products in Brazil in the second quarter call, Slide 14 does so again. These products were launched in May with full availability for fiscal 2011, and we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that October was Deere's biggest month ever for tractor and combine sales in Brazil. Further, we added about 25 dealer locations in 2010, enhancing our ability to meet the product support and service needs of our growing customer base. We currently have approximately 200 dealer locations in Brazil.
Slide 15 highlights two exciting events that took place this quarter in India for the Ag & Turf and Construction & Forestry divisions. In late September, Ag & Turf had a groundbreaking ceremony and in October, began construction of a combines factory in India. This marks John Deere's entry into the Harvesting business there. Full production is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2012. 
You've heard us talk about our joint venture with Ashok Leyland for some time. The inauguration of the 200,000 square foot facility took place on October 21. Hiring is underway, and production, initially of backhoes, is expected to begin in the first half of 2011.
Our 2011 industry outlooks are on Slide 16. Fundamentals in the U.S. and Canadian farm sectors remain robust but reflecting the transition to Interim Tier 4, industry sales of agricultural equipment in the region are forecast to be about flat in 2011. With respect to Deere, we continue to see strength in our order books. The combine early order program is progressing well and as planned. In absolute numbers, orders are ahead of last year. 
In the sprayer, planter and tillage equipment programs, we are seeing strong results, even above last year, and demand for large tractors remains strong. The 8R Series tractor, with its Interim Tier 4 engine, is being very well accepted. We have conducted aggressive training on the new 8R in the areas of technology, capability and support. Also, customers are excited about the performance of and the new telematics on the tractor. In fact, dealers report that some customers who had submitted orders early to receive 8R tractors with Tier 3 engines have changed their order to later in the year to receive an Interim Tier 4-compliant machine. Also, some customers who bought a new 8R tractor in 2010 are already discussing trades for the 2011 machine. We are encouraged by the initial orders of more than 2,500 8R units, all of which are retail sold. Effective availability for the 8R Series tractors is May 2011.
Earlier, we touched on the conditions in Western Europe. As noted earlier, we are encouraged that demand is beginning to turn. In 2011, we expect Ag sales to be up 5% to 10% in Western Europe. 
Sales in Central Europe and the CIS are expected to see moderate gains from the depressed levels of 2010. Asia's sales are expected to increase moderately from the very strong levels of 2010, and industry sales in South America are expected to be flat in 2011 from the strong levels of 2010. Although the underlying economic fundamentals are positive, our industry retail forecast includes lower sales from Brazilian government programs that target small farmers and a return to higher interest rates if the FINAME PSI extension expires on March 31. In summary, with Deere's lineup of new products, we are excited about our prospects in South America.
Turning to another product category. After rising almost 15% in 2010, we expect retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be about flat in 2011. We have seen an uptick in the Commercial Mowing segment, and our new utility vehicles have experienced an extremely successful launch. Putting this all together on Slide 17, Deere sales for worldwide Ag & Turf are projected to be up 7% to 9% for 2011, with an operating margin around 13%.
In 2010, the Ag & Turf division's operating margin benefited by about two points, due to the mix of large Ag sales in comparison with a normal year. That effect is expected to moderate somewhat in 2011, as small Ag equipment sales recover from their fairly low levels of the past few years. The mix impact in 2011 will be about one point.
Let's focus now on Construction & Forestry on Slide 18. Deere's net sales were up 75% in the quarter, while production tonnage was up 129%. The division's operating profit of $54 million was impacted by higher shipment and production volumes, incentive-compensation expenses, raw material costs and post-retirement benefit expenses.
On Slide 19. Following a 41% increase in 2010, net sales in Construction & Forestry are forecast to be up 25% to 30% in fiscal 2011. To put these numbers in perspective, and to truly appreciate the severity of the decline in the C&F market, this year's increase will put the division sales at about what has historically been considered a trough level. 
We are forecasting the U.S. construction industry to be up about 25% for the full year. Growth is slower coming out of this recession than others, but we are encouraged by the activity we have seen from the independent rental companies and in the governmental segment. Also encouraging, Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment markets.
Meanwhile, global forestry markets were up significantly in 2010 from the very low levels of 2009 and are expected to be up further in 2011. Globally, the industry was up about 50% in 2010, and our current forecast calls for a further increase of 25% to 30% in 2011. The full year operating margin for Deere's C&F division is forecast to be in the mid-single digits.
Let's move now to our credit operations. Slide 20 shows the worldwide credit operations' provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average-owned portfolio. For fiscal 2010, the provision was 48 basis points. Write-offs from the Construction & Forestry portfolios continue to improve. We are seeing fewer repossessions and increased pricing on the repossessions that are occurring, as well as improving recovery rates. The 2011 full year provision for credit losses as a percent of the average-owned portfolio is forecast to run around 45 basis points.
On Slide 21, past-dues for the worldwide credit operations were lower than 2009 overall. 
Moving to Slide 22. Worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company was $91 million in the quarter versus a net loss of $22 million last year. The biggest factors were the reversal and deferral of wind energy tax credits eligible for cash grants this year, a lower provision for credit losses, improved financing spreads and growth in the portfolio.
Speaking of wind, as previously announced, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell the Wind Energy business. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in December. A charge of about $20 million after tax is included in the fourth quarter results. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide credit operations net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $360 million in 2011.
Now let's turn our focus back to the equipment ops and take a look at receivables and inventories on Slide 23. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories were up roughly $1.5 billion in 2010 versus 2009. Keep in mind we ended fiscal 2009 with receivables and inventories at extremely low levels. They were $1.3 billion lower than at the end of fiscal 2008. 
Also, 2010 year-end inventories were higher due to strong end markets and the timing of Interim Tier 4 transitions. By the end of fiscal 2011, receivables and inventories are expected to be down about $675 million.
Now let's discuss the latest on retail sales. Slide 24 presents the product category detail in the U.S. and Canada for the month of October, expressed in units. Utility tractor industry sales were up 11%; Deere was up more than the industry. Row-crop tractor industry sales were up 40%; Deere was up more than the industry. Four-wheel drive industry sales were up 63%; Deere was up more. And the combine industry sales were up 18%; again, Deere was up more than the industry.
Looking at Deere dealer inventories in the bottom chart for row-crop tractors, Deere ended October with inventories at 16% of trailing 12-month sales. Combine inventories were at 2% of sales.
Turning to Slide 25. In Western Europe, sales of John Deere tractors and combines were up double digits in October. Deere's retail sales of selected turf & utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada were up double digits in the month. And Construction & Forestry sales in the U.S. and Canada, on both a first-in-the-dirt and settlement basis, were up double digits for the month.
Slide 26 shows raw material and logistics costs up about $80 million in the quarter and down about $135 million for fiscal 2010. Our fiscal 2011 calls for raw material and logistics costs to be up about $250 million compared with last year. By division, this includes about $175 million increase for Ag & Turf and about $75 million for Construction & Forestry. The significant material cost tailwind of about $230 million in the first half of 2010 is not forecast to be repeated in 2011.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 27, R&D was up about 14% in the fourth quarter with currency translation being negative by about two points. For fiscal 2010, R&D expense was up about 8%. For fiscal 2011, R&D expense is expected to be up about 15%. 
As we stated last quarter, R&D spending is expected to remain at high levels as we approach significant product launches with Interim Tier 4 engines. And soon thereafter, we respond to Final Tier 4 emission standards. Also included in the increase is the ongoing new product development expense for our growing global customer base.
Moving now to Slide 28. Pension and OPEB expense in the fourth quarter was up about $70 million, bringing the full year increase to about $345 million. Pension and OPEB expense is expected to be about flat in fiscal 2011. 
On Slide 29, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 15% in the fourth quarter. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about 11 points of the increase, while pension and OPEB expense added about two points. For fiscal 2010, SA&G was up about 10 points. Variable incentive compensation accounted for about six points of the change as the company's performance continued to improve. One factor was record-setting SVA, reflecting our continued focus on execution and asset efficiency.
Pension and OPEB accounted for about two points of the SA&G increase and currency translation, about two points. SA&G is expected to be up about six points for fiscal 2011. In line with our growth objective, growth will account for about two points of the change with variable incentive-compensation accounting for about one point.
Moving to the tax rates on Slide 30. The fourth quarter effective tax rate for the equipment operations was about 42%. The full year 2010 effective tax rate was about 41%, including the tax expense of about $130 million related to U.S. healthcare legislation recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the charge, the effective tax rate for 2010 would have been about 36%. For 2011, our effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 35% to 37%.
On Slide 31, you see our record of strong cash flow from Deere's equipment operations. We anticipate cash flow from equipment ops of about $3 billion in fiscal 2011. Such strong cash generation speaks to successful execution of our SVA model, which emphasizes high returns from a lean slate of assets. In light of such strong cash flow, we thought it appropriate to review our use of cash priorities, as outlined on Slide 32.
First is the importance of a single A rating. Deere's worldwide credit operation provides a strategic advantage in funding customer purchases. But this is true only so long as we can access the credit markets on a cost-effective basis. One of the key elements to this end is maintaining a single A rating, which is our top priority. 
The rating agencies expect 12 months of debt maturities to be covered by cash and/or untapped credit facilities. This also implies appropriately funding our pension and OPEB benefits, which we have done proactively and prudently over the years. In fact, at the end of fiscal 2010, the accumulated benefit obligation for Deere's U.S. hourly and salary plans was 102% funded, while the projected benefit obligations was 98% funded.
Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations, such as the two facilities in India that we just referenced or our factory in Domodedovo, Russia that was opened earlier in the year. A third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and such not growing it beyond a point that can be comfortably sustained by our cash flow.
Share repurchase is our method of deploying excess cash once the previous requirements are met and as long as the share repurchase is viewed as value enhancing.
Slide 33 addresses unsecured term debt maturities over the next two years, nearly $3 billion in 2011 and approximately $5 billion in 2012. The relatively high level and timing of maturities in 2012 will affect the amount of cash we are targeting for year-end 2011. 
Slide 34 summarizes share repurchases by fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for about $255 million, bringing total shares repurchased this year to over 5 million. Looking into 2011, given our projected cash flow and use of cash priorities, it is fair to say that our forecast contemplates additional share repurchases in the coming year.
Finally, Slide 35 summarizes sources and uses of cash since we restarted the share repurchase program back in 2004 and began a run of seven dividend increases. You'll note that we have returned over $7 billion of cash to shareholders over this time, representing about 55% of the cash generated by operations. This accomplishment demonstrates our focus on delivering value to investors.
Turning to Slide 36. Capital expenditures were $735 million in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by the Interim Tier 4 emission rules. Depreciation and amortization was about $550 million. Pension and OPEB contributions were about $840 million in the year. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2011, as Slide 37 illustrates, capital expenditures are expected to be about $1 billion in the year. The increase is due to new product development in new markets, such as our entry into the Harvesting business in India, as mentioned earlier. Depreciation and amortization for 2011 is expected to be about $550 million, with pension and OPEB contributions of about $300 million.
In closing, John Deere enters 2011 on a strong pace. We are looking for further improvements in the year ahead as a result of some pickup in overall economic conditions and a farm sector that remains very sound in general and is gaining strength in some of our key markets. At the same time, the company is aiming to capitalize on this positive environment by pursuing new markets, adding productive new models of equipment and extending its competitive position throughout the world.
John Deere's plans for helping meet the world's growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure are well on track and moving ahead at an accelerated rate. That's one of the reasons we remain highly confident about the company's increasingly attractive future prospects and about our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future."

First of all, as Susan pointed out, this is about 70% of our average or typical volume. So even with that very significant increase, Jamie, that just puts us at the bottom of where we would normally be operating. The other thing I would point out, and this will certainly have an impact on the Ag & Turf division as well, is that although we have good volume increases, we talked about raw material costs; we talked about R&D and SA&G; we have some other expenses that -- I'm going to give the number for the company because I don't have them split by division, but they are important for the Construction & Forestry division as well. And that would include IT4 product costs. We have raw material costs. That's inflation adjustments, if you will, but these new IT4-compliant machines cost more money because there's more hardware on them. And the cost for the company is about $135 million, we estimate, for next year. And actually, we do have a little bit of a split. We think it's about $100 million for the Ag & Turf and about $35 million for the Construction & Forestry. We also have some higher overhead expenses due to just the fact that we will be in transition. Susan mentioned that Construction & Forestry will have a two- week shutdown as they transition to SAP. We've got some additional human resources assigned to help facilitate that. And then additionally, just the near transition to IT4, which causes some inefficiencies, if you will, in the factory. Then the third thing that, again, affects the company less so, Construction, but nonetheless something to note, is that absorption is about $100 million hit in 2011. So when you look at those factors, you can see why we have the kinds of margins that we do. We will continue to work to improve our margins. Obviously, you've heard us talk about our aspirations, which are a 12% operating margin on average over time and a peak margin of about 14½%. And those are still very much in play, but in 2011, we have some unique circumstances."

And I'm interested that you raised your farm cash income expectations in North America and in South America. And certainly, the underlying crop fundamentals look pretty strong and yet we have kind of flattish forecast for those markets. And I'm wondering, do you think that we're just sort of saturated at this point and the cycle is kind of flattening out? Or is there some reason that you would expect farmers, despite these strong fundamentals, to have fairly flat purchases?"

Our guidance for North America is affected by these very significant product transitions in IT4. That will have some impact on our ability to respond to customers' requirements. We will do our very best. But because of the need",338,"Well, let's go back again. Our guidance for North America is affected by these very significant product transitions in IT4. That will have some impact on our ability to respond to customers' requirements. We will do our very best. But because of the need to manage emissions credits, and as we've talked a lot already about the transitions and the fact that you have some capacity that's taken out effectively because of those transitions, we think that the markets will be affected in 2011 by that. So that's, maybe, in North America. In South America, again, the guidance specifically is looking at tractors and combines, which is certainly a very important part of the market. But it does not include what's happening in sugarcane and cotton. The other thing I want to point out is in the tractor market, as we look at it, we assume, because we don't know what will happen, that the very attractive 5½% rate that the FINAME PSI has been offering will end and not be extended beyond the end of March because we simply don't know. And that's what's in our forecast. The other factors, there are two state government programs in Brazil that appear to be ending in December and not repeated. Those are targeted at small farms and lower horsepower equipment. So those two end. And we think that there's been a very significant number of tractor sold under MDA, which is the Mais Alimentos, which is the More Food program. That's the federal program in Brazil. Sales in the last two years each have represented about 30% of the industry. And we think that, based on the market dynamics, we think that we actually may see that segment slowing down, maybe off as much as a third next year. And so that's what's incorporated in our industry guidance. Again, that's the industry. When you look at Deere, we have all these new products. We've got a very exciting lineup ahead, and we're very enthused about our prospects into 2011."
