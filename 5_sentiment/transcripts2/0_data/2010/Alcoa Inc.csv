After comments by Chuck and Klaus, we’ll take your questions.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expectations listed in today’s press release and ALCOA’s most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today’s press release and in the appendix of today’s presentation and on our website at www.ALCOA.com under the invest section.
Now I’d like to turn it over to Chuck.

We significantly exceeded our target to be free cash flow neutral by year end. We achieved all of our 2010 cash sustainability targets a year early, dramatically improved liquidity and strengthened our balance sheet.
As to earnings, we’ve overcome significant currency and energy headwinds, weakened markets, project start up costs and unallocated fixed costs at our facilities to report our second consecutive quarter of profitability.
If you noticed, I just drew a comparison between cash and earnings and if you bear with me, I’d like to take a few minutes and elaborate on that. If you’ve been following us during 2009, you know we’ve been singularly focused on cash as a financial measure of performance.
In early 2009 we were in the middle of a financial and economic crisis. Price and demand destruction was rampant. We set aggressive cash targets and communicated these both internally and externally.
The only way these targets were going to be achieved is by very aggressive and decisive actions, particularly in the manner in which we pulled back capacity and eliminated cash costs, and I’m sure everybody is aware that we did this in our stream operations but during the course of the year we did in it in mid stream operations. We did it in down stream operations.
We had investment casting facilities taken down by 50%. We had Davenport, our largest mill in North America, running at less than 70%, shut down Texarkana. My point is that we had to pull back capacity at many locations to meet the decreased demand and the way we were going to manage our cash is to take all of the variable cash costs out as quick as possible.
When you do that, you’ve got all your fixed costs and it’s going to be over lower volume and it’s going to hurt profitability. But the other alternative is we could have continued to run this volume that had no demand. We would have assumed all of this cost and put it in inventory and we would have had much better earnings and been on a road to disaster.
So let me finish by saying that we’re extremely proud of the efforts in maintaining our cash and liquidity position and think as we go through this presentation that you’ll see it speaks for itself that we were able to achieve all of these targets.
Now let’s move to the fourth quarter presentation. As I noted, we achieved all of our 2010 cash sustainability targets in the fourth quarter, helping to produce cash from operations of $1.1 billion and free cash flow of $761 million.
Disciplined capital management yielded a decline in debt of $759 million from the fourth quarter 2008 which when we add it to the increase in cash of $719 million, it resulted in a decrease in net debt of $1.5 billion.
Loss from continuing operations was $266 million or $0.27 per share and included restructuring of special items of $275 million or $0.28 per share. In a few minutes, I’ll review these items in more detail.
The quarter benefited from a 9% uptick in the realized price of aluminum, record production of third party shipments in the Alumina segment and continued productivity gains related to our cash sustainability program. A weak U.S. dollar and higher energy costs negatively impacted sequential performance.
On the revenue side, higher aluminum prices and margin neutral buy/resell activity helped drive an 18% sequential improvement in every end market with the exception of Aerospace, commercial building and construction and the IGT market showed a sequential increase.
Let’s move to the next slide and I’ll talk about market activity. Markets continue to be very weak relative to last year and the sequential improvements we are experiencing are well below historic norms. Sequential declines in the Aerospace and IGT markets were driven by continued destocking activity which we expect to last into the first half of 2010.
Now let’s move to the financials. I’ll highlight key items. You have the detailed income statement in the press release. Higher realized aluminum prices and buy/resell activity helped to drive an 18% increase in revenues sequentially. The buy/resell activity accounted for roughly a third of the sequential increase in revenues.
Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased in the quarter due to the charges related to our Italian operations and the MRN tax settlement. Excluding those charges and the impact of the buy/resell activity, cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 83.6%.
Lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was 38.8% bringing our operational tax rate for the year to 36.2%. For your reference, we’ve attached an appendix to help guide you through the full year tax rate.
Going forward, we expect our ETR to be approximately 35%. However we will continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility in our profit drivers and the overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction.
Let’s now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter. This slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location on the financial statements. As you’ll recall, the European Commission has ruled the pricing of electricity to our Italian smelters represented inappropriate state aid. 
We appealed the opening of the case by the EC and will also vigorously challenge the decision in EU courts. While there has been no indication from the Italian government of the magnitude of the drawback, we anticipate a cash payment of $300 million to $400 million in 2010.
Now to illustrate the impact on the Italian case on our fourth quarter financials, we have distinguished the discrete components of the charge on this slide. As you can see, Italian charges include restructuring, a deferred tax asset write off, the draw back reserve and environmental accruals, and they totally net to an impact of $0.33 per share.
The other items in the quarter netted to a $0.05 benefit of which the majority was discrete tax items recognized for certain foreign jurisdictions. The net of these items totaled $275 million or $0.28 per share.
Many of our restructuring charges this year have centered on the significant head count reductions aimed at reducing our cost structure. Let’s now review head count reduction for the company.
Our efforts to rapidly redesign operations and improve work flow have structurally reduced head count. We have identified a total of 24,600 reductions, over 21,500 of which have been completed. These reductions contributed $325 million in cash savings in 2009 and will achieve run rate savings of $600 million. In addition, we estimate that 75% of these positions are permanent reductions and therefore sustainable.
We’ve also had an additional 20,000 reductions through divestitures bringing total head count down to roughly 59,000 Alcoans.
Let’s now move to earnings bridges starting with the sequential bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and special items. The fourth quarter benefited from a 9% increase in realized aluminum prices.
Higher energy and commodity prices and the continuing weakening of the dollar in the quarter partially offset this benefit. As a reference point, fourth quarter oil prices were higher by 12%, natural gas prices were up 44% and the dollar depreciated against the Real by 7% and the A dollar by 9%.
SG&A expenses were higher in the sequential quarter, yet remain low on a percent of sales basis. As you will see in Klaus’s presentation, total overhead is $412 million lower than 2008 and we anticipate improving that by another 20% in 2010.
Higher depreciation and start up costs at our Brazilian operations effectively offset productivity gains generated by our cash sustainability efforts.
Let’s turn to the year over year bridge which better illustrates the impact our initiatives have had on the bottom line. On a year over year basis, profitability was significantly impacted by a decline in aluminum price of 35% and double digit declines in every end market. These significant impacts were partially offset by almost $1.5 billion of favorable productivity, energy and currency, a testament that our cash sustainability initiatives are having a significant and positive impact to earnings.
Before we move to the segments, I’d like to call your attention to the changes we’ve made to the segment summaries. We’ve included bridges illustrating the drivers and discrete impact for every segment. We hope this new level of transparency assists you in better understanding and assessing performance.
With that said, let’s go to Alumina. We set quarterly production of 3.9 million metric tons this quarter. Increases at Sao Luis, Port Comfort and the inclusion of a full quarter of 100% of [Surinam] accounted for the majority of the improvement.
We also set a record in third party shipments on strong customer demand, particularly in China. Higher volumes and an increase in third party realized pricing of 15% drove earnings benefits of $73 million. The weakening U.S. dollar yielded negative currency effects of $30 million.
You will recall that last quarter’s results included a $58 million gain related to the [Seraco] acquisition. Also, the MRN partnership in which we have an equity investment settled a tax litigation matter for which we recorded a $30 million charge during the fourth quarter.
Productivity gains including the benefits of lower caustic costs were offset by higher start up costs as we ramp up Juriti bauxite mine. Start up costs in Juriti totaled $14 million sequentially.
Moving to the outlook, aluminum pricing will follow a 60 day lag. Lower caustic costs will flow through the system and we will continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives.  The ramp up of Juriti and Sao Luis will yield increased depreciation costs of $8 million.
Let’s move to the Primary segment. Primary ATOI includes $273 million related to the Italian power case, comprised of the drawback and higher energy costs totaling $23 million since the ruling was issued. We have filed the official documentation to begin a temporary layoff in Massena and [Porta Vesna].
We continue to work with the electricity providers and distribution companies to find an acceptable power solution and prevent a full curtailment. From an operational perspective, third party realized aluminum price was up $183.00 a ton or 9% as LME pricing and regional premiums continued to improve. Margin neutral by resell totaled 207 tons during the quarter and production increased slightly.
Productivity was offset by negative currency impacts of $29 million. Looking to the first quarter, our realized pricing is expected to follow a 15 day lag and we expect continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives.
Let’s go to Flat-Rolled Products segment. FRP generated $37 million in ATOI this quarter on an improved mix in pricing. Ongoing cash sustainability initiatives resulted in a 25% decrease in total head count for the group for the full year.
Next quarter we expect continued gains from our cost initiatives. However, we remain cautious on the end markets, especially Aerospace while can sheet which is a key market for us, we made some tough decisions over the past year to change our pricing strategy and to ensure the long term profitability of the business.
Metal ceilings have been eliminated and increased costs of the business are being shared with customers to improve our profitability in the market. These decisions were not made lightly and it is designed to position ALCOA more competitively in the can sheet business and to achieve financial returns that can support the business in the long term.
Current volume levels require some restructuring and we expect to complete head count reductions by the end of the first quarter.
Now let’s turn to the EPS segment. Revenue declined 3% sequentially due primarily to continued weakness in the Aerospace and IGT markets. Continued destocking in Aerospace supply chains drove revenues down 3% sequentially while IGT revenues fell 16% as new projects continued to be delayed.
Small gains were seen in the commercial transportation market with revenues up 7% sequentially. ATOI for the quarter of $57 million was 24% below the third quarter primarily driven by the revenue declines in our two key markets.
The market conditions for this segment are anticipated to remain challenging for the first quarter with respect to both mix and demand, the impact of which will be partially mitigated by productivity improvements.
Let’s now move to my favorite, the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we produced cash from operations of $1.1 million, our best performance since the second quarter of 2007. Working capital generated $522 million in the quarter as continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives more than offset the impact of higher LME prices.
Roughly 90% of the working capital reductions are structural in nature, driven by a 10 day decline in day’s working capital since the fourth quarter of 2008. The other adjustments line includes the add back of the non cash charges in the quarter.
CapEx total $363 million as we deferred non essential capital in Brazil until 2010. For the year, gross CapEx accounted for 68% of our total spend of $1.6 billion. Our three major growth projects, CRT, San Luis comprised 75% of the gross spend.
Free cash flow of $761 million marked the highest free cash flow generation since the second quarter of 2003. All of our cash sustainability initiatives in 2009 were centered on driving cash flows and strengthening ALCOA. 
Let’s move to the next slide to put our performance in the proper perspective. We acted swiftly in the downturn to secure ALCOA’s liquidity. Putting forth our holistic solution of both operational and financial initiatives, we’ve been relentless in executing this plan in 2009 saving $2.4 billion in total costs. These savings are hitting the bottom line as evidenced by a second consecutive quarter of profitability and our full year cash generation. 
To put our current position into perspective, let’s look back at the beginning of 2009. In the first two months of 2009 we generated a negative free cash flow of $1 billion. Over the next 10 months of the year, our initiatives drove free cash flow generation of $750 million bringing full year cash flow to a negative $257 million, an outstanding outcome and further evidence of our success in executing our cash sustainability program.
We also improved liquidity and reduced debt by $759 million. In fact, net debt for the company declined by $1.5 billion in ’09 and if we would have used the $1 billion in excess cash to pay down debt, our debt to cap would have fallen to 36.1% and we are not done.
The combination of current metal, currency and energy factors and the continued execution of our cash sustainability initiatives will help drive far better performance in 2010.
In summary, our progress in an undeniably strong response to the weak market environment we experienced in 2009 and a testament to the enthusiasm every Alcoan exhibits in strengthening our company and creating value for our stakeholders.
And now I’d like to turn it over to Klaus.

Looking at our Q4 numbers and reviewing 2009, let me say I’m really pleased with the performance and this was only possible because literally every Alcoan has been chipping in.Let me",4423,"Thank you very much Chuck and welcome everybody who’s on the call. Looking at our Q4 numbers and reviewing 2009, let me say I’m really pleased with the performance and this was only possible because literally every Alcoan has been chipping in.
Let me review 2009 first. It was a very challenging environment. We had a historically not seen price decline, 66% decline in less than five months and we had a broad based demand destruction in our end markets.
At the same time the challenge has brought the best out of ALCOA. We have responded very, very early. As many of you may remember, we’ve put this together in a holistic solution which we call the cash sustainability program. Chuck already referred to it. Cash was the target that we had been aiming at and you can see the results, and I’ll be going through that.
We summarized that and what you can see in the middle of our seven promises, this kind of became our mantra, our playbook that pretty much every employee in ALCOA was following. And if you look at the deliveries, you can see that we really delivered on all of those promises. 
That’s our safety performance, exceeded our cash targets, continued growth, repowered a lot of our smelters, free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of ’09 which we promised, but that number is a number none of us was having in mind when we made that promise; way over shot it, we strengthened our liquidity.
So that’s the summary. Let’s go through some of the details so you get a feel for it. In spite of all the economic pressures, we have not compromised our values. We in fact, live them every day and we are very proud of the achievements particularly in an environment like the environment last year.
We have had our best ever safety performance. You can see that on the left hand side here of the slide that the total recordable incidents rate for instance, up 9% over last year, or the lost work incidents rate up 7%.
But to make it more tangible, 74% of all of our facilities had no lost work day incidents in the last year. Or, to make it even clearer, an ALCOA employee working anywhere in the global organization, is four times safer than an employee in the U.S. industrial company. 
And obviously this didn’t go unnoticed. We received quite a bit of recognition; made it to the Fortune Most Admired again, Dow Jones Sustainability Index, eight consecutive year, the World Economic Forum Global 100 or the Brazilian magazine, their leading business publication Exame, all of those awarded us, and we also are particularly proud given the importance of this for our industry that we helped launch the USCAP, going after the carbon emission trading and emission capturing.
So all of this I think is a clear testament that we are not only managing our bottom line, but we are also managing our bottom line, and let’s go to the next slide and start to go through the specifics there.
Procurement; on the procurement, this is certainly the biggest bucket that we had and also that we showed on the commitment. We actually said we wanted to reduce the procurement costs by $2 billion until 2010. We set $1.5 billion we would be able to achieve in 2009 and look where we are here on the right hand side. The actual is actually around $1.998 billion. You can clearly see where we are one year ahead with the execution.
To get there, we really had to use every lever. We expanded our supplier base. We changed specifications. We’ve actually broken pricing conventions and I could go on and on and on. We really had to pull every lever of the success on our side.
I’m particularly proud of this because at the same time it wasn’t like we had all the wins kind of helping us. We had quite a bit of headwinds particularly on the rising currency levels as well as the energy prices, and still we’ve been able to overcome those challenges and come out with that performance.
Let’s go to the next one, the overhead, the overhead costs. The overhead costs, we did something pretty simple. We said, we do a head count 20% on all the overhead costs. So that led us to the target of $400 million. We wanted to have 50% of that in 2009, and look at where we are here on the right hand side. Same pattern on the slide before; $412 million reduced overhead costs. So again, a year ahead and all of that was only possible because of a rapid reduction in costs; personnel, travel, consulting, those type of things.
Let’s go to the CapEx slide. On the CapEx many of you who follow ALCOA know we are coming out of the time where we’ve done a lot of investment and that is what you see here on the left hand side, the $3.4 billion of CapEx in investment in 2008.
When we faced the crisis we said we’re going to cut that down and came out with a target of $1.8 billion. In reality, what did we achieve? We achieved a $1.622 billion CapEx spend. That was only possible because we aggressively managed the spend and we delayed spend to overcome also the additional currency headwinds of the total magnitude in CapEx alone of $250 million in 2009.
So that’s what led to that. Now we also said that we will be able to bring down the sustaining CapEx down to a level of $850 million and we’ll be able to run that through without compromising the quality of the system. And if you take that on the right hand side here, and add into it the remaining spend from the Brazilian project plus the new Saudi project, plus the sustaining CapEx, you end up with a target of $1.250 million. So I think that’s a pretty good achievement.
Working capital as the last point there, important spend category. So what did we do there? On the right hand side you can see we came up with a target for 2009 of $800 million, and what did we achieve? We achieved $1.3 billion of spend reduction. This is significant particularly as we have been facing during that period in 2009 a rising level of LME prices which obviously the second half particularly which obviously makes it more difficult to achieve those numbers.
If I were to summarize the performance in simple terms, I would say, if you look at the performance against the cash sustainability program targets, and many of you had a chance to discuss those when we did our equity raise with Chuck and myself, and there were a lot of people who said, “Wow, this is a very aggressive plan.” 
And I agree. It was a very aggressive plan. The performance here has been exceptional, driving up the costs and compensating for the substantial headwinds and currency as well as energy and I’m very, very sure that we really improved the cash raising capabilities to bring cost savings to the bottom line.
The next slide, I want to stop here for a second because so far I’ve been talking about the operational improvement, and that is very, very good. But that’s only one side of what we have been doing.
The other thing is, we’ve been looking at improving our strategic position, improving on how we can perform going forward. Sometimes you have the impression when you go through a year like 2009 as though you’re totally occupied in getting all the saving done. 
As much as we have been focusing on that our eye continues to be on true north. Where is the right strategic positioning? And we did not let go on those. We continued to execute on those equally well as on the operational ones.
Let’s review those because the year had a lot of months, a lot of days, and sometimes you forget what happened during all the year. So let’s start with the left box here, the portfolio box. We’ve really optimized the portfolio for liquidity and growth.
Let me just mention the big items, and there have been other smaller ones. Shining Prospect; the AEES investment, for those that don’t follow us that much, that was the automotive business investment; the Norway Smelter swap, cash swap against our assets, Suranime assets, we’re buying up a minority position from the HP.
If you look at that left hand box, and look at where we are today, 90% of the businesses that we have today are either a number one or number two competitive position.
Let’s go to the second box. Obviously you all know that when it comes to the smelting system, energy cost is the most important factor, and long term supply of competitive energy is the most important factor. And again, we have continued to focus on that to strengthen our competitiveness in this.
Today, we have 85% of all smelting systems powered through minimum 2025. There are in fact quite a number of those that have contracts that go further out than 2025.
And then on the right hand side box, and I think a lot of Alcoan’s are particularly proud of that because that talks about the organic growth and that obviously takes a lot of people to get that thing done.
We have brought on line our new bauxite mine in the Amazon in Juriti and we’ve also brought on line the respective refinery in Sao Luis. Both of those activities in Brazil are going to substantially improve our cost position of the refining system. It’s going to bring us down, ALCOA in total down, 5% on the refining cost structure, the world wide refining cost.
So with that, ALCOA’s refining system is now position in the lower quartile of the cost curve, one of the best moves that we could actually make.
Then on the right hand side, left corner, Bohai in China, we brought on line our Bohai facility, and this is very soon going to replace a lot of the imported lithographic sheets that China today has. 
Samara, one of our Russian facilities we actually ramped up the can sheet and manufacturing there. We are the only producer of that product in Russia, and we’re not stopping there. We also announced just a little before the holidays, our new joint venture in Saudi Arabia. Let’s go to that.
I know that many of you have certainly read the press release, but I still want to spend a little time because this is really, really important; an important move for ALCOA’s primary system. This is, I would say a once in a lifetime opportunity for ALCOA, for Ma’aden, our partner as well as for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
We’re talking about an investment in total of $10.8 billion. ALCOA and partners have 40% and ALCOA’s investment is about $900 million over a period of four years and we expect this to be funded basically with free cash flow of ALCOA.
It’s the lowest cost production complex in the world and I’ll give you some more details on that. The world’s most efficient integrated aluminum complex utilized fully developed infrastructure. It lowers ALCOA’s refining and smelting position. It offers expansion opportunities and it gives us a very strong footprint in a fast growing region.
Let’s take a look at some more details here on the Ma’aden joint venture. As I said, it encompasses bauxite mine, a refinery, a smelter and a rolling mill, and all together in pretty strong proximity.
The bauxite mine, 12 million tons annually, a direct rail line to the refinery. Refinery; located in Raz Az Zawr, 1.8 million tons annually, and the design is built for expansion options. Smelter is co-located to the refinery, 740,000 tons annually, also optionality for expansion; and the rolling mill co-located to the smelter, up to 460,000 tons on the hot mills and basically all of that, particularly the refining, smelter and rolling mill, utilizes the Raz Az Zawr new port. 
I forgot to mention it’s right on the water so it utilized the new port. It utilized also the 2,500 megawatt gas power plant that is currently getting erected there. And, all utilized the railway connection right out to the mine.
The smelter and the rolling mill will be operational in 2013. All of that together, and I assume you would agree with that, gives us the unique opportunity to bring our cost down and build a super low cost aluminum production complex.
So let’s go to the most important thing; the conclusion of all the things that we’ve done last year. Really as I said, we really focused on cash and cash alone. We have improved our cash position. We strengthened our balance sheet and strengthened also our strategic position as I just said.
Let’s look at the left box here which shows the free cash flow broken down by quarters. You can clearly see the outstanding performance. We are exceeding our targets in regards to free cash flow and free cash flow neutral by the end of last year. In fact, we have had as Chuck pointed out, $761 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and that’s a very, very good performance.
If you look at the free cash flow improvements on the right hand side here, if you look at the free cash flow improvements over the year, this allowed us to fund the growth and to end the year with a $1.5 billion cash balance, and to bring the debt to cap down by 3.9 points year on year, which brings it down from 42.5% to 38.6%.
Our actions all significantly improved our cash generation as well as our balance sheet and we have all intentions to remain on that path in 2010. Before I talk about 2010, let’s go to the end markets and see how the end markets are performing.
Go to Aerospace, let’s start with that. Large commercial aircraft, we expect deliveries to decline. The airlines continue to be challenged. They are projected to lose $11 billion in 2009 and another $6 billion in 2010. New orders fell pretty drastically to roughly 300 from roughly 1,400 in 2008.
If you go to regional business, the market experienced significant reductions in orders as well as in deliveries. While we continue to see destocking across the supply chain, and that is obviously most important to our profitability short term.
Let me add to that one thing for those that don’t follow that market so strongly. If you take the two big players, Boeing and Airbus alone, you always have to keep in mind with all the things that I’ve just been saying that there continues to be a six year order backlog. And unlike in the last aviation cycle, the production has not been ramped up, so there’s a lot of respected analysts that believe that this backlog can tide the companies over until the orders recover.
And also, if you look at air travel, it’s clearly been picking up during the past 12 months and we believe that this is probably not going to drive new builds, but what it certainly is going to drive is at least spare parts utilization. So there’s also some potentially good news in that here.
Automotive; production expected to rebound in 2010 by about 8% to 60.8 million vehicles. The dealer restocking which was expected to happen in the second half of ’09 is largely completed. Inventories are back to normal levels.
It’s important to recall that production even though they are improved, are obviously well below the peak levels of 2007 for instance. We’re talking about 11% still below the 2007 level. But, all regions are expected to show improvement except Europe, and in Europe it’s simply an impact of the prolonged and strong government stimulus program that we saw in 2009.
Heavy trucks and trailer, generally expect a build rate to rise by 10%. We’re talking about 1.2 million units. It’s well below historic norms. North America for instance, if you take that, we expect 2010 to have a plus 5% increase to 125,000 units. The historic norm is about 225,000 units.
If you look at the U.S. and new EPA 2010 diesel emissions standards have created a modest boost here of about 10,000 units.  You will see that the flat to minimal growth in North American and Europe in freight shipments and the over capacity will continue to create some downward pressure on this market.
Beverage can market, we continue to see a trend flat to slightly higher. Commercial building and construction we expect a decline of 20 plus percent. Leading indicators like contracts awarded, architectural buildings show that trend. 
On the industrial gas turbine side, there are three factors in fact; reduced energy demand, the International Energy Agency forecasts about minus 3.5% for 2009. That’s the first world wide reduction in 65 years.
The challenge; project financing and the uncertainty of the cost around carbon legislation. That actually has an upside in there because gas turbines have only half of the emission of coal fired power generation, so this could give an advantage depending on where those cards fall.
To sum it all up, we expect to see a relative improvement in 2010 but the levels are below the historic norms; but, they are up. If you now fold that into the projection on aluminum, that’s what you see here on that slide and we believe that all of this is going to drive a pretty substantial growth of aluminum in 2010; 10% growth in 2010.
You can see already when you look at that chart here the major driver of this growth is China. If you subtract China from that, you still end up with 5% growth overall which is still a good growth number that we’re going to see driven by places like India, Brazil and Asia in general.
Let’s go to the next slide which shows the supply demand relation. Let’s start with aluminum. We see here that we expect a surplus of about 1.2 million tons. If you add the surplus here on the China side as well as the western world side, 305 to 925.
We also, let’s go to China side; China moves to a modest surplus but significantly reduces imports. Last year imports added up to about 1.5 million tons. We believe that China will continue to manage the capacity as well as the demand very well and will stay in balance after all the surplus that we see here we believe is going to be fairly temporary.
On the western world side, we believe that this is a reflection of Greenfield’s expansion in the Middle East and India coming online. This in total adds what we add in total for that is about 740,000 tons over the year. 
What is not built in here in our view, outages as well as high energy costs that may lead to curtailment in places like Venezuela and India.
Let’s go to the total surplus here of 1.2 million as I mentioned. Just to give you reference, this equals two weeks of consumption, so it’s relatively manageable for the global industry. Our view is not taking into account potential restocking of the supply chain and if that were to happen the right side would also look substantially different from what we see here.
So the Alumina slide, the next one, pretty balanced, modest surplus, less than 1% of the total market is what we see here. Let’s move on to the inventory conditions.
On the left hand side here, if you look at producer inventory, import inventory all time lows. The LME stocks are leveling off and keep in mind those stocks are not freely available. Most of them are financially and logistically constrained so that is basically reducing the availability of the LME stocks and despite of the relatively high inventory.
If you look at a number that’s not on here but we showed it last time, but I’ll give it to you. The U.S. distributor stocks, all time low also continues, we continue to see a very, very low stock situation in the supply chain.
And all of that, what you can see on the right hand side leads to a very tight physical condition all over the place; Europe, Japan, U.S. Midwest, all of the regional premiums are up and some of them are substantially up. 
So one thing that is driving that is not just the physical demand, so the physical end customer demand, but it’s also the financial investors have come back. They’ve always been in our marketplace and they have come back to the marketplace. It’s also driving it, because we see quite a bit of questions around that because people that are not following this so much.
Let’s go to the next slide so that I can do a little deeper dive on that. What is the logic on the part of the financial participants? What attracts them to come into the aluminum market? One strong attraction is the strength of the forward curve which you see here on the left hand side.
It’s a simple procedure to make money here. You buy metal on spot and you sell it forward and if you have a forward curve like the one you currently have, it’s pretty straightforward. The price of the forward curve, minus the sub price minus the storage costs minus insurance, and then the price of spot. That obviously assumes that you’re not financing it. Otherwise you would actually take into account also what your financing costs are, which probably is more what most people that are getting in here also are taking into account.
On the right upper corner you see something else that’s really interesting. That shows the relative attractiveness of aluminum versus other materials. The percentage change in the forward curve shows spot to 18 months out and you can clearly see that aluminum is a fairly attractive play versus other metals.
On the right lower side, you see the total value of the LME inventories and you can play with other number too, but in reality we take that as a proxy for how deep and how liquid the market is. So what execution risk do you have? And the answer to that is, you have very, very little execution risk when you go into this financial investment.
So let’s summarize where we see ourselves coming out in 2010. What are the targets in 2010? Let’s go to procurement again, start with procurement.
We have overachieved what we set out as a target, but the critical thing is, there are quite a number of savings that we need to lock in. They don’t come usually. We need to lock those in. Second thing is, there are headwinds. I talked about the currency and energy, but as well, as the market recovers we will see price increased which we will have to compensate for which is a normal thing in some of our commodities that we buy as input factors.
We still believe with all of that together, we will be able to up the target by another $500 million for 2010 so $2.5 billion savings in 2010 in total we believe we can get.
The second category is overhead. On the overhead side, we have been able to get $400 million done this year. The number that we originally thought, we believe we can lock this savings in and make them kind of permanent and add another $100 million to it.
The sustain in CapEx that I talked about that already, $850 million is the number of sustaining CapEx that we believe we can perform on without compromising the quality of the system.
Working capital, last but not least, locking in the savings in spite of the growth environment that we will see here. We believe we can add an additional two days of working capital which ends up at $200 million of additional cash here.
So if we summarize that for 2010, how would I describe the situation for 2010? The market environment, key end markets will improve over 2009. The levels are still not at the historic norm.
The aluminum market is in a modest surplus and the currency and energy headwinds will persist. We at ALCOA will continue to pursue our path of aggressively managing our operation as I’ve just described and as we’ve shown in 2009. We will focus on strengthening the balance sheet and we will continue to optimize our business.
Let me elaborate on this; optimizing our business so that you understand. I can’t emphasize that enough. You can rest assured that in all the actions that we are taking, all the operational actions, we always have in mind where do we see true north. Where do we see the mid to long term attractiveness of our portfolio?
Our upstream behavior will continue to focus on bringing our costs down on the cost curve like we did with Brazil and like we will do in a big step with Saudi. On the mid stream side, we will focus, because the mid stream market is a more fragmented market, we will focus on the profitable global as well as regional markets, and there we will make sure that our positioning in those markets will secure the profitable performance on the long term.
On the down stream we have some additional levers we can pull because we have leadership positions which we can secure and build out by technology, via new products, via organic and well and inorganic growth and rest assured we will use all of that. That is what we have in mind here.
On the 2010 commitment numbers, the chart that you see here is a smaller version. It’s the one that I just showed you, and that is a stretch. I think all Alcoan’s know that. We have been able to show that we stick to our commitments. The track record of last year shows it very clearly.
We are able to deliver value for our shareholders and that’s the commitment for 2010 that every Alcoan basically stands by.
Thank you very much. With that, I’d like to open the line for the Q&A.

Your sales of $5.43 billion were about 15% higher than we were forecasting, a little over $700 million higher, and if you look at the primary metal segment your third party shipments surged by 26% in the quarter to 878,000 tons. This is about 193,000 higher tons than we had estimated. If you just look at your average price times those tons, you’re looking at about $460 million in extra sales and that accounted for about two-thirds of the sales difference. The surge in third party shipments of about 193,000 versus what we were looking for and then your comment in your release that you had to go out and purchase, it seemed like a very large number of tons, 207,000 tons and then resell them to satisfy customer commitments. Those purchased tons that you had to do were about 24% of your shipments in the quarter to third party. Can you go through the purchase and resale to customers and the issues I just mentioned?

If you look last quarter it was about the 70 level, so if you’re looking at a sequential change, that’s about 135. And really it comes from when we had purchase commitments in order to service that downstream business long before the economy went in the tank.
So you can look at these, the 207 was about $419 million of revenue in the quarter and you can look at those as being totally margin neutral. The other thing that you need to look at that you didn’t bring up is on the Alumna side, and we had a host of third party shipments on the Alumna side increases there, and it’s to meet customer demand.
But you’ve got to take into consideration that we’re ramping up during the quarter. We were ramping up Point Comfort on its fourth digester and we’re also ramping up Sao Luis. So when you’re doing that you’ve got higher costs so you don’t really have a lot of margin on it on a full cost basis even as can be seen by cash from operations, you’re generating a lot of cash.
So when you’re looking at that top line to the bottom line, I think you’ve got to look at both Alumina primary; adjust for the buy/resell and take into consideration that some of the tons going out to third party in the Alumina are on low margin tons on a P&L basis, and good on a cash basis.
And if you need to get into more detail than that, we’ll be glad to do it after the call.

I think that gives you a little bit of a feel for it. As I tried to say on the return mechanics pretty much get altered here if you don’t take your money but if you take money that you have been getting from someplace, then what you’ve been referring to as the interest rate becomes an issue.
So you could say obviously today it’s attractive because the financing is very, very cheap and money for such investments is available. So once the interest rate goes up, obviously you have to ask yourself what’s the logic of the interest rate going up.
The logic of the interest rate going up, if you look banks, national banks today would actually be if they are afraid that the economy has kicked in or are comfortable that the economy has kicked. I said afraid because I was just looking at China where the decision last week was the Chinese National Bank is basically bringing the interest rate up because they were afraid of an overheating of the economy.
Once that happens, that’s obviously the decision founded on real demand in addition to the financial investors coming online. So then in a way, you get a compensating effect and I think that’s what you will see here.
The other side here on the attractiveness of the market itself in terms of the size of liquidity and those type of things will remain. So that’s the view that we have on this. And the behavior of the financial investors is going to be a very, very rational behavior here.

The fundamental situation on China is that they are short on energy and that they are not an ideal place particularly for smelting. There are a lot of other opportunities for taking the power to do something else, and that’s exactly the path they’ve been following.
We’ve seen that on and on again. We’ve recently seen that they’ve been announcing that there’s no new smelter license going to be passed out for the next three years. We’ve also seen that they’ve put environmental regulations in place which will lead to a curtailment of roughly 850,000 tons over the next three years.
So that’s where we are coming from. I believe that they are going to balance the supply and demand side, so we don’t count that there’s going to be a similar amount of imports like we saw last year.
On top of it always, don’t forget the one thing that we don’t see here, it would require a totally different analysis here on top of it, China has evolved into one of the biggest buyer that you can have on this planet and we are melding that and generating new metal that’s obviously not included.

We significantly exceeded our target to be free cash flow neutral by year-end. We achieved all of our 2010 Cash Sustainability targets a year early, dramatically improved liquidity and strengthened our balance sheet. As to earnings, we've overcome significant currency and energy headwinds, weakened markets, project start up cost and unallocated fixed costs at our curtailed facilities to report our second consecutive quarter of profitability.If you noticed, I just drew a comparison between cash and earnings and if you would bear with me, I'd like to take a few minutes and elaborate on that. If you've been following us during 2009, you know we've been singularly focused on cash as a financial measure of performance. In early 2009, we were in the middle of a financial and economic crisis. Price and demand destruction was rampant. We set a aggressive cash targets and communicated these both internally and externally. The only way these targets were going to be achieved is by very aggressive and decisive actions, particularly in the manner in which we pulled back capacity and eliminated cash cost. And I'm sure everybody's aware that we did this in upstream operations, but during the course of the year, we did it in the midstream operations, we did it in the downstream operations. We have investment casting facilities taken down by 50%. We had Davenport, our largest mill in North America running at less than 70%. Shutdown Texarkana. My point is that we had to pull back capacity at many locations to meet the decreased demand. And the way we were going to manage our cash is to take all of the variable cash costs out as quick as possible. When you do that, you've got all your fixed costs and it's going to be over a lower volume and it's going to hurt profitability. But the other alternative is we could've continue to run this volume that had no demand, we would have assumed all these costs and put it in inventory and we would have much better earnings and then on a road to disaster. So let me finish by saying that we are extremely proud of the efforts in maintaining our cash and liquidity position and think, as we go through this presentation, the you'll see as it speaks for itself that we were able to achieve all these targets.So now, let's move to the fourth quarter presentation. As I noted, we achieved all of our 2010 Cash Sustainability targets in the fourth quarter, helping to produce cash from operations of $1.1 billion and free cash flow of $761 million. Disciplined capital management yielded the decline in debt of $759 million from the fourth quarter of 2008, which when we added to the increase in cash of $719 million, it resulted in a decrease in net debt of $1.5 billion. Loss from continuing operations was $266 million or $0.27 per share. And included restructuring and special items of $275 million or $0.28 per share. In a few minutes, I'll review these items in more detail.The quarter benefited from a 9% uptick in the realized price of aluminum, record production in third-party shipments in the Alumina segment and continued productivity gains related to our cash sustainability program. A weak U.S. dollar and higher energy costs negatively impacted sequential performance. On the revenues side, higher aluminum prices in margin-neutral buyer-reseller activity helped drive an 18% sequential improvement and every end market, with the exception of aerospace, commercial building and construction, and the IGT market showed a sequential increase.Let's move to the next slide and I'll talk about market activity. Markets continued to be very weak relative to last year and the sequential improvements we are experiencing are well below the historic norms. Sequential declines in the aerospace and IGT markets were driven by continued de-activity which we expect to last into the first half of 2010. Now let's move to the financials.I'll highlight key items, you have the detailed income statement in the press release. Higher realized alumina prices in buyer-reseller activity helped to drive an 18% increase in revenue sequentially. The buyer-reseller activity accounted for roughly a third of the sequential increase in revenues. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased in the quarter due to the charges related to our Italian operations and the MRN [Mineração Rio do Norte] tax settlement. Excluding those charges and the impact to e buyer-seller activity, cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 83.6%. Lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was 38.8%, bringing our operational tax rate for the year, 36.2. For' your reference, we've attached an appendix to help guide you through the full year tax rate. Going forward, we expect our ETR to be approximately 35%, however, we will continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility in our profit drivers and the overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction. Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter.This slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location and financial statements. As you'll recall, the European Commission has ruled that pricing of electricity to our Italian smelters represented inappropriate  [indiscernible]. We appealed the opening of the case by the EC and will also vigorously challenge the decision in EU courts. While there's been no indication from the Italian government on the magnitude of the drawback, we anticipate a cash payment of $300 million to $400 million in 2010. To help illustrate the impact of the Italian case on our fourth quarter financial, we have distinguished the discrete components of the charge on this slide. As you can see, Italian charges include restructuring, a deferred tax asset write-off, the drawback reserve and environmental accruals and they totally net to an impact of $0.33 per share. The other items in the quarter netted to a $0.05 per share benefit of which the majority was discrete tax items recognized for certain foreign jurisdictions. The net of these items totaled $275 million or $0.28 per share. Many of our restructuring charges this year have centered on the significant headcount reductions aimed at reducing our cost structure. Let's now review headcount reduction for the company.Our efforts to rapidly redesign operations and improve workflow have structurally reduced headcount. We have identified a total of 24,600 reductions, over 21,500 of which have been completed. These reductions contribute $325 million in cash savings in 2009 and will achieve run rate savings of $600 million. In addition, we estimate that 75% of these positions are permanent reductions and therefore, sustainable. We've also had an additional 20,000 reductions through divestitures bringing total headcount down to roughly 59,000 Alcoans. Let's now move to earnings bridges starting with the sequential bridge.This slide bridges our income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and special items. The fourth quarter benefited from a 9% increase in realized aluminum prices. Higher energy and commodity prices and the continuing weakening of the dollar in the quarter partially offset this benefit. As a reference point, fourth quarter oil prices were higher by 12%, natural gas prices up 44% and the dollar depreciated against the real by 7% and the A [American] dollar by 9%.SG&A expenses are higher in the sequential quarter, yet remain low on a percent of sales basis. As you will see in Klaus' presentation, total overhead is $412 million lower than 2008 and we anticipate improving that by another 20% in 2010. Higher depreciation of startup costs at our Brazilian operations effectively offset productivity gains generated by our Cash Sustainability efforts.Let's turn to the year-over-year bridge, which better illustrates the impact our initiatives on our bottomline. On a year-over-year basis, profitability was significantly impacted by a decline in aluminum price of 35% and double-digit declines in every end market. These significant impacts were partially offset by almost 1.5 billion of favorable productivity, energy and currency. A testament that our Cash Sustainability initiatives are having a significant and positive impact to earnings.Before we move to the segments, I'd like to call your attention to the changes we've made in the segment summaries. We've included bridges illustrating the drivers and discrete impacts for every segment. We hope this new level of transparency assists you in better understanding and assessing performance. With that said, let's go to Alumina.We set quarterly production of 3.9 million metric tons this quarter. Increases at São Luís, Point Comfort and the inclusion of a full quarter of 100% of Suriname accounted for the majority of the improvement. We also set a record in third-party shipments on strong customer demand, particularly in China. Higher volumes and an increase in third-party realized pricing of 15% drove earnings benefits of $73 million. The weakening U.S. dollar yielded negative currency effects of $30 million. You will recall that last quarter results included a $58 million gain related to the Suralco acquisition. Also the MRN partnership in which we have an equity investment settled a tax litigation matter for which we recorded a $30 million charge during the fourth quarter. Productivity gains, including the benefits of lower caustic cost, were offset by higher startup cost as we wrap up Juruti bauxite mine. Startup cost in Juruti totaled $14 million sequentially. Moving to the outlook, alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag. Lower caustic cost will flow through the system and we will continue to benefit from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. The ramp up of Juruti  in São Luís will yield increased depreciation cost of $8 million. Let's move to the Primary segment.Primary ATOI includes $273 million related to the Italian power case comprised of a drawback and higher energy cost totaling $23 million since the ruling was issued. We have filed the official documentation to begin a temporary layoff in Fusina and Portovesme. We continue to work with electricity providers and distribution companies to find an acceptable power solution and prevent a full curtailment. From an operational perspective, third-party realized alumina prices was up $383 a ton, or 9%, as alumina pricing and regional premiums continued to improve. Margin-neutral buy-resale totaled 207,000 tons during the quarter and production increased slightly. Productivity was offset by negative currency impacts of $29 million. Looking to the first quarter, our realized pricing is expected to follow a 50-day lag and we expect continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Let's go to Flat-Rolled Product segment.FRP generate $37 million in ATOI this quarter on improvement in pricing. Ongoing cash sustainability initiatives resulted in a 25% decrease in total headcount for the group for the full year. Next quarter, we expect continued gains from our cost initiatives. However, we remain cautious on the end markets, especially aerospace. While can sheet, which is a key market for us, we made some tough decisions over the past year to change our pricing strategy and to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. Metal ceilings have been eliminated and increased costs of the business are being shared with the customers to improve our profitability in the market. These decisions were not made lightly and are designed to position Alcoa more competitively in the Can Sheet business and to achieve financial returns that can support the business in the long-term. Current volume levels require some restructuring and we expect to complete headcount reductions by the end of first quarter.Now let's turn to EPS segment. Revenue declined 3% sequentially due primarily to continued weakness in the aerospace and IGT markets. Continued destocking in the aerospace supply chain drove revenues down 3% sequentially, while IGT revenues fell 16% as new projects continue to be delayed. Small gains were seen in the commercial transportation market with revenues up 7% sequentially. ATOI for the quarter of $57 million was 24% below the third quarter partly driven by the revenue declines in our two key markets. The market conditions for the segment are anticipated to remain challenging for the first quarter with respect to both mix and demand, the impact of which will be partially mitigated by productivity improvements.Let's now move to my favorite, the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we produced cash from operations of $1.1 billion, our best performance since the second quarter 2007. Working capital generated $522 million in the quarter as continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives more than offset the impact of higher LME prices. Roughly 90% of the working capital reductions are structural in nature, driven by a 10-day decline in days working capital since the fourth quarter of 2008. The other adjustments line includes the add back of the non-cash charges in the quarter. CapEx totaled $363 million as we deferred nonessential capital in Brazil into 2010. For the year, growth CapEx accounted for 68% of our total spend of $1.6 billion. Our three major growth projects Juruti, São Luís and Estreito comprised 75% of the gross spend. Free cash flow of $761 million marked the highest free cash flow generation since the second quarter of 2003. All of our cash sustainability initiatives in 2009 were centered on driving cash flows and strengthening Alcoa. Let's move to the next Slide to put our performance in the proper perspective.We've acted swiftly in the downturn to secure Alcoa's liquidity putting forth our holistic solution of both operational financial initiatives. We've been relentless in executing this plan in 2009 saving $2.4 billion total cost. These savings are hitting the bottomline as evidenced by our second consecutive quarter of profitability and our full-year cash generation. To put our current position into perspective, let's look back at the beginning of 2009. In the first two months of 2009, we generated a negative free cash flow of $1 billion. Over the next 10 months of the year our initiatives drove free cash flow generation of $750 million, bringing full-year cash flow to a negative $257 million, an outstanding outcome and further evidence of our success in executing our Cash Sustainability Program. We also improved liquidity and reduced debt by $759 million. In fact, net debt for the company declined by $1.5 billion in '09, an if we were to use the $1 billion excess cash to pay down debt, our debt-to-cap would fall to 31%.And we are not done. The combination of current metal, currency and energy factors and the continued execution of our Cash Sustainability initiatives would help draw a far better performance in 2010. In summary, our progress is an undeniably strong response to the weak market environment we experienced in 2009 and a testament to the enthusiasm every Alcoan exhibits in strengthening our company and creating value for our stakeholders. I'd now like to turn it over to Klaus."

Looking at our Q4 numbers and reviewing 2009, let me say I'm really pleased with the performance and this was only possible because literally, every Alcoan has been shipping in. Let's review the 2009 first. Well it was a very challenging environment. We had a historically not seen price decline, 60% decline in less than five months and we had a broad-based demand destruction in our end markets. At the same time, the challenge has brought the best out in Alcoa, we have responded very, very early. As many of you may remember, we've put this together in a holistic solution, which we call the Cash Sustainability Program, Chuck already referred to it. Cash was target that we had been aiming at and you can see the results and I'll be going through that. We've summarized that in what you can see here in the middle in our seven promises, this became our mantra or our playbook that pretty much every employee in Alcoa was following. And if you look at the deliveries, you can see that we really delivered on all those promises: Best ever safety performance, exceeded our cash targets, continued growth, repower a lot of our smelters, free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of '09, which we promised, but I guess that number is a number that -- none of us was having in mind when we made that promise, way overshot it, we strengthened our liquidity. So that's the summary. Let's go through some of the details so you get a feel for it. In spite of all the economic pressures, we have not compromised our values. We in fact, live them everyday and we are very proud of the achievement, particularly in an environment like the environment last year. We have had our best ever safety performance. You can see that on the left-hand side here of the slide, in the Total Recordable Incident Rate for instance, up 9% relative to last year. All the lost work the insurance rate up 7% versus last year's. But to make it more tangible, 74% of all of our facilities had no loss workday incidents in the last year. Or to make it even clearer, an Alcoa employee working anywhere in the global organization, is 4x safer than an employee in the U.S. industrial company. And obviously, this doesn't go unnoticed, we received quite a bit of recognition. Made it to Fortune Most Admired again, Dow Jones Sustainability Index's eighth consecutive year, been in that. The World Economic Forum Global 100, or the Brazilian Magazine their leading business publication exam. All of those awarded us and we are also particularly proud given the importance of this for our industry that we helped launch the USCAP [United States Climate Action Partnership] and going after a carbon emission training and emission capturing. So all of these, I think, is a clear testament that we are not only managing our bottomline, but we are also managing our bottomline. And let's go to the next slide and start to go through the specifics there.Procurement. On the procurement, this is certainly the biggest bucket that we had and also that we showed in the commitment. We actually said that we wanted to reduce the procurement costs by $2 billion until 2010. We said $1.5 billion, we'd be able to achieve in 2009 and look where we are here on the right-hand side. The actual, is actually around $1.998 billion. You can clearly see we are really one year ahead with the execution. To get there, we really have to use every lever. We expanded our supplier base, we changed specifications, we've actually broken pricing conventions and I could go on, and on and on. We really had to pull every lever, but the success was on our side. I'm particularly proud of this because at the same time, it wasn't like we had all the wins helping us here. We had quite a bit of headwinds, particularly on the rising currency levels as well as the energy prices. And still, we've been able to overcome those challenges and come out with that performance. Let's go to the next one, the overhead cost.On the overhead cost, we did something pretty simple. We said we'd do a haircut 20% on all the overhead costs, so that lead us to the target of $400 million. We wanted to have 50% of that in 2009 and look at where we are here on the right-hand side. Same pattern then on the slide before, $412 million reduced overhead costs. So again, a year ahead and all of that was only possible because of a rapid reduction in costs, personnel, travel, consulting, those type of things.Let's go to the CapEx side. On the CapEx, many of you follow Alcoa know we are coming out of  time where we've done a lot of investments. And that is what you see here on the left-hand side, the $3.4 billion of CapEx investments in 2008. When we face the crisis, we said we're going to cut that down and came out with a target of $1.8 billion. And in reality what we have we achieved, we achieved $1.622 billion CapEx spend. But that was only possible because we aggressively managed the spend and we delayed spend to overcome also the additional currency headwinds of the total magnitude in CapEx alone, $250 million in 2009. So that's what led to that.Now we also said that we will be able to bring down the sustaining CapEx down to a level of $850 million and we'll be able to run that through without compromising the quality of the system. And if you take that on the right-hand side here and add into it the remaining from the Brazilian projects plus the new Saudi project, plus then the sustaining CapEx, you end up with a target of 1.250. So I think that's a pretty good achievement.Working capital at the last point there, important spend category. So what did we do there? On the right-hand side you can see, we came out with a target for 2009 of $800 million. And what did we achieve? we achieved $1.3 billion of spend reduction. There's a significant particularly as we have been facing during that period in 2009 the rising level of alumina prices, which obviously the second half particularly, which obviously makes it more difficult to achieve those numbers.If I were to summarize the performance in simple terms, I would say we -- again, if you looked at the performance against the Cash Sustainability Program targets, and many of you had a chance to discuss those ones when we did our equity raise with Chuck and myself, and there were a lot of people that said, ""Wow, this is a very, very aggressive plan."" And I agree, it was a very aggressive plan. The performance here has been exceptional, driving up the cost and compensating for the substantial headwinds and currency as well as energy. And I am very, very sure that we really improved the cash generation capability and capabilities to bring cost savings to the bottom line.The next slide, I want to stop here for a second because so far, I've been talking about the operational improvement. And that is very, very good. But that's only one side of what we have been doing. The other thing is, we've been looking at improving our strategic position. Improving on how we can perform going forward. And sometimes, you have the impression when you go to a year like 2009, as though you are totally occupied in getting all the savings done. As much as we have been focusing on that, our eye continued to be on true North. Where is the right strategic positioning? And we did not let go on those ones. We continue to execute on those ones equally well than on the operational ones. Let's review those because the year has a lot of months, a lot of days and sometimes you forget what happened during all the year. So let's start with the left box, the portfolio box. We've really optimized the portfolio for liquidity and growth. Let me just mention the big items, and there have been other smaller ones. Shining Prospect, the AEES investment -- for those that don't follow us that much, that was the automotive business investment. The Norway Smelter swap cashed a swap against our Sapa assets. Surinam Refinery buying out minority position from BHP. If you look at that left hand box and look at where we are today, 9% [ph] of the businesses that we have today are in a number one or number two competitive position.Let's go to the second box. Obviously, you all know that when it comes to the smelting system, energy cost is the most important factor and long-term supply of competitive energy is the most important factor. And again, we have continued to focus on that to strengthen our competitiveness in this. Today, we have 85% of all smelting systems powered through minimum 20-25. There are in fact quite a number of those that have contracts that go further out in 2025. And then on the right-hand side, on the right-hand side box, I think there are a lot of Alcoans who are particularly proud of that because that talks about the organic growth and that obviously takes a lot of people to get that thing done. We have brought online our new bauxite mine in the Amazon, in Juruti. And we've also brought online the respective refinery in São Luís. Both of those activities in Brazil are going to substantially improve our cost position of the refining system. It's going to bring us down, Alcoa in total down five percentage points on the refining cost, of the worldwide cost curve. So with that, Alcoa as a refining system is now positioned in the lowest quartile of the cost curve, one of the best moves that we could actually make.Then on the right-hand side, left corner, so to say, Bohai in China. We brought online our Bohai facility. And this is very soon going to replace a lot of the imported lithographic sheet that China today has. Samara, one of our Russian facilities, we actually ramped up the can, sheet and tap manufacturing there. We are the only producer of that product in Russia and we're not stopping there. Just a little before the holidays, we announced our new joint venture with Saudi Arabia. Let's go to that.I know that many of you have certainly read the press release. But I still want to spend a little time because this is really, really important. And an important move for Alcoa's primary system. This is, I would say, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Alcoa, for Ma'aden, our partner, as well as for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We're talking about an investment in total of $10.8 billion. Alcoa and partners have 40% in there. Alcoa's investment is about $900 million over a period of four years and we expect this to be funded basically with the free cash flow of Alcoa.It's the lowest cost production complex in the world and I will give you some more details on that. The world's most efficient integrated aluminum complex utilizes fully developed infrastructure, the lowest Alcoa's refining and Smelting position, it offers expansion opportunities and it gives us a very strong footprint in a fast-growing region.Let's take a look at some more details here on the Ma'aden joint venture. As I said, it encompasses bauxite mine, a refinery, a smelter and a rolling mill. And all together, in pretty strong proximity. The bauxite mine, 4 million tons annually, directly aligned to the refinery. Refinery, located in Raz Az Zawr, 1.8 million tons annually and the design is built for expansion options.Smelter co-located to the refinery, 740,000 tons annually. Also optionality for expansion. And the rolling mill co-located to the smelter, up to 460,000 tons on the hot mill. And basically all of that, particularly the refining, smelter and rolling mill utilizes the Raz Az Zawr new port. I forgot to mention it's right on the water. So it utilizes a new port. It utilizes also 2,500-megawatt gas-fired power plant that is currently getting erected there. And it all utilizes the railway connection right out to the mine. The smelter and the rolling mill will be operational in 2013.All that together, and I assume you would agree with that gives us a unique opportunity to bring our costs down and build a super low-cost aluminum production complex.So let's go to the most important thing. As a conclusion from all the things that we've done last year, as I've said, we've really focused on cash and on cash alone. We've improved our cash position and we strengthened our balance sheet and strengthened also our strategic position as I just said. Let's look at the left box here, which shows the free cash flow broken down by quarters. We can clearly see that's an outstanding performance. We are exceeding our targets in regards to free cash flow and free cash flow neutral by the end of the last year. In fact, we have had, as Chuck pointed out, $761 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. And that's a very, very good performance.If you look at the free cash flow improvements at the right-hand side here, if you look at the free cash flow improvements over the year, this allowed us to fund the growth and to end the year with a $1.5 billion cash balance. And to bring the debt-to-cap down by 3.9 points year-on-year, which brings it down from 42.5 to 38.6.Our actions all significantly improved our cash generation as well as our balance sheet. And we have all intentions to remain on that path in 2010. Before I talk about 2010, let's go to the end markets and see how the end markets are performing. So global Aerospace, let's start with that. Large commercial aircraft. We expect deliveries to decline. The airlines continued to be challenged. They are projected to lose $11 billion in 2009 and another $6 billion in 2010. New orders fell pretty drastically to roughly 300 from 1,400 in 2008. If you go to regional business, the market experienced significant reductions in orders as well as in deliveries. While we continue to see destocking across the supply chain and that obviously is most important to our profitability short term. Let me add to that one thing for those who don't follow that market so strongly. If you take the two big players, Boeing and Airbus, alone, you always have to keep in mind with all the things that I've just been saying, that there continues to be a six-year auto backlog. And unlike in the last aviation cycles, the production has not been ramped up. So there's a lot of respected analysts that believe that this backlog can tie the companies over until the orders recover. And also, if we look at air travel, it's gradually ticking up during the past 12 months. And we believe that this is probably not going to drive new build. But what it's certainly going to drive is at least spare parts utilization. So there is also some potentially good news in that year.Automotive. Production expected to rebound in 2010 by about 8% to 60.8 million vehicles. The VW stocking, which was expected to happen in the second half of '09 and is largely completed. Inventories are back to normal levels. It's important to recall that sales and production, even though they improved, are obviously well below the peak levels of 2007. For instance, we're talking about 11% still below the 2007 level. But all regions are expected to show improvements, except Europe. And then Europe is simply an impact of the prolonged and strong government stimulus program that we saw in 2009. Heavy truck and trailer, in general expected the build rates to rise by 10%, we're talking about 1.2 million units. It's well below historic norms. North America for instance, if you take that, we expect 2010 to have a plus 5% increase to 125,000 units. The historic norm is about 225,000 units.If you look at the U.S. and new EPA 2010 diesel emissions standards has created a modest boost here of about 10,000 units.We would see that the flat to minimal growth of North America and Europe in freight shipments and the overcapacity will continue to create some downward pressure on this market.The average can market, we continue to see a trend flat to slightly higher. Commercial building and construction, we expect a decline of 25 plus percent. Leading indicators like contract awarded, architectural billings show that trend. On the industrial gas turbine side, there are a couple of factors -- three factors in fact. Reduced energy demand, the International Energy Agency forecast about 93.5% for 2009. That's the first worldwide reduction in 65 years. The challenge project financing and the uncertainty of the cost around carbon legislation. That actually has an upside in there because gas turbines only have half of the emission of coal-fired power generation.  So this could give an advantage depending on where those cards fall. To sum it all up, we expect to see a relative improvement in 2009 but the levels are below the historic norms, but they are up.If you now fold that into the projection on aluminum, that's what you see here on that slide. And we believe that all of this is going to drive a pretty substantial growth of aluminum in 2010, 10% growth on 2010. And you can see already when you look at that chart here, the major driver of this growth is China. And if you subtract China from that, you still end up with 5% growth overall, which is still a good, good growth number that we're going to see, driven by places like India, Brazil, and Asia in general.Let's go to the next slide, which shows the supply-demand relations. Let's start with aluminum. We'll see here that we expect a surplus of about 1.2 million tons if you add the surplus here on the China side, as well as on the western world side 3.5 [ph]  to 9 25.Let's go to China side. China moves to a modest surplus but significantly reduces imports. Last year the imports added up to about $1.5 million tons. We believe that China will continue to manage the capacity, as well as the demand very well and will stay in balance. After all, the surplus that we see here, we believe it's going to be fairly temporary. On the western world side, we believe that this is a reflection of the greenfields smelter [ph] in the Middle East and India coming online, what we added in a total for that is about 740,000 tons over the year. What is not built in here in our view are outages, as well as high energy costs that may lead to curtailment in places like Venezuela and India.Let's go to the total surplus here of $1.2 million, as I mentioned. Just to give you a reference, this equals two weeks of consumption. So relatively manageable for the global industry.Our view is not taking into account potential restocking of the supply chain. And if that were to happen, the right side also would look substantially different from what we see here. So the alumina site, as the next one, pretty balanced, modest surplus, less than 1% of the total market. That's all we see here.Let's move on to the inventory conditions. On the left-hand side here, if you look at producer inventory, Davenport inventory, all-time lows. The LME stocks are leveling off and keep in mind, those stocks are not freely available. Most of them are financially and logistically constrained. So that is basically reducing the availability of the LME stocks, and despite of the relatively high inventory. If you look at a number that's not on here -- we showed it last time, but I'll give it to you. The U.S. distributor stocks, all-time low. Also, we continue to see a very, very low stock situation in the supply chain.In all of that, what you can see on the right-hand side leads to a very tight physical condition all over the place. Europe, Japan, U.S. Midwest, all of the many regional premiums are up and some of them substantially up. So one thing that is driving that is not just the physical demand so the physical and customer demand. But it's also the financial investors have come back. They've always been in our market place and they have come back to the market place. That's also driving it because we receive quite a bit of questions around that from people that are not following this so much. Let's go to the next slide so that I can do a little deeper dive on that.So what is the logic of the financial participants? What attracts them to come into the aluminum market? One strong attraction is the strength of the foreword curve, what you see here on the left-hand side. And it's a simple procedure to make money here. You buy metal on spot and you sell it forward. And if you have a forward curve, I think forward curve like the one you currently have. It's a pretty straightforward return mechanics, the price of the forward curve minus the sub-price, minus storage cost, minus insurance and then the price on spot. That obviously assumes that you're not financing, because otherwise you would actually take into account also what your financing costs are, which is probably is more what most people that are getting in here are also taking into account.On the right upper corner, you see something else that's pretty interesting that shows the relative attractiveness of aluminum versus other materials. The percentage change on the foreword curve, which shows spot to 18 months out. And you can clearly really see that aluminum is a fairly attractive play versus other metals. On the right lower side, you see the total value of the LME inventories. And you can play with other numbers too. But in reality, we take that as a proxy for how deep and how liquid is the market. So what execution risk do you have, and the answer to that is you have a very, very little execution risk when you go into this financial investment.So let's summarize where we see ourselves coming out in 2010. What other targets in 2010. So, let's go to a procurement again, start with procurement. We have overachieved what we set as a target. Critical thing is, there are a quite a number of savings that we need to lock in. They don't come usually. We need to lock those in. The second thing is there are headwinds. I talked about at currency, as well as energy. But as well, as the market recovers, we will see price increases, which we will have to compensate for, which is a normal thing in some of our commodities than we buy as input factors. We still believe, with all of that together, we will be able to up the target by another 500 million for 2010. So 2.5 billion savings in 2010 in total we believe we can get.Second category is overhead. On the overhead side, we have been able to get 400 million done this year, the number we originally thought, two-year number. We believe we can lock these savings in and make them kind of permanent and add another 100 million to it. The sustain in CapEx side, I've talked about that already, $850 million is the number of sustaining CapEx that we believe we can perform on without compromising the quality of the system. Working capital, last but not least, locking in the savings in spite of the growth environment that we won't see here. We believe we can add an additional two days of working capital, which will end up with 200 million of additional cash here. So if we summarize that all for 2010, how would I describe the situation for 2010?The market environment, key end markets, will improve versus 2009, the levels are still not at the historic norms. The aluminum market is in a modest surplus and the currency and energy headwinds will persist. We at Alcoa will continue to pursue our path of aggressively managing our operations as I just described. And as we've shown in 2009, we will focus on strengthening the balance sheet and we will continue to optimize on our business.Let me elaborate on this, optimizing our business, so that you understand. I can't emphasize that enough. You can rest assured that in all the actions we are taking, all the operational actions, we always have in mind where do we see true north? Where do we see the mid- to long-term attractiveness of our portfolio? Our upstream behavior will continue to focus on bringing our costs down on the cost curve, right? Like we did with Iceland, like we did with Brazil and like we will do in a big step with Saudi. On the midstream side, we will focus -- because the midstream market is a more fragmented market. We will focus on the profitable global, as well as regional markets. And there, we will make sure that our positioning in those markets will secure profitable the performance on the long-term.On the downstream, we have some additional levers we can pull. Because we have leadership positions which we can secure and build out via technology, via new products, via organic, as well as inorganic growth. And rest assured, we will use all of that. That is what we have in mind here.On the 2010 commitment numbers, the chart that you see here is the smaller version, is the one that I just showed you. And that is a stretch, I think all Alcoans know that. We have been able to show that we stick to our commitments. The track record of last year shows it very clearly. We are able to deliver value for our shareholders. And that's a commitment for 2010 that every Alcoan basically stands by. Thank you very much. With that, I'd like to open the line for the Q&A."

And then your comment in your release that you had to go out and purchase, it seems like a very large number of tons, 207,000 tons. And then resell them to satisfy customer commitments.

And really, it comes from when we had purchase commitments in order to service our downstream businesses long before the economy went in the tank. So you can look at these, the 207 [207,000] was about $490 million worth of revenue in the quarter and you can look those as being totally margin-neutral.The other thing that you need to look at that you didn't bring up is on the alumina side. And that we had a host of third-party shipments on the alumina side increases there and is to meet customer demand. But you got to take it into consideration that we're ramping up during the quarter. We were ramping up point comfort on it's fourth divesture [ph]. And we're also ramping up São Luís. So when you're doing that you've got higher costs so you don't really have a lot of margin on it on a full cost basis even though as can be seen by cash from operations, you're generating a lot of cash. So when you're looking at that top line to the bottom line, I think you got to look at both alumina and primary, adjust for the buy resell and take into consideration that some of the tons going out to third party on the alumina are on low-margin tons on a P&L basis and good on a cash basis.

That would give you the better model for looking to what you can expect in 2010."

I think that gives you a little bit of a feel for it. As I try to say on the return mechanics, I mean the return mechanics pretty much get altered here if you don't take your money, but if you take money that you have been getting from some place. And then what you've been referring to is the interest rate becomes an issue. So you could say, once the interest -- obviously today, it's attractive because of financing is very, very cheap and money for such investment is available. So once the interest rate goes up, obviously you have to ask yourself what's the logic of the interest rate going up? The logic of the interest rate going up, I mean if  you look at -- if you look at banks, I mean national banks today would actually be if they are afraid that the economy has kicked in or if the comfortable that the economy has kicked in. I said afraid because I was just looking at China where the decision last week was the Chinese National Bank basically brings the interest up because they were afraid of an overheating of the economy. Once that happens, that's obviously the decision levels [ph] we founded on real demand in addition to the financial investors coming online. So then in a way, you get a compensating effect and I think that's what you will see here. The other side here on the attractiveness of the market itself in terms of the size, liquidity and those types of things will remain. So that's the view that we have on those.

And then there's a lot of other opportunities for taking the power to do something else and that's exactly the path that they have been following. We've seen that on and on, and on again. We've recently seen that they've been announcing that there's no new smelter licensed going to be passed out for the next three years. We've also seen that they put environmental regulations in place which will lead to a curtailment of roughly 850,000 tons over the next three years. So that's where we are coming from.

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and the appendix in today's presentation and on our website at www.alcoa.com under the Invest section. Now I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."

We significantly exceeded our target to be free cash flow neutral by year-end. We achieved all of our 2010 Cash Sustainability targets a year early, dramatically improved liquidity and strengthened our balance sheet. As to earnings, we've overcome significant currency and energy headwinds, weakened markets, project start up cost and unallocated fixed costs at our curtailed facilities to report our second consecutive quarter of profitability.If you noticed, I just drew a comparison between cash and earnings and if you would bear with me, I'd like to take a few minutes and elaborate on that. If you've been following us during 2009, you know we've been singularly focused on cash as a financial measure of performance. In early 2009, we were in the middle of a financial and economic crisis. Price and demand destruction was rampant. We set a aggressive cash targets and communicated these both internally and externally. The only way these targets were going to be achieved is by very aggressive and decisive actions, particularly in the manner in which we pulled back capacity and eliminated cash cost. And I'm sure everybody's aware that we did this in upstream operations, but during the course of the year, we did it in the midstream operations, we did it in the downstream operations. We have investment casting facilities taken down by 50%. We had Davenport, our largest mill in North America running at less than 70%. Shutdown Texarkana. My point is that we had to pull back capacity at many locations to meet the decreased demand. And the way we were going to manage our cash is to take all of the variable cash costs out as quick as possible. When you do that, you've got all your fixed costs and it's going to be over a lower volume and it's going to hurt profitability. But the other alternative is we could've continue to run this volume that had no demand, we would have assumed all these costs and put it in inventory and we would have much better earnings and then on a road to disaster. So let me finish by saying that we are extremely proud of the efforts in maintaining our cash and liquidity position and think, as we go through this presentation, the you'll see as it speaks for itself that we were able to achieve all these targets.So now, let's move to the fourth quarter presentation. As I noted, we achieved all of our 2010 Cash Sustainability targets in the fourth quarter, helping to produce cash from operations of $1.1 billion and free cash flow of $761 million. Disciplined capital management yielded the decline in debt of $759 million from the fourth quarter of 2008, which when we added to the increase in cash of $719 million, it resulted in a decrease in net debt of $1.5 billion. Loss from continuing operations was $266 million or $0.27 per share. And included restructuring and special items of $275 million or $0.28 per share. In a few minutes, I'll review these items in more detail.The quarter benefited from a 9% uptick in the realized price of aluminum, record production in third-party shipments in the Alumina segment and continued productivity gains related to our cash sustainability program. A weak U.S. dollar and higher energy costs negatively impacted sequential performance. On the revenues side, higher aluminum prices in margin-neutral buyer-reseller activity helped drive an 18% sequential improvement and every end market, with the exception of aerospace, commercial building and construction, and the IGT market showed a sequential increase.Let's move to the next slide and I'll talk about market activity. Markets continued to be very weak relative to last year and the sequential improvements we are experiencing are well below the historic norms. Sequential declines in the aerospace and IGT markets were driven by continued de-activity which we expect to last into the first half of 2010. Now let's move to the financials.I'll highlight key items, you have the detailed income statement in the press release. Higher realized alumina prices in buyer-reseller activity helped to drive an 18% increase in revenue sequentially. The buyer-reseller activity accounted for roughly a third of the sequential increase in revenues. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased in the quarter due to the charges related to our Italian operations and the MRN [Mineração Rio do Norte] tax settlement. Excluding those charges and the impact to e buyer-seller activity, cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 83.6%. Lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was 38.8%, bringing our operational tax rate for the year, 36.2. For' your reference, we've attached an appendix to help guide you through the full year tax rate. Going forward, we expect our ETR to be approximately 35%, however, we will continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility in our profit drivers and the overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction. Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter.This slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location and financial statements. As you'll recall, the European Commission has ruled that pricing of electricity to our Italian smelters represented inappropriate [indiscernible]. We appealed the opening of the case by the EC and will also vigorously challenge the decision in EU courts. While there's been no indication from the Italian government on the magnitude of the drawback, we anticipate a cash payment of $300 million to $400 million in 2010. To help illustrate the impact of the Italian case on our fourth quarter financial, we have distinguished the discrete components of the charge on this slide. As you can see, Italian charges include restructuring, a deferred tax asset write-off, the drawback reserve and environmental accruals and they totally net to an impact of $0.33 per share. The other items in the quarter netted to a $0.05 per share benefit of which the majority was discrete tax items recognized for certain foreign jurisdictions. The net of these items totaled $275 million or $0.28 per share. Many of our restructuring charges this year have centered on the significant headcount reductions aimed at reducing our cost structure. Let's now review headcount reduction for the company.Our efforts to rapidly redesign operations and improve workflow have structurally reduced headcount. We have identified a total of 24,600 reductions, over 21,500 of which have been completed. These reductions contribute $325 million in cash savings in 2009 and will achieve run rate savings of $600 million. In addition, we estimate that 75% of these positions are permanent reductions and therefore, sustainable. We've also had an additional 20,000 reductions through divestitures bringing total headcount down to roughly 59,000 Alcoans. Let's now move to earnings bridges starting with the sequential bridge.This slide bridges our income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and special items. The fourth quarter benefited from a 9% increase in realized aluminum prices. Higher energy and commodity prices and the continuing weakening of the dollar in the quarter partially offset this benefit. As a reference point, fourth quarter oil prices were higher by 12%, natural gas prices up 44% and the dollar depreciated against the real by 7% and the A [American] dollar by 9%.SG&A expenses are higher in the sequential quarter, yet remain low on a percent of sales basis. As you will see in Klaus' presentation, total overhead is $412 million lower than 2008 and we anticipate improving that by another 20% in 2010. Higher depreciation of startup costs at our Brazilian operations effectively offset productivity gains generated by our Cash Sustainability efforts.Let's turn to the year-over-year bridge, which better illustrates the impact our initiatives on our bottomline. On a year-over-year basis, profitability was significantly impacted by a decline in aluminum price of 35% and double-digit declines in every end market. These significant impacts were partially offset by almost 1.5 billion of favorable productivity, energy and currency. A testament that our Cash Sustainability initiatives are having a significant and positive impact to earnings.Before we move to the segments, I'd like to call your attention to the changes we've made in the segment summaries. We've included bridges illustrating the drivers and discrete impacts for every segment. We hope this new level of transparency assists you in better understanding and assessing performance. With that said, let's go to Alumina.We set quarterly production of 3.9 million metric tons this quarter. Increases at São Luís, Point Comfort and the inclusion of a full quarter of 100% of Suriname accounted for the majority of the improvement. We also set a record in third-party shipments on strong customer demand, particularly in China. Higher volumes and an increase in third-party realized pricing of 15% drove earnings benefits of $73 million. The weakening U.S. dollar yielded negative currency effects of $30 million. You will recall that last quarter results included a $58 million gain related to the Suralco acquisition. Also the MRN partnership in which we have an equity investment settled a tax litigation matter for which we recorded a $30 million charge during the fourth quarter. Productivity gains, including the benefits of lower caustic cost, were offset by higher startup cost as we wrap up Juruti bauxite mine. Startup cost in Juruti totaled $14 million sequentially. Moving to the outlook, alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag. Lower caustic cost will flow through the system and we will continue to benefit from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. The ramp up of Juruti  in São Luís will yield increased depreciation cost of $8 million. Let's move to the Primary segment.Primary ATOI includes $273 million related to the Italian power case comprised of a drawback and higher energy cost totaling $23 million since the ruling was issued. We have filed the official documentation to begin a temporary layoff in Fusina and Portovesme. We continue to work with electricity providers and distribution companies to find an acceptable power solution and prevent a full curtailment. From an operational perspective, third-party realized alumina prices was up $383 a ton, or 9%, as alumina pricing and regional premiums continued to improve. Margin-neutral buy-resale totaled 207,000 tons during the quarter and production increased slightly. Productivity was offset by negative currency impacts of $29 million. Looking to the first quarter, our realized pricing is expected to follow a 50-day lag and we expect continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Let's go to Flat-Rolled Product segment.FRP generate $37 million in ATOI this quarter on improved mix and pricing. Ongoing cash sustainability initiatives resulted in a 25% decrease in total headcount for the group for the full year. Next quarter, we expect continued gains from our cost initiatives. However, we remain cautious on the end markets, especially aerospace. While can sheet, which is a key market for us, we made some tough decisions over the past year to change our pricing strategy and to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. Metal ceilings have been eliminated and increased costs of the business are being shared with the customers to improve our profitability in the market. These decisions were not made lightly and are designed to position Alcoa more competitively in the Can Sheet business and to achieve financial returns that can support the business in the long-term. Current volume levels require some restructuring and we expect to complete headcount reductions by the end of first quarter.Now let's turn to EPS segment. Revenue declined 3% sequentially due primarily to continued weakness in the aerospace and IGT markets. Continued destocking in the aerospace supply chain drove revenues down 3% sequentially, while IGT revenues fell 16% as new projects continue to be delayed. Small gains were seen in the commercial transportation market with revenues up 7% sequentially. ATOI for the quarter of $57 million was 24% below the third quarter, primarily driven by the revenue declines in our two key markets. The market conditions for the segment are anticipated to remain challenging for the first quarter with respect to both mix and demand, the impact of which will be partially mitigated by productivity improvements.Let's now move to my favorite, the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we produced cash from operations of $1.1 billion, our best performance since the second quarter 2007. Working capital generated $522 million in the quarter as continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives more than offset the impact of higher LME prices. Roughly 90% of the working capital reductions are structural in nature, driven by a 10-day decline in days working capital since the fourth quarter of 2008. The other adjustments line includes the add back of the non-cash charges in the quarter. CapEx totaled $363 million as we deferred nonessential capital in Brazil into 2010. For the year, growth CapEx accounted for 68% of our total spend of $1.6 billion. Our three major growth projects Juruti, São Luís and Estreito comprised 75% of the gross spend. Free cash flow of $761 million marked the highest free cash flow generation since the second quarter of 2003. All of our cash sustainability initiatives in 2009 were centered on driving cash flows and strengthening Alcoa. Let's move to the next Slide to put our performance in the proper perspective.We've acted swiftly in the downturn to secure Alcoa's liquidity, putting forth our holistic solution of both operational and financial initiatives. We've been relentless in executing this plan in 2009 saving $2.4 billion in total cost. These savings are hitting the bottomline as evidenced by our second consecutive quarter of profitability and our full-year cash generation. To put our current position into perspective, let's look back at the beginning of 2009. In the first two months of 2009, we generated a negative free cash flow of $1 billion. Over the next 10 months of the year our initiatives drove free cash flow generation of $750 million, bringing full-year cash flow to a negative $257 million, an outstanding outcome and further evidence of our success in executing our Cash Sustainability Program. We also improved liquidity and reduced debt by $759 million. In fact, net debt for the company declined by $1.5 billion in '09, and if we were to use the $1 billion in excess cash to pay down debt, our debt-to-cap would fall to 36.1%.And we are not done. The combination of current metal, currency and energy factors and the continued execution of our Cash Sustainability initiatives would help draw a far better performance in 2010. In summary, our progress is an undeniably strong response to the weak market environment we experienced in 2009 and a testament to the enthusiasm every Alcoan exhibits in strengthening our company and creating value for our stakeholders. I'd now like to turn it over to Klaus."

Let",4411,"Well thank you very much, Chuck, and welcome everybody who's on the call. Looking at our Q4 numbers and reviewing 2009, let me say I'm really pleased with the performance and this was only possible because literally, every Alcoan has been chipping in. Let's review the 2009 first. Well it was a very challenging environment. We had a historically not seen price decline, 60% decline in less than five months and we had a broad-based demand destruction in our end markets. At the same time, the challenge has brought the best out in Alcoa, we have responded very, very early. As many of you may remember, we've put this together in a holistic solution, which we call the Cash Sustainability Program, Chuck already referred to it. Cash was target that we had been aiming at and you can see the results and I'll be going through that. We've summarized that in what you can see here in the middle in our seven promises, this became our mantra or our playbook that pretty much every employee in Alcoa was following. And if you look at the deliveries, you can see that we really delivered on all those promises: Best ever safety performance, exceeded our cash targets, continued growth, repower a lot of our smelters, free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of '09, which we promised, but I guess that number is a number that -- none of us was having in mind when we made that promise, way overshot it, we strengthened our liquidity. So that's the summary. Let's go through some of the details so you get a feel for it. In spite of all the economic pressures, we have not compromised our values. We in fact, live them everyday and we are very proud of the achievement, particularly in an environment like the environment last year. We have had our best ever safety performance. You can see that on the left-hand side here of the slide, in the Total Recordable Incident Rate for instance, up 9% relative to last year. All the lost work the insurance rate up 7% versus last year's. But to make it more tangible, 74% of all of our facilities had no loss workday incidents in the last year. Or to make it even clearer, an Alcoa employee working anywhere in the global organization, is 4x safer than an employee in the U.S. industrial company. And obviously, this doesn't go unnoticed, we received quite a bit of recognition. Made it to the Fortune Most Admired again, Dow Jones Sustainability Index's eighth consecutive year, been in that. The World Economic Forum Global 100, or the Brazilian Magazine, their leading business publication exam. All of those awarded us and we are also particularly proud given the importance of this for our industry that we helped launch the USCAP [United States Climate Action Partnership] and going after a carbon emission training and emission capturing. So all of these, I think, is a clear testament that we are not only managing our bottomline, but we are also managing our bottomline. And let's go to the next slide and start to go through the specifics there.Procurement. On the procurement, this is certainly the biggest bucket that we had and also that we showed in the commitment. We actually said that we wanted to reduce the procurement costs by $2 billion until 2010. We said $1.5 billion, we'd be able to achieve in 2009 and look where we are here on the right-hand side. The actual, is actually around $1.998 billion. You can clearly see we are really one year ahead with the execution. To get there, we really have to use every lever. We expanded our supplier base, we changed specifications, we've actually broken pricing conventions and I could go on, and on and on. We really had to pull every lever, but the success was on our side. I'm particularly proud of this because at the same time, it wasn't like we had all the wins helping us here. We had quite a bit of headwinds, particularly on the rising currency levels as well as the energy prices. And still, we've been able to overcome those challenges and come out with that performance. Let's go to the next one, the overhead cost.On the overhead cost, we did something pretty simple. We said we'd do a haircut 20% on all the overhead costs, so that lead us to the target of $400 million. We wanted to have 50% of that in 2009 and look at where we are here on the right-hand side. Same pattern then on the slide before, $412 million reduced overhead costs. So again, a year ahead and all of that was only possible because of a rapid reduction in costs, personnel, travel, consulting, those type of things.Let's go to the CapEx side. On the CapEx, many of you follow Alcoa know we are coming out of  time where we've done a lot of investments. And that is what you see here on the left-hand side, the $3.4 billion of CapEx investments in 2008. When we face the crisis, we said we're going to cut that down and came out with a target of $1.8 billion. And in reality what we have we achieved, we achieved $1.622 billion CapEx spend. But that was only possible because we aggressively managed the spend and we delayed spend to overcome also the additional currency headwinds of the total magnitude in CapEx alone, $250 million in 2009. So that's what led to that.Now we also said that we will be able to bring down the sustaining CapEx down to a level of $850 million and we'll be able to run that through without compromising the quality of the system. And if you take that on the right-hand side here and add into it the remaining from the Brazilian projects plus the new Saudi project, plus then the sustaining CapEx, you end up with a target of 1.250. So I think that's a pretty good achievement.Working capital at the last point there, important spend category. So what did we do there? On the right-hand side you can see, we came out with a target for 2009 of $800 million. And what did we achieve? we achieved $1.3 billion of spend reduction. There's a significant particularly as we have been facing during that period in 2009 the rising level of alumina prices, which obviously the second half particularly, which obviously makes it more difficult to achieve those numbers.If I were to summarize the performance in simple terms, I would say we -- again, if you looked at the performance against the Cash Sustainability Program targets, and many of you had a chance to discuss those ones when we did our equity raise with Chuck and myself, and there were a lot of people that said, ""Wow, this is a very, very aggressive plan."" And I agree, it was a very aggressive plan. The performance here has been exceptional, driving up the cost and compensating for the substantial headwinds and currency as well as energy. And I am very, very sure that we really improved the cash generation capability and capabilities to bring cost savings to the bottom line.The next slide, I want to stop here for a second because so far, I've been talking about the operational improvement. And that is very, very good. But that's only one side of what we have been doing. The other thing is, we've been looking at improving our strategic position. Improving on how we can perform going forward. And sometimes, you have the impression when you go to a year like 2009, as though you are totally occupied in getting all the savings done. As much as we have been focusing on that, our eye continued to be on true North. Where is the right strategic positioning? And we did not let go on those ones. We continue to execute on those ones equally well than on the operational ones. Let's review those because the year has a lot of months, a lot of days and sometimes you forget what happened during all the year. So let's start with the left box, the portfolio box. We've really optimized the portfolio for liquidity and growth. Let me just mention the big items, and there have been other smaller ones. Shining Prospect, the AEES investment -- for those that don't follow us that much, that was the automotive business investment. The Norway Smelter swap cashed a swap against our Sapa assets. Surinam Refinery buying out minority position from BHP. If you look at that left hand box and look at where we are today, 9% [ph] of the businesses that we have today are in a number one or number two competitive position.Let's go to the second box. Obviously, you all know that when it comes to the smelting system, energy cost is the most important factor and long-term supply of competitive energy is the most important factor. And again, we have continued to focus on that to strengthen our competitiveness in this. Today, we have 85% of all smelting systems powered through minimum 20-25. There are in fact quite a number of those that have contracts that go further out in 2025. And then on the right-hand side, on the right-hand side box, I think there are a lot of Alcoans who are particularly proud of that because that talks about the organic growth and that obviously takes a lot of people to get that thing done. We have brought online our new bauxite mine in the Amazon, in Juruti. And we've also brought online the respective refinery in São Luís. Both of those activities in Brazil are going to substantially improve our cost position of the refining system. It's going to bring us down, Alcoa in total down five percentage points on the refining cost, of the worldwide cost curve. So with that, Alcoa as a refining system is now positioned in the lowest quartile of the cost curve, one of the best moves that we could actually make.Then on the right-hand side, left corner, so to say, Bohai in China. We brought online our Bohai facility. And this is very soon going to replace a lot of the imported lithographic sheet that China today has. Samara, one of our Russian facilities, we actually ramped up the can, sheet and tap manufacturing there. We are the only producer of that product in Russia and we're not stopping there. Just a little before the holidays, we announced our new joint venture with Saudi Arabia. Let's go to that.I know that many of you have certainly read the press release. But I still want to spend a little time because this is really, really important. And an important move for Alcoa's primary system. This is, I would say, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Alcoa, for Ma'aden, our partner, as well as for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We're talking about an investment in total of $10.8 billion. Alcoa and partners have 40% in there. Alcoa's investment is about $900 million over a period of four years and we expect this to be funded basically with the free cash flow of Alcoa.It's the lowest cost production complex in the world and I will give you some more details on that. The world's most efficient integrated aluminum complex utilizes fully developed infrastructure, the lowest Alcoa's refining and Smelting position, it offers expansion opportunities and it gives us a very strong footprint in a fast-growing region.Let's take a look at some more details here on the Ma'aden joint venture. As I said, it encompasses bauxite mine, a refinery, a smelter and a rolling mill. And all together, in pretty strong proximity. The bauxite mine, 4 million tons annually, directly aligned to the refinery. Refinery, located in Raz Az Zawr, 1.8 million tons annually and the design is built for expansion options.Smelter co-located to the refinery, 740,000 tons annually. Also optionality for expansion. And the rolling mill co-located to the smelter, up to 460,000 tons on the hot mill. And basically all of that, particularly the refining, smelter and rolling mill utilizes the Raz Az Zawr new port. I forgot to mention it's right on the water. So it utilizes a new port. It utilizes also 2,500-megawatt gas-fired power plant that is currently getting erected there. And it all utilizes the railway connection right out to the mine. The smelter and the rolling mill will be operational in 2013.All that together, and I assume you would agree with that gives us a unique opportunity to bring our costs down and build a super low-cost aluminum production complex.So let's go to the most important thing. As a conclusion from all the things that we've done last year, as I've said, we've really focused on cash and on cash alone. We've improved our cash position and we strengthened our balance sheet and strengthened also our strategic position as I just said. Let's look at the left box here, which shows the free cash flow broken down by quarters. We can clearly see that's an outstanding performance. We are exceeding our targets in regards to free cash flow and free cash flow neutral by the end of the last year. In fact, we have had, as Chuck pointed out, $761 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. And that's a very, very good performance.If you look at the free cash flow improvements at the right-hand side here, if you look at the free cash flow improvements over the year, this allowed us to fund the growth and to end the year with a $1.5 billion cash balance. And to bring the debt-to-cap down by 3.9 points year-on-year, which brings it down from 42.5 to 38.6.Our actions all significantly improved our cash generation as well as our balance sheet. And we have all intentions to remain on that path in 2010. Before I talk about 2010, let's go to the end markets and see how the end markets are performing. So global Aerospace, let's start with that. Large commercial aircraft. We expect deliveries to decline. The airlines continued to be challenged. They are projected to lose $11 billion in 2009 and another $6 billion in 2010. New orders fell pretty drastically to roughly 300 from 1,400 in 2008. If you go to regional business, the market experienced significant reductions in orders as well as in deliveries. While we continue to see destocking across the supply chain and that obviously is most important to our profitability short term. Let me add to that one thing for those who don't follow that market so strongly. If you take the two big players, Boeing and Airbus, alone, you always have to keep in mind with all the things that I've just been saying, that there continues to be a six-year auto backlog. And unlike in the last aviation cycles, the production has not been ramped up. So there's a lot of respected analysts that believe that this backlog can tie the companies over until the orders recover. And also, if we look at air travel, it's gradually ticking up during the past 12 months. And we believe that this is probably not going to drive new build. But what it's certainly going to drive is at least spare parts utilization. So there is also some potentially good news in that year.Automotive. Production expected to rebound in 2010 by about 8% to 60.8 million vehicles. The VW stocking, which was expected to happen in the second half of '09 and is largely completed. Inventories are back to normal levels. It's important to recall that sales and production, even though they improved, are obviously well below the peak levels of 2007. For instance, we're talking about 11% still below the 2007 level. But all regions are expected to show improvements, except Europe. And then Europe is simply an impact of the prolonged and strong government stimulus program that we saw in 2009. Heavy truck and trailer, in general expected the build rates to rise by 10%, we're talking about 1.2 million units. It's well below historic norms. North America for instance, if you take that, we expect 2010 to have a plus 5% increase to 125,000 units. The historic norm is about 225,000 units.If you look at the U.S. and new EPA 2010 diesel emissions standards has created a modest boost here of about 10,000 units.We would see that the flat to minimal growth of North America and Europe in freight shipments and the overcapacity will continue to create some downward pressure on this market.The average can market, we continue to see a trend flat to slightly higher. Commercial building and construction, we expect a decline of 25 plus percent. Leading indicators like contract awarded, architectural billings show that trend. On the industrial gas turbine side, there are a couple of factors -- three factors in fact. Reduced energy demand, the International Energy Agency forecast about 93.5% for 2009. That's the first worldwide reduction in 65 years. The challenge project financing and the uncertainty of the cost around carbon legislation. That actually has an upside in there because gas turbines only have half of the emission of coal-fired power generation.  So this could give an advantage depending on where those cards fall. To sum it all up, we expect to see a relative improvement in 2009 but the levels are below the historic norms, but they are up.If you now fold that into the projection on aluminum, that's what you see here on that slide. And we believe that all of this is going to drive a pretty substantial growth of aluminum in 2010, 10% growth on 2010. And you can see already when you look at that chart here, the major driver of this growth is China. And if you subtract China from that, you still end up with 5% growth overall, which is still a good, good growth number that we're going to see, driven by places like India, Brazil, and Asia in general.Let's go to the next slide, which shows the supply-demand relations. Let's start with aluminum. We'll see here that we expect a surplus of about 1.2 million tons if you add the surplus here on the China side, as well as on the western world side 3.5 to 9 25.Let's go to China side. China moves to a modest surplus but significantly reduces imports. Last year the imports added up to about $1.5 million tons. We believe that China will continue to manage the capacity, as well as the demand very well and will stay in balance. After all, the surplus that we see here, we believe it's going to be fairly temporary. On the western world side, we believe that this is a reflection of the greenfields smelter in the Middle East and India coming online, what we added in a total for that is about 740,000 tons over the year. What is not built in here in our view are outages, as well as high energy costs that may lead to curtailment in places like Venezuela and India.Let's go to the total surplus here of $1.2 million, as I mentioned. Just to give you a reference, this equals two weeks of consumption. So relatively manageable for the global industry.Our view is not taking into account potential restocking of the supply chain. And if that were to happen, the right side also would look substantially different from what we see here. So the alumina site, as the next one, pretty balanced, modest surplus, less than 1% of the total market. That's all we see here.Let's move on to the inventory conditions. On the left-hand side here, if you look at producer inventory, Davenport inventory, all-time lows. The LME stocks are leveling off and keep in mind, those stocks are not freely available. Most of them are financially and logistically constrained. So that is basically reducing the availability of the LME stocks, and despite of the relatively high inventory. If you look at a number that's not on here -- we showed it last time, but I'll give it to you. The U.S. distributor stocks, all-time low. Also, we continue to see a very, very low stock situation in the supply chain.In all of that, what you can see on the right-hand side leads to a very tight physical condition all over the place. Europe, Japan, U.S. Midwest, all of the many regional premiums are up and some of them substantially up. So one thing that is driving that is not just the physical demand so the physical and customer demand. But it's also the financial investors have come back. They've always been in our market place and they have come back to the market place. That's also driving it because we receive quite a bit of questions around that from people that are not following this so much. Let's go to the next slide so that I can do a little deeper dive on that.So what is the logic of the financial participants? What attracts them to come into the aluminum market? One strong attraction is the strength of the foreword curve, what you see here on the left-hand side. And it's a simple procedure to make money here. You buy metal on spot and you sell it forward. And if you have a forward curve, I think forward curve like the one you currently have. It's a pretty straightforward return mechanics, the price of the forward curve minus the sub-price, minus storage cost, minus insurance and then the price on spot. That obviously assumes that you're not financing, because otherwise you would actually take into account also what your financing costs are, which is probably is more what most people that are getting in here are also taking into account.On the right upper corner, you see something else that's pretty interesting that shows the relative attractiveness of aluminum versus other materials. The percentage change on the foreword curve, which shows spot to 18 months out. And you can clearly really see that aluminum is a fairly attractive play versus other metals. On the right lower side, you see the total value of the LME inventories. And you can play with other numbers too. But in reality, we take that as a proxy for how deep and how liquid is the market. So what execution risk do you have, and the answer to that is you have a very, very little execution risk when you go into this financial investment.So let's summarize where we see ourselves coming out in 2010. What other targets in 2010. So, let's go to a procurement again, start with procurement. We have overachieved what we set as a target. Critical thing is, there are a quite a number of savings that we need to lock in. They don't come usually. We need to lock those in. The second thing is there are headwinds. I talked about at currency, as well as energy. But as well, as the market recovers, we will see price increases, which we will have to compensate for, which is a normal thing in some of our commodities than we buy as input factors. We still believe, with all of that together, we will be able to up the target by another 500 million for 2010. So 2.5 billion savings in 2010 in total we believe we can get.Second category is overhead. On the overhead side, we have been able to get 400 million done this year, the number we originally thought, two-year number. We believe we can lock these savings in and make them kind of permanent and add another 100 million to it. The sustain in CapEx side, I've talked about that already, $850 million is the number of sustaining CapEx that we believe we can perform on without compromising the quality of the system. Working capital, last but not least, locking in the savings in spite of the growth environment that we won't see here. We believe we can add an additional two days of working capital, which will end up with 200 million of additional cash here. So if we summarize that all for 2010, how would I describe the situation for 2010?The market environment, key end markets, will improve versus 2009, the levels are still not at the historic norms. The aluminum market is in a modest surplus and the currency and energy headwinds will persist. We at Alcoa will continue to pursue our path of aggressively managing our operations as I just described. And as we've shown in 2009, we will focus on strengthening the balance sheet and we will continue to optimize on our business.Let me elaborate on this, optimizing our business, so that you understand. I can't emphasize that enough. You can rest assured that in all the actions we are taking, all the operational actions, we always have in mind where do we see true north? Where do we see the mid- to long-term attractiveness of our portfolio? Our upstream behavior will continue to focus on bringing our costs down on the cost curve, right? Like we did with Iceland, like we did with Brazil and like we will do in a big step with Saudi. On the midstream side, we will focus -- because the midstream market is a more fragmented market. We will focus on the profitable global, as well as regional markets. And there, we will make sure that our positioning in those markets will secure profitable the performance on the long-term.On the downstream, we have some additional levers we can pull. Because we have leadership positions which we can secure and build out via technology, via new products, via organic, as well as inorganic growth. And rest assured, we will use all of that. That is what we have in mind here.On the 2010 commitment numbers, the chart that you see here is the smaller version, is the one that I just showed you. And that is a stretch, I think all Alcoans know that. We have been able to show that we stick to our commitments. The track record of last year shows it very clearly. We are able to deliver value for our shareholders. And that's a commitment for 2010 that every Alcoan basically stands by. Thank you very much. With that, I'd like to open the line for the Q&A."

If you'll just look at your average price times those tons, you're looking at about $460 million in extra sales and that accounted for about 2/3 of the sales difference. The surge in third-party shipments of about 193,000 versus what we were looking for. And then your comment in your release that you had to go out and purchase, it seems like a very large number of tons, 207,000 tons. And then resell them to satisfy customer commitments.

And really, it comes from when we had purchase commitments in order to service our downstream businesses long before the economy went in the tank. So you can look at these, the 207 [207,000] was about $490 million worth of revenue in the quarter and you can look at those as being totally margin-neutral.The other thing that you need to look at that you didn't bring up is on the alumina side. And that we had a host of third-party shipments on the alumina side increases there and is to meet customer demand. But you got to take it into consideration that we're ramping up during the quarter. We were ramping up point comfort on it's fourth divesture. And we're also ramping up São Luís. So when you're doing that, you've got higher costs so you don't really have a lot of margin on it on a full cost basis even though as can be seen by cash from operations, you're generating a lot of cash. So when you're looking at that top line to the bottom line, I think you got to look at both alumina and primary, adjust for the buy resell and take into consideration that some of the tons going out to third party on the alumina are on low-margin tons on a P&L basis and good on a cash basis.

So you could say, once the interest -- obviously today, it's attractive because of financing is very, very cheap and money for such investment is available. So once the interest rate goes up, obviously you have to ask yourself what's the logic of the interest rate going up? The logic of the interest rate going up, I mean if  you look at -- if you look at banks, I mean national banks today would actually be if they are afraid that the economy has kicked in or if the comfortable that the economy has kicked in. I said afraid because I was just looking at China where the decision last week was the Chinese National Bank basically brings the interest up because they were afraid of an overheating of the economy.

I mean, the fundamental situation on China that energy, that they are short on energy, and that they are not an ideal place particularly for smelting. And then there's a lot of other opportunities for taking the power to do something else and that's exactly the path that they have been following. We've seen that on and on, and on again. We've recently seen that they've been announcing that there's no new smelter licensed going to be passed out for the next three years. We've also seen that they put environmental regulations in place which will lead to a curtailment of roughly 850,000 tons over the next three years. So that's where we are coming from. I believe that they are going to balance the supply-demand side. So we don't count in that there is going to be similar amounts of imports like we saw last year. And on top of it, always, don't forget that there is one thing that we don't see here, it's hard -- I mean, it would have required a totally different analysis here on top of it.

Thanks, Matt. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. We've got some detail in this quarter. I'm going to take my time going through that, the bridges and the reconciliation sheet of the restructuring special items. I'm also going to give you some additional disclosure around sensitivities today. But let me start off with by first saying that our improved operating result reflects increased profitability that we gained through a strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiative. Our realized aluminum pricing is hitting the bottom line and we are overcoming increased energy costs and reduced volumes. Now let's go to the first quarter overview. In the first quarter, higher realized LME pricing and the continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives drove significant improvements in the cost of goods sold and SGA percentages of sales. The combination of which generated EBITDA of $596 million, which is the highest level since the third quarter of 2008. Higher energy costs, lower volumes, predominantly can sheet, both negatively impacted results. Our loss from continuing operations of $194 million or $0.19 per share included restructuring and special items, totaling $295 million or $0.29 per share. I'll review these items in more detail in just a bit.  Lastly, debt to cap improved to 38.1% and liquidity remained strong with $1.3 billion of cash on hand.Let's move to the next slide which illustrates market activity in our businesses. Revenues in many of our markets have improved relative to last year, while others, namely, aerospace and IGT, continued to experience supply chain de-stocking and low levels of demand. The declines in packaging were expected due to our decision to curtail can sheet volumes to our North American supply base. This decision contributed to a reduction in flat-rolled product shipments of roughly 75,000 tons. The sequential declines in our third-party alumina and primary metal sales reflect higher internal shipments to meet improved order rates and the anticipated reduction in buy/resale activity to more normal levels. Buy/resale totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a reduction of 158,000 tons sequentially. On a sequential basis, aerospace was essentially flat as de-stocking activity begins to slow and supply levels stabilize. Weak demand in IGT and building and construction continues to drive revenue declines in these markets. Now let's review the financials. I'll highlight some key items for you as you have the detailed income statement in the press release. Third-party revenues declined 10% sequentially as increases in internal shipments in alumina and lower can sheet volumes more than offset the benefit of higher pricing. Note that the reduction in buy/resale activity contributed to half of the revenue decline. COGS as a percent of sales fell to 82.1% driven through continued progress in our Cash Sustainability initiatives. As you'll recall, COGS in the fourth quarter included charges related to our Italian operations, the MRN tax settlement and the impact of buy/resale activity. All of which accounted for 6.7 percentage points of the COGS percent decline.On a percent-of-sales basis, SG&A improved by 0.5 percentage points sequentially as we continued to aggressively reduce overhead spend. And lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was a negative 95.5%. For your reference, we've attached at an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate. Included in the tax rate this quarter are discrete tax items totaling $112 million, which I will detail in the next slide. Going forward, we expect our operational ETR to be approximately 32%. However, we will continue to experience swings in rate given volatility in our profit drivers and overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction. Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter. Okay, this slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location on the financial statements. Restructuring-related items of $119 million primarily relates to the permanent closure of certain curtailed U.S. locations, including the Badin and Eastalco smelters. This decision was made after an assessment of the sustained competitiveness of each facility was completed based on factors, including market fundamentals, other idle capacity, the cost structure and future capital investment. The discrete tax items include $79 million related to the recently-enacted health care legislation. The legislation changed the tax treatment of the federal subsidy offered to companies that provided Medicare Part D-equivalent prescription drug benefits to retirees. Non-cash mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in several power contracts totaled $31 million and power outages in São Luís and Rockdale negatively impacted results by $17 million. Lastly, an increase in the Grasse River environmental remediation accrual totaled $11 million. The net of these items totaled $295 million or $0.29 per share.Now let's move to the sequential bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and special items. Higher realized alumina and aluminum pricing was partially offset by the non-recurrence of a LIFO benefit in the previous quarter. We generated significant productivity gains through continued execution of our Cash Sustainability initiatives. You can clearly see that we've been able to hold our productivity gains from last year and increase our level of savings despite headwinds from lower volumes and higher energy. As a reference point, sequential increases in the average price of oil was up approximately 4% and natural gas, 1%. Before moving to the segments, I'd like to review our key net income sensitivities. This slide shows you our two key sensitivities: aluminum and currency. These sensitivities help you provide directional guidance on how changing metal price and then currencies impact our bottom line.The aluminum sensitivity is inclusive of all LME-linked elements in our revenue and cost structure: alumina, aluminum and LME-linked power. This sensitivity based on a 15-day lag LME price. The currency's sensitivities reflect on different economic exposures. For the most part, our non-U.S. operations generate U.S. dollar revenues from alumina and aluminum, but pay expenses in local currency. It should be no surprise that the Aussie dollar sensitivity is our highest given the large operating base we have in Australia. We will include this sensitivity table in the appendix going forward for your reference.Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Alumina. Alumina pricing trended high in the quarter, yielding a 13% increase in our realized price. Production was slightly lower sequentially as a power outage in São Luís and many outages in Australia offset increases at Point Comfort. The power outage, which occurred in early February, negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million. Juruti negatively impacted the quarter by $20 million and higher energy costs totaled $15 million. As noted on the bridge, the fourth quarter charge for a tax settlement and our MRN partnership did not recur.Moving to the outlook, alumina pricing will follow the 60-day lag. Lower caustic cost will flow through the system and we will continue to benefit from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. As we look at all of our operating conditions that we have across our system, we would expect production to increase by approximately 100,000 tons versus the first quarter.Let's move to the Primary segment. The first quarter performance benefited from an 8% increase in the realized price, favorable currency benefits and productivity gains. As you'll recall, the fourth quarter included a $250 million charge related to the drawback from the Italian power case. The decline in third-party shipments was predominately driven by a significant reduction in buy/resale activity. Margin-neutral buy/resale totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a decline of 158,000 tons sequentially. Higher power costs were incurred, particularly in Italy, as new power tariffs took effect. Also, although smelting activity at our Rockdale facility has been curtailed, we continue to have power-generation activities at this site. A maintenance outage conducted during the quarter negatively impacted sequential performance by $11 million. Looking to the second quarter, we expect our realized pricing to follow a 15-day lag and continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Unfortunately, the power station in Rockdale continues to struggle. The master agreement with USW, which covers 5,350 employees, expires on May 31. While we are confident that a mutually acceptable agreement will be reached, actions are being taken to ensure business continuity if any disruptions should occur.Lastly, we expect production to be equal to the first quarter. Beginning next year, we expect ongoing cost reductions from the closures announced this quarter of approximately $15 million annually, largely comprised of the cessation of depreciation and other holding costs. Now let's move to the Flat-Rolled Products segment.Flat-Rolled Products ATOI declined $7 million sequentially, largely driven by lower volumes from our decision to curtail sales to our North American can sheet customer. In can sheet, we reduced headcount and capacity to bring our cost structure more in line with current volumes. This effort and improved pricing on new contracts helped to mitigate the impact of reduced volumes. The net impact on our North American can sheet operations was $22 million sequentially. Overall, higher pricing, improved product mix and Cash Sustainability initiatives more than offset the higher energy costs and negative currency impact we experienced in the quarter. Next quarter, we expect continued gains from Cash Sustainability initiatives. Key end markets will improve. However, our can sheet volumes will remain at lower levels.Now let's move to the Engineered Products and Solutions. ATOI of $81 million was up 42% sequentially despite lower sales. Strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiative helped generate ATOI percent of 7.5% equal to the first quarter of 2009 when sales were $200 million higher. These results clearly illustrate how this business has structurally improved its cost position. Revenue fell 2% sequentially as continued weakness in the IGT and building and construction markets was partially offset by volume increases in the industrial and commercial transportation markets. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiative and slight improvements in overall market conditions. Let's now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we produced cash from operations of $199 million. The largest single contributor to this sequential change in CFO was due to working capital. Working capital increased by $336 million as we are carrying higher inventories to meet rising demand levels. Our typical first quarter inventory build was managed diligently with the tools and insights gained from last year. In fact, on a days basis, the first quarter of 2009, we moved 13 days of working capital. We improved at 13 days of working capital versus last year. And we made improvement in each one of our groups. In the GPP group, which is the Primary group, it improve days of working capital with 27 days. Flat-Rolled Products was down 27 days and EPS was down 14 days. Capital expenditures totaled $221 million. Including the net investment in Ma'aden, which flows through other investing activities, CapEx totaled $281 million. This keeps us on track against our 2010 target of $1.25 billion. Free cash flow in the first quarter was essentially break even, so let me take a minute and summarize. I'll remind everybody that we've got a target to be free cash flow positive in 2010. All of our Cash Sustainability initiatives are centered on driving free cash flow and structurally improving our ability to drive bottom line growth. We've made outstanding progress in reducing our cost of purchased goods and lowering our overhead spend. And we've been able to sustain the gains that we made in 2009. We're judiciously deploying capital and managing working capital effectively, keeping overall days low on a relative basis. We're aggressively pursuing our Cash Sustainability targets to generate higher levels of free cash flow and drive near-term and long-term value to shareholders. I'd now, like to turn it over to Klaus."

And welcome, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. I guess what you've seen already from the press release, and Chuck went to it more in-depth is we've used this quarter to continue to improve the bottom line and to drive towards our 2010 goals. I'd like to guide through a couple of things here. It starts in the usual fashion with an overview on the end markets as well as on the aluminum market, including the supply and demand side. And then, I'd like to give you a deeper insight into our main businesses and look at drivers that there are to get to a more normalized performance. That's a question that, when we've been on the road talking to investors, was asked a lot and we thought that, that's important for all of you to understand, to better understand what is really the value creation potential that Alcoa has here. So let's start with the end markets in the usual fashion. So 2010, we expect the economy to continue to improve slightly. Let's start with aerospace. Large commercial aircrafts, we are projecting deliveries to be essentially flat compared to 2009. We see that most of the airlines stand by their orders and they continue to stand by it, main reasons for that being the fuel efficiency of new planes. Some actually receive a substantial subsidies from government export credit agencies and some just want to avoid losing their deposits through the cancellation. If you look at the airline economics, they actually looked improved compared to the fourth quarter, a 30% improved. But at the same time, the projection is that all of the airline industry in total worldwide will continue to lose money, $2.8 billion projected in 2010. One thing that's always good to remind ourselves of, particularly here in this segment is the order backlog of six years that Boeing and Airbus have in their books. If you look at another segment here on aerospace, regional and business jet, it doesn't look that good. We continue to see significant reductions of orders as well as deliveries. Lastly, what really counts for us is the de-stocking and we expect this to come to an end in the first half of 2010. That's the most important factor because it immediately is driving our course of profitability. The segments that are relevant for us and particularly are sheets, rolled products, aerospace, foil and fasteners. So we are profiting on a lot of ends and each one of those segments has its own dynamics. For instance, in aerofoils, we already see a pretty substantial pickup. Whereas in sheet, given the strong inventory levels at many places, we believe that, that's probably laggard.Automotive. Local automotive production expected to rebound in 2010 plus 9% is our expectation. 62.2 million vehicles, that's pretty much in every region except to Europe. And Europe, is because with the strong government incentive for last year demand was just pulled forward. But if you look at the 2010 levels, they are still way below 9%, below the 2007 peak level of 68 million vehicles.The vehicle inventory situation has fully corrected and we're now really witnessing real demand also in the U.S. If you saw what's happening here in the U.S. pretty much spurred by strong incentive programs, this time by the automakers, euro financing is the big thing today. And if you look at the March sales, you saw that the March sales for GM have been up 21%, for Ford, 40% and for Toyota, 40%. Obviously, from all this, the consumer is the beneficiary. He seems to be seeing it or she seems to be seeing it in the same way and is responding to that offer with real demand. Heavy truck and trailer, next segment, expect a slow recovery versus 2009 low. We see 10% increase in production in 2010 to a 1.3 million units level. If you look at the U.S., we see growth, on the one hand, freight miles are slowly recovering and the freight rates are increasing. On a year-on-year basis, we saw an increase of 18.6%. But let's make no mistake, I mean, we're talking about numbers that are well below the historic norms, particularly given the overhang that exists here on the trucking fleet side. For the U.S., the projection is higher than 23,000 units versus the 225,000 as the historic norm.Beverage can packaging global market, we believe will contribute to be flat versus 2009 level. And we will continue to follow our strategy to partner with those can sheet customers that understand and value Alcoa's unmatched quality, as well as our service capability, as well as our unique strength to continue to innovate in that segment. We will continue to particularly work with those that use packaging and sustainability as their strong profit drivers because that is the match that makes sense for us and generates value on both sides.From the commercial building and construction side in North America, a significant decline. We expect it to be 25%. And most of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Funds (sic) [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Funds] are going into highways and not buildings. So that is not working very much as a counterbalance here. Europe, expected to decline too, a little less so as 5% is the expectation. And China and India are totally different picture, substantial growth in both of the market. Last but not least, industrial gas turbines. Heavy-duty gas turbine builds are expected to decline, we think 25% to 30% versus 2009. Orders are postponed or deferred mainly driven by a slower economic growth and that then being reflected in lower electricity demand on the short term, and driven also by uncertainty about emissions regulations. For Alcoa, the most important thing is the de-stocking of the OEM. That's, again here, the major short-term impact. And mid to long term, our forecast is bullish on the industrial gas turbine. And I would even say, it has been become even more bullish if you look at the structural changes that are happening in this market, the substantial price decline in natural gas given to the innovation and the finds of shale gas, low capital cost requirements for gas turbine or combined cycle power plant, the flexibility, the short lead times and the environmental advantages, for instance, versus coal. And if you sum up the whole end-market situation, the way I would see it is, is I would say, end markets continue to strengthen. In the main, 2010 would clearly be better than 2009, but it's going to be below historic norms in many of the markets.So let's go to aluminum and let's have the next chart on here. We expect the consumption to grow by 10% in 2010. This is pretty much the view that we already have shown you in the fourth quarter announcement, and very strongly driven by China. If you look at the growth rate in China, in the first quarter, of 37% growth rate, we expect that to normalize. And our projection here is that over the course of the year, we would see 18%. And this is probably a conservative assumption, given what we're seeing in China these days.If you look at further up here, North America and look at the current year-on-year number for the U.S., it has been 3%. We project the 5% over the course of the full year. Strong growth in Japan, year-on-year, 23%. Our expectation for Asia, without China, is 6%. And even in Europe, I have to say, we've seen a year-on-year growth of 20%. Our expectation here is 3%. So that's where those stand, so 10%. And if you would take China out, it's 5%. Let's go to the inventory conditions. I will lead you through the chart. It looks more complicated than it really is. On the left-hand side, we have condensed pretty much the most important inventory levels. And as the amount has been growing, we also see a modest increase in port inventories in China, as well as in Japan, as well as the very modest increase in producer stock. At the same time, we see a counter-effect on the LME stocks. They have declined by roughly 40,000 tons in this quarter. So overall, if you look at the accumulation, overall, it's been pretty flat inventory situation. When you then go to the right-hand side and look at the regional premiums that we have been tracking for a while here, and you can see the curves there, what happens here is you have, on the one hand, improved real [ph] (37:01) demand, strong interest continues from financial participants, logistic constraints, distributor stocks are low, USA distributor stocks are at an all-time low. All of that together really leads to a very tight supply chain situation and continues to drive the regional premiums, as you see them here coming up or kind of being stable on a pretty high level. The next one, let's move to the demand and the supply side situation. This is the chart for aluminum, and that we believe, we have to really see the China and the Western world separately. In the main, we project for the whole world an overhang here of 1.2 million tons in 2010, and I'll qualify that a little bit later. So for China, if you look at the left-hand side, you see a small surplus, a little bit bigger than what we saw, actually, end of last year. But very frankly, I mean, I could go through the detail, if anybody's interested in that, later on. But frankly, I'm not at all and we're not at all concerned about that. What we've seen here with China, in the worst of all downturns, they have been very, very good at managing their supply and demand balance. And they've been very agile and very, very fast in responding here. So I would be very sure that this surplus is really only temporary. If you go on the right-hand side, on the Western side, what you see here is pretty much a function of new greenfields measure, starting up mainly in the Middle East, some in India, in addition on giving us a 745,000 metric tons additional supply. And then the combination of small restarts in Europe, mainly offset by the curtailment in Venezuela, given the drought situation, given that this is hydro powered.If you look at the total surplus of 1.2 million, if you add those 400,000 and the 830,000 up, let's all here remind ourselves, we're talking about a two-week consumption in our market. So this is the amount that we're talking about. So that's a pretty manageable number. And actually, our projections here don't even include a restocking of the supply chain, and as yet was used as, just in the slide before that, on the U.S. distributor stock, we are at an all-time low. Now let's go to the next slide, which basically shows the same thing for the supply/demand balance for alumina. Alumina is the global market, that's why we don't really see that as two separate markets here. And I don't even need to go onto the details. I mean, the numbers show it by themselves, as supply/demand is balanced in 2010, and that's what we expect and that's also what we've been seeing in the market. And I'll come to some of those aspects when we talk about our business a little bit more. So insomuch, that closes the part on the market. So let's now move on to talking about Alcoa. And as I said early on, I mean, one of the questions that Chuck and I have been asked a lot in many, many conversations with you all out there, saying, ""Well, on the one hand, we have this enormous overshadowing here by the downturn."" And the way that Alcoa got through it and most people give us good credits for it, but they say, ""We don't fully understand how all of that leads into the normalization of your profit capabilities."" And at the same time, I think everybody sees also that we've used the downturn to streamline all portfolio to lower our costs systemically. And obviously, also, that goes into the whole equation to drive performance. So I want to do -- the first slide is already up, and I'm going to lead you through it. So I want to use four slides, basically, going through the four businesses, and show you what we see when we look at it from our internal perspective as the main value drivers in here. So the chart that's up here is on the Alumina business. Keep in mind, we are the clear market leader in the Alumina business, and not only are we the market leader, volume wise, but our system is one of the most competitive systems, the largest and the most competitive one, because we are positioned, on average, in the lowest quartile on the cost curve. As you can see here, on the left-hand side, that's the cost curve. We have two cost curves there, the 2009, one in the 2000. And I'll refer to it a little later, why we put the 2000 in there. Our total capacity is 18.1 million tons. We've grown in the last year by roughly 2 million tons, basically by taking the partner out into Ralco and completing our São Luis/Juruti expansion. And we will add more 450,000 tons when, in 2014, Ma'aden comes online, the refinery and the mine, come online. And you can see this little green red dot there on the left-hand side on the refining curve. So that will be the new position that Ma'aden will have on the cost curve, and literally, extends the cost curve further down and sets a new low-cost point.Well, that's all good, but we've also done other things on the operational side. If you look at the alumina conversion costs, we've brought the alumina conversion costs down by 18% since the fourth quarter in '08. And if you go over to the lower right-hand side, which says Alcoa third-party alumina sales percent of LME, we've indexed that, and you have a 10-year history here of the contract pricing for Alcoa. As you know, it's done as a percentage of aluminum. And you see your trends there. And if you look at the most recent contract prices that we have been able to achieve, they've been upward the 15% LME. All of this is a clear reflection, we continue to have a tight market or we even have a tighter market. We have also, on the other hand, rising alumina costs. And that's the reason, if you go back to the left-hand side through the cost curve, why we put the comparison, the gray curve, the 2000 curve in there because you can see -- and we put the two 50 percentile points in there so you can see what happened here over this course of the 10 years. The cost in the alumina sector have increased substantially, about 50%. The midpoint has moved up by 50%. So on the one hand, I mean, going back to the pricing levels, I think we see here, on the one hand, the tight market, on the other hand, rising alumina costs putting pressure on the pricing, and also, have we changed over on the frequency of our contract pricing. So all of that together has led to good things happening there. And the good things happening there, you see reflected on the upper right-hand side, where you see the EBITDA per metric ton for alumina also over a 10-year period, and then looking at the first quarter performance, you already see that this is trending into the right direction. But you also, on the other hand, see, if you look at the whole light blue bars there, that by no means are we talking about a normalized performance here. And the prices are high, yes. But at the same time, costs have also risen, and we believe there is upside potential in here and we're going to continue to see upside here. And in the end, I mean, there's not that much good bauxite available, particularly when you want it close to refining, and when you want the refinery close to a port and when you want this being close to consumers. Add it all together, that determines where you are on the cost curve, right? It's not just about having something there. It's really on what you have there. And all of that will continue to lead into pretty substantial tightness, in our view, and continue to drive prices. So let's sum it up. We are very well-positioned here and we've got substantial upside on the alumina side. Let's go to the next one. Aluminum, right? On the aluminum side, our system is about 4.5 million tons capacity. We have current utilization rate of 80% versus the pre-crisis level of 2008. In 2008, we produced about 4 million tons. We added roughly 300,000 tons with Elkem and with Ma'aden. Once Ma'aden comes online, we will add another 186,000 tons to our smelting system. And again here, you'd see those little green dot here on the left-hand side, where it says global primary cost curve. That little green dot means the cost position of Ma'aden, setting a new low-cost point, which is obviously, a very, very good thing to happen, right?At the same time here, when you want to measure, what have we done operationally? Conversion cost is a good measure. We've brought conversion cost down for aluminum by 21%, compared to the fourth quarter in '08. And also, important here is power. We've secured a competitive power for 85% of our smelter system until 2025 and even longer, but minimum, 2025. That determines that. So then when you go to the upper right-hand side, you see again, the EBITDA margin, this time for aluminum. And you can clearly see, we've made solid progress in the fourth quarter, but far from a normalized level. And we believe that prices also here will be rising partially, also because of the cost pressure. We also have, on the left-hand side here, put the 2000 cost curve, and then you can see almost the same phenomenon that I already described on the alumina side, the 50% increase here of the midpoint. So with all of that, we believe that with all of that, plus our improved position, our better costs and the market price is trending up, we believe that, on a normalized level, this will go substantially up. And I want to remind you, just take a little step back, and that little charge here on the right lower corner is very, very powerful and important to understand.  Let's take a little step back and think about what is really done with aluminum. And I think that when you look at reports, there's almost a consensus in the world that you will have probably, over a long period of time, 6% annual growth, normalized, so to say, in this market, right? If you have 6% growth in this market, let's be realistic and see what that means, in terms of additional need for supply. This would actually mean that we would have, or somebody else would have to build 2.3 million tons per year of new capacity. This would mean three new Ma'aden smelters per year. This would mean four new São Luis expansions per year. It will mean 20 new gas turbines per year. Or for those of you who love hydropower, two new Hoover Dams built every year. And it would mean equal $30 billion that would have to be put into the ground as infrastructure investment. While looking at that, I am pretty confident that the supply-demand situation is heavily biased towards a tight situation, because it's not very likely that this will be doable in this world, right? Therefore, I'm pretty convinced that we will continue to see pressure on the prices here, going forward.So next one is rolled products. On the rolled product side, let me start on the right upper-hand side where you have, again, the profitability. If you look at the profitability here in the first year, is you'll see that this is a business that has had profit margins and around 10-plus percent, right? And 2005, we started investing in the growth markets, China and Russia, and that has brought the margins down on where do we stand today, strategically? The Russian can sheet mill is fully operational. China Bohai is ramping up. Full ramp-up will be done by 2011. By the way, I forgot to mention, on Russia, that it's the first time this quarter that they have been able to get breakeven, right? We also have lowest conversion costs on Ma'aden once the mill goes online in 2013, plus we've used the downturn to re-engineer the businesses. We strengthened our position, exited commoditized market, exited foil electronic underperformer, headcount reduction of 5,000 people. To just put it in perspective, we're talking about 25% of the total headcount here that we've done. Overhead costs are down $140 million. And if you look at the left-hand side with the third-party sales structure [ph] (50:29), given that we are going to the downturn, that we continue to see some de-stocking going on and that we have lost one can sheet customer, we are currently at a utilization rate of 75%. That is not a normalized level. We believe a normalized level would rather be around 90% in aerospace. We've seen years like in 2005 where we have been at 100%, right? So all of these parts together, I mean, if you put them altogether, I believe that all of those actions show that we have set flat-rolled products on a path to become a strong performance country, going forward.Last but not least, Engineered Product and Solution business. Let me start on left-hand side. Where do we stand currently? We stand at a 70% utilization rate on aerospace and a 65% utilization on the rest of the group. And if you see that and now go to the right-hand side, the EBITDA margin performance, when you look at the first quarter, the one that we reported about now, 14%, just shy of the 2008 15%, with this type of utilization rate, obviously, it points to a very strong cost cutting that has happened here. Very, very good performance. When you look to the strategic position that we have in engineered products and solution, we have unequal technological capabilities that put us in a position to create value for the customers of our customers. We have focused the portfolio today, 85% of the sales are number one or number two market leader positions. $440 million for activity improvement in 2009. Aerospace de-stocking, as I said early on, is improving, and we believe it's going to come to an end in first half 2010. We also see significant short-term profit accelerators. Just to give you a few, 787 and A380 to mention some. We are in that with special alloys, unique fasteners, as well as with airfoils. Joint strike fighter, we're in it with alloys, structures and fasteners. Heavy truck market is recovering. We have Dura-Bright capabilities on quoting LvL ONE outstanding wheels. And on top of it, we've shown that we also are very capable of doing inorganic growth, with the integration of the 2000 acquisitions, Van Petty and Republic, which has really been done almost flawlessly. We will continue, in this group, to look for additional growth and build on our strengths that we have there, whether it be organic or inorganic. Let's sum this all up. I hope that all of this information is valuable for you to understand, where is the performance, as you have always asked, on a normalized level? As the economy comes back, utilization will go up. And we've used the downturn to improve our position with a better portfolio, with better cost and with future growth like Ma'aden, which is substantially going to increase our competitiveness. All of that together will drive the value of our business and of our performance.Let's look at this year. Real quickly, where do we stand, in regards to the targets that we've set ourselves, to increase our operations in 2010. On the procurement side, $505 million, target is $2.5 billion, $5.5 million year-to-date and the first quarter looks good. We're well on track overhead. We're going to bring it down by $500 million this year. We've achieved $127 million in the first quarter, looks good.Total CapEx, this targets include about $250 million for Ma'aden. We're trending in the right direction, in line with expectations. And last, but not least, on the working capital side, Chuck noted that there's an increase in days, compared to the fourth quarter, which is kind of typical for the first quarter. But if you'd look at a year-on-year basis, you actually see that we have taken out 13 days in working capital turns. That's a big success of the cash sustainability initiative. We're on target to continue to reduce this, and to get the two days out of the working capital turns that we have been shooting for and aiming for this year. Let's get to an end and summarize that. The environment is stabilizing. We will be capitalizing on this while we are managing headwinds like currency and energy. We're exceeding our goals. Talking to Alcoans all around the world, they know that we have the future in our hands. They are very proud of the almost flawless execution that we've shown in 2009, and they want to repeat it in 2010. 2010, as a year, we have a great team. We have an outstanding portfolio. We have an unwavering commitment to make this happen again to improve costs and to profitably grow. All of that growth, we can be very happy about our portfolio there, global alumina leader, we can leverage our base; continue to improve our situation in aluminum-rolled products led you through that profitability can be revitalized; and EPS, we can use the leadership position that we have to continue to grow. With all that said, we are committed to create value for 2010 and forward, and even more strongly so. Let me close with that and open up the lines for questions and answers."

On the Alumina pricing side, I mean the thing that I can say already today and you saw that in my Alumina chart, that's why we put that in there, you can clearly see that the pricing is trending upwards. So obviously the tightening that exists in the Alumina market is reflected in a stronger percentage through the LME. And as I've said, I mean the recent contracts that we signed up have been upwards 15%, which I think is also, historically, a pretty, pretty good number. We also have gone away from longer-term contracts to more of a shorter-term contractual obligations to profit from the different pricing situations. And on top of that, I believe that we're going to see much more upside trends here. As I've said early on, there isn't that many good bauxite reserves that are close enough to a refinery, so the transportation costs are not shooting through the roof and close enough to a port, and then the port close enough to end customers. When you put those equations all together, that's not that easy to do right. So we believe it's going to be trending up. On the iron ore situation, first of all, I don't know the market well enough, so I wouldn't be the best one to talk about it.

The U.S. situation, in the U.S., we have about 5,350 employees that are covered under the U.S. USW master agreement. The master agreement expires on May 31. And we are currently in early negotiations, I would call it. Obviously, we have a strong desire to reach a fair, as well as competitive labor agreement. And to avoid any type of work stoppage, we've taken some steps to prepare in case work stoppage would happen. And as I said earlier on, we want to emphasize that, again, we hope that there will be no work stoppage, but we obviously have to protect our assets and also our workforce, our communities, and we have commitments to our customers that we don't want to compromise here.

But given that, this was the question that, I think, we've all been much more nervous about when we went into the downturn. And given that, when we went into the downturn, I mean everybody was afraid that this overhang would depress the market and prices would not come back at all. I think what we are seeing now is that our estimate is that quite a majority of the LME is either through financial transactions or through logistics constraints bound for at least a while in the warehouse. And then while in my view, I would put a frame around it between three to six months as a start to probably 18 months, and I would say the majority of what we see there probably has those. We know of some transactions that even have a longer timeframe behind there. But I don't believe, Curt, not only do I not believe, I know by having looked into this that it is virtually impossible for this to all come out at the same time, and that's exactly why you are continuing to see these regional price premiums continuing to go up pretty much, right? The tightness is there. And also keep in mind, we've also seen not only real demand coming back pretty substantially and I think that's going to get stronger going forward, but at the same time, financial investors have also strengthened their positions here and very often driven by a view on where else would you get value if you want to hold on to something other than a currency denomination, right?"

You've got 3003 prices moving up roughly $0.20 quarter-over-quarter. Orders up through February, about 20%.

I think the first thing that I would want to give you as an explanation is this aspect of the cans on the packaging side that we made a purposeful decision to discontinue once we had the chance to discontinue with the large contract with one of our customers on the can sheet side. It was a 10-year contract. It had a lot of aspects in there that in total, I mean lots of quite a bit of money over that 10-year timeframe. And as painful as it is to make a decision like that and then having to curtail some capacity as appropriate and right, I believe it is, if you want to substantially make sure that you have a profitability structure of your business, that is a solid foundation for investments and being in that business, right? So that's the first thing. So I mean the 75% utilization is obviously overshadowed by that part, right? The second part, I think I talked about aerospace already. I mean aerospace is coming back. I said it's probably a laggard on the sheet and rolled side given that there are pretty heavy inventory levels that we've seen in aerospace. And the third point I would add here is the reason why the profitability has come down from this 10% to 11% rate at that time when we had a higher cost structure even was the investment in China and Russia, right? And that is now coming online. And so as I said, we've seen Russia in this quarter breaking even. Kunshan is operating into the automotive market in China, and it's operating real nicely. It's a hot market obviously in China. Bohai is coming up. And as I said before, we believe that the full ramp, we will be seeing in 2011 and obviously, that would then give us also the fruits there. And the fruits will be nicer than what we've seen before because we've reached a lower cost level. That's the way I would portray it, John."

I'd try to answer it in two chunks. One, and as I said earlier on and I think also in conversations with you earlier, I mean sometimes you have to make a tough decision to change a pretty nasty situation that we have there. And we are not an employment company. We're not in a business to just produce something and lose money with it. And that's been the situation that we had with this contract. So I think we got to be reasonable. On top of it, and if you look at the performance of Alcoa, I think you can ask pretty much everybody who's out there and understands the Can Sheet business, we are clearly the quality leader. On top of it, we provide service, and we have a huge innovation potential, which I don't think anybody else has. Some have seen some other aluminum packaging that are pretty innovative and drive really also market share for companies. So that's the discussion that we continue to have. And I have a hard time to project where this is going. I still hope that we will be able to re-establish the relationship there and help both ends because I believe this can easily be turned into a win-win situation. On your second part of the question, is there enough capacity out there? Well, I mean some people have taken in large contracts and have highly publicized that, and are now in a situation that they have to deliver, and they have to deliver, as you know, flawless quality. And well, we'll see. And once the temperatures go up, which they've done this year a little earlier than everyone expected, and I think also beverage sales will go up and the need for aluminum cans will go up, and that's the situation there.

Thanks, Matt. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. We've got some detail in this quarter. I'm going to take my time going through that, the bridges and the reconciliation sheet of the restructuring special items. I'm also going to give you some additional disclosure around sensitivities today. But let me start off with by first saying that our improved operating result reflects increased profitability that we gained through a strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiative. Our realized aluminum pricing is hitting the bottom line and we are overcoming increased energy costs and reduced volumes. Now let's go to the first quarter overview. In the first quarter, higher realized LME pricing and the continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives drove significant improvements in the cost of goods sold and SGA percentages of sales, the combination of which generated EBITDA of $596 million, which is the highest level since the third quarter of 2008. Higher energy costs, lower volumes, predominantly can sheet, both negatively impacted results. Our loss from continuing operations of $194 million or $0.19 per share included restructuring and special items totaling $295 million or $0.29 per share. I'll review these items in more detail in just a bit.  Lastly, debt to cap improved to 38.1% and liquidity remained strong with $1.3 billion of cash on hand.Let's move to the next slide which illustrates market activity in our businesses. Revenues in many of our markets have improved relative to last year, while others, namely, aerospace and IGT, continued to experience supply chain de-stocking and low levels of demand. The declines in packaging were expected due to our decision to curtail can sheet volumes to our North American supply base. This decision contributed to a reduction in flat-rolled product shipments of roughly 75,000 tons. The sequential declines in our third-party alumina and primary metal sales reflect higher internal shipments to meet improved order rates and the anticipated reduction in buy/re-sell activity to more normal levels. Buy/re-sell totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a reduction of 158,000 tons sequentially. On a sequential basis, aerospace was essentially flat as de-stocking activity begins to slow and supply levels stabilize. Weak demand in IGT and building and construction continues to drive revenue declines in these markets. Now let's review the financials. I'll highlight some key items for you as you have the detailed income statement in the press release. Third-party revenues declined 10% sequentially as increases in internal shipments in alumina and lower can sheet volumes more than offset the benefit of higher pricing. Note that the reduction in buy/re-sell activity contributed to half of the revenue decline. COGS as a percent of sales fell to 82.1% driven through continued progress in our cash sustainability initiatives. As you'll recall, COGS in the fourth quarter included charges related to our Italian operations, the MRN tax settlement and the impact of buy/re-sell activity, all of which accounted for 6.7 percentage points of the COGS percent decline.On a percent-of-sales basis, SG&A improved by 0.5 percentage points sequentially as we continued to aggressively reduce overhead spend. And lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was a negative 95.5%. For your reference, we've attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate. Included in the tax rate this quarter are discrete tax items totaling $112 million, which I will detail on the next slide. Going forward, we expect our operational ETR to be approximately 32%. However, we will continue to experience swings in rate given the volatility in our profit drivers and overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction. Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter. Okay, this slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location on the financial statements. Restructuring-related items of $119 million primarily relates to the permanent closure of certain curtailed U.S. locations, including the Badin and Eastalco smelters. This decision was made after an assessment of the sustained competitiveness of each facility was completed based on factors including market fundamentals, other idle capacity, the cost structure and future capital investment. The discrete tax items include $79 million related to the recently-enacted health care legislation. The legislation changed the tax treatment of the federal subsidy offered to companies that provided Medicare Part D-equivalent prescription drug benefits to retirees. Non-cash mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in several power contracts totaled $31 million and power outages in São Luís and Rockdale negatively impacted results by $17 million. Lastly, an increase in the Grasse River environmental remediation accrual totaled $11 million. The net of these items totaled $295 million or $0.29 per share.Now let's move to the sequential bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and special items. Higher realized alumina and aluminum pricing was partially offset by the non-recurrence of a LIFO benefit in the previous quarter. We generated significant productivity gains through continued execution of our Cash Sustainability initiatives. You can clearly see that we've been able to hold our productivity gains from last year and increase our level of savings despite headwinds from lower volumes and higher energy. As a reference point, sequential increases in the average price of oil was up approximately 4% and natural gas, 1%. Before moving to the segments, I'd like to review our key net income sensitivities. This slide shows you our two key sensitivities: aluminum and currency. These sensitivities help you provide directional guidance on how changing metal price and then currencies impact our bottom line.The aluminum sensitivity is inclusive of all LME-linked elements in our revenue and cost structure: alumina, aluminum and LME-linked power. This sensitivity based on a 15-day lag LME price. The currency's sensitivities reflect on different economic exposures. For the most part, our non-U.S. operations generate U.S. dollar revenues from alumina and aluminum, but pay expenses in local currency. It should be no surprise that the Aussie dollar sensitivity is our highest given the large operating base we have in Australia. We will include this sensitivity table in the appendix going forward for your reference.Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Alumina. Alumina pricing trended high in the quarter, yielding a 13% increase in our realized price. Production was slightly lower sequentially as a power outage in São Luís and many outages in Australia offset increases at Point Comfort. The power outage, which occurred in early February, negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million. Juruti negatively impacted the quarter by $20 million and higher energy costs totaled $15 million. As noted on the bridge, the fourth quarter charge for a tax settlement and our MRN partnership did not recur.Moving to the outlook, alumina pricing will follow the 60-day lag. Lower caustic cost will flow through the system and we will continue to benefit from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. As we look at all of our operating conditions that we have across our system, we would expect production to increase by approximately 100,000 tons versus the first quarter.Let's move to the Primary segment. The first quarter performance benefited from an 8% increase in the realized price, favorable currency benefits and productivity gains. As you'll recall, the fourth quarter included a $250 million charge related to the drawback from the Italian power case. The decline in third-party shipments was predominately driven by a significant reduction in buy/re-sell activity. Margin-neutral buy/re-sell totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a decline of 158,000 tons sequentially. Higher power costs were incurred, particularly in Italy, as new power tariffs took effect. Also, although smelting activity at our Rockdale facility has been curtailed, we continue to have power-generation activities at this site. A maintenance outage conducted during the quarter negatively impacted sequential performance by $11 million. Looking to the second quarter, we expect our realized pricing to follow a 15-day lag and continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Unfortunately, the power station in Rockdale continues to struggle. The master agreement with USW, which covers 5,350 employees, expires on May 31. While we are confident that a mutually acceptable agreement will be reached, actions are being taken to ensure business continuity if any disruptions should occur.Lastly, we expect production to be equal to the first quarter. Beginning next year, we expect ongoing cost reductions from the closures announced this quarter of approximately $15 million annually, largely comprised of the cessation of depreciation and other holding costs. Now let's move to the Flat-Rolled Products segment. Flat-Rolled Products ATOI declined $7 million sequentially, largely driven by lower volumes from our decision to curtail sales to our North American can sheet customer. In can sheet, we reduced headcount and capacity to bring our cost structure more in line with current volumes. This effort and improved pricing on new contracts helped to mitigate the impact of reduced volumes. The net impact on our North American can sheet operations was $22 million sequentially. Overall, higher pricing, improved product mix and Cash Sustainability initiatives more than offset the higher energy costs and negative currency impact we experienced in the quarter. Next quarter, we expect continued gains from Cash Sustainability initiatives. Key end markets will improve. However, our can sheet volumes will remain at lower levels.Now let's move to the Engineered Products and Solutions. ATOI of $81 million was up 42% sequentially despite lower sales. Strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiative helped generate ATOI percent of 7.5% equal to the first quarter of 2009 when sales were $200 million higher. These results clearly illustrate how this business has structurally improved its cost position. Revenue fell 2% sequentially as continued weakness in the IGT and building and construction markets was partially offset by volume increases in the industrial and commercial transportation markets. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiative and slight improvements in overall market conditions. Let's now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we produced cash from operations of $199 million. The largest single contributor to this sequential change in CFO was due to working capital. Working capital increased by $336 million as we are carrying higher inventories to meet rising demand levels. Our typical first quarter inventory build was managed diligently with the tools and insights gained from last year. In fact, on a days basis, the first quarter of 2009, we moved 13 days of working capital. We improved that 13 days of working capital versus last year. And we made improvement in each one of our groups. In the GPP group, which is the Primary group, it improved days of working capital 27 days. Flat-Rolled Products was down 27 days and EPS was down 14 days. Capital expenditures totaled $221 million. Including the net investment in Ma'aden, which flows through other investing activities, CapEx totaled $281 million. This keeps us on track against our 2010 target of $1.25 billion. Free cash flow in the first quarter was essentially breakeven, so let me take a minute and summarize. I'll remind everybody that we've got a target to be free cash flow positive in 2010. All of our cash sustainability initiatives are centered on driving free cash flow and structurally improving our ability to drive bottom line growth. We've made outstanding progress in reducing our cost of purchased goods and lowering our overhead spend. And we've been able to sustain the gains that we made in 2009. We're judiciously deploying capital and managing working capital effectively, keeping overall days low on a relative basis. We're aggressively pursuing our cash sustainability targets to generate higher levels of free cash flow and drive near-term and long-term value to shareholders. I'd now like to turn it over to Klaus."

And welcome, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. I guess what you've seen already from the press release, and Chuck went through it more in-depth, is we've all to use +this quarter to continue to improve the bottom line and to drive towards our 2010 goals. I'd like to guide through a couple of things here. It starts in the usual fashion with an overview on the end markets as well as on the aluminum markets, including the supply and demand side. And then, I'd like to give you a deeper insight into our main businesses and look at the drivers that there are to get to a more normalized performance. That's a question that, when we've been on the road talking to investors, was asked a lot and we thought that, that's important for all of you to understand, to better understand what is really the value creation potential that Alcoa has here. So let's start with the end markets in the usual fashion. So 2010, we expect the economy to continue to improve slightly. Let's start with aerospace. Large commercial aircrafts, we are projecting deliveries to be essentially flat compared to 2009. We see that most of the airlines stand by their orders and they continue to stand by it, main reasons for that being the fuel efficiency of new planes. Some actually receive substantial subsidies from government export credit agencies and some just want to avoid losing their deposits through the cancellation. If you look at the airline economics, they actually look improved compared to the fourth quarter, are 30% improved. But at the same time, the projection is that all of the airline industry in total worldwide will continue to lose money, $2.8 billion projected in 2010. One thing that's always good to remind ourselves of, particularly here in this segment, is this is the order backlog of six years that Boeing and Airbus have in their books. If you look at another segment here on aerospace, regional and business jet, it doesn't look that good. We continue to see significant reductions of orders as well as deliveries. Lastly, what really counts for us is the de-stocking and we expect this to come to an end in the first half of 2010. That's the most important factor because it immediately is driving our core's profitability. The segments that are relevant for us and particularly are Sheets, Rolled Froducts, Aerospace, Foil and Fasteners. So we are profiting on a lot of ends and each one of those segments has its own dynamics. For instance, in airfoils, we already see a pretty substantial pickup, whereas in sheet, given the strong inventory levels at many places, we believe that, that's probably laggard.Automotive. Global automotive production expected to rebound in 2010 plus 9% is our expectation. 62.2 million vehicles, that's pretty much in every region except to Europe. And Europe, is because with the strong government incentive for last year demand was just pulled forward. But if you look at the 2010 levels, they are still way below 9%, below the 2007 peak level of 68 million vehicles.The vehicle inventory situation has fully corrected and we're now really witnessing real demand also in the U.S. If you saw what's happening here in the U.S. pretty much spurred by strong incentive programs, this time by the automakers, euro financing is the big thing today. And if you look at the March sales, you saw that the March sales for GM have been up 21%, for Ford, 40% and for Toyota, 40%. Obviously, from all this, the consumer is the beneficiary. He seems to be seeing it or she seems to be seeing it in the same way and is responding to that offer with real demand. Heavy truck and trailer, next segment, expect a slow recovery versus 2009 low. We see 10% increase in production in 2010 to a 1.3 million units level. If you look at the U.S., we see growth, on the one hand, freight miles are slowly recovering and the freight rates are increasing. On a year-on-year basis, we saw an increase of 18.6%. But let's make no mistake, I mean, we're talking about numbers that are well below the historic norms, particularly given the overhang that exists here on the trucking fleet side. For the U.S., the projection is higher than 23,000 units versus the 225,000 as the historic norm.Beverage can packaging global market, we believe will contribute to be flat versus 2009 level. And we will continue to follow our strategy to partner with those can sheet customers that understand and value Alcoa's unmatched quality, as well as our service capability, as well as our unique strength to continue to innovate in that segment. We will continue to particularly work with those that use packaging and sustainability as their strong profit drivers because that is the match that makes sense for us and generates value on both sides.From the commercial building and construction side in North America, a significant decline. We expect it to be 25%. And most of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Funds (sic) [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Funds] are going into highways and not buildings. So that is not working very much as a counterbalance here. Europe, expected to decline too, a little less so as 5% is the expectation. And China and India are totally different picture, substantial growth in both of the market. Last but not least, industrial gas turbines. Heavy-duty gas turbine builds are expected to decline, we think 25% to 30% versus 2009. Orders are postponed or deferred mainly driven by a slower economic growth and that then being reflected in lower electricity demand on the short term, and driven also by uncertainty about emissions regulations. For Alcoa, the most important thing is the de-stocking of the OEM. That's, again here, the major short-term impact. And mid to long term, our forecast is bullish on the industrial gas turbine. And I would even say, it has been become even more bullish if you look at the structural changes that are happening in this market, the substantial price decline in natural gas given to the innovation and the finds of shale gas, low capital cost requirements for gas turbine or combined cycle power plant, the flexibility, the short lead times and the environmental advantages, for instance, versus coal. And if you sum up the whole end-market situation, the way I would see it is, is I would say, end markets continue to strengthen. In the main, 2010 would clearly be better than 2009, but it's going to be below historic norms in many of the markets.So let's go to aluminum and let's have the next chart on here. We expect the consumption to grow by 10% in 2010. This is pretty much the view that we already have shown you in the fourth quarter announcement, and very strongly driven by China. If you look at the growth rate in China, in the first quarter, of 37% growth rate, we expect that to normalize. And our projection here is that over the course of the year, we would see 18%. And this is probably a conservative assumption, given what we're seeing in China these days.If you look at further up here, North America and look at the current year-on-year number for the U.S., it has been 3%. We project the 5% over the course of the full year. Strong growth in Japan, year-on-year, 23%. Our expectation for Asia, without China, is 6%. And even in Europe, I have to say, we've seen a year-on-year growth of 20%. Our expectation here is 3%. So that's where this stands, so 10%. And if you would take China out, it's 5%. Let's go to the inventory conditions. I'll lead you through the chart. It looks more complicated than it really is. On the left-hand side, we have condensed pretty much the most important inventory levels. And as demand has been growing, we also see a modest increase in port inventories in China, as well as in Japan, as well as a very modest increase in producer stock. At the same time, we see a counter-effect on the LME stocks. They have declined by roughly 40,000 tons in this quarter. So overall, if you look at the accumulation, overall, it's been a pretty flat inventory situation. When you then go to the right-hand side and look at the regional premiums that we have been tracking for a while here, and you can see the curves there, what happens here is you have, on the one hand, an improved real demand, strong interest continues from financial participants, logistic constraints, distributor stocks are low, USA distributor stocks are at an all-time low. All of that together really leads to a very tight supply chain situation and continues to drive the regional premiums, as you see them here coming up or kind of being stable on a pretty high level. The next one, let's move to the demand and the supply side situation. This is the chart for aluminum, and that we believe, we have to really see the China and the Western world separately. In the main, we project for the whole world an overhang here of 1.2 million tons in 2010, and I'll qualify that a little bit later. So for China, if you look at the left-hand side, you see a small surplus, a little bit bigger than what we saw, actually, end of last year. But very frankly, I mean, I could go through the details, if anybody's interested in that, later on. But frankly, I'm not at all and we're not at all concerned about that. What we've seen here with China, in the worst of all downturns, they have been very, very good at managing their supply and demand balance. And they've been very agile and very, very fast in responding here. So I would be very sure that this surplus is really only temporary. If you go on the right-hand side, on the Western side, what you see here is pretty much a function of new greenfield smelter starting up mainly in the Middle East, some in India, in additional giving us a 745,000 metric tons additional supply. And then the combination of small restarts in Europe, mainly offset by the curtailment in Venezuela, given the drought situation, given that this is hydro powered.If you look at the total surplus of 1.2 million, if you add those 400,000 and the 830,000 up, let's all here remind ourselves, we're talking about a two-week consumption in our market. So this is the amount that we're talking about. So that's a pretty manageable number. And actually, our projections here don't even include a restocking of the supply chain, and as yet was used as, just in the slide before that, on the U.S. distributor stock, we are at an all-time low. Now let's go to the next slide, which basically shows the same thing for the supply/demand balance for alumina. Alumina has a global market. That's why we don't really see that as two separate markets here. And I don't even need to go into the details. I mean, the numbers show it by themselves, as supply/demand is balanced in 2010, and that's what we expect and that's also what we've been seeing in the market. And I'll come to some of those aspects when we talk about our business a little bit more. So, so much, that closes the part on the market. So let's now move on to talking about Alcoa. And as I said early on, I mean, one of the questions that Chuck and I have been asked a lot in many, many conversations with you all out there is saying, ""Well, on the one hand, we have this enormous overshadowing here by the downturn."" And the way that Alcoa got through it and most people give us good credit for it, but they say, ""We don't fully understand how all of that leads into the normalization of your profit capabilities."" And at the same time, I think everybody sees also that we've used the downturn to streamline our portfolio to lower our costs systemically. And obviously, also, that goes into the whole equation to drive performance. So I want to do -- the first slide is already up, and I'm going to lead you through it. So I want to use four slides, basically, going through the four businesses, and show you what we see when we look at it from our internal perspective as the main value drivers in here. So the chart that's up here is on the Alumina business. Keep in mind, we are the clear market leader in the Alumina business, and not only are we the market leader, volume wise, but our system is one of the most competitive systems, the largest and the most competitive one, because we are positioned, on average, in the lowest quartile on the cost curve. As you can see here, on the left-hand side, that's the cost curve. We have two cost curves there, the 2009, one in the 2000. And I'll refer to it a little later, why we put the 2000 in there. Our total capacity is 18.1 million tons. We've grown in the last year by roughly 2 million tons, basically by taking the partner out into Ralco and completing our São Luis/Juruti expansion. And we will add more 450,000 tons when, in 2014, Ma'aden comes online, the refinery and the mine, come online. And you can see this little green red dot there on the left-hand side on the refining curve. So that will be the new position that Ma'aden will have on the cost curve, and literally, extends the cost curve further down and sets a new low-cost point.Well, that's all good, but we've also done other things on the operational side. If you look at the alumina conversion costs, we've brought the alumina conversion costs down by 18% since the fourth quarter in '08. And if you go over to the lower right-hand side, which says Alcoa third-party alumina sales percent of LME, we've indexed that, and you have a 10-year history here of the contract pricing for Alcoa. As you know, it's done as a percentage of aluminum. And you see your trends there. And if you look at the most recent contract prices that we have been able to achieve, they've been upward the 15% LME. All of this is a clear reflection, we continue to have a tight market or we even have a tighter market. We have also, on the other hand, rising alumina costs. And that's the reason, if you go back to the left-hand side through the cost curve, why we put the comparison, the gray curve, the 2000 curve in there because you can see -- and we put the two 50 percentile points in there so you can see what happened here over this course of the 10 years. The cost in the alumina sector have increased substantially, about 50%. The midpoint has moved up by 50%. So on the one hand, I mean, going back to the pricing levels, I think we see here, on the one hand, the tight market, on the other hand, rising alumina costs putting pressure on the pricing, and also, have we changed over on the frequency of our contract pricing. So all of that together has led to good things happening there. And the good things happening there, you see reflected on the upper right-hand side, where you see the EBITDA per metric ton for alumina also over a 10-year period, and then looking at the first quarter performance, you already see that this is trending into the right direction. But you also, on the other hand, see, if you look at the whole light blue bars there, that by no means are we talking about a normalized performance here. And the prices are high, yes. But at the same time, costs have also risen, and we believe there is upside potential in here and we're going to continue to see upside here. And in the end, I mean, there's not that much good bauxite available, particularly when you want it close to refining, and when you want the refinery close to a port and when you want this being close to consumers. Add it all together, that determines where you are on the cost curve, right? It's not just about having something there. It's really on what you have there. And all of that will continue to lead into pretty substantial tightness, in our view, and continue to drive prices. So let's sum it up. We are very well-positioned here and we've got substantial upside on the alumina side. Let's go to the next one. Aluminum, right? On the aluminum side, our system is about 4.5 million tons capacity. We have current utilization rate of 80% versus the pre-crisis level of 2008. In 2008, we produced about 4 million tons. We added roughly 300,000 tons with Elkem and with Ma'aden. Once Ma'aden comes online, we will add another 186,000 tons to our smelting system. And again here, you'd see those little green dot here on the left-hand side, where it says global primary cost curve. That little green dot means the cost position of Ma'aden, setting a new low-cost point, which is obviously, a very, very good thing to happen, right?At the same time here, when you want to measure, what have we done operationally? Conversion cost is a good measure. We've brought conversion cost down for aluminum by 21%, compared to the fourth quarter in '08. And also, important here is power. We've secured a competitive power for 85% of our smelter system until 2025 and even longer, but minimum, 2025. That determines that. So then when you go to the upper right-hand side, you see again, the EBITDA margin, this time for aluminum. And you can clearly see, we've made solid progress in the fourth quarter, but far from a normalized level. And we believe that prices also here will be rising partially, also because of the cost pressure. We also have, on the left-hand side here, put the 2000 cost curve, and then you can see almost the same phenomenon that I already described on the alumina side, the 50% increase here of the midpoint. So with all of that, we believe that with all of that, plus our improved position, our better costs and the market price is trending up, we believe that, on a normalized level, this will go substantially up. And I want to remind you, just take a little step back, and that little charge here on the right lower corner is very, very powerful and important to understand.  Let's take a little step back and think about what is really done with aluminum. And I think that when you look at reports, there's almost a consensus in the world that you will have probably, over a long period of time, 6% annual growth, normalized, so to say, in this market, right? If you have 6% growth in this market, let's be realistic and see what that means, in terms of additional need for supply. This would actually mean that we would have, or somebody else would have to build 2.3 million tons per year of new capacity. This would mean three new Ma'aden smelters per year. This would mean four new São Luis expansions per year. It will mean 20 new gas turbines per year. Or for those of you who love hydropower, two new Hoover Dams built every year. And it would mean equal $30 billion that would have to be put into the ground as infrastructure investment. While looking at that, I am pretty confident that the supply-demand situation is heavily biased towards a tight situation, because it's not very likely that this will be doable in this world, right? Therefore, I'm pretty convinced that we will continue to see pressure on the prices here, going forward.So next one is rolled products. On the rolled product side, let me start on the right upper-hand side where you have, again, the profitability. If you look at the profitability here in the first year, is you'll see that this is a business that has had profit margins at around 10-plus percent, right? And 2005, we started investing in the growth markets, China and Russia, and that has brought the margins down. And where do we stand today, strategically? The Russian can sheet mill is fully operational. China Bohai is ramping up. Full ramp-up will be done by 2011. By the way, I forgot to mention, on Russia, that it's the first time this quarter that they have been able to get breakeven, right? We also have lowest conversion costs on Ma'aden once the mill goes online in 2013, plus we've used the downturn to re-engineer the businesses. We strengthened our position, exited commoditized markets, exited foil, a chronic underperformer, headcount reduction of 5,000 people. To just put it in perspective, we're talking about 25% of the total headcount here that we've done. Overhead costs are down $140 million. And if you look at the left-hand side with the third-party sales structure, given that we are going through the downturn, that we continue to see some de-stocking going on and that we have lost one can sheet customer, we are currently at a utilization rate of 75%. That is not a normalized level. We believe a normalized level would rather be around 90% in aerospace. We've seen years like in 2005 where we have been at 100%, right? So all of these parts together, I mean, if you put them all together, I believe that all of those actions show that we have set flat-rolled products on a path to become a strong performance contributor going forward.Last but not least, Engineered Product and Solution business. Let me start on the left-hand side. Where do we stand currently? We stand at a 70% utilization rate on aerospace and a 65% utilization on the rest of the group. And if you see that and now go to the right-hand side, the EBITDA margin performance, when you look at the first quarter, the one that we report about now, 14%, just shy of the 2008 15%, with this type of utilization rate, obviously, it points to a very strong cost cutting that has happened here. Very, very good performance. When you look on top of it, to the strategic position that we have in engineered products and solution, we have unequal technological capabilities that put us in a position to create value for the customers of our customers. We have focused the portfolio today, 85% of the sales are a #1 or #2 market leader positions. $440 million for activity improvement in 2009. Aerospace de-stocking, as I said early on, is improving, and we believe it's going to come to an end in first half 2010. We also see significant short-term profit accelerators. Just to give you a few, 787 and A380 to mention some. We are in that with special alloys, unique fasteners, as well as with airfoils. Joint strike fighter, we're in it with alloys, structures and fasteners. Heavy truck market is recovering. We have Dura-Bright capabilities on quoting LvL ONE outstanding wheels. And on top of it, we've shown that we also are very capable of doing inorganic growth, with the integration of the 2000 acquisitions, Van Petty and Republic, which has really been done almost flawlessly. We will continue, in this group, to look for additional growth and build on our strengths that we have there, whether it be organic or inorganic. Let's sum this all up. I hope that all of this information is valuable for you to understand, where is the performance, as you have always asked, on a normalized level? As the economy comes back, utilization will go up. And we've used the downturn to improve our position with a better portfolio, with better cost and with future growth like Ma'aden, which is substantially going to increase our competitiveness. All of that together will drive the value of our business and of our performance.Let's look at this year. Real quickly, where do we stand, in regards to the targets that we've set ourselves, to increase our operations in 2010. On the procurement side, $505 million, target is $2.5 billion, $5.5 million year-to-date and the first quarter looks good. We're well on track overhead. We're going to bring it down by $500 million this year. We've achieved $127 million in the first quarter, looks good.Total CapEx, this targets include about $250 million for Ma'aden. We're trending in the right direction, in line with expectations. And last, but not least, on the working capital side, Chuck noted that there's an increase in days, compared to the fourth quarter, which is kind of typical for the first quarter. But if you'd look at a year-on-year basis, you actually see that we have taken out 13 days in working capital turns. That's a big success of the cash sustainability initiative. We're on target to continue to reduce this, and to get the two days out of the working capital turns that we have been shooting for and aiming for this year. Let's get to an end and summarize that. The environment is stabilizing. We will be capitalizing on this while we are managing headwinds like currency and energy. We're exceeding our goals. Talking to Alcoans all around the world, they know that we have the future in our hands. They are very proud of the almost flawless execution that we've shown in 2009, and they want to repeat it in 2010. 2010, as a year, we have a great team. We have an outstanding portfolio. We have an unwavering commitment to make this happen again to improve costs and to profitably grow. All of that growth, we can be very happy about our portfolio there, global alumina leader, we can leverage our base; continue to improve our situation in aluminum-rolled products led you through that profitability can be revitalized; and EPS, we can use the leadership position that we have to continue to grow. With all that said, we are committed to create value for 2010 and forward, and even more strongly so. Let me close with that and open up the lines for questions and answers."

On the Alumina pricing side, I mean the thing that I can say already today and you saw that in my Alumina chart, that's why we put that in there, you can clearly see that the pricing is trending upwards. So obviously the tightening that exists in the Alumina market is reflected in a stronger percentage through the LME. And as I've said, I mean the recent contracts that we signed up have been upwards 15%, which I think is also, historically, a pretty, pretty good number. We also have gone away from longer-term contracts to more of a shorter-term contractual obligations to profit from the different pricing situations. And on top of that, I believe that we're going to see much more upside trends here. As I've said early on, there isn't that many good bauxite reserves that are close enough to a refinery, so the transportation costs are not shooting through the roof and close enough to a port, and then the port close enough to end customers. When you put those equations all together, that's not that easy to do right. So we believe it's going to be trending up. On the iron ore situation, first of all, I don't know the market well enough, so I wouldn't be the best one to talk about it. But I would say that this is what I just said, it's the fair description of what we see in the Alumina side. Chuck, you want to take the other one?"

But given that this was the question that, I think, we've all been much more nervous about when we went into the downturn, and given that when we went into the downturn, I mean everybody was afraid that this overhang would depress the market and prices would not come back at all, I think what we're seeing now is that our estimate that quite a majority of the LME is either through financial transactions or through logistics constraints bound for at least a while in the warehouse. And the while, in my view, I would put a frame around it between three to six months as a start to probably 18 months, and I would say the majority of what we see there probably has those. We know of some transactions that even have a longer timeframe behind there. But I don't believe, Curt, not only do I not believe, I know by having looked into this that it is virtually impossible for this to all come out at the same time, and that's exactly why you are continuing to see these regional price premiums continuing to go up pretty much, right? The tightness is there. And also keep in mind, we've also seen not only real demand coming back pretty substantially and I think that's going to get stronger going forward, but at the same time, financial investors have also strengthened their positions here and very often driven by a view on where else would you get value if you want to hold on to something other than a currency denomination, right?"

I think the first thing that I would want to give you as an explanation is this aspect of the cans on the packaging side that we made a purposeful decision to discontinue once we had the chance to discontinue with the large contract with one of our customers on the can sheet side. It was a 10-year contract. It had a lot of aspects in there that in total, I mean lots of quite a bit of money over that 10-year timeframe. And as painful as it is to make a decision like that and then having to curtail some capacity as appropriate and right, I believe it is, if you want to substantially make sure that you have a profitability structure of your business, that is a solid foundation for investments and being in that business, right? So that's the first thing. So I mean the 75% utilization is obviously overshadowed by that part, right? The second part, I think I talked about aerospace already. I mean aerospace is coming back. I said it's probably a laggard on the sheet and rolled side given that there are pretty heavy inventory levels that we've seen in aerospace. And the third point I would add here is the reason why the profitability has come down from this 10% to 11% rate at that time when we had a higher cost structure even was the investment in China and Russia, right? And that is now coming online. And so as I said, we've seen Russia in this quarter breaking even. Kunshan is operating into the automotive market in China, and it's operating real nicely. It's a hot market obviously in China. Bohai is coming up. And as I said before, we believe that the full ramp, we will be seeing in 2011 and obviously, that would then give us also the fruits there. And the fruits will be nicer than what we've seen before because we've reached a lower cost level. That's the way I would portray it, John."

I'd try to answer it in two chunks. One, and as I said earlier on and I think also in conversations with you earlier, I mean sometimes you have to make a tough decision to change a pretty nasty situation that we have there. And we are not an employment company. We're not in a business to just produce something and lose money with it. And that's been the situation that we had with this contract. So I think we got to be reasonable. On top of it, and if you look at the performance of Alcoa, I think you can ask pretty much everybody who's out there and understands the Can Sheet business, we are clearly the quality leader. On top of it, we provide service, and we have a huge innovation potential, which I don't think anybody else has. Some have seen some other aluminum packaging that are pretty innovative and drive really also market share for companies. So that's the discussion that we continue to have. And I have a hard time to project where this is going. I still hope that we will be able to re-establish the relationship there and help both ends because I believe this can easily be turned into a win-win situation. On your second part of the question, is there enough capacity out there? Well, I mean some people have taken in large contracts and have highly publicized that, and are now in a situation that they have to deliver, and they have to deliver, as you know, flawless quality.

Thanks, Matt. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. We've got some detail in this quarter. I'm going to take my time going through that, the bridges and the reconciliation sheet of the restructuring special items. I'm also going to give you some additional disclosure around our sensitivities today. But let me start off with by first saying that our improved operating result reflects increased profitabilities that we gained through a strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Our realized aluminum pricing is hitting the bottom line and we are overcoming increased energy cost and reduced volumes.  Now let's go to the first quarter overview. In the first quarter, higher realized LME [London Metal Exchange] pricing and the continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives drove significant improvements in the cost of goods sold and SGA [Smelting Grade Alumina] percentages of sales; the combination of which generated EBITDA of $596 million, which is the highest level since the third quarter of 2008. Higher energy costs, lower volumes, predominantly can sheet, both negatively impacted results. Our loss from continuing operations of $194 million or $0.19 per share included restructuring and special items, totaling $295 million or $0.29 per share. I'll review these items in more detail in just a bit.  Lastly, debt to cap improved to 38.1%,  and liquidity remained strong with $1.3 billion of cash on hand.      Let's move to the next slide, which illustrates market activity in our businesses. Revenues in many of our markets have improved relative to last year, while others, namely, aerospace and IGT [industrial gas turbine], continued to experience supply chain de-stocking and low levels of demand. The declines in packaging were expected due to our decision to curtail can sheet volumes to our North American supply base. This decision contributed to a reduction in flat-rolled product shipments of roughly 75,000 tons. The sequential declines in our third-party alumina and primary metal sales reflect higher internal shipments to meet improved order rates and the anticipated reduction in buy/re-sell activity to more normal levels. Buy/re-sell totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a reduction of 158,000 tons sequentially. On a sequential basis, aerospace was essentially flat as de-stocking activity begins to slow and supply levels stabilize. Weak demand in IGT and building and construction continues to drive revenue declines in these markets. Now let's review the financials. I'll highlight some key items for you as you have the detailed income statement in the press release. Third-party revenues declined 10% sequentially as increases in internal shipments in alumina and lower can sheet volumes more than offset the benefit of higher pricing. Note that the reduction in buy/re-sell activity contributed to half of the revenue decline. COGS as a percent of sales fell to 82.1% driven through continued progress in our cash sustainability initiatives. As you'll recall, COGS in the fourth quarter included charges related to our Italian operations, the MRN tax settlement and the impact of buy/re-sell activity, all of which accounted for 6.7 percentage points of the COGS percent decline.On a percent-of-sales basis, SG&A improved by 0.5 percentage points sequentially as we continued to aggressively reduce overhead spend. And lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was a negative 95.5%. For your reference, we've attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate. Included in the tax rate this quarter are discrete tax items totaling $112 million, which I will detail on the next slide. Going forward, we expect our operational ETR to be approximately 32%. However, we will continue to experience swings in rate given the volatility in our profit drivers and overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction. Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter. Okay, this slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location on the financial statements. Restructuring-related items of $119 million primarily relates to the permanent closure of certain curtailed U.S. locations, including the Badin and Eastalco smelters. This decision was made after an assessment of the sustained competitiveness of each facility was completed based on factors including market fundamentals, other idle capacity, the cost structure and future capital investment. The discrete tax items include $79 million related to the recently-enacted health care legislation. The legislation changed the tax treatment of the federal subsidy offered to companies that provided Medicare Part D-equivalent prescription drug benefits to retirees. Non-cash mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in several power contracts totaled $31 million and power outages in São Luís and Rockdale negatively impacted results by $17 million. Lastly, an increase in the Grasse River environmental remediation accrual totaled $11 million. The net of these items totaled $295 million or $0.29 per share.Now let's move to the sequential bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and special items. Higher realized alumina and aluminum pricing was partially offset by the non-recurrence of a LIFO benefit in the previous quarter. We generated significant productivity gains through continued execution of our Cash Sustainability initiatives. You can clearly see that we've been able to hold our productivity gains from last year and increase our level of savings despite headwinds from lower volumes and higher energy. As a reference point, sequential increases in the average price of oil was up approximately 4% and natural gas, 1%. Before moving to the segments, I'd like to review our key net income sensitivities. This slide shows you our two key sensitivities: aluminum and currency. These sensitivities help you provide directional guidance on how changing metal price and then currencies impact our bottom line.The aluminum sensitivity is inclusive of all LME-linked elements in our revenue and cost structure: alumina, aluminum and LME-linked power. This sensitivity is based on a 15-day-lagged LME price. The currency's sensitivities reflect on different economic exposures. For the most part, our non-U.S. operations generate U.S. dollar revenues from alumina and aluminum, but pay expenses in local currency. It should be no surprise that the Aussie dollar sensitivity is our highest, given the large operating base we have in Australia. We will include this sensitivity table in the appendix going forward for your reference.Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Alumina. Alumina pricing trended high in the quarter, yielding a 13% increase in our realized price. Production was slightly lower sequentially, as a power outage in San Luis (sic) [São Luís] and maintenance outages in Australia offset increases at Point Comfort. The power outage, which occurred in early February, negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million. Juruti negatively impacted the quarter by $20 million, and higher energy costs totaled $15 million. As noted on the bridge, the fourth quarter charge for a tax settlement in our MRN [Mineração Rio do Norte] partnership did not recur.Moving to the outlook. Alumina pricing will follow the 60-day lag. Lower caustic cost will flow through the system, and we will continue to benefit from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. As we look at all of our operating conditions that we have across our system, we would expect production to increase by approximately 100,000 tons versus the first quarter.Let's move to the Primary segment. The first quarter performance benefited from an 8% increase in the realized price, favorable currency benefits and productivity gains. As you will recall, the fourth quarter included a $250 million charge related to the drawback from the Italian power case. The decline in third-party shipments was predominantly driven by a significant reduction in buy/re-sell activity. Margin-neutral buy/re-sell totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a decline of 158,000 tons sequentially. Higher power costs were incurred, particularly in Italy, as new power tariffs took effect. Also, although smelting activity at our Rockdale facility has been curtailed, we continue to have power-generation activities at this site. A maintenance outage conducted during the quarter negatively impacted sequential performance by $11 million. Looking to the second quarter, we expect our realized pricing to follow a 15-day lag and continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Unfortunately, the power station in Rockdale continues to struggle. The master agreement with USW [United Steelworkers], which covers 5,350 employees, expires on May 31. While we are confident that a mutually acceptable agreement will be reached, actions are being taken to ensure business continuity if any disruptions should occur.Lastly, we expect production to be equal to the first quarter. Beginning next year, we expect ongoing cost reductions from the closures announced this quarter of approximately $15 million annually, largely comprised of the cessation of depreciation and other holding costs. Now let's move to the Flat-Rolled Products segment. Flat-Rolled Products ATOI declined $7 million sequentially, largely driven by lower volumes from our decision to curtail sales to our North American can sheet customer. In can sheet, we've reduced headcount and capacity to bring our cost structure more in line with current volumes. This effort and improved pricing on new contracts helped to mitigate the impact of reduced volumes. The net impact on our North American can sheet operations was $22 million sequentially. Overall, higher pricing, improved product mix and Cash Sustainability initiatives more than offset the higher energy costs and negative currency impact we experienced in the quarter. Next quarter, we expect continued gains from Cash Sustainability initiatives. Key end markets will improve. However, our can sheet volumes will remain at lower levels.Now let's move to the Engineered Products and Solutions. ATOI of $81 million was up 42% sequentially despite lower sales. Strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiatives helped generate ATOI percent of 7.5% equal to the first quarter of 2009, when sales were $200 million higher. These results clearly illustrate how this business has structurally improved its cost position. Revenue fell 2% sequentially, as continued weakness in the IGT and building and construction markets was partially offset by volume increases in the industrial and commercial transportation markets. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives and slight improvements in overall market conditions. Let's now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we produced cash from operations of $199 million. The largest single contributor to this sequential change in CFO was due to working capital. Working capital increased by $336 million, as we are carrying higher inventories to meet rising demand levels. Our typical first quarter inventory build was managed diligently, with the tools and insights gained from last year. In fact, on a days basis, the first quarter of 2009, we moved 13 days of working capital. We improved that 13 days of working capital versus last year, and we made improvement in each one of our groups. In the GPP [Global Primary Products] group, which is the Primary group, it improved days of working capital 27 days. Flat-Rolled Products was down 27 days, and EPS was down 14 days. Capital expenditures totaled $221 million. Including the net investment in Ma'aden, which flows through other investing activities, CapEx totaled $281 million. This keeps us on track against our 2010 target of $1.25 billion. Free cash flow in the first quarter was essentially break even, so let me take a minute and summarize. I'll remind everybody that we've got a target to be free cash flow positive in 2010. All of our Cash Sustainability initiatives are centered on driving free cash flow and structurally improving our ability to drive bottom line growth. We've made outstanding progress in reducing our cost of purchased goods and lowering our overhead spend. And we've been able to sustain the gains that we made in 2009. We're judiciously deploying capital and managing working capital effectively, keeping overall days low on a relative basis. We're aggressively pursuing our cash sustainability targets to generate higher levels of free cash flow and drive near term and long-term value to shareholders. I'd now like to turn it over to Klaus."

And welcome, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. I guess what you've seen already from the press release, and Chuck went through it more in-depth, is we've also used this quarter to continue to improve the bottom line and to drive towards our 2010 goals. I'd like to guide through a couple of things here. It starts in the usual fashion with an overview on the end markets as well as on the aluminum markets, including the supply and demand side. And then, I'd like to give you a deeper insight into our main businesses, and look at the drivers that there are to get to a more normalized performance. That's a question that, when we've been on the road talking to investors, was asked a lot and we thought that, that's important for all of you to understand, to better understand what is really the value-creation potential that Alcoa has here. So let's start with the end markets in the usual fashion. So in 2010, we expect the economy to continue to improve slightly. Let's start with aerospace. Large commercial aircrafts, we are projecting deliveries to be essentially flat compared to 2009. We see that most of the airlines stand by their orders and they continue to stand by it, main reasons for that being the fuel efficiency of new planes. Some actually receive substantial subsidies from government export credit agencies, and some just want to avoid losing their deposits through the cancellation. If you look at the airline economics, they actually look improved compared to the fourth quarter, 30% improved. But at the same time, the projection is that all of the airline industry in total worldwide will continue to lose money, $2.8 billion projected in 2010. One thing that's always good to remind ourselves of, particularly here in this segment, is this is the order backlog of six years that Boeing and Airbus have in their books. If you look at another segment here on aerospace, regional and business jet, it doesn't look that good. We continue to see significant reductions of orders, as well as deliveries. Lastly, what really counts for us is a destocking, and we expect this to come to an end in the first half of 2010. That's the most important factor, because it immediately is driving Alcoa's profitability. The segments that are relevant for us and particularly are sheets, rolled products, aerospace, foil and fasteners. So we are profiting on a lot of ends, and each one of those segments has its own dynamics. For instance, in aerosfoils (sic) [aerofoils], we already see a pretty substantial pickup; whereas in sheet, given the strong inventory levels at many places, we believe that, that's probably laggard.Automotive. Global automotive production expected to rebound in 2010 plus 9% is our expectation, 62.2 million vehicles. That's pretty much in every region except Europe. And Europe is because with the strong government incentive for last year, demand was just pulled forward. But if you look at the 2010 levels, they are still way below 9%, below the 2007 peak levels of 68 million vehicles.The vehicle inventory situation has fully corrected, and we're now really witnessing real demand also in the U.S. If you saw what's happening here in the U.S., pretty much spurred by strong incentive programs, this time by the automakers. Euro financing is the big thing today. And if you look at the March sales, you saw that the March sales for GM have been up 21%; for Ford, 40%; and for Toyota, 40%. Obviously from all this, the consumer is the beneficiary. He seems to be seeing it, or she seems to be seeing it, in the same way and is responding to that offer with real demand. Heavy truck and trailer, next segment, expect a slow recovery versus the 2009 low. We see 10% increased production in 2010 to a 1.3 million units level. If you look at the U.S., we see growth. On the one hand, the freight miles are slowly recovering and the freight rates are increasing. On a year-on-year basis, we saw an increase of 18.6%. But let's make no mistake, I mean, we're talking about numbers that are well below the historic norms, particularly given the overhang that exists here on the trucking fleet side. For the U.S., the projection is higher than 23,000 units versus the 225,000 as the historic norm.Beverage can packaging global market, we believe will continue to be flat versus 2009 level. And we will continue to follow our strategy to partner with those can sheet customers that understand and value Alcoa's unmatched quality as well as our service capability, as well as our unique strength to continue to innovate in that segment. We will continue to particularly work with those that use packaging and sustainability as their strong profit drivers, because that is the match that makes sense for us and generates value on both sides.On the commercial building and construction side in North America, a significant decline. We expect it to be 25%. And most of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Funds are going into highways and not buildings. So that is not working very much as a counterbalance here. Europe, expected to decline too, a little less so as 5% is the expectation. And China and India, a totally different picture, substantial growth in both of the market. Last but not least, industrial gas turbines. Heavy-duty gas turbine builds are expected to decline, we think 25% to 30% versus 2009. Orders are postponed or deferred, mainly driven by a slower economic growth; and that then being reflected in the lower electricity demand on the short term, and driven also by uncertainty about emissions regulations. For Alcoa, the most important thing is the destocking of the OEM. That's, again here, the major short-term impact. And mid to long term, our forecast is bullish on the industrial gas turbine. And I would even say, it has been become even more bullish, if you look at the structural changes that are happening in this market: the substantial price decline in natural gas, given to the innovation and the finds of shale gas, low-capital cost requirements for gas turbine or combined cycle power plant, the flexibility, the short lead times and the environmental advantages, for instance, versus coal. If you sum up the whole end-market situation, the way I would see it is, is I would say, end markets continue to strengthen. In the main, 2010 would clearly be better than 2009, but it's going to be below historic norms in many of the markets.So let's go to aluminum, and let's have the next chart on here. We expect the consumption to grow by 10% in 2010. This is pretty much the view that we already have shown you in the fourth quarter announcement, and very strongly driven by China. If you look at the growth rate in China in the first quarter, a 37% growth rate. We expect that to normalize. And our projection here is that over the course of the year, we would see 18%. And this is probably a conservative assumption, given what we're seeing in China these days.If you look at further up here, North America, look at the current year-on-year number for the U.S., that's been 3%. We project the 5% over the course of the full year. Strong growth in Japan, year-on-year, 23%. Our expectation for Asia, without China, is 6%. And even in Europe, I have to say, we've seen a year-on-year growth of 20%. Our expectation here is 3%. So that's where this stands, so 10%. And if you would take China out, it's 5%. Let's go to the inventory conditions. I'll lead you through the chart. It looks more complicated than it really is. On the left-hand side, we have condensed pretty much the most important inventory levels. And as demand has been growing, we also see a modest increase in port inventories in China as well as in Japan, as well as a very modest increase in producer stock. At the same time, we see a counter-effect on the LME stocks. They have declined by roughly 40,000 tons in this quarter. So overall, if you look at the accumulation here, overall, it's been a pretty flat inventory situation. When you then go to the right-hand side and look at the regional premiums that we have been tracking for a while here, and you can see the curves there; what happens here is you have, on the one hand, an improved real demand, strong interest continues from financial participants, logistic constraints, distributor stocks are low, USA distributor stocks are at an all-time low. All of that together really leads to a very tight supply chain situation and continues to drive the regional premiums, as you see them here coming up or kind of being stable on a pretty high level. The next one, let's move to the demand and the supply side situation. This is the chart for aluminum, and that we believe we have to really see the China and the Western world separately. In the main, we project for the whole world an overhang here of 1.2 million tons in 2010, and I'll qualify that a little bit later. So for China, if you look at the left-hand side, you see a small surplus; a little bit bigger than what we saw, actually, end of last year. But very frankly, I mean, I could go through the details, if anybody's interested in that, later on. But frankly, I'm not at all, and we're not at all concerned about that. What we've seen here with China, in the worst of all downturns, they have been very, very good at managing their supply and demand balance. And they've been very agile and very, very fast in responding here. So I would be very sure that this surplus is really only temporary. If you go on the right-hand side, on the Western side, what you see here is pretty much a function of new greenfield smelter starting up mainly in the Middle East, some in India, in additional giving us a 745,000 metric tons additional supply. And then the combination of small restarts in Europe, mainly offset by the curtailment in Venezuela, given the drought situation, given that this is hydro powered.If you look at the total surplus of 1.2 million, if you add those 400,000 and the 830,000 up, let's all here remind ourselves, we're talking about a two-week consumption in our market. So this is the amount that we're talking about. So that's a pretty manageable number. And actually, our projections here don't even include a restocking of the supply chain, and as yet was used as, just in the slide before that, on the U.S. distributor stock, we are at an all-time low. Now let's go to the next slide, which basically shows the same thing for the supply/demand balance for alumina. Alumina has a global market. That's why we don't really see that as two separate markets here. And I don't even need to go into the details. I mean, the numbers show it by themselves, as supply/demand is balanced in 2010, and that's what we expect and that's also what we've been seeing in the market. And I'll come to some of those aspects when we talk about our business a little bit more. So, so much, that closes the part on the market. So let's now move on to talking about Alcoa. And as I said early on, I mean, one of the questions that Chuck and I have been asked a lot in many, many conversations with you all out there is saying, ""Well, on the one hand, we have this enormous overshadowing here by the downturn."" And the way that Alcoa got through it and most people give us good credit for it, but they say, ""We don't fully understand how all of that leads into the normalization of your profit capabilities."" And at the same time, I think everybody sees also that we've used the downturn to streamline our portfolio to lower our costs systemically. And obviously, also, that goes into the whole equation to drive performance. So I want to do -- the first slide is already up, and I'm going to lead you through it. So I want to use four slides, basically, going through the four businesses, and show you what we see when we look at it from our internal perspective as the main value drivers in here. So the chart that's up here is on the Alumina business. Keep in mind, we are the clear market leader in the Alumina business, and not only are we the market leader, volume wise, but our system is one of the most competitive systems, the largest and the most competitive one, because we are positioned, on average, in the lowest quartile on the cost curve. As you can see here, on the left-hand side, that's the cost curve. We have two cost curves there, the 2009, one in the 2000. And I'll refer to it a little later, why we put the 2000 in there. Our total capacity is 18.1 million tons. We've grown in the last year by roughly 2 million tons, basically by taking the partner out into Ralco and completing our São Luis/Juruti expansion. And we will add more 450,000 tons when, in 2014, Ma'aden comes online, the refinery and the mine, come online. And you can see this little green red dot there on the left-hand side on the refining curve. So that will be the new position that Ma'aden will have on the cost curve. It literally extends the cost curve further down, sets a new low-cost point.Well, that's all good, but we've also done other things on the operational side. If you look at the alumina conversion costs, we've brought the alumina conversion costs down by 18% since the fourth quarter in '08. And if you go over to the lower right-hand side, which says Alcoa third-party alumina sales percent of LME, we've indexed that. And you have a 10-year history here of the contract pricing for Alcoa. As you know, it's done as a percentage of aluminum. And you see your trend there. And if you look at the most recent contract prices that we have been able to achieve, they've been upward the 15% LME. All of this is a clear reflection, we continue to have a tight market or we even have a tighter market. We have also, on the other hand, rising alumina costs. And that's the reason, if you go back to the left-hand side, to the cost curve, why we put the comparison, the gray curve, the 2000 curve in there. Because you can see -- and we put the two 50 percentile points in there, so you can see what happened here over this course of the 10 years. The cost in the alumina sector have increased substantially, about 50%. The midpoint has moved up by 50%. So on the one hand, I mean, going back to the pricing levels, I think we see here, on the one hand, the tight market; on the other hand, rising alumina costs putting pressure on the pricing, and also, have we changed over on the frequency of our contract pricing. So all of that together has led to good things happening there. And the good things happening there, you see reflected on the upper right-hand side, where you see the EBITDA per metric ton for alumina also over a 10-year period. And then looking at the first quarter performance, you already see that this is trending into the right direction. But you also, on the other hand, see, if you look at the whole light blue bars there, that by no means are we talking about a normalized performance here. And the prices are high, yes. But at the same time, costs have also risen. And we believe there is upside potential in here, and we're going to continue to see upside here. In the end, I mean, there's not that much good bauxite available, particularly when you want it close to refining. And when you want the refinery close to a port and when you want this being close to consumers, add it all together, that determines where you are on the cost curve, right? It's not just about having something there. It's really on what you have there. And all of that will continue to lead into pretty substantial tightness, in our view, and continue to drive prices. So let's sum it up. We are very well positioned here, and we've got substantial upside on the alumina side. Let's go to the next one, aluminum, right? On the aluminum side, our system is about 4.5 million tons capacity. We have current utilization rate of 80% versus the pre-crisis level of 2008. In 2008, we produced about 4 million tons. We added roughly 300,000 tons with Elkem and with Ma'aden. Once Ma'aden comes online, we will add another 186,000 tons to our smelting system. And again here, you'd see those little green dot here on the left-hand side, where it says Global Primary Cost Curve. That little green dot means the cost position of Ma'aden, setting a new low-cost point, which is obviously, a very, very good thing to happen, right?At the same time here, when you want to measure, what have we done operationally, conversion cost is a good measure. We've brought conversion costs down for aluminum by 21% compared to the fourth quarter in '08. And also, important here is power. We've secured a competitive power for 85% of our smelter system until 2025 and even longer, but minimum, 2025. That determines that. So then when you go to the upper right-hand side, you see again, the EBITDA margin, this time for aluminum. And you can clearly see, we've made solid progress in the fourth quarter, but far from a normalized level. And we believe that prices also here will be rising partially, also because of the cost pressure. We also have, on the left-hand side here, put the 2000 cost curve. And then you can see almost the same phenomenon that I already described on the alumina side, a 50% increase here of the midpoint. So with all of that, we believe that with all of that, plus our improved position, our better costs and the market price is trending up, we believe that, on a normalized level, this will go substantially up. And I want to remind you, just take a little step back, and that little charge here on the right lower corner is very, very powerful and important to understand. And let's take a little step back and think about what is really done with aluminum. And I think that when you look at reports, there is almost a consensus in the world that you will have probably, over a long period of time, 6% annual growth, normalized, so to say, in this market, right? If you have 6% growth in this market, let's be realistic and see what that means, in terms of additional need for supply. This would actually mean that we would have or somebody else would have to build 2.3 million tons per year of new capacity. This would mean three new Ma'aden smelters per year. This would mean four new São Luis expansions per year. It will mean 20 new gas turbines per year. Or for those of you who love hydropower, two new Hoover Dams built every year. And it would mean equal $30 billion that would have to be put into the ground as infrastructure investment. While looking at that, I am pretty confident that the supply-demand situation is heavily biased towards a tight situation, because it's not very likely that this will be doable in this world, right? Therefore, I'm pretty convinced that we will continue to see pressure on the prices here, going forward.So next one is Rolled Products. On the Rolled Product side, let me start on the right upper-hand side where you have, again, the profitability. If you look at the profitability here in the first year, is you'll see that this is a business that has had profit margins in around 10-plus percent, right? And 2005, we started investing in the growth markets, China and Russia, and that has brought the margins down. Where do we stand today strategically? The Russian can sheet mill is fully operational. China, Bohai is ramping up. Full ramp-up will be done by 2011. By the way, I forgot to mention, on Russia, that it's the first time this quarter that they have been able to get break even, right? We also have lowest conversion costs on Ma'aden once the mill goes online in 2013. Plus, we've used the downturn to reengineer the businesses. We strengthened our position, exited commoditized market, exited foil, electronic underperformer, headcount reduction of 5,000 people. That's to just put it in perspective, we're talking about 25% of the total headcount here that we've done. Overhead costs are down $140 million. And if you look at the left-hand side with the third-party sales structure, given that we are going through the downturn, that we continue to see some de-stocking going on and that we have lost one can sheet customer, we are currently at a utilization rate of 75%. That is not a normalized level. We believe a normalized level would rather be around 90% in aerospace. We've seen years like in 2005 where we have been at 100%, right? So all of these parts together, I mean, if you put them all together, I believe that all of those actions show that we have set flat-rolled products on a path to become a strong performance contributor going forward.Last but not least, Engineered Product and Solution business. Let me start on the left-hand side. Where do we stand currently? We stand at a 70% utilization rate on aerospace and a 65% utilization on the rest of the group. And if you see that and now go to the right-hand side, the EBITDA margin performance, when you look at the first quarter, the one that we report about now, 14%, just shy of the 2008 15%, with this type of utilization rate, obviously, it points to a very strong cost cutting that has happened here. Very, very good performance. When you look on top of it, to the strategic position that we have in engineered products and solution, we have unequal technological capabilities that put us in a position to create value for the customers of our customers. We have focused the portfolio today, 85% of the sales are a #1 or #2 market leader positions. $440 million for activity improvement in 2009. Aerospace de-stocking, as I said early on, is improving, and we believe it's going to come to an end in first half 2010. We also see significant short-term profit accelerators. Just to give you a few, 787 and A380 to mention some. We are in that with special alloys, unique fasteners, as well as with airfoils. Joint strike fighter, we're in it with alloys, structures and fasteners. Heavy truck market is recovering. We have Dura-Bright capabilities on quoting LvL ONE outstanding wheels. And on top of it, we've shown that we also are very capable of doing inorganic growth, with the integration of the 2000 acquisitions, Van Petty and Republic, which has really been done almost flawlessly. We will continue, in this group, to look for additional growth and build on our strengths that we have there, whether it be organic or inorganic. Let's sum this all up. I hope that all of this information is valuable for you to understand, where is the performance, as you have always asked, on a normalized level? As the economy comes back, utilization will go up. And we've used the downturn to improve our position with a better portfolio, with better cost and with future growth like Ma'aden, which is substantially going to increase our competitiveness. All of that together will drive the value of our business and of our performance.Let's look at this year. Real quickly, where do we stand, in regards to the targets that we've set ourselves, to increase our operations in 2010. On the procurement side, $505 million, target is $2.5 billion, $5.5 million year-to-date and the first quarter looks good. We're well on track overhead. We're going to bring it down by $500 million this year. We've achieved $127 million in the first quarter, looks good.Total CapEx, this targets include about $250 million for Ma'aden. We're trending in the right direction, in line with expectations. And last, but not least, on the working capital side, Chuck noted that there's an increase in days, compared to the fourth quarter, which is kind of typical for the first quarter. But if you'd look at a year-on-year basis, you actually see that we have taken out 13 days in working capital turns. That's a big success of the cash sustainability initiative. We're on target to continue to reduce this, and to get the two days out of the working capital turns that we have been shooting for and aiming for this year. Let's get to an end and summarize that. The environment is stabilizing. We will be capitalizing on this while we are managing headwinds like currency and energy. We're exceeding our goals. Talking to Alcoans all around the world, they know that we have the future in our hands. They are very proud of the almost flawless execution that we've shown in 2009, and they want to repeat it in 2010. 2010, as a year, we have a great team. We have an outstanding portfolio. We have an unwavering commitment to make this happen again to improve costs and to profitably grow. All of that growth, we can be very happy about our portfolio there, global alumina leader. We can leverage our base, continue to improve our situation in aluminum-rolled products, led you through that. Profitability can be revitalized. And EPS, we can use the leadership position that we have to continue to grow. With all that said, we are committed to create value for 2010 and forward, and even more strongly so. Let me close with that, and open up the lines for questions and answers."

On the Alumina pricing side, I mean, the thing that I can say already today, and you saw that in my Alumina chart, that's why we put that in there, you can clearly see that the pricing is trending upwards. So obviously, the tightening that exists in the Alumina market is reflected in a stronger percentage through the LME. And as I've said, I mean, the recent contracts that we signed up have been upwards 15%; which I think is also historically, a pretty, pretty good number. We also have gone away from longer-term contracts to more of a shorter-term contractual obligations to profit from the different pricing situation. And on top of that, I believe that we're going to see much more upside trends here. As I've said early on, there isn't that many good bauxite reserves that are close enough to a refinery, so the transportation costs are not shooting through the roof and close enough to a port, and then the port close enough to end customers. When you put those equations all together, that's not that easy to do right. So we believe it's going to be trending up. On the iron ore situation, first of all, I don't know the market well enough, so I wouldn't be the best one to talk about it.

And the transparency is obviously not that great in there. But given that this was the question that, I think, we've all been much more nervous about when we went into the downturn, and given that when we went into the downturn, I mean everybody was afraid that this overhang would depress the market and prices would not come back at all, I think what we're seeing now is that our estimate that quite a majority of the LME is either through financial transactions or through logistics constraints bound for at least a while in the warehouse. And the while, in my view, I would put a frame around it between three to six months as a start to probably 18 months, and I would say the majority of what we see there probably has those. We know of some transactions that even have a longer timeframe behind there. But I don't believe, Curt, not only do I not believe, I know by having looked into this that it is virtually impossible for this to all come out at the same time, and that's exactly why you are continuing to see these regional price premiums continuing to go up pretty much, right? The tightness is there. And also keep in mind, we've also seen not only real demand coming back pretty substantially and I think that's going to get stronger going forward, but at the same time, financial investors have also strengthened their positions here and very often driven by a view on where else would you get value if you want to hold on to something other than a currency denomination, right?"

You've got 3003 prices moving up roughly $0.20 quarter-over-quarter; orders up through February, about 20%, so a very strong market. And yet, if we're to judge by your shipments of flat-rolled products in the first quarter, your utilization  rate is actually going down.

I think the first thing that I would want to give you as an explanation is this aspect of the cans on the packaging side, that we made the purposeful decision to discontinue once we had the chance to discontinue with the large contract with one of our customers on the can sheet side, was a 10-year contract. It had a lot of aspects in there that in total, I mean, lost us quite a bit of money over that 10-year time frame. And as painful as it is to make a decision like that and then having to curtail some capacity as appropriate and right, I believe it is, if you want to substantially make sure that you have a profitability structure of your business, that is a solid foundation for investments and being in that business, right? So that's the first thing. So I mean, the 75% utilization is obviously overshadowed by that part, right? The second part, I think I talked about aerospace already. I mean, aerospace is coming back. I said it's probably a laggard on the sheet and rolled side, given that there are pretty heavy inventory levels that we've seen in aerospace. And the third point I would add here is the reason why the profitability has come down from this 10% to 11% rate at that time, when we had a higher cost structure even, was the investment in China and Russia, right? And that is now coming online. And so as I've said, we've seen Russia in this quarter be breaking even. Kunshan is operating into the automotive market in China, and is operating real nicely. It's a hot market obviously in China. Bohai is coming up. And as I've said before, we believe that the full ramp-up we will be seeing in 2011. And obviously, that would then give us also the fruits there. And the fruits will be nicer than what we've seen before, because we've reached a lower cost level. That's the way I would portray it, John."

I'd try to answer it in two chunks. One, and as I said earlier on and I think also in conversations with you earlier, I mean sometimes you have to make a tough decision to change a pretty nasty situation that we have there. And we are not an employment company. We're not in a business to just produce something and lose money with it. And that's been the situation that we had with this contract. So I think we got to be reasonable. On top of it, and if you look at the performance of Alcoa, I think you can ask pretty much everybody who's out there and understands the Can Sheet business, we are clearly the quality leader. On top of it, we provide service, and we have a huge innovation potential, which I don't think anybody else has. Some have seen some other aluminum packaging that are pretty innovative and drive really also market share for companies. So that's the discussion that we continue to have. And I have a hard time to project where this is going. I still hope that we will be able to re-establish the relationship there and help both ends because I believe this can easily be turned into a win-win situation. On your second part of the question, is there enough capacity out there? Well, I mean some people have taken in large contracts and have highly publicized that, and are now in a situation that they have to deliver, and they have to deliver, as you know, flawless quality. And well, we'll see. And once the temperatures go up, which they've done this year a little earlier than everyone expected, and I think also beverage sales will go up and the need for aluminum cans will go up, and that's the situation there.

I'm going to take my time going through that, the bridges and the reconciliation sheet of the restructuring special items. I'm also going to give you some additional disclosure around our sensitivities today. But let me start off with by first saying that our improved operating result reflects increased profitabilities that we gained through a strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Our realized aluminum pricing is hitting the bottom line and we are overcoming increased energy cost and reduced volumes.  Now let's go to the first quarter overview. In the first quarter, higher realized LME [London Metal Exchange] pricing and the continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives drove significant improvements in the cost of goods sold and SGA [SG&A] percentages of sales; the combination of which generated EBITDA of $596 million, which is the highest level since the third quarter of 2008. Higher energy costs, lower volumes, predominantly can sheet, both negatively impacted results. Our loss from continuing operations of $194 million or $0.19 per share included restructuring and special items, totaling $295 million or $0.29 per share. I'll review these items in more detail in just a bit.  Lastly, debt to cap improved to 38.1%,  and liquidity remained strong with $1.3 billion of cash on hand.      Let's move to the next slide, which illustrates market activity in our businesses. Revenues in many of our markets have improved relative to last year, while others, namely, aerospace and IGT [industrial gas turbine], continued to experience supply chain destocking and low levels of demand. The declines in packaging were expected due to our decision to curtail can sheet volumes to our North American supply base. This decision contributed to a reduction in flat-rolled product shipments of roughly 75,000 tons. The sequential declines in our third-party alumina and primary metal sales reflect higher internal shipments to meet improved order rates and the anticipated reduction in buy/re-sell activity to more normal levels. Buy/re-sell totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a reduction of 158,000 tons sequentially. On a sequential basis, aerospace was essentially flat as destocking activity begins to slow and supply levels stabilize. Weak demand in IGT and building and construction continues to drive revenue declines in these markets. Now let's review the financials. I'll highlight some key items for you as you have the detailed income statement in the press release. Third-party revenues declined 10% sequentially as increases in internal shipments in alumina and lower can sheet volumes more than offset the benefit of higher pricing. Note that the reduction in buy/re-sell activity contributed to half of the revenue decline. COGS as a percent of sales fell to 82.1% driven through continued progress in our cash sustainability initiatives. As you'll recall, COGS in the fourth quarter included charges related to our Italian operations, the MRN tax settlement and the impact of buy/re-sell activity, all of which accounted for 6.7 percentage points of the COGS percent decline.On a percent-of-sales basis, SG&A improved by 0.5 percentage points sequentially as we continued to aggressively reduce overhead spend. And lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was a negative 95.5%. For your reference, we've attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate. Included in the tax rate this quarter are discrete tax items totaling $112 million, which I will detail on the next slide. Going forward, we expect our operational ETR to be approximately 32%. However, we will continue to experience swings in rate given the volatility in our profit drivers and overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction. Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter. Okay, this slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location on the financial statements. Restructuring-related items of $119 million primarily relates to the permanent closure of certain curtailed U.S. locations, including the Badin and Eastalco smelters. This decision was made after an assessment of the sustained competitiveness of each facility was completed based on factors including market fundamentals, other idle capacity, the cost structure and future capital investment. The discrete tax items include $79 million related to the recently-enacted health care legislation. The legislation changed the tax treatment of the federal subsidy offered to companies that provided Medicare Part D-equivalent prescription drug benefits to retirees. Non-cash mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in several power contracts totaled $31 million and power outages in São Luís and Rockdale negatively impacted results by $17 million. Lastly, an increase in the Grasse River environmental remediation accrual totaled $11 million. The net of these items totaled $295 million or $0.29 per share.Now let's move to the sequential bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and special items. Higher realized alumina and aluminum pricing was partially offset by the non-recurrence of a LIFO benefit in the previous quarter. We generated significant productivity gains through continued execution of our Cash Sustainability initiatives. You can clearly see that we've been able to hold our productivity gains from last year and increase our level of savings despite headwinds from lower volumes and higher energy. As a reference point, sequential increases in the average price of oil was up approximately 4% and natural gas, 1%. Before moving to the segments, I'd like to review our key net income sensitivities. This slide shows you our two key sensitivities: aluminum and currency. These sensitivities help you provide directional guidance on how changing metal price and then currencies impact our bottom line.The aluminum sensitivity is inclusive of all LME-linked elements in our revenue and cost structure: alumina, aluminum and LME-linked power. This sensitivity is based on a 15-day-lagged LME price. The currency's sensitivities reflect on different economic exposures. For the most part, our non-U.S. operations generate U.S. dollar revenues from alumina and aluminum, but pay expenses in local currency. It should be no surprise that the Aussie dollar sensitivity is our highest, given the large operating base we have in Australia. We will include this sensitivity table in the appendix going forward for your reference.Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Alumina. Alumina pricing trended high in the quarter, yielding a 13% increase in our realized price. Production was slightly lower sequentially, as a power outage in San Luis (sic) [São Luís] and maintenance outages in Australia offset increases at Point Comfort. The power outage, which occurred in early February, negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million. Juruti negatively impacted the quarter by $20 million, and higher energy costs totaled $15 million. As noted on the bridge, the fourth quarter charge for a tax settlement in our MRN [Mineração Rio do Norte] partnership did not recur.Moving to the outlook. Alumina pricing will follow the 60-day lag. Lower caustic cost will flow through the system, and we will continue to benefit from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. As we look at all of our operating conditions that we have across our system, we would expect production to increase by approximately 100,000 tons versus the first quarter.Let's move to the Primary segment. The first quarter performance benefited from an 8% increase in the realized price, favorable currency benefits and productivity gains. As you will recall, the fourth quarter included a $250 million charge related to the drawback from the Italian power case. The decline in third-party shipments was predominantly driven by a significant reduction in buy/re-sell activity. Margin-neutral buy/re-sell totaled 49,000 tons this quarter, a decline of 158,000 tons sequentially. Higher power costs were incurred, particularly in Italy, as new power tariffs took effect. Also, although smelting activity at our Rockdale facility has been curtailed, we continue to have power-generation activities at this site. A maintenance outage conducted during the quarter negatively impacted sequential performance by $11 million. Looking to the second quarter, we expect our realized pricing to follow a 15-day lag and continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiatives. Unfortunately, the power station in Rockdale continues to struggle. The master agreement with USW [United Steelworkers], which covers 5,350 employees, expires on May 31. While we are confident that a mutually acceptable agreement will be reached, actions are being taken to ensure business continuity if any disruptions should occur.Lastly, we expect production to be equal to the first quarter. Beginning next year, we expect ongoing cost reductions from the closures announced this quarter of approximately $15 million annually, largely comprised of the cessation of depreciation and other holding costs. Now let's move to the Flat-Rolled Products segment. Flat-Rolled Products ATOI declined $7 million sequentially, largely driven by lower volumes from our decision to curtail sales to our North American can sheet customer. In can sheet, we've reduced headcount and capacity to bring our cost structure more in line with current volumes. This effort and improved pricing on new contracts helped to mitigate the impact of reduced volumes. The net impact on our North American can sheet operations was $22 million sequentially. Overall, higher pricing, improved product mix and Cash Sustainability initiatives more than offset the high energy costs and negative currency impact we experienced in the quarter. Next quarter, we expect continued gains from Cash Sustainability initiatives. Key end markets will improve. However, our can sheet volumes will remain at lower levels.Now let's move to the Engineered Products and Solutions. ATOI of $81 million was up 42% sequentially despite lower sales. Strong performance in our Cash Sustainability initiative helped generate ATOI percent of 7.5%, equal to the First Quarter of 2009, when sales were $200 million higher. These results clearly illustrate how this business has structurally improved its cost position. Revenue fell 2% sequentially, as continued weakness in the IGT and building and construction markets was partially offset by volume increases in the industrial and commercial transportation markets. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect continued benefits from our Cash Sustainability initiative and slight improvements in overall market conditions. Let's now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we produced cash from operations of $199 million. The largest single contributor to this sequential change in CFO was due to working capital. Working capital increased by $336 million, as we are carrying higher inventories to meet rising demand levels. Our typical first quarter inventory build was managed diligently with the tools and insights gained from last year. In fact, on a days basis, the first quarter of 2009, we moved 13 days of working capital. We improved that 13 days of working capital versus last year, and we made improvement in each one of our groups. In the GPP [Global Primary Products] group, which is the Primary group, it improved days of working capital 27 days. Flat-Rolled Products was down 27 days, and EPS [Engineered Products and Solutions] was down 14 days. Capital expenditures totaled $221 million. Including the net investment in Ma'aden, which flows through other investing activities, CapEx totaled $281 million. This keeps us on track against our 2010 target of $1.25 billion.  Free cash flow in the first quarter was essentially break even. So let me take a minute and summarize. I'll remind everybody that we've got a target to be free cash flow positive in 2010. All of our Cash Sustainability initiatives are centered on driving free cash flow and structurally improving our ability to drive bottom line growth. We've made outstanding progress in reducing our cost of purchased goods and lowering our overhead spend. And we've been able to sustain the gains that we made in 2009. We're judiciously deploying capital and managing working capital effectively, keeping overall days low on a relative basis. We're aggressively pursuing our cash sustainability targets to generate higher levels of free cash flow and drive near-term and long-term value to shareholders. I'd now like to turn it over to Klaus."

I guess what you've seen already from the press release, and Chuck went through it more in-depth, is we've also used this quarter to continue to improve the bottom",4418,"Well, thank you very much, Chuck. And welcome, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. I guess what you've seen already from the press release, and Chuck went through it more in-depth, is we've also used this quarter to continue to improve the bottom line and to drive towards our 2010 goals. I'd like to guide through a couple of things here. It starts in the usual fashion with an overview on the end markets, as well as on the aluminum markets, including the supply and demand side. And then, I'd like to give you a deeper insight into our main businesses, and look at the drivers that there are to get to a more normalized performance. That's a question that, when we've been on the road talking to investors, was asked a lot, and we thought that that's important for all of you to understand, to better understand what is really the value-creation potential that Alcoa has here. So let's start with the end markets in the usual fashion. So in 2010, we expect the economy to continue to improve slightly. Let's start with aerospace. Large commercial aircrafts, we are projecting deliveries to be essentially flat compared to 2009. We see that most of the airlines stand by their orders, and they continue to stand by it, main reasons for that being the fuel efficiency of new planes. Some actually receive substantial subsidies from government export credit agencies, and some just want to avoid losing their deposits through the cancellation. If you look at the airline economics, they actually look improved compared to the fourth quarter, 30% improved. But at the same time, the projection is that all of the airline industry in total worldwide will continue to lose money, $2.8 billion projected in 2010. One thing that's always good to remind ourselves of, particularly here in this segment, is this is the order backlog of six years that Boeing and Airbus have in their books. If you look at another segment here on aerospace, regional and business jet, it doesn't look that good. We continue to see significant reductions of orders, as well as deliveries. Lastly, what really counts for us is a destocking, and we expect this to come to an end in the first half of 2010. That's the most important factor, because it immediately is driving Alcoa's profitability. The segments that are relevant for us and particularly are sheets, rolled products, aerospace, foil and fasteners. So we are profiting on a lot of ends, and each one of those segments has its own dynamics. For instance, in aerosfoils (sic) [aerofoils], we already see a pretty substantial pickup; whereas in sheet, given the strong inventory levels at many places, we believe that, that's probably laggard.Automotive. Global automotive production expected to rebound in 2010 plus 9% is our expectation, 62.2 million vehicles. That's pretty much in every region except Europe. And Europe is because with the strong government incentive for last year, demand was just pulled forward. But if you look at the 2010 levels, they are still way below 9%, below the 2007 peak levels of 68 million vehicles.The vehicle inventory situation has fully corrected, and we're now really witnessing real demand also in the U.S. If you saw what's happening here in the U.S., pretty much spurred by strong incentive programs, this time by the automakers. Euro financing is the big thing today. And if you look at the March sales, you saw that the March sales for GM have been up 21%; for Ford, 40%; and for Toyota, 40%. Obviously from all this, the consumer is the beneficiary. He seems to be seeing it, or she seems to be seeing it, in the same way and is responding to that offer with real demand. Heavy truck and trailer, next segment, expect a slow recovery versus the 2009 low. We see 10% increased production in 2010 to a 1.3 million units level. If you look at the U.S., we see growth. On the one hand, the freight miles are slowly recovering and the freight rates are increasing. On a year-on-year basis, we saw an increase of 18.6%. But let's make no mistake, I mean, we're talking about numbers that are well below the historic norms, particularly given the overhang that exists here on the trucking fleet side. For the U.S., the projection is higher than 23,000 units versus the 225,000 as the historic norm.Beverage can packaging global market, we believe will continue to be flat versus 2009 level. And we will continue to follow our strategy to partner with those can sheet customers that understand and value Alcoa's unmatched quality as well as our service capability, as well as our unique strength to continue to innovate in that segment. We will continue to particularly work with those that use packaging and sustainability as their strong profit drivers, because that is the match that makes sense for us and generates value on both sides.On the commercial building and construction side in North America, a significant decline. We expect it to be 25%. And most of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Funds are going into highways and not buildings. So that is not working very much as a counterbalance here. Europe, expected to decline too, a little less so as 5% is the expectation. And China and India, a totally different picture, substantial growth in both of the market. Last but not least, industrial gas turbines. Heavy-duty gas turbine builds are expected to decline, we think 25% to 30% versus 2009. Orders are postponed or deferred, mainly driven by a slower economic growth; and that then being reflected in the lower electricity demand on the short term, and driven also by uncertainty about emissions regulations. For Alcoa, the most important thing is the destocking of the OEM. That's, again here, the major short-term impact. And mid to long term, our forecast is bullish on the industrial gas turbine. And I would even say, it has been become even more bullish, if you look at the structural changes that are happening in this market: the substantial price decline in natural gas, given to the innovation and the finds of shale gas, low-capital cost requirements for gas turbine or combined cycle power plant, the flexibility, the short lead times and the environmental advantages, for instance, versus coal. If you sum up the whole end-market situation, the way I would see it is, is I would say, end markets continue to strengthen. In the main, 2010 would clearly be better than 2009, but it's going to be below historic norms in many of the markets.So let's go to aluminum, and let's have the next chart on here. We expect the consumption to grow by 10% in 2010. This is pretty much the view that we already have shown you in the fourth quarter announcement, and very strongly driven by China. If you look at the growth rate in China in the first quarter, a 37% growth rate. We expect that to normalize. And our projection here is that over the course of the year, we would see 18%. And this is probably a conservative assumption, given what we're seeing in China these days.If you look at further up here, North America, look at the current year-on-year number for the U.S., that's been 3%. We project the 5% over the course of the full year. Strong growth in Japan, year-on-year, 23%. Our expectation for Asia, without China, is 6%. And even in Europe, I have to say, we've seen a year-on-year growth of 20%. Our expectation here is 3%. So that's where this stands, so 10%. And if you would take China out, it's 5%. Let's go to the inventory conditions. I'll lead you through the chart. It looks more complicated than it really is. On the left-hand side, we have condensed pretty much the most important inventory levels. And as demand has been growing, we also see a modest increase in port inventories in China as well as in Japan, as well as a very modest increase in producer stock. At the same time, we see a counter-effect on the LME stocks. They have declined by roughly 40,000 tons in this quarter. So overall, if you look at the accumulation here, overall, it's been a pretty flat inventory situation. When you then go to the right-hand side and look at the regional premiums that we have been tracking for a while here, and you can see the curves there; what happens here is you have, on the one hand, an improved real demand, strong interest continues from financial participants, logistic constraints, distributor stocks are low, USA distributor stocks are at an all-time low. All of that together really leads to a very tight supply chain situation and continues to drive the regional premiums, as you see them here coming up or kind of being stable on a pretty high level. The next one, let's move to the demand and the supply side situation. This is the chart for aluminum, and that we believe we have to really see the China and the Western world separately. In the main, we project for the whole world an overhang here of 1.2 million tons in 2010, and I'll qualify that a little bit later. So for China, if you look at the left-hand side, you see a small surplus; a little bit bigger than what we saw, actually, end of last year. But very frankly, I mean, I could go through the details, if anybody's interested in that, later on. But frankly, I'm not at all, and we're not at all concerned about that. What we've seen here with China, in the worst of all downturns, they have been very, very good at managing their supply and demand balance. And they've been very agile and very, very fast in responding here. So I would be very sure that this surplus is really only temporary. If you go on the right-hand side, on the Western side, what you see here is pretty much a function of new greenfield smelter starting up mainly in the Middle East, some in India, in additional giving us a 745,000 metric tons additional supply. And then the combination of small restarts in Europe, mainly offset by the curtailment in Venezuela, given the drought situation, given that this is hydro powered.If you look at the total surplus of 1.2 million, if you add those 400,000 and the 830,000 up, let's all here remind ourselves, we're talking about a two-week consumption in our market. So this is the amount that we're talking about. So that's a pretty manageable number. And actually, our projections here don't even include a restocking of the supply chain, and as yet was used as, just in the slide before that, on the U.S. distributor stock, we are at an all-time low. Now let's go to the next slide, which basically shows the same thing for the supply/demand balance for alumina. Alumina has a global market. That's why we don't really see that as two separate markets here. And I don't even need to go into the details. I mean, the numbers show it by themselves, as supply/demand is balanced in 2010, and that's what we expect and that's also what we've been seeing in the market. And I'll come to some of those aspects when we talk about our business a little bit more. So, so much, that closes the part on the market. So let's now move on to talking about Alcoa. And as I said early on, I mean, one of the questions that Chuck and I have been asked a lot in many, many conversations with you all out there is saying, ""Well, on the one hand, we have this enormous overshadowing here by the downturn."" And the way that Alcoa got through it and most people give us good credit for it, but they say, ""We don't fully understand how all of that leads into the normalization of your profit capabilities."" And at the same time, I think everybody sees also that we've used the downturn to streamline our portfolio to lower our costs systemically. And obviously, also, that goes into the whole equation to drive performance. So I want to do -- the first slide is already up, and I'm going to lead you through it. So I want to use four slides, basically, going through the four businesses, and show you what we see when we look at it from our internal perspective as the main value drivers in here. So the chart that's up here is on the Alumina business. Keep in mind, we are the clear market leader in the Alumina business, and not only are we the market leader, volume wise, but our system is one of the most competitive systems, the largest and the most competitive one, because we are positioned, on average, in the lowest quartile on the cost curve. As you can see here, on the left-hand side, that's the cost curve. We have two cost curves there, the 2009, one in the 2000. And I'll refer to it a little later, why we put the 2000 in there. Our total capacity is 18.1 million tons. We've grown in the last year by roughly 2 million tons, basically by taking the partner out into Ralco and completing our São Luís/Juruti expansion. And we will add more 450,000 tons when, in 2014, Ma'aden comes online, the refinery and the mine, come online. And you can see this little green red dot there on the left-hand side on the refining curve. So that will be the new position that Ma'aden will have on the cost curve. It literally extends the cost curve further down, sets a new low-cost point.Well, that's all good, but we've also done other things on the operational side. If you look at the alumina conversion costs, we've brought the alumina conversion costs down by 18% since the fourth quarter in '08. And if you go over to the lower right-hand side, which says Alcoa third-party alumina sales percent of LME, we've indexed that. And you have a 10-year history here of the contract pricing for Alcoa. As you know, it's done as a percentage of aluminum. And you see your trend there. And if you look at the most recent contract prices that we have been able to achieve, they've been upward the 15% LME. All of this is a clear reflection, we continue to have a tight market or we even have a tighter market. We have also, on the other hand, rising alumina costs. And that's the reason, if you go back to the left-hand side, to the cost curve, why we put the comparison, the gray curve, the 2000 curve in there. Because you can see -- and we put the two 50 percentile points in there, so you can see what happened here over this course of the 10 years. The cost in the alumina sector have increased substantially, about 50%. The midpoint has moved up by 50%. So on the one hand, I mean, going back to the pricing levels, I think we see here, on the one hand, the tight market; on the other hand, rising alumina costs putting pressure on the pricing, and also, have we changed over on the frequency of our contract pricing. So all of that together has led to good things happening there. And the good things happening there, you see reflected on the upper right-hand side, where you see the EBITDA per metric ton for alumina also over a 10-year period. And then looking at the first quarter performance, you already see that this is trending into the right direction. But you also, on the other hand, see, if you look at the whole light blue bars there, that by no means are we talking about a normalized performance here. And the prices are high, yes. But at the same time, costs have also risen. And we believe there is upside potential in here, and we're going to continue to see upside here. In the end, I mean, there's not that much good bauxite available, particularly when you want it close to refining. And when you want the refinery close to a port and when you want this being close to consumers, add it all together, that determines where you are on the cost curve, right? It's not just about having something there. It's really on what you have there. And all of that will continue to lead into pretty substantial tightness, in our view, and continue to drive prices. So let's sum it up. We are very well positioned here, and we've got substantial upside on the alumina side. Let's go to the next one, aluminum, right? On the aluminum side, our system is about 4.5 million tons capacity. We have current utilization rate of 80% versus the pre-crisis level of 2008. In 2008, we produced about 4 million tons. We added roughly 300,000 tons with Elkem and with Ma'aden. Once Ma'aden comes online, we will add another 186,000 tons to our smelting system. And again here, you'd see those little green dots here on the left-hand side, where it says Global Primary Cost Curve. That little green dot means the cost position of Ma'aden, setting a new low-cost point, which is obviously a very, very good thing to happen, right?At the same time here, when you want to measure, what have we done operationally, conversion cost is a good measure. We've brought conversion costs down for aluminum by 21% compared to the fourth quarter in '08. And also, important here is power. We've secured a competitive power for 85% of our smelter system until 2025 and even longer, but minimum, 2025. That determines that. So then when you go to the upper right-hand side, you see again, the EBITDA margin, this time for aluminum. And you can clearly see we've made solid progress in the fourth quarter, but far from a normalized level. And we believe that prices also here will be rising partially, also because of the cost pressure. We also have, on the left-hand side here, put the 2000 cost curve. And then you can see almost the same phenomenon that I already described on the alumina side, a 50% increase here of the midpoint. So with all of that, we believe that with all of that, plus our improved position, our better costs and the market price is trending up, we believe that, on a normalized level, this will go substantially up. And I want to remind you, just take a little step back, and that little charge here on the right lower corner is very, very powerful and important to understand. And let's take a little step back and think about what is really done with aluminum. And I think that when you look at reports, there is almost a consensus in the world that you will have probably, over a long period of time, 6% annual growth, normalized, so to say, in this market, right? If you have 6% growth in this market, let's be realistic and see what that means, in terms of additional need for supply. This would actually mean that we would have or somebody else would have to build 2.3 million tons per year of new capacity. This would mean three new Ma'aden smelters per year. This would mean four new São Luís expansions per year. It will mean 20 new gas turbines per year. Or for those of you who love hydropower, two new Hoover Dams built every year. And it would mean equal $30 billion that would have to be put into the ground as infrastructure investment. While looking at that, I am pretty confident that the supply-demand situation is heavily biased towards a tight situation, because it's not very likely that this will be doable in this world, right? Therefore, I'm pretty convinced that we will continue to see pressure on the prices here, going forward.So next one is Rolled Products. On the Rolled Product side, let me start on the right upper-hand side where you have, again, the profitability. If you look at the profitability here in the first year, is you'll see that this is a business that has had profit margins in around 10-plus percent, right? And 2005, we started investing in the growth markets, China and Russia, and that has brought the margins down. Where do we stand today strategically? The Russian can sheet mill is fully operational. China, Bohai is ramping up. Full ramp-up will be done by 2011. By the way, I forgot to mention, on Russia, that it's the first time this quarter that they have been able to get break even, right? We also have lowest conversion costs on Ma'aden once the mill goes online in 2013. Plus, we've used the downturn to re-engineer the businesses. We strengthened our position, exited commoditized market, exited foil, electronic underperformer, headcount reduction of 5,000 people. That's to just put it in perspective, we're talking about 25% of the total headcount here that we've done. Overhead costs are down $140 million. And if you look at the left-hand side with the third-party sales structure, given that we are going through the downturn, that we continue to see some destocking going on and that we have lost one can sheet customer, we are currently at a utilization rate of 75%. That is not a normalized level. We believe a normalized level would rather be around 90% in aerospace. We've seen years like in 2005 where we have been at 100%, right? So all of these parts together, I mean, if you put them all together, I believe that all of those actions show that we have set flat-rolled products on a path to become a strong performance contributor going forward.Last but not least, Engineered Product and Solution business. Let me start on the left-hand side. Where do we stand currently? We stand at a 70% utilization rate on aerospace and a 65% utilization on the rest of the group. And if you see that and now go to the right-hand side, the EBITDA margin performance, when you look at the first quarter, the one that we report about now, 14%, just shy of the 2008 15%, with this type of utilization rate, obviously, it points to a very strong cost cutting that has happened here. Very, very good performance. When you look on top of it, to the strategic position that we have in engineered products and solution, we have unequal technological capabilities that put us in a position to create value for the customers of our customers. We have focused the portfolio today, 85% of the sales are a #1 or #2 market leader positions. $440 million for activity improvement in 2009. Aerospace destocking, as I said early on, is improving, and we believe it's going to come to an end in first half 2010. We also see significant short-term profit accelerators. Just to give you a few, 787 and A380 to mention some. We are in that with special alloys, unique fasteners, as well as with airfoils. Joint strike fighter, we're in it with alloys, structures and fasteners. Heavy truck market is recovering. We have Dura-Bright capabilities on quoting LvL ONE outstanding wheels. And on top of it, we've shown that we also are very capable of doing inorganic growth, with the integration of the 2000 acquisitions, Van Petty and Republic, which has really been done almost flawlessly. We will continue, in this group, to look for additional growth and build on our strengths that we have there, whether it be organic or inorganic. Let's sum this all up. I hope that all of this information is valuable for you to understand, where is the performance, as you have always asked, on a normalized level? As the economy comes back, utilization will go up. And we've used the downturn to improve our position with a better portfolio, with better cost and with future growth like Ma'aden, which is substantially going to increase our competitiveness. All of that together will drive the value of our business and of our performance.Let's look at this year. Real quickly, where do we stand, in regards to the targets that we've set ourselves, to increase our operations in 2010. On the procurement side, $505 million, target is $2.5 billion, $5.5 million year-to-date and the first quarter looks good. We're well on track overhead. We're going to bring it down by $500 million this year. We've achieved $127 million in the first quarter, looks good.Total CapEx, this targets include about $250 million for Ma'aden. We're trending in the right direction, in line with expectations. And last, but not least, on the working capital side, Chuck noted that there's an increase in days, compared to the fourth quarter, which is kind of typical for the first quarter. But if you'd look at a year-on-year basis, you actually see that we have taken out 13 days in working capital turns. That's a big success of the cash sustainability initiative. We're on target to continue to reduce this, and to get the two days out of the working capital turns that we have been shooting for and aiming for this year. Let's get to an end and summarize that. The environment is stabilizing. We will be capitalizing on this while we are managing headwinds like currency and energy. We're exceeding our goals. Talking to Alcoans all around the world, they know that we have the future in our hands. They are very proud of the almost flawless execution that we've shown in 2009, and they want to repeat it in 2010. 2010, as a year, we have a great team. We have an outstanding portfolio. We have an unwavering commitment to make this happen again to improve costs and to profitably grow. All of that growth, we can be very happy about our portfolio there, global alumina leader. We can leverage our base, continue to improve our situation in aluminum-rolled products, led you through that. Profitability can be revitalized. And EPS, we can use the leadership position that we have to continue to grow. With all that said, we are committed to create value for 2010 and forward, and even more strongly so. Let me close with that, and open up the lines for questions and answers."

On the Alumina pricing side, I mean, the thing that I can say already today, and you saw that in my Alumina chart, that's why we put that in there, you can clearly see that the pricing is trending upwards. So obviously, the tightening that exists in the Alumina market is reflected in a stronger percentage through the LME. And as I've said, I mean, the recent contracts that we signed up have been upwards 15%, which I think is also historically, a pretty, pretty good number. We also have gone away from longer-term contracts to more of a shorter-term contractual obligations to profit from the different pricing situation. And on top of that, I believe that we're going to see much more upside trends here. As I've said early on, there isn't that many good bauxite reserves that are close enough to a refinery, so the transportation costs are not shooting through the roof and close enough to a port, and then the port close enough to end customers. When you put those equations all together, that's not that easy to do right. So we believe it's going to be trending up. On the iron ore situation, first of all, I don't know the market well enough, so I wouldn't be the best one to talk about it. But I would say that this is what I just said, is the fair description of what we see in the Alumina side. Chuck, you want to take the other one?"

But given that this was the question that, I think, we've all been much more nervous about when we went into the downturn, and given that when we went into the downturn, I mean everybody was afraid that this overhang would depress the market and prices would not come back at all, I think what we're seeing now is that our estimate that quite a majority of the LME is either through financial transactions or through logistics constraints bound for at least a while in the warehouse. And the while, in my view, I would put a frame around it between three to six months as a start to probably 18 months, and I would say the majority of what we see there probably has those. We know of some transactions that even have a longer time frame behind there. But I don't believe, Curt, not only do I not believe, I know by having looked into this that it is virtually impossible for this to all come out at the same time, and that's exactly why you are continuing to see these regional price premiums continuing to go up pretty much, right? The tightness is there. And also keep in mind, we've also seen not only real demand coming back pretty substantially and I think that's going to get stronger going forward, but at the same time, financial investors have also strengthened their positions here and very often driven by a view on where else would you get value if you want to hold on to something other than a currency denomination, right?"

I think the first thing that I would want to give you as an explanation is this aspect of the cans on the packaging side, that we made the purposeful decision to discontinue once we had the chance to discontinue with the large contract with one of our customers on the can sheet side, was a 10-year contract. It had a lot of aspects in there that in total, I mean, lost us quite a bit of money over that 10-year time frame. And as painful as it is to make a decision like that and then having to curtail some capacity as appropriate and right, I believe it is. If you want to substantially make sure that you have a profitability structure of your business, that is a solid foundation for investments and being in that business, right? So that's the first thing. So I mean, the 75% utilization is obviously overshadowed by that part, right? The second part, I think I talked about aerospace already. I mean, aerospace is coming back. I said it's probably a laggard on the sheet and rolled side, given that there are pretty heavy inventory levels that we've seen in aerospace. And the third point I would add here is the reason why the profitability has come down from this 10% to 11% rate at that time, when we had a higher cost structure even, was the investment in China and Russia, right? And that is now coming online. And so as I've said, we've seen Russia in this quarter be breaking even. Kunshan is operating into the automotive market in China, and is operating real nicely. It's a hot market obviously in China. Bohai is coming up. And as I've said before, we believe that the full ramp-up we will be seeing in 2011. And obviously, that would then give us also the fruits there. And the fruits will be nicer than what we've seen before, because we've reached a lower cost level.

And we are not an employment company. We're not in a business to just produce something and lose money with it. And that's been the situation that we had with this contract. So I think we got to be reasonable. On top of it, and if you look at the performance of Alcoa, I think you can ask pretty much everybody who's out there and understands the Can Sheet business, we are clearly the quality leader. On top of it, we provide service, and we have a huge innovation potential, which I don't think anybody else has. Some have seen some other aluminum packaging that are pretty innovative and drive really also market share for companies. So that's the discussion that we continue to have. And I have a hard time to project where this is going. I still hope that we will be able to re-establish the relationship there and help both ends because I believe this can easily be turned into a win-win situation. On your second part of the question, is there enough capacity out there? Well, I mean some people have taken in large contracts and have highly publicized that, and are now in a situation that they have to deliver, and they have to deliver, as you know, flawless quality. And well, we'll see. And once the temperatures go up, which they've done this year a little earlier than everyone expected, and I think also beverage sales will go up and the need for aluminum cans will go up, and that's the situation there.

Thanks Matt, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us today. We got a fairly clean quarter, so let me run through it. Our increased performance this quarter reflects continuing improvement in our key end markets, as well as strong performance in our cash sustainability initiatives. We were able to generate positive free cash flow, and we maintained a strong liquidity position.
Now, let us move to the next slide and I will highlight the financial results for the quarter. Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $137 million or $0.13 per share compared with a first-quarter loss from continuing operations of $194 million or the loss of $0.19 per share. Remember first quarter 2010 results included restructuring and special charges of $295 million or $0.29 per share. We generated EBITDA of $724 million, a 14% EBITDA margin, which is the highest since the third quarter of 2008.
Higher volumes in most end markets and continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives drove this bottom-line performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was $87 million in debt to capital stood at 38.4%. Lastly, our liquidity remains strong with 1.34 billion of cash on hand.
Let us move to the next slide, which illustrates the revenue change by market. Revenues in most of our markets improved sequentially. Aerospace rose as destocking activity begins to slow and orders rise in the investment castings business. New customers and seasonal increases drove packaging sales higher, while commercial transportation benefited from increased global economic activity.
Higher third-party alumina shipments helped drive sales in that business up 10% sequentially. While many markets are up significantly year-over-year, let us remember that these improvements are relative to a very weak period in 2009.
Now, let us move on to the income statement. Third-party revenues rose 6% sequentially on higher third-party shipments in the upstream and improved demand in almost every end market. COGS as a percent of sales fell to 81.2% driven through continued progress on our cash sustainability initiatives. These activities also help to improve SG&A as a percent of sales by almost a full percentage point. We have a tight focus on spending as market activity increases, operating more effectively and minimizing rehires where possible. Let me remind you that we have reduced headcount by approximately 37,000 since the downturn began in late 2008.
Our cash sustainability initiatives drove a reduction of 17,000, while divestitures were responsible for the remainder. We’re not only holding headcount levels, but are also driving restructuring this quarter that will result in further reductions. Lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was 25%. For your reference, we have attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate. Included in the tax rate this quarter are discrete items totaling 16 million. Going forward we expect our operational ETR to be approximately 32%, however, we will continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility in our profit drivers, and overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction.
Now, let us review the restructuring of special items in the quarter. This slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location in the financial statements. As you can see, these items had no impact on our overall results. Yet, they do impact specific line items on the income statement. We have therefore included this detail to enable a clear analysis of our results.
First, restructuring was $20 million and relates primarily to further headcount reduction. Discrete tax items totaled a favorable $16 million. Non-cash mark-to-market benefits on derivatives in several power contracts totaled $22 million, and the negative decision in a lawsuit related to (inaudible) negative impacted results by $7 million.
Lastly, we reached a mutually beneficial agreement with United Steelworkers, which helped sustain our competitive position in the US. We are very pleased that our employees ratified the agreement in late June. Preparation cost for a potential strike and a one-time signing bonus for employee totaled $13 million this quarter.
Let us now move to the sequential bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and special items. Lower realized aluminum pricing and higher LME link cost, particularly energy, were more than offset by higher volumes in every business. Performance benefited from a rise in the US dollar and favorable non-LME linked energy rates. Productivity gains related to our cash sustainability initiatives continued to enhance bottom line performance and account for approximately 60% of the sequential improvement.
Now, let us turn to the segments starting with alumina. Production was up 24,000 metric tons this quarter. Increases at Point Comfort, San Ciprián and Wagerup were mostly offset by a reduction in São Luís and lower production in Jamaica. The São Luís ramp up was slower than anticipated due to commissioning issues experienced in the quarter, and is operating at roughly 6800 tons per day. We remain on track to meet our target of achieving full run rate production of 9000 tons per day by the end of 2010.
Turning to profitability, the strengthening US dollar yielded possible currency effects of $18 million, primarily related to the depreciation in dollar [ph]. 1% increase in third-party pricing and higher third-party volumes contributed 5 million to ATOI in the quarter. The impact of the commissioning issues at São Luís this quarter negatively impacted results by $11 million.
Moving to the outlook, alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag and we will continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives. Lastly, we expect production to increase by 150,000 tons versus the second quarter as the ramp up at São Luís continues to progress.
Let us move to the primary segment. Second-quarter performance was negatively impacted by a 1% decline in realized price and higher LME linked alumina and power cost. Alumina and LME linked power cost roughly represent 45% of cost of aluminum production, and typically follow a quarter lag to the LME. Favorable currency and non-LME linked energy costs, combined with productivity improvements, partially offset the negative impact of pricing. As you will recall, the first quarter included $11 million related to a maintenance outage at the Rockdale power plant. In the second quarter, the final resolution of litigation related to our Rockdale power contract resulted in a negative impact of $10 million.
Also in the quarter, we curtailed Fusina and production at our Avilés smelter was halted due to heavy flooding. We’re in the process of restarting production and anticipate Avilés to be at full operating rate by the fourth quarter of this year. Looking forward to the third quarter, we anticipate pricing to follow a 15 day lag we expect continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives, and lastly we expect production to be equal to the second quarter.
Moving now to flat-rolled products, flat-rolled products ATOI improved by $41 million sequentially, driven by higher volumes in Russia, China and North America, and continued benefits from our cash sustainability program. We have rationalized our cost structure in the North American can sheet business to reflect lower volumes, and we’re winning new orders at pricing levels that properly reflect the value we deliver to our customers.
In the third quarter, we estimate that EBITDA margins in our North American can sheet business will be on par with that we achieved during the prior year. In short, our actions will have fully offset the loss margin associated with our decision to forego sales to a large North American customer.
We experienced sequential revenue growth in substantially all end markets led by commercial transportation and packaging. Our growth businesses in Russia and China have steadily improved during the year. In Russia, we are very pleased that the significant restructuring has allowed us to fully benefit from improving market conditions and drive our Russian operations to profitability this quarter. Next quarter, we see improving demand in each of our regions. We anticipate normal seasonal plant slowdowns and continued gains from our cash sustainability initiatives.
Let us turn to the EPS segment. ATOI of $107 million was up 32% sequentially. Continued strong performances in our cash sustainability initiatives help generate an EBITDA margin of 17.2%, 2.7 percentage points above the second quarter of 2009 when sales were $72 million higher. These results illustrate how this segment has structurally improved its cost position through sustainable actions.
Revenue increased 4% sequentially on higher volumes in our aerospace structural castings business and our commercial building and construction business. While the global commercial building and construction market continues to decline, improved sales in this market reflect our leading brands and strong relationships with well positioned customers. Looking ahead, we anticipate normal seasonal plant slowdowns, but continued gains from our cash sustainability initiatives.
Let us now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $300 million. The sequential increase was driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. In the quarter, we ended several accounts receivables sales programs, which resulted in an unfavorable working capital impact of approximately $260 million. However, our cash sustainability efforts helped to hold days working capital at 42 days, which is a six-day improvement over the same period last year.
Capital expenditures totaled 213 million. Including the net investment in the Ma'aden joint-venture, which flows through other investing activities, spending totaled 233 million. This keeps us on track against our 2010 target of 1.25 billion. Free cash flow in the second quarter totaled $87 million.
So let us summarize. We were free cash flow positive in 2010, the result of our disciplined execution in each of our cash sustainability initiatives. Our performance this quarter also illustrates that we have structurally improved our ability to drive bottom-line growth. We made outstanding progress in reducing our cost and maintaining these reductions when markets began to recover. We are effectively managing capital expenditures and working capital to meet our full-year targets. Every Alcoan is committed to achieving these targets. Across the company, we are aggressively pursuing higher levels of free cash flow and profitability, ultimately driving near term and long term shareholder value.
Thanks, and I would like to turn it over to Klaus now.

And in the usual fashion, I will tell you something about our end market development, aluminum demand, supply picture as well as Alcoa’s businesses. But before that, I would like to give you a little bit of a broader frame around all of that given that today almost on a daily or hourly basis we read all the headlines tracking the economic recovery, we felt that it is worthwhile to provide a little bit of a true north at least for the aluminum demand on a mid to longer-term basis.
Let me have the (inaudible). Thank you very much. There is a strong mid-to-long term aluminum fundamental, and it is pretty much driven by the mega trends that we see changing of late. On the one hand, let us not forget we will be having 3 billion more people coming on to this planet in a reasonably short time until 2050, and most of them will be living in cities. So urbanization is a big thing.
(inaudible) last week the population Commissioner in China made the statement that in less than five years they are expecting that more people will live in urban environments and rural environments also in China. All of that together I mean, population growth, urbanization, all of that drives demand in all kinds of goods. When you then look at the properties that aluminum brings to the table lightweight and high strength and reflectability, I’m always amazed by some of the statistics looking at 75% of all aluminum ever produced on this planet still being in use. That shows great capabilities of aluminum and it makes alumina the material of choice in many household applications. And all of this together we believe is going to drive demand in the next 10 years pretty much up to 73 million tons in 2020. That is an average growth rate per annum of 6%.
This forecast is pretty much based only on kind of historic correlations between societies getting richer, building of middle-class, building infrastructure. This is most likely rather conservative. I will explain why I think that because we are seeing some strong material replacement effect in some areas like automotive. And I will give you some color on that before I go into the other things.
We see globally a push for fuel efficiency coming from consumers as well as aggressive legislation. In the US, the new emission standard CAFÉ was just passed, and you see here on the left-hand side what the regulation actually forces the automakers to achieve. It forces the automakers to achieve an improvement from today 25.5 miles per gallon to 2016 to a higher efficiency of 35.5 miles per gallon. If you look at that you are talking about six year's timeframe. This is a big task. I mean it is a big task in a very, very short time. When you then listen to how the automakers are intending to do that, they pretty much say we really only got three levers here.
We can improve power train, drive train and the lightweighting. And when it comes to lightweighting, aluminum is the material of choice, which you can see here nicely depicted on the right-hand side, fuel economy improvement. And we here compared it to the most competitive material, which is high-strength steel. And actually you see that aluminum has a three-time benefit over high-strength steel. Then when you look at what does that translate to when it comes to emissions, it actually translates to a three-time better CO2 emissions. Both of those things obviously are not only important, but when you think about a three times improvement that is rather dramatic. That is the reason why when you look one level deeper, and here look at the different aluminum penetration opportunities in automotive, what you see here on the left hand side is the different types of consumptions by component in automotive, and you see the light blue is where aluminum already plays a role today, and the darker blue is where we believe aluminum will play a role pretty soon, a stronger role pretty soon.
The biggest opportunity that we see here is in body structures and panels. If you take that and multiply that out, it translates into an additional primary aluminum demand of 10 million tons in the next 10 years. Only a fraction of that 10 million is baked into our 6% demand growth. That gives you a bit of the feel for what is going on. Obviously, this change will not come overnight, but the pressure is increasing from legislation and increasing from consumers. We are currently working intensely with our automotive customers, and are helping to design the next generation of fuel-efficient cars, trucks, as well as buses.
So, let us now go to the end markets and look at how the different end markets are doing. This is the traditional chart that we have been showing, and (inaudible) compared to last quarter shows you the end market demand in 2010 is improved. You see more green arrows here than in the last quarter. Growth expectations are rising in automotive, truck and trailer, as well as in packaging. So that is very consistent with the last IMS forecast. IMS increased their worldwide GDP growth assumption to 4.6% from originally in April of 4.2. By the way China in that makes up for 10.5 percentage points, and we will come to that.
So Aerospace, let us go to the segment. So the first segment is aerospace. On large commercial aircraft delivery rates are essentially flat. Boeing and Airbus have announced modest build rate increases. Boeing said 31.4 up to 34 units. Airbus said 34 units up to 36. Now, let us keep in mind until very recently most of the industry observers have been projecting further production cuts, whereas in reality when you look at orders until June are up significantly, up to a level of 268 versus 69 units in 2009. Yes, granted, this is not at historic levels, but I think there is no doubt, this is substantially better than what we saw before.
We also see in aerospace passenger traffic miles are up. If you look at the May year-on-year number was 12%, and if you look at air freight traffic miles, which is more of a leading indicator. It is up 34%. ATA [ph] has come out with a forecast for 2010. Worldwide miles for passenger and freight, there are projecting higher than 10% growth rate here. It seems that some airlines are - the airline sector in general is turning the corner. Last year, ATA said the whole industry lost about $10 billion. Now, they are projecting a profit of about $2.5 million.
On regional and business jets, we continue to see weakness of orders as well as deliveries. And lastly, let me point out lastly as destocking begins to ebb, it will have an immediate impact on our profitability.
Automotive, the next segment here, global production is expected to rise to around 66 million vehicles that is a plus 15%. The growth is in pretty much every region, except in Europe and Europe is pretty much driven by the strong incentives that pulled demand forward. European sales are down, but exports have risen for European companies by 40%. So it is interesting to see that European production due to that rise in exports is expected to be around 3.8%.
US sales are expected to be around 11.7 million vehicles, so around a 7% to 12% growth rate. That is what we see here. In China, up 10% to 15%, and it is interesting to know General Motors just announced that China sales surpassed the US first in their 102 history of GM. If you look at heavy truck and trailer, we increased our forecast. Global build rates are up, expected to be around 1.3 million units. Growth is pretty much in all regions, driven very strongly by increased global activities, as well as increased freight rates.
If you look at US trailer production alone, we have seen in this year a steady increase. January 2010, 5000 units; May 2010, 9000 units. If you look at orders in June, 13,000 units. Clear sign for growth in this market. Beverage can and packaging, the market is up modestly. Our strategy as you all know as you all know that has followed Alcoa to selectively partner with can sheet customers that understand our unmatched qualities as well as service capabilities and are willing to pay for the value.
Commercial building and construction, significant declines in the USA evidenced by increased delinquency rate on commercial and mortgage-backed securities. The outlook on US is depressed. China a very different picture, a positive growth is very strongly driven by economic stimulus measures coming in various forms in commercial centers, retail, as well as office space, government infrastructure, public health; education has high priority and hotel space.
Also for India we do need to market some [ph] by 15%. On the end markets, the industrial gas turbines negatively impacted by lower energy demand or postponements as well as deferrals of large projects. Also important is we see continued destocking of the OEMs. The good news on a short-term is the International Energy Agency reported that in March, it has been the fourth straight month of a year-on-year increase in electricity production in the OECD countries. Keep in mind before we had 17 months of declining production.
On the mid to long term, we are bullish on industrial gas turbines given the low equipment costs, higher variability, lower prices for natural gas and the environmental advantages that IGT has by our competing technologies. So if you sum that all up, there are real signs of improvement here on the production side, as well as on the order side. It remains below peak levels, but clearly improved, and clear sign of a continued global recovery there.
So let us go to the next slide. What you see here is that how does that translate into alumina demand broken down by the different regions. We are increasing our forecast for this year from originally 10% to 12% for this year. When you go through this, you see the growth rates here for the different region. You see robust consumption growth in places like China, Brazil and India. Modest increases in North America and Europe. We continue to see that graph is very tight and that continues to also drive primary metals demand.
Let us move to the inventories as many people are curious about what is going on on that level. You see on the left hand side, all the relevant inventories for LME, Shanghai, Japanese Port and Producers. It is consistent with the whole picture that you see a decrease in the LME inventories, but you also see a decrease when you add this all up, the global inventory levels are down, three days down from 66 days at the end of first quarter to 63 days today.
One aspect to note, not on this chart, but noteworthy, US distributor stocks are rising modestly but keep in mind that US distributor stocks have been at an all-time historic low. Scrap is basically not a variable in the US and there is very, very low imports coming in. Now, move to the right-hand side, that is why you see the regional premiums continuing to go up. You have tight physical market conditions that drive the regional premiums.
Look at the blue line there. This is Europe, Europe regional premiums. It is near an all-time record high. And look at the yellow line that is the Midwest regional premiums at a five year high.
Let us turn next to the supply demand balance and let us start with aluminum. Well, we have raised the demand projection, but at the same time we have seen that additional production came on-line. So, we continue to believe that we are going to have a surplus this year of roughly about 1.2 million tons. Let us start with China. China’s surplus has been reduced from 400,000 tons to 200,000 tons, 400,000 tons in the prior quarter to 200,000 tons now. And we continue to see that China is very, very good and I will talk more about it. We are managing the supply demand balance very well.
When you look at the west, the west increase of production is pretty much driven by Greenfield measures ramping up, coming online, the Middle East and India and then by restarts in Russia. These are the drivers that we see here. But let us put the 1.2 overhang in perspective. This equals two weeks of consumption, is well manageable and our forecast here has not even taken into account the full refilling of the inventory levels.
Let us go to the next slide. The next slide is a little busy, but we thought we would rather take this upfront, because this is a question that is raised a lot, what is going on in metals in China, and also fuelled by a lot of additional information coming in, and I will fill you in on what we think is going on there.
Let us first see - China is obviously an important market. It is also an important market for Alcoa. We have now sales of around $1 billion in China, and if you look at the last five years, we’ve had average growth rates of around 29% in that market. And we’re going to continue to see stronger penetration from our side. So let us start with this upper left chart here, and the blue is describing the production levels, and the red line is describing the Shanghai metal price. And what you saw there is once the Shanghai metal price came down, also the production level came down to a maximum of 27% were curtailed last year.
So that is really important to understand that Chinese aluminum industry response very, very fast and very drastic to changes in pricing, and really it is geared towards staying in balance, supply and demand balance. That is also what you see kind of on the left hand slide there, where the red dotted line shows the premium or discount of the Shanghai metal price to the LMEs, and the blue line shows whether China exports or imports. So, below the line is importing and above the line would be exporting, and the zero line would be exporting.
What you see there, last year the metal price in Shanghai was higher than the LMEs traded at a premium. That year we had about 1.5 million tons coming into the country. We believe this was mainly driven because of two effects, one on the one hand a drastic curtailment and on the other hand a very fast response of the economy to the substantial stimulus program in China. So not necessarily intended, but you see that once the Shanghai price is going into a discount as we have today, exports are not really going up because there is one additional element you have to keep in mind, and that is the 15% export duty that China has one primary metals.
So the reason why the country is steering this industry in that way is because it is energy intense. And energy is a scarce resource in China. It is a scarce resource in an absolute basis and it is a scarce resource on a relative basis, because what does China want to achieve? They want to increase doing - they are building out the higher value add businesses, and at the same time they have to make sure that the increased consumer demand is fulfilled. And I’m talking about additional refrigerators that are bought, washing machines and particularly given the hot summer that they are enjoying this year, the additional air conditioners and they actually are running a lot.
So this all comes into the equation and it is no surprise, and let us go to the right-hand side chart here. We actually saw in the last week the Chinese government announcing a broad based restructuring, not just referring to the aluminum market, but in general. But on the aluminum market, they basically said we are going to increase the power prices, and in some cases removed subsidies. But in all cases the prices are pretty much going up, and with that they are driving, and they actually stated that the restructuring of the aluminum industry.
Today the Shanghai metal up roughly about 14500 Renminbi pricing level. We believe that roughly 6 million tons of aluminum capacity in China is below the borderline. We expect that very soon, most likely in the third quarter we will see 1 million tons to 1.5 million tons coming offline. We actually have received note that about 700,000 tons have already come off line, or are about to come offline now in the Hainan province. So that is what is going on there, and I think it is important to understand and hopefully having answered some questions, and I’ll be happy to answer more questions on that.
Let us move to the next one, which is alumina, and alumina is a global market and we expect the global market to be relatively balanced. Chinese smelters are coming off line. Therefore there is less alumina demand, but we expect that we will also see a reduced refinery capacity as we have seen exactly that in the downturn. In fact the response on the refinery capacity was even faster and more drastic than what we saw on the smelters.
We are cutting our forecast for China imports on alumina from - we originally had 5.4 million tons to 4 million tons as we have seen Chinese importers reselling alumina cargos into the western market as they can profit from the higher prices. They usually get an additional premium of $10 to $20 per ton. So, so much about the market, let us now go through the Alcoa businesses, and I want to update you on how we’re driving value across all of our businesses.
Let us start with alumina. On alumina, we are the market leader, 18.1 million metric tons, and production capacity that is greatly positioned, very favorably positioned on the cost curve. Plus the good news is we are continuing to grow our low-cost production while bringing online (inaudible). We’re ramping the production up as we speak. It will be completed; the ramp up will be completed by the end of this year.
And then comes Ma'aden is at a new low-cost point on the curve. If you look at that, the alumina profitability is recovering. You can already see that on the left-hand side here of this chart, but it has not reached levels where we would expect this to be for all our business. You see the upper right-hand chart here shows the aluminum pricing, and we do see higher pricing driven by underlying industry costs, and obviously that improves profitability too.
Keep in mind that about 20% of our contract portfolio renews annually. So that is the ratio in which you would see things moving along here. If you put all these things together, our cost reduction actions, the tight markets, the higher pricing, we expect that the Alcoa alumina business can perform better than on the historic EBITDA to metric tons levels once the strong market returns.
Let us go to the primary metals; also here it was 4.5 million metric ton capacity. We are the leader. We have streamlined our system. We significantly reduced costs. We have optimized our portfolio, permanently curtailed smelters like East Alcoa and Baden, and we continue to steadily focus on improving our cost position. I will just give you one example here, and for us it is the kind of the normal thing to go through, but I think it is important to line that out.
If you look on the upper right-hand corner here, if you look at our sales generated energy, we’re building out our sales generation power through additions of hydropower in Brazil, Estreito and Sera [ph] are those two places where we have stakes in the new hydro dams there, and this will be replacing purchase power. The power cost will be 30% lower once they are online in 2011. It will bring our self generation for the smelting system up from 21% to 26%. That action alone will bring us down, the worldwide smelting system down one percentage point on the cost curve.
And again then comes Ma'aden. Ma'aden also on the smelter sets a new low-cost point. On Ma'aden, just as a quick update, all is well on track. We have just received commitments for our project financing for $4.5 billion. This is the first phase. Keep in mind the first phase here is the smelter as well as the rolling mill. All key project positions for the construction and the build out are filled, and we have started to break ground here.
All of this has helped us drive profitability during today’s volatile times and will also help us bring our EBIT margins above the historic levels once the market returns to the strong levels we have seen before.
Okay let us move to the next one. The next business is flat rolled. In flat rolled, we have taken aggressive actions. We have re-established profitability levels; we have reduced costs, divested underperforming assets, exited commoditized markets, emphasize high-value added products like aerospace as well as can sheet. Demand at the pricing levels that are consistent for the value that we are producing, and you see it already here in the profit margin, all actions have a good impact.
Second-quarter ’10, we have an EBIT margin that climbed to 10%. That is the right path and we will continue on that path. If you look at the right-hand side, we continue to see destocking in aerospace, plate and sheet. That will go well into the second half of 2010. Utilization continues to be at 75%, which is the same level that we saw in the first quarter.
As you know, we chose to not supply a large can sheet customer and rationalize capacity, reduce headcount, and signed up a new customer with higher pricing. Profitability has already improved and we will soon fully offset the margin impact. We are pleased to announce also that Russia is now having a positive operating income in the second quarter. China facilities are ramping up on schedule, and the Ma'aden joint-venture, our rolling mill, has broken ground. So, all of this together we are well positioned to deliver higher EBITDA margins.
Last but not least, certainly not least, engineered products and solutions, if you look at the left-hand side we achieved 17% EBITDA margin that is on par with the margin that we had in the second quarter of ’08. For that quarter we had 1.7 billion sales, which is 540 million higher than what we see today. Then you look at the utilization levels, today aerospace 70% and the rest 65%. And what need I say more. This is a clear reflection of our cost reduction and our strong competitive capabilities in this business.
On the right-hand side, aerospace, we see the demand returning in investment casting. It is marking an end to the destocking for turbine blades. On fasteners, we expect the destocking to last throughout the end of this year. Also, we continue to build out this group. We have bolted on an acquisition of Traco. Traco is a manufacturer of windows for commercial buildings and that is very nicely complementary to our building and construction portfolio. We’re building on our core strength. Organically as well as inorganically we are improving cost and we’re driving profitability in engineered products and solutions.
Let us now review our progress against our 2010 operational target. Procurement, our target 2.5 billion, we are at 1.4 billion now. Overhead target 500 million, we are at 311 million now. Total CapEx target of 1,250 [ph] that includes 250 million for Ma'aden. We have spent 514 million. On the working capital, 42 days. This is an improvement of 6 days year-on-year, and we remain well on target to achieve our 2010 goal.
So let us sum it up. Alcoa performance and strengthening, in this quarter we had 14% EBIT margin, and keep in mind this all in light of a low utilization rate in today’s market conditions. The long-term drivers remain intact. I started out giving you a perspective on that 6% we expect in the next 10 years of market growth, and there is upside. I referred to the lightweight aspect.
Add into this a great committed team that is committed to drive value. You will expect profitability to grow and outperform our pack. Let me close the presentation with that and hand over to our question-and-answer session.

I mean, I would say it is zero to be very clear. Zero, and if you look at last year, I mean, you actually saw what we have been able to do, we have actually been overshooting the target for last year. So on that end I would not have any concern.
On the procurement side, keep in mind I mean, this does not have energy in there, but you’re right, it has some elements in there where we actually have headwinds coming against us. And our attitude on this is headwinds are a fact of life. You sometimes have them, you sometimes are lucky to have tailwinds, but we are here as management to overcome those and that is the attitude that you see in the team, and they actually are very, very able and dedicated to always find new opportunities and as - for instance, I will just give you for instance, I have to run through what happened currently in China.
So with that, what’s happening in China currently, you also see on some of the materials that are input materials for us. You see that there will be also input materials coming online most likely, and we’ve also shown last year that we are much able to change pricing even for commodities by bringing in the materials from other regions and with that changing the pricing mechanics in certain regions. You will continue to see us using the full gamut that exists on the procurement side. Chuck, you want to add to -

I think the biggest risk that we continue to have is not coming from what’s called the real economy, it is more coming from the volatility in the financial markets. Obviously, I mean, currency swings could potentially have a big impact on us. So that’s what I would see. I mean, I’ve gone through on off the end markets and you’ve seen that all indications if you dig and dig deeper, you see that there is a lot of very positive indications there of a real recovery in almost all of these markets, but I believe that the biggest risk is still the volatility that could potentially come from financial markets and reflected in the currency.
Then on China you’re right. I mean, we believe to clarify that, we believe that 1 to 1.5 million tons will come off pretty soon. As I’ve said 700,000 has probably already come off as I speak now, but we believe in total we have 6 million being under water and yes, some new capacity will potentially get started up in China, but on the other hand the aspect of changing the industry over to a higher value add industry and going away from energy intense industry continues to be a scene, and this scene - we’ve talked about this quite a bit but you continue to see it is becoming very, very real. So that is what we believe is coming on there and the most important thing out of all this is probably, I mean, I again and again confronted with people, not people like you that know our industry very well, but those that’s just I mean, take a little look into our industry and they ask the question, aren’t you concerned that China will flood the market with metal, when they don’t have any place in China to go, and my answer always is no, I’m not concerned at all because you have very, very different fundamentals here to some other industries like the telecom equipment industry or so. Our business is built on a strong energy intensity and energy is a scarce commodity in China and they are needed more for other things.

Most of the volume went to a small competitor here in the US, and there was no - well, I don’t know where it is now [ph], but I haven’t seen any indications that there has been a material, strong material substitution.
In fact, I mean, when you look at that can sheet growth, you see that can sheet is rather coming back to growth. So, but as I already said before I mean, when you look at whether the strategy has worked out or not, I mean, the profitability that we’ve reached now on flat rolls shows we’re finally to old levels of profitability, 10% EBIT margin, and this can still be improved over time and we have pretty much been able with the restructuring that we’ve taken, we were taking on new customers that were willing to pay for value to almost come back to - almost compensate for all the profits that has been lost through this contract.
That’s the first one and the second one, second question that you had was on Russia, that’s not only volume. I mean the good news is Russia is coming back and depending on who you listen to, they are projecting growth between 3% to 5% even this year in Russia we are seeing that we’ve been able to capture some of that, capture also new customers there but also, I mean, the big part of the story is the restructuring. If you look at from the day that we bought the facilities in Russia, we’ve probably taken out more than 7000 people there.
And literally when you were to see pictures of how the plants looked before and how they look today, I mean, you would think that this is entirely different plans. We’ve invested quite substantially. We’ve also invested in our people and in the processes there, and today I mean, these are world-class facilities. We are the only company that produces can and tap [ph] in Russia, and are positioned for growth that will be coming in Russia. Good signs there. Thank you, Pertash.

My question is really similar to what Sal was asking in terms of looking ahead for the third quarter. We are seeing some headwinds in terms of pricing, some of your downstream businesses are going to face a seasonal slowdown due to the summer months, and you've already guided for flat volumes for your primary smelting business. So what do you think can really drive Alcoa's earnings on a quarterly basis significantly higher from here in the second half? Would you attribute it more to your continued internal cost cutting program? Are you looking for maybe the off-lining of this Chinese capacity that you mentioned that's about to be shut? Or is it going to be maybe more volume driven in the fourth quarter if you're expecting a continued strong recovery in the US? So if you could just talk about where you could see earnings going in the near term, second half of 2010 and what would be the key drivers.

So that all will continue to drive profitability and I talked about some destocking coming to an end when you look at aerospace turbines blades, and all of those are factors that we will use to continue to drive profitability in the fourth quarter and going forward.

I mean, we actually see, maybe we can bring that chart on. I don’t know how complicated that is, the chart with the various end markets that’s I think pretty illustrative. When you go to China you pretty much see automotive continues to be up. There it is exactly and go to the China column there, automotive is up. We continue to see that heavy trucks and traders up, beverage cans up. Even commercial buildings and construction, I went through that and that’s driven by strong support from economic stimulus programs up in China and I mean, if I want to add to that, I mean, when you talk to people and there is negativity, I mean, they sometimes I mean, they throw at me, hey, Klaus, but in China there is a big bubble developing in real estate, and when you look at it a little deeper, you see there seems to be a growing credit risk from the Chinese banking sector.
The investment real estate rose 38% and property values rose 68% in Main cities. Yes, that’s true. The Central Government has responded in the usual fashion, responded very, very quickly and they are now focusing on low-cost affordable housing, particularly in urban areas and in out of city areas. Always keep in mind you’re talking about a nation with 1.3 billion people, and 1.3 billion people going through an urbanization phase as I said. I mean, they will be moving into, cities will be the major part of the population already in five years.
That’s almost hard to imagine, and what some people are estimating is that there will be 6 million units of low-cost housing built in this year alone. The government has dedicated over $130 billion to put into housing, low cost housing basically being built out and that’s the amount until 2012 basically. So that’s what I’m seeing and then when you talk to people that are negative on China, I mean, I’m always asking now, okay, so what’s your growth rate projection, and actually what I’m then hearing is that people that are negative on China are telling me well, you know, what I’m expecting 8.5%.
Well, 8.5% is I mean, by all means a pretty substantial number. I mean, when you look at the Chinese, the Chinese government, they just raised their growth rate from 8.6% to 9.1% and when you look at the last IMF report it’s 10.5%. So we see that. We continue to see that all across the board. I continue to be an optimistic on China and believe that they are managing very well through some of the overheating that happens in some of the markets and you see in all markets they’re now going to the next phase and restructuring the market to get aluminum market become more efficient and to become more power conscious.

I'm joined by Chuck McLane, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Klaus Kleinfeld, Chairman and CEO. After comments by Chuck and Klaus, we'll take your questions. 
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's press release and our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and the appendix of today's presentation and on our website at www.alcoa.com, under the Invest section. 
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."

Thanks, Matt, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us today. We got a fairly clean quarter, so let me run through it. Our increased performances this quarter reflects continuing improvement in our key end markets, as well as strong performance in our cash sustainability initiatives. We were able to generate positive free cash flow, and we maintained  a strong liquidity position. So let's move to the next slide, and I'll highlight the financial results for the quarter.
Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $137 million or $0.13 per share compared with a first quarter loss from continuing operations of $194 million or a loss of $0.19 per share. Remember, first quarter 2010 results included restructuring and special charges of $295 million or $0.29 per share. We generated EBITDA of $724 million, a 14% EBITDA margin, which is the highest since the third quarter of 2008. Higher volumes in most end markets and continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives drove this bottom line performance.  Free cash flow in the quarter was $87 million, and debt to capital stood at 38.4%. Lastly, our liquidity remains strong with $1.34 billion of cash on hand.
Let's move to the next slide, which illustrates the revenue change by market. Revenues in most of our markets improved sequentially. Aerospace rose as destocking activity begins to slow, and orders rise from Investment Castings business. New customers and seasonal increases drove Packaging sales higher, while Commercial Transportation benefited from increased global economic activity. Higher third-party Alumina shipments helped drive sales in that business, up 10% sequentially. While many markets are up significantly year-over-year, let's remember that these improvements are relative to a very weak period in 2009. So let's move on to the income statement.  
Third-party revenues rose 6% sequentially on higher third-party shipments in the upstream and improved demand in almost every end market. COGS as a percent of sales fell to 81.2%, driven through continued progress on our cash sustainability initiatives. These activities also help to improve SG&A as a percent of sales by almost a full percentage point. We have a tight focus on spending as market activity increases, operating more effectively and minimizing rehires where possible. 
Let me remind you that we reduced headcount by approximately 37,000 since the downturn began in late 2008. Our cash sustainability initiatives drove a reduction of 17,000, while divestitures are responsible for the remainder. We are not only holding headcount levels but are also driving restructuring this quarter that will result in further reductions. Lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was 25%. 
For your reference, we have attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate. Included in the tax rate this quarter are discrete items totaling $16 million. Going forward, we expect our operational ETR to be approximately 32%. However, we will continue to experience swings in the rate, given the volatility in our profit drivers and overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction.  Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter. 
This slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location in the financial statements. As you can see, these items had no net impact on the overall results, yet they do impact specific line items on the income statement. We have therefore included this detail to enable a clear analysis of our results. 
First, restructuring was $20 million and relates primarily to further headcount reductions. Discrete tax items totaled a favorable $16 million. Non-cash mark-to-market benefits on derivatives in several power contracts totaled $22 million, and the negative decision in a lawsuit related to Rockdale negatively impacted results by $7 million. 
Lastly, we reached a mutually beneficial agreement with United Steelworkers, which helped sustain our competitive position in the U.S. We are very pleased that our employees ratified the agreement in late June. Preparation costs for a potential strike and a onetime signing bonus for employees totaled $13 million this quarter. Let's now move to the sequential bridge.  
This slide bridges our income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and special items. Lower realized aluminum pricing and higher LME-linked costs, particularly energy, were more than offset by higher volumes in every business. Performance benefited from a rising U.S. dollar and favorable non-LME-linked energy rates. Productivity gains related to our cash sustainability initiatives continued to enhance bottom line performance and account for approximately 60% of the sequential improvement. Now let's turn to the segments starting with Alumina. 
Production was up 24,000 metric tons this quarter. Increases at Point Comfort, Suriname and Wagerup were mostly offset by a reduction in São Luís and lower production in Jamaica. The São Luís ramp-up was slower than anticipated, due to commissioning issues experienced in the quarter and is operating at roughly 6,800 tons per day. We remain on track to meet our target of achieving full run rate production of 9,000 tons per day by the end of 2010.
Turning to profitability. The strengthening U.S. dollar yielded positive currency effects of $18 million, primarily related to the depreciation of the Aussie dollar. A 1% increase in third-party pricing and higher third-party volumes contributed $5 million to ATOI in the quarter. The impact of the commissioning issues at São Luís this quarter negatively impacted results by $11 million.
Moving to the outlook, alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag, and we will continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives. Lastly, we expect production to increase by 150,000 tons versus the second quarter, as the ramp-up at São Luís continues to progress.
Let's move to the Primary segment. Second quarter performance was negatively impacted by a 1% decline in realized price and higher LME-linked alumina and power costs. Alumina and LME-linked power costs roughly represent 45% of costs of aluminum production and typically follow a quarter lag to the LME. Favorable currency and non-LME-linked energy costs, combined with productivity improvements, partially offset the negative impact of pricing. As you'll recall, the first quarter included $11 million related to a maintenance outage at the Rockdale Power Plant. In the second quarter, the final resolution of litigation related to our Rockdale Power contract resulted in a negative impact of $10 million. 
Also in the quarter, we curtailed Fusina and production at our Aviles smelter was halted due to heavy flooding. We're in the process of restarting production and anticipate Aviles to be at full operating rate by the fourth quarter this year.  Looking forward to the third quarter, we anticipate pricing to follow a 15-day lag. We expect continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives, and lastly, we expect production to be equal to the second quarter.
Moving now to Flat-Rolled Products. Flat-Rolled Products ATOI improved by $41 million sequentially, driven by higher volumes in Russia, China and North America and continued benefits from our cash sustainability program. We have rationalized our cost structure in the North American Can Sheet business to reflect lower volumes, and we are winning new orders at pricing levels that properly reflect the value we deliver to our customers. 
In the third quarter, we estimate that EBITDA margins in our North American Can Sheet business will be on par with that we achieved during the prior year. In short, our actions will have fully offset the lost margin associated with our decision to forego sales to a large North American customer.
We experienced sequential revenue growth in substantially all end markets, led by Commercial Transportation and Packaging. Our growth businesses in Russia and China had steadily improved during the year. In Russia, we are very pleased that a significant restructuring has allowed us to fully benefit from improving market conditions and drive our Russian operations to profitability this quarter. Next quarter, we see improving demand in each of our regions. We anticipate normal seasonal plant slowdowns and continued gains from our cash sustainability initiatives.
Let's turn to the EPS segment. ATOI of $107 million was up 32% sequentially. Continued strong performances in our cash sustainability initiatives helped generate an EBITDA margin of 17.2%, 2.7 percentage points above the second quarter of 2009 when sales were $72 million higher. These results illustrate how this segment has structurally improved its cost position through sustainable actions. 
Revenue increased 4% sequentially on higher volumes in our Aerospace Structural Castings business and our Commercial Building and Construction business. While the global commercial building and construction market continues to decline, improved sales in this market reflect our leading brands and strong relationships with well-positioned customers. Looking ahead, we anticipate normal seasonal plant slowdowns but continued gains from our cash sustainability initiatives. Let's now move to the cash flow statement. 
For the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $300 million. The sequential increases was driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. In the quarter, we ended several accounts receivable sales programs, which resulted in an unfavorable working capital impact of approximately $260 million. However, our cash sustainability efforts helped to hold days working capital at 42 days, which is a six-day improvement over the same period last year. Capital expenditures totaled $213 million. Including the net investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which flows through other investing activities, spending totaled $233 million. This keeps us on track against our 2010 target of $1.25 billion. Free cash flow in the second quarter totaled $87 million. 
So let's summarize. We are free cash flow positive in 2010, a result of our disciplined execution in each of our cash sustainability initiatives. Our performance this quarter also illustrates that we've structurally improved our ability to drive bottom line growth. We made outstanding progress in reducing our cost and maintaining these reductions, and markets begin to recover. We are effectively managing capital expenditures and working capital to meet our full year targets. Every Alcoan is committed to achieving these targets. Across the company, we are aggressively pursuing higher levels of free cash flow and profitability, ultimately driving near-term and long-term shareholder value. 
Thanks, and I'd like to turn it over to Klaus now."

And in the usual fashion, I will tell you something about our end-market development, aluminum demand, supply picture, as well as Alcoa's businesses. But before that, I would like to give you a little bit of a broader frame around all of that. Given that today, almost on a daily or hourly basis, we read all the headlines, tracking the economic recovery, we felt that it's worthwhile to provide a little bit of a true north, at least for the aluminum demand on a mid- to longer-term basis.
There is a strong mid- to long-term aluminum fundamentals, and it's pretty much driven by the mega-trends that we see changing our planet. On the one hand, let's not forget, we have 3 billion more people coming on to this planet in a reasonably short time until 2050, and most of them will be living in cities. So urbanization is a big thing. It was just last week that the Commissioner or Population Commissioner on China made the statement that in less than five years, they are expecting that more people will live in urban environments than rural environments also in China. All of that together, I mean, population growth, urbanization, all of that drives demands and all kinds of growth. 
And when you then look at the properties that aluminum brings to the table, lightweighting and high strength and recyclability, I'm always amazed by some of the statistics. Looking at 75% of all aluminum ever produced on this planet still being in use, that shows great capabilities of aluminum. And it makes aluminum the material of choice in many of those applications. And all of this together, we believe, is going to drive demand in the next 10 years, pretty much up to 73 million tons in 2020. That's an average growth rate per annum of 6%. This forecast is pretty much based only on kind of historic correlations between societies getting richer, building out middle class, building infrastructure. This is most likely rather conservative view, and I'll explain why I think that, because we are seeing some strong material replacement effect in some areas, like automotive, and I'll give you some color on that before I go into the other things.
We see globally a push for fuel efficiency coming from consumers, as well as aggressive legislation. In the U.S., the new emissions standard, CAFE, was just passed, and you see here on the left-hand side what this regulation actually forces the automakers to achieve. It forces the automakers to achieve an improvement from today, 25.5 miles per gallon in 2016 already to reduce it to a higher efficiency of 35.5 miles per gallon. If you look at that, you're talking about six years timeframe. This is a big task. I mean it's a big task in a very, very short time. When you then listen to how the automakers are intending to do that, they pretty much say, ""We really only got three levers here. We can improve powertrain, drivetrain and the lightweighting.""
And when it comes to lightweighting, aluminum is the material of choice, which you can see here nicely depicted on the right-hand side. Let's go to the upper right-hand side, fuel economy improvement. And we here compared it to the most competitive material, which is high-strength steel. And actually, you see that aluminum has a 3x benefit over high-strength steel. Then, when you look at what does that translate to when it comes to emissions, it actually translates to a 3x better CO2 emissions. Both of those things, obviously not only important, but when you think about a 3x improvement, that is rather dramatic. 
That's the reason why when you look one level deeper, and here, look at the different aluminum penetration opportunities in automotive, what you see here on the left-hand side is the different types of consumptions by a component in automotive.  And you see the light blue is where aluminum already plays a role today, and the darker blue is where we believe aluminum will play a role pretty soon, a stronger role pretty soon. The biggest opportunity that we see here is in body structures and panel. 
If you take that and multiply that out, it translates into an additional primary aluminum demand of 10 million tons in the next 10 years. And that's only -- only a fraction of that 10 million is baked into our 6% demand growth, all right? That gives you a bit of the feel for what is going on. Obviously, this change will not come overnight, but the pressure is increasing, increasing from legislation and increasing from consumers. We are currently working intensely with our automotive customers and are helping to design the next-generation fuel-efficient cars, trucks, as well as buses. So let's now go to the end markets and look at how the different end markets are doing. 
This is the traditional chart that we have been showing. And just a first impression compared to the last quarter, it shows you the end-market demand in 2010 is improved. You see more green arrows here than in the last quarter. Growth expectations are rising in Automotive, Trucks and Trailer, as well as in Packaging. So that's very consistent with the last IMF forecast. IMF increased their worldwide growth assumption to 4.6% from originally in April, 4.2%. By the way, China in that makes up for 10.5 percentage points, and we'll come to that.
Aerospace. Let's go to the segments. So the first segment, Aerospace. Let's go back. On the large commercial aircraft, delivery rates are essentially flat. Boeing and Airbus have announced modest build rate increases. Boeing is at 31.4 up to 34 units. Airbus is at 34 units up to 36. But let's keep in mind, until very recently, most of the industry observers have been projecting further production cuts. Whereas in reality, when you look at orders until June are up significantly, up to a level of 268 versus 69 units in 2009. Yes, granted this is not at historic levels, but I think there is no doubt this is substantially better than what we saw before.
We also see in Aerospace passenger traffic miles are up. If you look at the May year-on-year numbers, it's 12%. And if you look at air freight traffic, freight traffic miles, which is more of a leading indicator, is up 34%. IATA has come out with a forecast for 2010. Worldwide miles for passenger and freight, they are projecting higher than 10% growth rate here. It seems that some airlines are -- or the airline sector in general is turning the corner. Last year, IATA said the whole industry lost about $10 billion. Now they are projecting a profit of around $2.5 billion for this year. On Regional and Business Jets, we continue to see weakness of orders, as well as deliveries. And lastly, let me point out lastly, as destocking begins to ebb, it will have an immediate impact on our profitability. 
Automotive, the next segment here, global production is expected to rise to around 66 million vehicles. That's a plus 15%. The growth is pretty much in every region except in Europe. In Europe, pretty much driven by the strong incentives last year that pulled demand forward. European sales are down, but export had risen for European companies by 40%. So it's interesting to see that European production due to that rise in exports is expected to be around 3.8%.
U.S. sales are expected to be around 11.7 million vehicles, so around a 7% to 12% growth rate. That's what we see here in China, up 10%, 15%. And it's interesting to note, General Motors just announced that the China sales surpassed the U.S., a first in their 102-year history of GM.
If you look at Heavy Truck and Trailer, we increased our forecast. Global build rates are up, expected to be around 1.3 million units. Growth is pretty much in all regions, driven very strongly by increased global activities, as well as increased freight rate. If you look at U.S. Trailer production alone, we've seen in this year a steady increase: January 2010, 5,000 units; May 2010, 9,000 units. If you look at orders in June, 13,000 units, a clear sign for growth in this market. 
Beverage Can and Packaging market is up modestly. It's our strategy, as you all know, that have followed Alcoa to selectively partner with can sheet customers that understand our unmatched quality, as well as service capabilities and are willing to pay for the value. 
Commercial Building and Construction, significant decline from the U.S.A., evidenced by the increased delinquency rates on commercial mortgage-backed securities. The outlook on Europe is depressed. China, a very different picture, a positive growth is very strong and driven by the economic stimulus and measures coming in various forms here in commercial centers, retailers, as well as office space. Government infrastructure, public health, education have high priority and hotel space. Also for India, we do need to model some by [ph] 15%.
These [ph] on the end markets, the industrial gas turbines negatively impacted by lower energy demand or a postponement, as well as deferrals of large projects. And also important is we see a continued destocking of the OEMs. The good news on a short term is, the International Energy Agency reported that in March, it's been the fourth straight months of a year-on-year increased electricity production in the OECD countries. Keep in mind, before we had 17 months of declining production. 
On the mid- to long term, we are bullish on industrial gas turbines, given the low equipment costs, high availability, lower prices for natural gas and the environmental advantages that IGT has via competing technologies. So if you sum that all up, there's real signs of improvement here on the production side, as well as on the order side. It remains below peak levels but clearly improved, a clear sign of a continued global recovery there. 
So let's go to the next slide. What you see here is how does that translate into aluminum demand broken down by the different region. We are increasing our forecast for this year from originally 10% to 12% for this year. When you go through this, you see that -- you see the growth rate here for the different regions. You see robust consumption growth in places like China, Brazil, India, modest increases in North America and Europe. We continue to see that graph is very tight, and that continues to also drive primary metals demand.
Let's move to the inventories, as many people are curious about what's going on, on that level. Here, you see on the left-hand side, all the relevant inventories, LME, Shanghai, Japanese Port and Producers is consistent with a whole picture that you see a decrease in the LME inventories, but you also see a decrease. And when you add these all up, the global inventory levels are down, three days down from 66 days in the level end of first quarter to 63 days today. One aspect to note, not on this chart but noteworthy, U.S distributor stocks are rising modestly. But keep in mind, U.S. distributor stock have to be at an all-time historic low. Scrap is basically not available in the U.S., and there is very, very low imports coming in.
Now move to the right-hand side, that is why you see the regional premium continuing to go up. You have tight physical market conditions that drives the regional premium. Look at the blue line there. This is Europe. Europe regional premium is near an all-time record high. Look at the yellow line, that's the Midwest regional premium at a five-year high.
Let's turn next to the supply-demand balance, and let's start with aluminum. Well, we've raised the demand projection, but at the same time, we've seen additional production came online. So we continue to believe that we're going to have a surplus this year of roughly about 1.2 million tons. 
Let's start with China. China's surplus has been reduced from 400,000 tons to 200,000 tons, 400,000 tons in the prior quarter to 200,000 tons now. And we continue to see that China is very, very good, and I'll talk more about it. They're managing the supply-demand balance very well.
When you look at the West, the West increase of production is pretty much driven by Greenfield smelters ramping up, coming online in the Middle East and India and then by restarts in Russia. These are the drivers that we see here. But let's put the 1.2 million overhang in perspective. This equals two weeks of consumption, well manageable, and our forecast here has not even taken into account the full refilling of the inventory levels. 
Let's go to the next slide. The next slide is a little busy, but we thought that we'd rather take this up, up front because this is a question that is raised a lot: What's going on in metals in China? And also fueled by a lot of additional information coming in, and I'll fill you in on what we think is going on there. Let's first see -- China is obviously an important market. It's also an important market for Alcoa. We have now sales of around $1 billion in China. And if you look at the last five years, we've had average growth rate of around 29% in that market, and we're going to continue to see a stronger penetration from our side. 
So let's start with this upper-left chart here. The blue thing is describing the production levels and the red line is describing the Shanghai metal price. And what you saw there is, once the Shanghai metal price came down, also were the production level came down to a maximum of 27% were curtailed last year. So that's really important to understand that Chinese aluminum industry responds very, very fast and very drastic to changes in pricing and really is geared towards staying in balance, supply and demand balance. 
That's also what you see kind of on the left-hand slide here, the left-hand slide there, where the red dotted line shows the premium or discount of the Shanghai metal price to the LME, and the blue line shows whether China exports or imports. So below the line is importing and above the line would be exporting, minus the zero line would be exporting. What you see there, last year, the metal price in Shanghai was higher than the LME. So it traded at a premium. At that year, we had about 1.5 million tons coming in into the country. We believe this was mainly driven because of two effects: on the one hand, a drastic curtailment; and on the other hand, a very fast response of the economy to the substantial stimulus program in China, so not necessarily intended. But you see that once the Shanghai price is going into a discount as we have today, exports are not really going up because of one additional element you have to keep in mind, and that's the 15% export duty that China has on primary metals.  
So the reason why the country is steering this industry in that way is because it's energy intense. And energy is a scarce resource in China. It's a scarce resource on an absolute basis and a scarce resource on a relative basis because, what does China want to achieve? They want to increase doing the building out the higher value-add businesses. And at the same time, they have to make sure that the increased consumer demand is fulfilled. And I'm talking about additional refrigerators that are bought, washing machines, and particularly, given the hot summer that they are enjoying this year, the additional air conditioners, and they actually are running a lot. So this all comes into the equation then. It's no surprise, and let's go to the right-hand side chart here, that we actually saw that last week, the Chinese government announcing a broad-based restructuring, not just referring to the aluminum market, but in general. But on the aluminum market, they basically said, ""We're going to increase the power prices, and in some cases, remove subsidies."" But in all cases, the prices are pretty much going up. And with that, they are driving and they actually stated that a restructuring of the aluminum industry.
At today's Shanghai metal of roughly about 14,500 renminbi pricing level, we believe that roughly 6 million tons of aluminum capacity in China is below the water line. We expect that very soon, most likely in the third quarter, we would see 1 million to 1.5 million tons coming offline. We actually have received note that about 700,000 tons have already come offline or are about to come offline now in the Henan province. So that's what's going on there. And I think it's important to understand and hopefully having answered some questions, and I'd be happy to answer more questions on that. 
Let's move to the next one, which is Alumina. Aluminum is a global market, and we expect this global market to be relatively balanced. Chinese metals are coming offline, therefore, there is less alumina demand. But we expect that we will also see your reduced refinery capacity, as we've seen exactly that in the downturn. In fact, the response on the refinery capacity was even faster and more drastic than what we saw on the smelters. We are cutting our forecast for China imports on alumina from -- we originally had 5.4 million tons to 4 million tons, as we have seen Chinese importers reselling alumina cargoes into the Western markets, as they can profit from the higher price as they usually get an additional premium of $10 to $20 per ton.
So, so much about the markets. Let's now go to the Alcoa businesses, and I want to update you on how we are driving value across all of our businesses. Let's start with Alumina. 
On Alumina, we are the market leader, 18.1 million metric tons and production capacity that is greatly positioned, very favorably positioned on the cost curve. Plus, the good news is, we are continuing to grow our low-cost production. We're bringing online São Luís, Juruti. We are ramping the production up, as we speak. The ramp-up will be completed by the end of this year. 
And then comes Ma'aden. Ma'aden has a new low-cost point on the curve, right? If you look at that, the alumina profitability is recovering. You can already see that on the left-hand side here of this chart, but it's not reached levels where we would expect this to be for our business. You see the upper right-hand chart here shows the aluminum pricing. And we do see higher pricing, driven by underlying industry costs. And obviously, that improves profitability, too. Keep in mind that about 20% of our contract portfolio renews annually. So that's the ratio in which you would see things moving along here. If you put all these things together, our cost reduction actions, the tight market, the higher pricing, we expect that the Alcoa Alumina business can perform better on the historic EBITDA to metric tons levels once the strong market returns.
Let's go to the Primary Metals. Also here, with 4.5 million metric tons capacity, we are a leader. We streamlined our system. We significantly reduced costs. We optimized our portfolio, permanently curtailed smelter like East Alcoa and Badin, and we continue to steadily focus on improving our cost position. 
Just to give you one example here. And for us, it's kind of the normal thing to go through. But I think it's important to line that out. If you look on the upper right-hand corner here, you look at our self-generated energy, we are building out our self-generation power through additions of hydropower in Brazil. Estreito and Serra do Facão are those two places where we have stakes in the new hydro dams there. And this will be replacing purchased power. The power cost will be 30% lower once they are online in 2011, and we'll bring our self generation for the smelting system up from 21% to 26%. That action alone will bring us down, the worldwide smelting system down  one percentage point on the cost curve. 
And again then comes Ma'aden. Ma'aden also on the smelter, sets a new low-cost point. On Ma'aden, just as a quick update, all is well on track. We've just received commitments for our product financing for $4.5 billion. This is the first phase. Keep in mind, the first phase here is the smelter, as well as the rolling mill. All key project positions for the construction and the buildout are filled, and we've started to break ground here. All of these helps us drive profitability during today's volatile times and will also help us bring our EBIT margin above the historic levels once the market returns to the strong levels we've seen it before.
Okay, let's move to the next one. The next business is Flat-Rolled. In Flat-Rolled, we've taken aggressive actions. We've re-established profitability levels. We've reduced costs; divested underperforming assets; exited commoditized markets; emphasized high-value ebb for us, like aerospace as well as can sheet; demand at the pricing levels that are consistent with the value that we are producing. And you see it already here in the profit margin, all actions have a good impact. Second quarter '10, we have an EBIT margin that climbed to 10%. That's the right path, and we will continue on that path. 
If you look at the right-hand side, we continue to see a destocking in Aerospace, Plate and Sheets that will go well into the second half in 2010. Utilization continues to be at 75%, which is the same level that we saw in the first quarter. As you know, we chose to not supply a large can sheet customer and rationalized capacity, reduced headcount and signed up new customer with higher pricing. Profitability has already improved, and we would soon fully offset the margin impact.
Pleased to announce also that Russia is now having a positive after tax operating income in the second quarter. China facilities are ramping up on schedule, and the Ma'aden joint venture and rolling mill has broken ground. So all of these together, we're well-positioned to deliver higher EBITDA margin. 
Last but certainly not least, Engineered Products and Solutions, if you look at the left-hand side, we achieved a 17% EBITDA margin that's on par with the margin that we had in the second quarter of '08. Of that quarter, we had $1.7 billion sales, which is $540 million higher than what we see today. And then you look at the utilization levels today, Aerospace, 70%, and the rest, 65%. And what, need I say more, this is a clear reflection of our cost reduction and our strong competitive capabilities in this business.
On the right-hand side, Aerospace, we see the demand returning in investment casting. It's marking an end to the destocking for turbine blades. On Fasteners, we expect the destocking to lag throughout the end of this year. Also we continue to build out this group. We bolted on an acquisition of TRACO. TRACO is a manufacturer of windows for commercial buildings, and that's very nicely complementary to our Building & Construction portfolio. We're building on our core strength organically, as well as inorganically. We are improving costs, and we are driving profitability in Engineered Products and Solutions.
Let's now review our progress against our 2010 operational improvement target. Procurement, our target, $2.5 billion, we are at a $1.4 billion now. Overhead target, $500 million, we are at $311 million now. Total CapEx target of $1.250 million, that includes $250 million for Ma'aden. We've spent $514 million. On the working capital, 42 days, this is an improvement of six days year-on-year, and we remain well on target to achieve our 2010 goal. 
So let's sum it up. Alcoa, the performance is strengthening. In this quarter, we had 14% EBIT margin, and keep in mind, this is all in light of a low utilization rate in today's market condition. The long-term drivers remain intact. I started out giving you a perspective on that 6% we expect in the next 10 years of market growth, and there is upside I referred to, the lightweighting aspect. Add into this a great committed team that's committed to drive value, you will expect profitability to grow and outperform our past. 
Let me close the presentation with that and hand over to our question-and-answer session."

We have actually been overshooting the target for last year. So on that end, I would not have any concern. On the procurement side, keep in mind, I mean, this does not have energy in there. But you're right, it has some elements in there where we actually have, had, had been coming against us. And our attitude on this is, headwinds are a fact of life. You sometimes have them. You sometimes are lucky to have tailwind. But we are here as management to overcome those. And that's the attitude that you see in the team, and they actually are very, very able and dedicated to always find new opportunities and ask you, for instance -- I’ll just give you a for instance, I have run through what happens currently in China. So with that, what's happening in China currently you also see on some of the materials that are input materials for us. You see that there will be also input materials coming online most likely. And we've also shown last year that we are much able to change pricing even for commodities by bringing in the materials from other regions and with that, changing the pricing mechanics in certain regions. You will continue to see us using the full gamut that exists on the procurement side. Chuck, you want to add something to that?"

I mean I've gone through all of the end markets and you've seen that all indications that if you dig and dig and dig deeper, you see that there is a lot of very positive indications there of a real recovery in almost all of these markets. But I believe that the biggest risk is still the volatility that could potentially come from financial markets and reflect it in the currency. Then on China, you're right. To clarify that, we believe that 1 million to 1.5 million tons will come off pretty soon. As I said, 700,000 has probably already come off as I speak now. But we believe in total, we have 6 million being under water. Yes, some new capacity will potentially get started up in China. But on the other hand, the aspect of changing the industry over to a higher value-add industry and going away from energy-intense industry continues to be a theme. And this theme we've talked about, there's quite a bit, but you continue to see it. It is becoming very, very real. So that is what we believe is coming on there. And the most important thing out of all this is probably -- I mean, I get again and again confronted with people, not people like you that know our industry very well, but those that just, I mean, take a little look into our industry and they asked the question, ""Aren't you concerned that China will flood the market with metal when they don't have any place in China to go?"" And my answer always ""No, I'm not concerned at all because you have very, very different fundamentals here to some other industries, like the telecom equipment industry or so.""

Most of the volume went to a small competitor here in the U.S. And there was no -- well, I don't know whether there was no, but I haven't seen any indications that there has been a material, a strong material substitution. In fact, I mean, when you look at the can sheet growth, you see that can sheet is rather coming back to growth. And so but as I already said before, I mean when you look at whether the strategy has worked out or not, I mean, the profitability that we've reached now on Flat-Rolled shows we are finally to old levels of profitability, 10% EBIT margin, and this can still be improved over time. And we have pretty much been able, with the restructuring that we've taken. We're taking on new customers that we are willing to pay for value to almost come back to almost compensate for all the profit that has been lost through this contract. That's the first one. The second one, the second question that you had was on Russia. That's not only volume. I mean the good news is Russia is coming back, and depending on who you listen to, they are projecting growth between 3% to 5% even this year in Russia. We are seeing that we have been able to capture some of that, capture also new customers there. But also, I mean the big part of the story is the restructuring. If you look at from the day that we bought the facilities in Russia, we've probably taken out more than 7,000 people there. And literally, when you were to see pictures of how the plants look before and how they look today, I mean, you would think that this is entirely different plants. We have invested quite substantially. We've also invested in our people and in the process there. And today, I mean these are world-class facilities.

I mean if I want to add to that, I mean, when you talk to people and there's negativity, sometimes I mean they throw at me, ""Hey, Klaus."" But in China, there is a big bubble developing in real estate, and when you look at it a little deeper, you see there seems to be growing credit risk from the Chinese banking sector. The investment real estate rose 38%, property values rose 68% in the main cities. Yes, that's true. The central government has, in the usual fashion, responded very, very quickly, and they are now focusing on low-cost affordable housing, particularly in urban areas and in outer city areas. Always keep in mind, you're talking about a nation with 1.3 billion people and 1.3 billion people going to an urbanization phase as I said. I mean they will be moving into -- the cities, will be the major part of the population already in five years. That's almost hard to imagine.

Well, 8.5% is, I mean by all means, a pretty substantial number. I mean when you look at the Chinese government, they just raised their growth rate from 8.6% to 9.1%, and when you look at the last IMF report, it's 10.5%. So we continue to see that all across the board. I continue to be optimistic on China and believe that they are managing very well through some of the overheating that happens in some of the markets. And you see in all markets, they are now going to the next phase and restructuring the aluminum market to become more efficient and to become more power conscious."

Thanks, Matt, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us today. We got a fairly clean quarter, so let me run through it. Our increased performances this quarter reflects continuing improvement in our key end markets, as well as strong performance in our cash sustainability initiative. We were able to generate positive free cash flow, and we maintained a strong liquidity position. So let's move to the next slide, and I'll highlight the financial results for the quarter.
Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $137 million or $0.13 per share compared with a first quarter loss from continuing operations of $194 million or a loss of $0.19 per share. Remember, first quarter 2010 results included restructuring and special charges of $295 million or $0.29 per share. We generated EBITDA of $724 million, a 14% EBITDA margin, which is the highest since the third quarter of 2008. Higher volumes in most end markets and continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives drove this bottom line performance.  Free cash flow in the quarter was $87 million, and debt to capital stood at 38.4%. Lastly, our liquidity remains strong with $1.34 billion of cash on hand.
Let's move to the next slide, which illustrates the revenue change by market. Revenues in most of our markets improved sequentially. Aerospace rose as destocking activity begins to slow, and orders rise from the Investment Castings business. New customers and seasonal increases drove packaging sales higher, while Commercial Transportation benefited from increased global economic activity. Higher third-party Alumina shipments helped drive sales in that business, up 10% sequentially. While many markets are up significantly year-over-year, let's remember that these improvements are relative to a very weak period in 2009. So let's move on to the income statement.  
Third-party revenues rose 6% sequentially on higher third-party shipments in the upstream and improved demand in almost every end market. COGS as a percent of sales fell to 81.2%, driven through continued progress on our cash sustainability initiatives. These activities also helped to improve SG&A as a percent of sales by almost a full percentage point. We have a tight focus on spending as market activity increases, operating more effectively and minimizing rehires where possible. 
Let me remind you that we have reduced headcount by approximately 37,000 since the downturn began in late 2008. Our cash sustainability initiatives drove a reduction of 17,000, while divestitures were responsible for the remainder. We are not only holding headcount levels but are also driving restructuring this quarter that will result in further reductions. Lastly, our operational tax rate for the quarter was 25%. 
For your reference, we have attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate. Included in the tax rate this quarter are discrete items totaling $16 million. Going forward, we expect our operational ETR to be approximately 32%. However, we will continue to experience swings in the rate, given the volatility in our profit drivers and overall profitability in each tax jurisdiction.  Let's now review the restructuring and special items in the quarter. 
This slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location in the financial statements. As you can see, these items had no net impact on our overall results, yet they do impact specific line items on the income statement. We have therefore included this detail to enable a clear analysis of our results. 
First, restructuring was $20 million and relates primarily to further headcount reductions. Discrete tax items totaled a favorable $16 million. Non-cash mark-to-market benefits on derivatives in several power contracts totaled $22 million, and the negative decision in a lawsuit related to Rockdale negatively impacted results by $7 million. 
Lastly, we reached a mutually beneficial agreement with United Steelworkers, which helps sustain our competitive position in the U.S. We are very pleased that our employees ratified the agreement in late June. Preparation costs for a potential strike and a onetime signing bonus for employees totaled $13 million this quarter. Let's now move to the sequential bridge.  
This slide bridges our income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and special items. Lower realized aluminum pricing and higher LME-linked costs, particularly energy, were more than offset by higher volumes in every business. Performance benefited from a rising U.S. dollar and favorable non-LME-linked energy rates. Productivity gains related to our cash sustainability initiatives continued to enhance bottom line performance and account for approximately 60% of the sequential improvement. Now let's turn to the segments starting with Alumina. 
Production was up 24,000 metric tons this quarter. Increases at Point Comfort, Suriname and Wagerup were mostly offset by a reduction in São Luís and lower production at Jamaica. The São Luís ramp-up was slower than anticipated due to commissioning issues experienced in the quarter, and is operating at roughly 6,800 tons per day. We remain on track to meet our target of achieving full run rate production of 9,000 tons per day by the end of 2010.
Turning to profitability. The strengthening U.S. dollar yielded positive currency effects of $18 million, primarily related to the depreciation of the Aussie dollar. A 1% increase in third-party pricing and higher third-party volumes contributed $5 million to ATOI in the quarter. The impact of the commissioning issues at São Luís this quarter negatively impacted results by $11 million.
Moving to the outlook, alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag, and we will continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives. Lastly, we expect production to increase by 150,000 tons versus the second quarter, as the ramp-up at São Luís continues to progress.
Let's move to the Primary segment. Second quarter performance was negatively impacted by a 1% decline in realized price and higher LME-linked alumina and power costs. Alumina and LME-linked power costs roughly represent 45% of cost of aluminum production and typically follow a quarter lag to the LME. Favorable currency and non-LME-linked energy costs, combined with productivity improvements, partially offset the negative impact of pricing. As you'll recall, the first quarter included $11 million related to a maintenance outage at the Rockdale Power Plant. In the second quarter, the final resolution of litigation related to our Rockdale Power contract resulted in a negative impact of $10 million. 
Also in the quarter, we curtailed Fusina and production at our Aviles smelter was halted due to heavy flooding. We're in the process of restarting production and anticipate Aviles to be at full operating rate by the fourth quarter of this year.  Looking forward to the third quarter, we anticipate pricing to follow a 15-day lag. We expect continued benefits from our cash sustainability initiatives, and lastly, we expect production to be equal to the second quarter.
Moving now to Flat-Rolled Products. Flat-Rolled Products ATOI improved by $41 million sequentially, driven by higher volumes in Russia, China and North America, and continued benefits from our cash sustainability program. We have rationalized our cost structure in the North American Can Sheet business to reflect lower volumes, and we are winning new orders at pricing levels that properly reflect the value we deliver to our customers. 
In the third quarter, we estimate that EBITDA margins in our North American Can Sheet business will be on par with what we achieved during the prior year. In short, our actions will have fully offset the lost margin associated with our decision to forego sales to a large North American customer.
We experienced sequential revenue growth in substantially all end markets, led by Commercial Transportation and Packaging. Our growth businesses in Russia and China has steadily improved during the year. In Russia, we are very pleased that this significant restructuring has allowed us to fully benefit from improving market conditions and drive our Russian operations to profitability this quarter. Next quarter, we see improving demand in each of our regions. We anticipate normal seasonal plant slowdowns and continued gains from our cash sustainability initiatives.
Let's turn to the EPS segment. ATOI of $107 million was up 32% sequentially. Continued strong performances in our cash sustainability initiatives helped generate an EBITDA margin of 17.2%, 2.7 percentage points above the second quarter of 2009 when sales were $72 million higher. These results illustrate how this segment has structurally improved its cost position through sustainable actions. 
Revenue increased 4% sequentially on higher volumes in our Aerospace Structural Castings business and our Commercial Building and Construction business. While the global commercial building and construction market continues to decline, improved sales in this market reflect our leading brands and strong relationships with well-positioned customers. Looking ahead, we anticipate normal seasonal plant slowdowns but continued gains from our cash sustainability initiatives. Let's now move to the cash flow statement. 
For the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $300 million. The sequential increases was driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. In the quarter, we ended several accounts receivable sales programs, which resulted in an unfavorable working capital impact of approximately $260 million. However, our cash sustainability efforts helped to hold days working capital at 42 days, which is a six-day improvement over the same period last year. Capital expenditures totaled $213 million. Including the net investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which flows through other investing activities, spending totaled $233 million. This keeps us on track against our 2010 target of $1.25 billion. Free cash flow in the second quarter totaled $87 million. 
So let's summarize. We are free cash flow positive in 2010, a result of our disciplined execution in each of our cash sustainability initiatives. Our performance this quarter also illustrates that we've structurally improved our ability to drive bottom line growth. We made outstanding progress in reducing our costs and maintaining these reductions, and markets begin to recover. We are effectively managing capital expenditures and working capital to meet our full year targets. Every Alcoan is committed to achieving these targets. Across the company, we are aggressively pursuing higher levels of free cash flow and profitability, ultimately driving near-term and long-term shareholder value. 
Thanks, and I'd like to turn it over to Klaus now."

And in the usual fashion, I will tell you something about our end-market development, aluminum demand, supply a picture as what Alcoa's business is. But before that, I would like to give you a little bit of a broader frame around all of that. Given that today, almost on a daily or hourly basis, we read all the headlines, tracking the economic recovery, we felt that it's worthwhile to provide a little bit of a true north, at least for the aluminum demand on a mid- to longer-term basis.
There is a strong mid- to long-term aluminum fundamentals, and it's pretty much driven by the mega-trends that we see changing our planet. On the one hand, let's not forget, we have 3 billion more people coming on to this planet in a reasonably short time until 2050, and most of them will be living in cities. So urbanization is a big thing. It was just last week that the Commissioner, Population Commissioner on China made the statement that in less than five years, they are expecting that more people will live in urban environments than rural environments also in China. All of that together, I mean, population growth, urbanization, all of that drives demands and all kinds of growth. 
And when you then look at the properties that aluminum brings to the table, lightweighting and high strength and recyclability, I'm always amazed by some of the statistics. Looking at 75% of all aluminum ever produced on this planet still being in use, that shows great capabilities of aluminum. And it makes aluminum the material of choice in many of those applications. And all of this together, we believe, is going to drive demand in the next 10 years, pretty much up to 73 million tons in 2020. That's an average growth rate per annum of 6%. This forecast is pretty much based only on kind of historic correlations between societies getting richer, building out middle class, building infrastructure. This is most likely rather conservative view, and I'll explain why I think that, because we are seeing some strong material replacement effect in some areas, like automotive, and I'll give you some color on that before I go into the other things.
We see globally a push for fuel efficiency coming from consumers, as well as aggressive legislation. In the U.S., the new emissions standard, CAFE [Corporate Average Fuel Economy], was just passed, and you see here on the left-hand side what those regulation actually forces the automakers to achieve. It forces the automakers to achieve an improvement from today, 25.5 miles per gallon in 2016 already, to reduce it to a higher efficiency of 35.5 miles per gallon. If you look at that, you're talking about six-years timeframe. This is a big task. I mean it's a big task in a very, very short time. When you then listen to how the automakers are intending to do that, they pretty much say, ""We really only got three levers here. We can improve powertrain, drivetrain and the lightweighting.""
And when it comes to lightweighting, aluminum is the material of choice, which you can see here nicely depicted on the right-hand side. Let's go to the upper right-hand side, fuel economy improvement. And we here compared it to the most competitive material, which is high-strength steel. And actually, you see that aluminum has a 3x benefit over high-strength steel. Then, when you look at what does that translate to when it comes to emissions, it actually translates to a 3x better CO2 emissions. Both of those things, obviously not only important, but when you think about a 3x improvement, that is rather dramatic. 
That's the reason why when you look one level deeper, and here, look at the different aluminum penetration opportunities in automotive, what you see here on the left-hand side is the different types of consumptions by component in automotive.  And you see the light blue is where aluminum already plays a role today, and the darker blue is where we believe aluminum will play a role pretty soon, a stronger role pretty soon. The biggest opportunity that we see here is in body structures and panels. 
If you take that and multiply that out, it translates into an additional primary aluminum demand of 10 million tons in the next 10 years. And that's only -- only a fraction of that 10 million is baked into our 6% demand growth. That gives you a bit of the feel for what is going on. Obviously, this change will not come overnight, but the pressure is increasing, increasing from legislation and increasing from consumers. We are currently working intensely with our automotive customers and are helping to design the next-generation fuel-efficient cars, trucks, as well as buses. So let's now go to the end markets and look at how the different end markets are doing. 
This is the traditional chart that we have been showing. And just a first impression compared to the last quarter shows you the end-market demand in 2010 has improved. You see more green arrows here than in the last quarter. Growth expectations are rising in Automotive, Trucks and Trailer, as well as in Packaging. So that's very consistent with the last IMF forecast. IMF [International Monetary Fund] increased their worldwide GDP growth assumption to 4.6% from originally in April, 4.2%. By the way, China in that makes up for 10.5 percentage points, and we'll come to that.
Aerospace. Let's go to the segments. So the first segment, Aerospace. On large commercial aircraft, delivery rates are essentially flat. Boeing and Airbus have announced modest build rate increases. Boeing's at 31.4 up to 34 units. Airbus is at 34 units up to 36. But let's keep in mind, until very recently, most of the industry observers have been projecting further production cuts. Whereas in reality, when you look at orders until June are up significantly, up to a level of 268 versus 69 units in 2009. Yes, granted, this is not at historic levels, but I think there is no doubt this is substantially better than what we saw before.
We also see in Aerospace passenger traffic miles are up. If you look at the May year-on-year numbers, it's 12%. And if you look at air freight traffic, freight traffic miles, which is more of a leading indicator, is up 34%. IATA has come out with a forecast for 2010. Worldwide miles passenger and freight, they are projecting higher than 10% growth rate here. It seems that some airlines are -- or the airline sector in general is turning the corner. Last year, IATA said the whole industry lost about $10 billion. Now they are projecting a profit of around $2.5 billion for this year. On Regional and Business Jets, we continue to see weakness of orders, as well as deliveries. And lastly, let me point out lastly, as destocking begins to ebb, it will have an immediate impact on our profitability. 
Automotive, the next segment here, global production is expected to rise to around 66 million vehicles. That's a plus 15%. The growth is pretty much in every region except in Europe. In Europe, pretty much driven by the strong incentives last year that pulled demand forward. European sales are down, but export have risen for European companies by 40%. So it's interesting to see that European production due to that rise in exports is expected to be around 3.8%.
U.S. sales are expected to be around 11.7 million vehicles, so around a 7% to 12% growth rate. That's what we see here at China, up 10%, 15%. And it's interesting to note, General Motors just announced that the China sales surpassed the U.S., a first in their 102-year history of GM.
If you look at Heavy Truck and Trailer, we increased our forecast. Global build rates are up, expected to be around 1.3 million units. Growth is pretty much in all regions, driven very strongly by increased global activities, as well as increased freight rate. If you look at U.S. Trailer production alone, we've seen in this year a steady increase: January 2010, 5,000 units; May 2010, 9,000 units. If you look at orders in June, 13,000 units, a clear sign for growth in this market. 
Beverage Can and Packaging, market is up modestly. It's our strategy, as you all know, that have followed Alcoa to selectively partner with can sheet customers that understand our unmatched qualities, as well as service capabilities and are willing to pay for the value. 
Commercial Building and Construction, significant decline from the U.S.A., evidenced by the increased delinquency rates on commercial mortgage-backed securities. The outlook on Europe is depressed. China, a very different picture, positive growth is very strong and driven by the economic stimulus and measures coming in various forms here in commercial centers, retailers, as well as office space. Government infrastructure, public health, education have high priority and hotel space. Also for India, we do need to model some by 15%.
On the end markets, the industrial gas turbines negatively impacted by lower energy demand or a postponement, as well as deferrals of large projects. And also important is we see a continued destocking of the OEMs. The good news on a short term is, the International Energy Agency reported that in March, it's been the fourth straight months of a year-on-year increased electricity production in the OECD countries. Keep in mind, before we had 17 months of declining production. 
On the mid to long term, we are bullish on industrial gas turbines, given the low equipment costs, high availability, lower prices for natural gas and the environmental advantages that IGT has via competing technologies. So if you sum that all up, there's real signs of improvement here on the production side, as well as on the order side. It remains below peak levels but clearly improved, a clear sign of a continued global recovery there. 
So let's go to the next slide. What you see here is how does that translate into aluminum demand broken down by the different region. We are increasing our forecast for this year from originally 10% to 12% for this year. When you go through this, you see that -- you see the growth rate here for the different regions. You see robust consumption growth in places like China, Brazil, India, modest increases in North America and Europe. We continue to see that graph is very tight, and that continues to also drive primary metals demand.
Let's move to the inventories, as many people are curious about what's going on, on that level. Here, you see on the left-hand side, all the relevant inventories, LME, Shanghai, Japanese Port and Producers is consistent with the whole picture that you see a decrease in the LME inventories, but you also see a decrease. And when you add these all up, the global inventory levels are down, three days down from 66 days in the level end of first quarter to 63 days today. One aspect to note, not on this chart but noteworthy, U.S distributor stocks are rising modestly. But keep in mind, U.S. distributor stocks have to be at an all-time historic low. Scrap is basically not available in the U.S., and there is very, very low imports coming in.
Now move to the right-hand side, that is why you see the regional premium continuing to go up. You have tight physical market conditions that drives the regional premium. Look at the blue line there. This is Europe. Europe regional premium is near an all-time record high. Look at the yellow line, that's the Midwest regional premium at a five-year high.
Let's turn next to the supply-demand balance, and let's start with aluminum. Well, we've raised the demand projection, but at the same time, we've seen that additional production came online. So we continue to believe that we're going to have a surplus this year of roughly about 1.2 million tons. 
Let's start with China. China's surplus has been reduced from 400,000 tons to 200,000 tons, 400,000 tons in the prior quarter to 200,000 tons now. And we continue to see that China is very, very good, and I'll talk more about it. They're managing the supply-demand balance very well.
When you look at the West, the West increase of production is pretty much driven by Greenfield smelters ramping up, coming online in the Middle East and India and then by restarts in Russia. These are the drivers that we see here. But let's put the 1.2 million overhang in perspective. This equals two weeks of consumption, well manageable, and our forecast here has not even taken into account the full refilling of the inventory levels. 
Let's go to the next slide. The next slide is a little busy, but we thought that we'd rather take this up, up front because this is a question that is raised a lot: What's going on in metals in China? And also fueled by a lot of additional information coming in, and I'll fill you in on what we think is going on there. Let's first see -- China is obviously an important market. It's also an important market for Alcoa. We have now sales of around $1 billion in China. And if you look at the last five years, we've had average growth rates of around 29% in that market, and we're going to continue to see a stronger penetration from our side. 
So let's start with this upper-left chart here. The blue thing is describing the production levels and the red line is describing the Shanghai metal price. And what you saw there is, once the Shanghai metal price came down, also were the production level came down to a maximum of 27% were curtailed last year. So that's really important to understand that Chinese aluminum industry responds very, very fast and very drastic to changes in pricing and really is geared towards staying in balance, supply and demand balance. 
That's also what you see kind of on the left-hand slide here, the left-hand slide there, where the red dotted line shows the premium or discount of the Shanghai metal price to the LME, and the blue line shows whether China exports or imports. So below the line is importing and above the line would be exporting, minus the zero line would be exporting. What you see there, last year, the metal price in Shanghai was higher than the LME. So it traded at a premium. At that year, we had about 1.5 million tons coming in into the country. We believe this was mainly driven because of two effects: on the one hand, a drastic curtailment; and on the other hand, a very fast response of the economy to the substantial stimulus program in China, so not necessarily intended. But you see that once the Shanghai price is going into a discount as we have today, exports are not really going up because of one additional element you have to keep in mind, and that's the 15% export duty that China has on primary metals.  
So the reason why the country is steering this industry in that way is because it's energy intense. And energy is a scarce resource in China. It's a scarce resource on an absolute basis and a scarce resource on a relative basis because, what does China want to achieve? They want to increase doing the building out their higher value-add businesses. And at the same time, they have to make sure that the increased consumer demand is fulfilled. And I'm talking about additional refrigerators that are bought, washing machines, and particularly, given the hot summer that they are enjoying this year, the additional air conditioners, and they actually are running a lot. So this all comes into the equation then. And it's no surprise, and let's go to the right-hand side chart here, that we actually saw that last week, the Chinese government announcing a broad-based restructuring, not just referring to the aluminum market, but in general. But on the aluminum market, they basically said, ""We're going to increase the power prices, and in some cases, remove subsidies."" But in all cases, the prices are pretty much going up. And with that, they are driving and they actually stated that a restructuring of the aluminum industry.
At today's Shanghai metal of roughly about RMB $14,500 pricing level, we believe that roughly 6 million tons of aluminum capacity in China is below the water line. We expect that very soon, most likely in the third quarter, we would see 1 million to 1.5 million tons coming offline. We actually have received note that about 700,000 tons have already come offline or are about to come offline now in the Henan province. So that's what's going on there. And I think it's important to understand and hopefully having answered some questions, and I'd be happy to answer more questions on that. 
Let's move to the next one, which is Alumina. Alumina is a global market, and we expect this global market to be relatively balanced. Chinese metals are coming offline, therefore, there is less alumina demand. But we expect that we will also see a reduced refinery capacity, as we've seen exactly that in the downturn. In fact, the response on the refinery capacity was even faster and more drastic than what we saw on the smelters. We are cutting our forecast for China imports on alumina from -- we originally had 5.4 million tons to 4 million tons, as we have seen Chinese importers reselling alumina cargoes into the Western markets, as they can profit from the higher prices, they usually get an additional premium of $10 to $20 per ton.
So, so much about the markets. Let's now go to the Alcoa businesses, and I want to update you on how we are driving value across all of our businesses. Let's start with Alumina. 
On Alumina, we are the market leader, 18.1 million metric tons and production capacity that is greatly positioned, very favorably positioned on the cost curve. Plus, the good news is, we are continuing to grow our low-cost production. We're bringing online São Luís, Juruti. We are ramping the production up, as we speak. The ramp-up will be completed by the end of this year. 
And then comes Ma'aden. Ma'aden sets a new low-cost point on the curve, right? If you look at that, the alumina profitability is recovering. You can already see that on the left-hand side here of this chart, but it's not reached levels where we would expect this to be for our business. You see the upper right-hand chart here shows the aluminum pricing. And we do see higher pricing, driven by underlying industry costs. And obviously, that improves profitability, too. Keep in mind that about 20% of our contract portfolio renews annually. So that's the ratio in which you would see things moving along here. If you put all these things together, our cost reduction actions, the tight market, the higher pricing, we expect that the Alcoa Alumina business can perform better than on the historic EBITDA to metric tons levels once the strong market returns.
Let's go to the Primary Metals. Also here, with 4.5 million metric tons capacity, we are a leader. We streamlined our system. We significantly reduced costs. We've optimized our portfolio, permanently curtailed smelters like East Alcoa and Badin, and we continue to steadily focus on improving our cost position. 
Just to give you one example here. And for us, it's kind of the normal thing to go through. But I think it's important to line that out. If you look on the upper right-hand corner here, you look at our self-generated energy, we are building out our self-generation power through additions of hydropower in Brazil. Estreito and Serra do Facão are those two places where we have stakes in the new hydro dams there. And this will be replacing purchased power. The power cost will be 30% lower once they are online in 2011, and we'll bring our self generation for the smelting system up from 21% to 26%. That action alone will bring us down, the worldwide smelting system down one percentage point on the cost curve. 
And again then comes Ma'aden. Ma'aden also on the smelter, sets a new low-cost point. On Ma'aden, just as a quick update, all is well on track. We've just received commitments for our product financing for $4.5 billion. This is the first phase. Keep in mind, the first phase here is the smelter, as well as the rolling mill. All key project positions for the construction and the buildout are filled, and we've started to break ground here. All of these helps us drive profitability during today's volatile times and will also help us bring our EBIT margin above the historic levels once the market returns to the strong levels we've seen it before.
Okay, let's move to the next one. The next business is Flat-Rolled. In Flat-Rolled, we've taken aggressive actions. We've re-established profitability levels. We've reduced costs; divested underperforming assets; expedite commoditized markets; emphasized high-value add for us, like aerospace as well as can sheet; demand at the pricing levels that are consistent with the value that we are producing. And you see it already here in the profit margin, all actions have a good impact. Second quarter '10, we have an EBIT margin that climbed to 10%. That's the right path, and we will continue on that path. 
If you look at the right-hand side, we continue to see a destocking in Aerospace, Plate and Sheets that will go well into the second half in 2010. Utilization continues to be at 75%, which is the same level that we saw in the first quarter. As you know, we chose to not supply a large can sheet customer and rationalized capacity, reduced headcount and signed up new customer with higher pricing. Profitability has already improved, and we would soon fully offset the margin impact.
Pleased to announce also that Russia is now having a positive after-tax operating income in the second quarter. China facilities are ramping up on schedule, and the Ma'aden joint venture and rolling mill have broken ground. So all of these together, we're well-positioned to deliver higher EBITDA margin. 
Last but certainly not least, Engineered Products and Solutions, if you look at the left-hand side, we achieved a 17% EBITDA margins that's on par with the margin that we had in the second quarter of '08. Of that quarter, we had $1.7 billion sales, which is $540 million higher than what we see today. And then you look at the utilization levels today, Aerospace, 70%, and the rest, 65%. And what, need I say more, this is a clear reflection of our cost reduction and our strong competitive capabilities in this business.
On the right-hand side, Aerospace, we see the demand returning in Investment Casting. It's marking an end to the destocking for turbine blades. On fasteners, we expect the destocking to lag throughout the end of this year. Also we continue to build out this group. We voted on an acquisition of Traco. Traco is a manufacturer of windows for commercial buildings, and that's very nicely complementary to our Building & Construction portfolio. We're building on our core strength organically, as well as inorganically. We are improving costs, and we are driving profitability in Engineered Products and Solutions.
Let's now review our progress against our 2010 operational improvement target. Procurement, our target, $2.5 billion, we are at a $1.4 billion now. Overhead target, $500 million, we are at $311 million now. Total CapEx target of $1.250 million, that includes $250 million for Ma'aden. We've spent $514 million. On the working capital, 42 days, this is an improvement of six days year-on-year, and we remain well on target to achieve our 2010 goal. 
So let's sum it up. Alcoa, the performance is strengthening. In this quarter, we had 14% EBIT margin, and keep in mind, this is all in light of a low utilization rate and today's market condition. The long-term drivers remain intact. I started out giving you a perspective on that 6% we expect in the next 10 years of market growth, and there is upside I referred to, the lightweighting aspect. Add into this a great committed team that's committed to drive value, you will expect profitability to grow and outperform our past. 
Let me close the presentation with that and hand over to our question-and-answer session."

We have actually been overshooting the target for last year. So on that end, I would not have any concern. On the procurement side, keep in mind, I mean, this does not have energy in there. But you're right, it has some elements in there where we actually have, had, headwinds coming against us. And our attitude on this is, headwinds are a fact of life. You sometimes have them.

And that's the attitude that you see in the team, and they actually are very, very able and dedicated to always find new opportunities and ask you, for instance -- I’ll just give you a for instance, I have run through what happens currently in China. So with that, what's happening in China currently you also see on some of the materials that are input materials for us. You see that there will be also input materials coming online most likely. And we've also shown last year that we are much able to change pricing even for commodities by bringing in the materials from other regions and with that, changing the pricing mechanics in certain regions. You will continue to see us using the full gamut that exists on the procurement side. Chuck, you want to add something to that?"

That is a business unit president or group CFO in every one of these procurement areas, and every team is still engaged. I'll go back to what Klaus said about overhead.

It's more coming from the volatility in the financial markets. Obviously, I mean, the currency swings have, can, could potentially have a big impact on us, so that's what I would see. I mean I've gone through all of the end markets and you've seen that all indications that if you dig and dig and dig deeper, you see that there is a lot of very positive indications there of a real recovery in almost all of these markets. But I believe that the biggest risk is still the volatility that could potentially come from financial markets and reflected in the currency. Then on China, you're right. To clarify that, we believe that 1 million to 1.5 million tons will come off pretty soon. As I said, 700,000 probably already come off as I speak now. But we believe in total, we have 6 million being under water. Yes, some new capacity will potentially get started up in China. But on the other hand, the aspect of changing the industry over to a higher value-add industry and going away from energy-intense industry continues to be a theme.

And my answer always ""No, I'm not concerned at all because you have very, very different fundamentals here to some other industries, like the telecom equipment industry or so.

And as I said early on, we had the clear the impression that we are really delivering value here on the product, as well as on the service side, and only want to deal with contracts that also compensate us fairly for that. Most of the volume went to a small competitor here in the U.S. And there was no -- well, I don't know whether there was no, but I haven't seen any indications that there has been a material, a strong material substitution. In fact, I mean, when you look at the can sheet growth, you see that can sheet is rather coming back to growth. And so but as I already said before, I mean when you look at whether the strategy has worked out or not, I mean, the profitability that we've reached now on Flat-Rolled shows we are finally to old levels of profitability, 10% EBIT margins, and this can still be improved over time. And we have pretty much been able, with the restructuring that we've taken. We're taking on new customers that we are willing to pay for value to almost come back to almost compensate for all the profit that has been lost through this contract. That's the first one. The second one, the second question that you had was on Russia. That's not only volume. I mean the good news is Russia is coming back, and depending on who you listen to, they are projecting growth between 3% to 5% even this year in Russia. We are seeing that we have been able to capture some of that, capture also new customers there. But also, I mean the big part of the story is the restructuring. If you look at from the day that we bought the facilities in Russia, we've probably taken out more than 7,000 people there. And literally, when you were to see pictures of how the plants look before and how they look today, I mean, you would think that this is entirely different plants. We've invested quite substantially. We've also invested in our people and in the process there. And today, I mean these are world-class facilities. We are the only company that produces can and then tap in Russia, well positioned for growth that will be coming in Russia. I mean good signs there."

So what do you think can really drive Alcoa's earnings on a quarterly basis significantly higher from here in the second half? Would you attribute it more to your continued internal cost-cutting program? Are you looking for maybe the offlining of this Chinese capacity that you mentioned that's about to be shut? Or is it going to be maybe more volume driven in the fourth quarter, if you're expecting a continued strong recovery in the U.S.?

There it is exactly, and go to the China. China, Automotive, up; and we continue to see that Heavy Truck & Trailers, up; Beverage Cans, up. Even Commercial Building and Construction, I went through that, and that's driven by strong support from economic stimulus programs, up in China. I mean if I want to add to that, I mean, when you talk to people and there's negativity, sometimes I mean they throw at me, ""Hey, Klaus."" But in China, there is a big bubble developing in real estate, and when you look at it a little deeper, you see there seems to be a growing credit risk from the Chinese banking sector. The investment real estate rose 38%, property values rose 68% in main cities. Yes, that's true. The central government has responded, in the usual fashion, responded very, very quickly, and they are now focusing on low-cost affordable housing, particularly in urban areas and in outer city areas. Always keep in mind, you're talking about a nation with 1.3 billion people and 1.3 billion people going to an urbanization phase as I said. I mean they will be moving into -- the cities, will be the major part of the population already in five years. That's almost hard to imagine. And what some people are estimating is that there will be 6 million units of low-cost housing built in this year alone. The government has dedicated over $130 billion to put into housing, low-cost housing basically, being build out, and that's the amount until 2012 basically. So that's what I'm seeing. And then when you talk to people that are negative on China, I mean I'm always asking now, ""Okay, so what's your growth rate projection?"" And actually, what I'm then hearing is that people that are negative on China are telling me, ""Well, you know what, I'm expecting 8.5%."" Well, 8.5% is, I mean by all means, a pretty substantial number. I mean when you look at the Chinese government, they just raised their growth rate from 8.6% to 9.1%, and when you look at the last IMF report, it's 10.5%. So we continue to see that all across the board. I continue to be optimistic on China and believe that they are managing very well through some of the overheating that happens in some of the markets. And you see in all markets, they are now going to the next phase and restructuring the aluminum market to become more efficient and to become more power conscious."

As many of you know, during this quarter, we encountered several operational challenges, which we attacked and resolved on a rapid basis. We restarted our Aviles smelter, maintained high output levels at Sao Luis despite the loss of a ship unloader and have almost completely recovered from a fire at our Tennessee operations. 
In the face of a typically weak quarter, on Midstreams segment increased shipments and revenue and maintained margins, while our Downstream segment increased revenues and achieved a record-high EBITDA margin.  From a liquidity standpoint, cash from operations and free cash flow improved. That was reduced, and our leverage ratio was down 270 basis points. 
Now let's move on to the next slide, and I'll highlight the financial results for the quarter.  Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $61 million or $0.06 per share, which included restructuring and other special items totaling $35 million or $0.03 per share. A decline in aluminum prices, combined with the unfavorable currency movements, more than offset the continuing benefits of our cash sustainability initiatives and higher volumes. 
Despite the decline in prices, revenues were higher than the majority of our end markets that continue to strengthen. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $602 million, and our continued focus on cash helped to generate free cash flow of $176 million. 
We strengthened our balance sheet, reducing debt by $491 million, and extending our maturity profile by roughly one year for a successful tender offer and new debt issue.  These actions helped to reduce debt to capital to 35.7%. Lastly, liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $843 million. 
Now let's review our revenue change by market.  Revenues in many of our markets improved sequentially. Aerospace continues to rise as destocking activity nears completion and volumes rise in the Investment Castings business. Expanding relationships with customers in North America and Russia drove Packaging sales higher, while Commercial Transportation continues to benefit from increased global economic activity, and Building & Construction continues to expand its customer base. 
Let's move on to the income statement.  Third-party revenues rose 2% on higher third-party shipments in the Upstream business and improved demand in most of our end markets. COGS as a percent of sales stood at 83.5%, up 2.3 percentage points from last quarter due to a decline in aluminum prices, adverse currency impacts and higher costs at Sao Luis. Lastly, our effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 82%. For your reference, we've attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate, including the discreet items in the quarter. 
Our operational year-to-date rate, excluding these items is 32%. Going forward, we would expect our operational rate to remain at that level. However, we will continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility of the profit drivers within each taxing jurisdiction.
The next slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location and their financial statements. Let me briefly review each one. Discreet tax items totaled $38 million in the quarter and were largely comprised of a favorable tax ruling and a foreign jurisdiction, which allows us to carry forward net operating losses. As we shared with you last month, the failure of a ship unloader at our Sao Luis facility resulted in higher cost totaling $23 million in the quarter. 
In June of 2010, the area surrounding our smelter in Aviles, Spain suffered severe flooding, which forced the temporarily idling of the facility. We performed significant repair work and the smelter began to ramp up operations in August. As a result of the flooding, we sustained charges and unfavorable impacts of the $13 million, net of insurance recoveries, primarily representing higher costs in loss volumes. 
The next item in connection with the tender offer in redemption of our bonds completed during the quarter, we recorded charges of $9 million. And lastly, non-cash, mark-to-market impacts on power contracts totaled $29 million. You may remember last quarter, this was a positive impact of $22 million. The net impact of these items totaled $35 million or $0.03 per share.
Now let's move to the sequential earnings bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and special items. The negative impact sequentially were led by lower realized aluminum pricing and adverse currency headwinds. These items more than offset the benefits of higher volumes in many of our businesses and the productivity gains generated from our cash sustainability initiatives. 
Let's move to the segments, and we'll start with Alumina.  Production was up 157,000 metric tons in the quarter, increases at Sao Luis, Pinjarra and Suriname was slightly offset by a reduction at Point Comfort. The Sao Luis refinery continues to ramp up, as it recovers from the failure of a ship unloader. Higher production and equipment costs of $25 million related to the recovery rampup were incurred in the quarter. By quarter end, Sao Luis was operating in an annualized run rate of $2.9 million metric tons, and we remain on track to achieve full annualized run rates of roughly $3.5 million tons by the end of 2010.
Turning to profitability, the combined impact of the 5% decline in realized alumina prices and depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the A dollar more than offset the impact of higher volumes and productivity gains. Lastly, the Alumina segment benefited from a tax rate change totaling $42 million. This benefit is totally offsetting Corporate to maintain our operating rate of 32%.
Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter, Alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag, and we will continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives. Lastly, we expect production across our global alumina system to increase by 150,000 metric tons versus the third quarter. 
Let's now move to the Primary segment. This quarter's performance was negatively impacted by a 2% decline in realized prices and unfavorable currency movements against the U.S. dollar. Productivity gains driven by cash sustainability were largely offset by cost increases in carbon products and energy. During the quarter, we restarted production at Aviles and anticipate achieving full capacity by the end of this year. 
Looking forward to next quarter, we anticipate pricing to continue to follow a 15-day lag. Production is expected to increase by 25,000 metric tons as Aviles ramps up, and we continue to expect to receive benefits from cash sustainability initiatives and headwinds from higher carbon costs. 
Moving to the Flat-Rolled Products segment. Okay, Flat-Rolled Products, ATOI with $66 million was a 7% sequential decline, an exceptional performance when you put it in the perspective of the typical sequential decline of nearly 40%. When viewed on a year-over-year basis, profitability improved $56 million. This quarter, we generate a revenue growth in substantially all end markets and gained volumes in China, North America and Russia, as we continue to expand our customer base. Higher costs stemming from the Tennessee fire and reduced production in North America related to the depletion of strike prep inventories negatively impacted profitability.
As a result of the rapid response by our Tennessee team, the financial impact of the fire to hot mill was significantly mitigated. In fact, repairs were nearly completed, and we're very pleased that the mill will return to full operation this month. Customer commitments were substantially met with inventory on hand and additional volumes out of our Warrick facility. The total financial impact in the third quarter was $3 million. Our Russian operations achieved its second consecutive quarter of profitability, and our Bohai, China facility continues to ramp up.
Next quarter, we expect continued strength in volumes, as Russia and Europe demand remains strong and China continues to ramp up. We will see gains from cash sustainability initiatives, and we expect normal seasonal volume declines in Kanshe [ph] (0:24:05). 
Let's turn to the last segment, which is Engineered Products and Solutions. ATOI of $114 million was up 7% sequentially. Continued strong performance in our cash sustainability initiatives helped generate our record EBITDA margin of 18%. That's five points higher than the third quarter of last year. These results illustrate how this segment has structurally improved its cost position through sustainable actions. 
Offsetting the normal seasonal impacts, revenues increased 5% sequentially on higher volumes in Aerospace and increased market share in the Building & Construction market. While the global commercial building and construction market continues to decline, improved sales in this market reflect our leading brands and strong relationships with well-positioned customers.  And despite the continued downward pressure in the IGT market, revenues remained flat sequentially.  Looking ahead, we anticipate our customers to undertake normal seasonal plant shutdowns and to continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives in the fourth quarter. 
Let's now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $392 million. The sequential increase was driven by a reduction in working capital. We currently stand at 42 days working capital, which is a five-day improvement over the same period last year and down one day sequentially. This quarter, we reduced debt by $491 million through the paydown of our August 2010 maturity. We also successfully executed a tender program for our 2011 maturity and pieces of our 2012 and 2013 maturities. 
Purchases of these securities were made with proceeds from $1 billion 20/20 offering. In sum, we reduced our debt outstanding, bringing our debt to capital to 35.7%, and increased our maturity profile by nearly one year.
Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $216 million. If you include the net investment of the Ma'aden joint venture, spending total 271, which keeps us on track against our 2010 goal of $1.25 billion. Finally, we had very strong cash flow generation in the third quarter of $176 million. 
Let me summarize on the next slide.  We are improving free cash flow generation, strengthening the company and driving shareholder value. The rapid response of how colleagues across each business to recover production after recent adverse events and to quickly repair damaged facilities was an exceptional achievement. As we effectively manage through challenges this quarter, we continue to aggressively pursue our 2010 goals. 
For the second year in a row, we remain on track to achieve these targets. All of our actions are focused on driving improved, sustainable performance across Alcoa. We have established higher baseline performance levels in our mid and downstream businesses and increased our balance sheet flexibility through debt reduction and well-timed capital market transactions. We had generated roughly $240 million of free cash flow this year, and we anticipate higher levels of free cash flow as we move into the fourth quarter. 
I'd like to now turn it over to Klaus."

Let's start on the usual fashion with a view on the economy and our end markets, first. So in general, we are muted, being optimistic. We see good profits of growth in some major regions and some specific end markets.  Let's start with the end markets. 
The Aerospace, the large commercial aircraft, the largest segment, our outlook has improved from essentially flat to roughly 2% to 4% growth, whereas 2009, we see orders, build rates, as well as deliveries up. Deliveries year-to-date are up 3%. Boeing and Airbus at the same time are ramping up their narrow-body production. 
To give you a little bit of more detailed indication, the orders that have come in year-to-date, 511 units compared to last year comparable timeframe, 195 units. And also keep in mind, there's still a backlog that exists between five to six years. 
International Air Traffic is up. We expect it to rise roughly 8% this year. This year, airline profitability improving. IATA expects the airlines to earn roughly $9 billion. Last year, they lost $10 billion. Regional and Business Jets, about 10% of the market, continues to be weak in order as well as deliveries.
Automotive, the next segment here on that chart. Let's start with the U.S., August, the lowest August sales since nearly 30 years and then came September, highest-selling months since August last year. And August last year was still marked by the Cash for Clunkers program. So we believe sales will continue to improve on a slow pace, probably slower than we are historically accustomed too. The OEMs are tightly controlling the inventory, currently at 52/55 days where this is normally 65 days. They are doing that to avoid price pressure via lot clearing sales. We do that very effectively.
China's sales in Automotive, up 40%. Through August, we are expecting on an annual basis, an increase of 15% to 20%. Europe sales is expected to decline compared to last year. And keep in mind, last year was marked by very strong government incentives, pretty much all across all the European countries. At the same time, export demand is up. So if you net it all out, production in Europe within Automotive will be up between 5% and 10%.
So next segments, Heavy Truck and Trailer, pretty much we have not revised our projections in all regions, driven by increased global industrial activity, better freight rates, as well as a depleted use of new truck inventories. If you move to the U.S. on heavy trucks and trailers, you'll see some more specifics there. The truck production year-to-date is up 55%. We expect on an annual basis 25%; trade up production up year-to-date on 46%; annual expectation is 53%; trailer backlog, given that growth is up 79% since December of 2009. 
It's interesting to note and also gives a good dimension on things that are going around here, sales in China are up 30%, we expect them to be up 35%, interestingly in the first half of 2010, given an absolute number of 570,000 trucks have been sold. We expect by the end of 2010, 870,000 trucks. And if you just take the absolute estimate number, it actually is more than 2x the sales of North America and Europe together.
Beverage Can and Packaging, North American Can, we expect a modest decline, pretty much caused by the weak summer promotions here. Chuck, I think, just did an outstanding -- for good aluminum cans in the very start, but we saw  some of our promotions around that and inclement weather in parts of Mexico. Growth in other regions will offset the North American decline. So in total, we expect in the beverage can and packaging market to be flat 2010 compared to 2000. 
Commercial Building & Construction, let's start with USA, we expect it to go further down. Our expectation is 25%. Reduction can look at some indicators and probably get the impression as though this market has not yet bottomed out, unfortunately. Looking at commercial mortgage-backed securities, delinquency rates topped with 7.8% in July and expected to go further up at the end of this year, 9% to 10% is whether the experts estimate, or look at the office vacancy rates at 70% during the second quarter. We expect it to grow further up. 
Europe, pretty much the same in Commercial Building & Construction. At China, a very different picture. We expect it to go up 10% to 15%, and India more in the same niche as China. 
So last segment here and that's for Gas Turbines. We see basically three factors we've used: Energy demand, power plant construction delays as well as deferrals, as well as the uncertainty around carbon legislation. All of this comes together in the industrial gas turbine market and weighs heavy on the demand, and that's the impact that we see there.
So to sum the end market overview that you have on this chart. We see a significant improvement for 2009 in most end markets, although the overall is below the historic norms. 
So with that, let's go to the aluminum demand and see what implications the end markets drive has on the aluminum demand, and this is actually pretty good news. Many of you who follow us know that we have raised our forecast in the second quarter here from 10% growth to 12%, and we are raising our forecast again another percentage points. And this is really driven by us seeing the rising consumption levels that India, Asia, Brazil, as well as Russia, and the second thing that will come through in the second half of this year. And the second aspect that one has to take into account here is the tight scrap conditions, unavailability of scrap, which drives the primary demand and growth in here too. 
So let's look at the inventory side, and some of you are familiar with this chart.  On the left-hand side here, you'll see all the aluminum inventories listed and kind of stacked on each other. You can already see where the dark blue one which reflects the LME. LME has come down, it continues to come down. If you look at the total, which we accumulated here, the total comes up to 59 days of consumption. And for those of you who remember the Q2 number, this is four days lower than what we had at the end of the second quarter. So that's actually pretty good news. We continue to see financial participants, as well as logistic constraints as well as the scrap shortage. It's basically  driving the accessibility or reducing the accessibility of metal. And if you go to the right-hand side, where you see the regional premiums depicted in the three big regions. You'll actually see that the regional premiums are high. If you look at the blue curve you have for Europe there, they're almost at an all-time high, and it's further pressured by some of the containments and closures in Europe. And then you look at the U.S. as another example there, you'll see the Midwest premium is almost at the five-year high.
So what does that mean now in terms of supply and demand? Let's put those two slides together, and start with Aluminum. So if you look at Aluminum, guys, you know, we always mix China and the Western world. As we revised our global demand size, we're also revising our global surplus estimate for the alumina mark. We now believe it's going to be around 1 million tons. That is a reduction of about 180,000 tons lower than what we had previously said in the second quarter. This is driven basically by two factors: One is increased demand, we talked about it; and the second thing is production outages like we saw in the Middle East, Canada, as well as India. 
Let's talk a little bit about China, because that's an interesting dynamic that we see there. If you look at this year, it looks like not much is going on. China manages very well to stay in balance, but there's actually a lot going on in China these days. As two things come together, a very short-term thing which is China at the end of this 11th five-year plan. And at the same time, they are ramping up to the new five-year plan, and that is very, very important changes on their way. On the one hand, you'll see provinces truly scrambling to reach the energy efficiency  as well as the emission targets that are tied into the 11th fifth-year plan. This is leading, as we speak, to massive floaters and curtailment. About 700,000 tons of smelting are in the process of getting shut, and others are getting  shut as we speak.  That will be most likely another 600,000 tons that are planned to getting shut until the end of this year. So that's a huge, huge shift. At the same time, we actually do see that there's new capacity, mainly in the West, that could potentially come online. That's the one thing and, obviously, having an impact short term already on pricing. 
The second thing is that it's cushioned around the new five-year plan. The new five-year plan, it is very clear in the whole setup of this plan that the administration fees, energy efficiency and emission as one of the most critical things driving the country going forward. And we have targeted for the energy-intense industries, like the aluminum industry, the draft of this new plan is currently out and gets circulated in the usual fashion. It's basically set until 2015, China will not allow more than 20 million tons of capacity. Talking to some of the experts there, experts basically say the Chinese government is very, very serious about this approach of emissions control and the energy efficiency. And they would rather expect around 17 million to 18 million tons by 2015, probably being the limit. It doesn't take much to understand that, that comes along with quite a number of opportunities here.
Let's move on to the alumina market. Talking about opportunities, the equally exciting things going on there in that market. We see on the one hand, the market is essentially balanced, with a little tightness emerging in the Atlantic region. The more exciting thing happens here on the changeover of the pricing. We talked about, I'm sure, in this call, we've talked more about it. This quarter, our plants have launched smelter grade alumina, their price index. This is a very thorough index, a hats up to them. It is very transparent, a lots of good data, benchmarking, daily spot prices amongst other things out of Australia. If you take that as an index, the average price at the start of the index for alumina has been $327 per ton, and the last price today was $348 per ton. 
So now we're leaving the markets behind us, and let's talk about how our businesses are doing and what we are doing in our businesses going forward.  So let's start with Alumina. As I said, exciting things going on in Alumina. There's a couple of things how we drive value. One thing is the changing of the pricing. We're going away, as we said before, announced that a long time ago, we're going away from LNE linkage to a pricing that's more and better reflects the underlying costs of this specific industry. And we have been successfully concluding contracts for our 2011 volumes on a price index basis. It's the way that the new contracts have been built. It's the ones that we have signed, as we have used the monthly average of the basket of different published alumina prices. So not favoring one over the other, and I think that's very, very fair, much fairer than the pricing that existed before. That's one value driver. 
Another value driver is that we are growing our low-cost production base. I mean the Juruti bauxite mine and the Sao Luis refinery are both coming online. We've achieved a good record production level in September, even though we have to overcome the failures of the ship unloader. We expect that we have a permanent solution in place by the end of this month. And in general, we are on track to achieve full production by the end of this year.
And the next value driver that is really well underway is Ma'aden. This will be the lowest cost refinery that exists. We'll start by end of 2014, as I said, well on the way. We expect the project financing to be completed in this year by the end of this year. 
The Alumina profitability is recovering, as you can see here on the left-hand side. It's also very clear that it has not yet reached the levels that we would expect from this business, particularly talking about these value drivers that I just mentioned. So we expect the benefits of the higher pricing as well as the lower-cost position to get us to the EBITDA margin levels that will be better than where we have historically performed once the market returns. So much on alumina, let's go to Aluminum on the next slide. 
So our smelting system currently is producing around 3.6  million tons. So we are at about 80% utilization, with secured power for 85% of the capacity until minimum 2025. We streamlined our system, we've reduced costs and permanently curtailed smelters like Suralco and Badin. We are further reducing our cost position. The Ma'aden joint venture here is clearly the next big, big step for bringing online the lower-cost smelter that will exist. Then it will come online by the end of 2013, so kind of already around the corner. All of these actions that will improve the EBITDA margin. And here, we also believe that we'll be higher than historic levels once the market returns.
So let's go to Flat-Rolled Product side. On the Flat-Rolled Products side, we've taken massive actions. We drived the bottom line. We reduced costs, divested underperforming assets. We exited to commodity markets. We emphasized high-valued products like Aerospace. And on the Can Sheet side, we adjusted our pricing to be consistent with the highest quality, the delivery performance and the innovativeness we have in our products. All of that, we can already see today, has an impact on the EBITDA margins. We have reached 9% year-to-date, although the utilization rate is at 80% in this business. And you may remember it was 75% by the end of the second quarter. So it's up a little bit. But it still only at 80%, and we continue to see destocking in Aerospace sheets and plates, since we run through the end of 2010 and also lower can sheet volumes. That's what leads them to the utilization rate here of 80%. 
At the same time, profitability in Russia is good, the second consecutive quarter. Our profits, we're ramping up our Chinese facilities, all of that looks good, demand, rolling mill is well underway, also on the right path. We expect profitability to exceed historic levels once the market accelerates.
Last but absolutely not least, our Engineered Products and Solution business. Year-to-date, the number as you can see here is 17% EBITDA margin. Q3 is at 18%, that's at a historic high. That's not only at a historic high, but then look at the right-hand side and see the utilization that we currently have. 70% in Aerospace, 65% in the Rest. So obviously, we reached this margin level with this utilization, the key reflection of how well we've worked in reducing our costs and improving our portfolio. 
We actually also in this quarter further strengthened our portfolio with the acquisition of Traco and the building and construction phase integration is well underway. It's really in Engineered Products and Solutions business that we see this good combination of great execution and improvement in top and bottom line performance, and that gives this team the license to further grow. 
So we will continue to build around the core of our EPS business, improve our performance further. And it's obviously, with its current utilization, a pretty substantial upside once the economy improves, and utilization will go up.
So let's now review the progress against our 2010 operational targets. Procurement, our target was $2.5 billion. Our savings, we are at $2.154 billion. That's good. Overhead, $500 million target, we have $431 million, good. Total CapEx, $1.50 million target; we currently have spent $785,000. This is in line with the expectation and keep in mind that it includes this $250 million on an annual basis for margin. Typically, the fourth quarter, just for you to note already, is higher as we take advantage of our customers shutting down, and we used that time to upgrade some of our facilities and to do the maintenance. So keep that in mind when you look into the fourth quarter. Last but not least, working capital, year-on-year working capital declined by five days, on target to reduce two days working capital this year.
Right now, we've talked a lot about financial benchmarks that we have achieved this quarter. But I really don't want to go with this presentation before I haven't talked also about some other things that I think make this company a great company. And while we have continued to expand our leadership position and this is about safety and sustainability on this chart here. On the left-hand side, you will actually see our safety performance. In the blue curve, which shows the total recordable incident rate or in the green curve, the lost workday incident rate that's the best-ever safety performance. 
If you look at the lost workday incident rate, just as for example, we further improved it by 40% compared to the end of 2009, which already had a very, very low number. We make clear what a number like that means. 85% of all of our core facilities, up to today and 2010, had zero lost work days, 85%. Then if you go to the right-hand side, you'll actually see that we received some nice recognition that really shows the leadership that we have, and it indicates leadership that we have in sustainability. Maplecroft ranked us third of 339 companies for our client-related innovations in the carbon management practices. Dow Jones Sustainability Index is the ninth consecutive year, we're Named to the World as well as the North American Index, and Cradle to Cradle certified us on a silver level  for primary aluminum for product, emphasizing the sustainable characteristics of our metal.
All of these achievements, I believe, are testament of our ability to manage more than just the bottom line. This is important also for the bottom line because at very, very many places that we've seen from Ireland to Brazil, this is what gives us the license to operate and to have a new opportunities to grow profitably in the future. 
All right, so let me sum it all up here on this last slide. We positioned the company for driving growth as well as profitability. It's a lean place, we've learned our lesson, and we will always be lean. Disciplined execution is our middle name, with personalize accountability and powering the Alcoa employees. And the most important thing, we're drive sales and returns, you can see on the right-hand side where we are currently when it comes to the EBITDA margins, 12%, do you see that this is the same level in 2008. But then you compare the time of 2008 with today, I just showed you the utilization levels and the current market conditions. So I think this makes us all feel very inspired by this achievement, and I can tell you we're all committed to exceed our historic performance levels. 
That said, why don't we open it for the Q&A?"

To the spot index, and I talked about Flats and I talked about the first contract that we have concluded, which basically are a monthly average spot price based on a number of indexes, and we used a basket of indexes. We believe that, that really better reflects the different cost structures that we have in alumina, and with the cost like ocean freight, oil, gas and coal in there compared to what we see in LME, it gives some more pricing flexibility. It's more reflective of the short-term volatility. The concept, I think, is very well-understood by our customers in the meantime. We are concluding business on that basis. And really, it's good that Flats has added this index on a daily reporting. It's even more differentiated than what we currently use, but it's very transparent to that. At the same time, you'll to be very clear, every pricing change takes a while until it gets done. And we have about 20% of our volumes coming up, and we really take that as an about number. 20% of all volume in alumina coming up every year. So it will take a while until this will ripple through the system, but we are concluding contracts as we speak on that basis."

But I don't think anybody expects the change like that to be easy. But I think the same time, the customer understands why a change like that is needed, because frankly, alumina has very different cost drivers from aluminum. And the flexibility that the customers gain here is very high.

And that's the level which we believe is going to be at the right level. And then Ma'aden comes into it and the rest is pure speculation. But I think you have to really see where we have been coming from. There were a lot of investments starting with Iceland, Russia, China, Juruti, Sao Luis expansion, and I'm sure I forgot something here. But that's all been happening and, I would say, less than five to eight years, probably in the last five years, and you'll see that Russia, just take it for instance. Let's start with Iceland, Iceland has been making good returns and even had making good returns during the worse of the crisis. And the reason for that is very simple because they brought up lower in the cost curve, right? Take Russia, and finally Russia has turned the quarter, second consecutive quarter that we are profitable there. And I said many times in these calls and with you all individually that the assets that we have in the Russia, once we run them well, which we do now, are very unique and well-positioned in that market. We're the only ones who can produce can sheet and have it capped, in for instance, also in Russia, and that market is actually siding to boom as the economy comes back. China, the positioning of us in the automotive market in China with graded sheet in Kunshan couldn't have been any better, adjusted through growth numbers there. Bohai is there, so it's profitable. Bohai is ramping up. And also, it's nicely positioned. Juruti, Sao Luis brings us further down at the cost curve, we've got a 9%, We're 25th percentile in the cost curve service. And then comes Ma'aden. So that's the logic that we're following here. Chuck, you want to add anything into this?"

Thanks, Matt. Let me really appreciate everyone joining us today. As many of you know, during this quarter we encountered several operational challenges, which we attacked and resolved on a rapid basis. We restarted our Avilés smelter, maintained high aspect levels of São Luís, despite the loss of a ship unloader and have almost completely recovered from a fire at our Tennessee operations.
In a phase of a typically weak quarter, our midstream segment increased shipments and revenue and maintained margins, while our downstream segment increased revenues and achieved a record high EBITDA margin. From a liquidity standpoint, cash from operations and free cash flow improved, debt was reduced, and our leverage ratio was down 270 basis points.
Now let’s move on to the next slide and I’ll highlight the financial results for the quarter. Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $61 million or $0.06 per share, which included restructuring and other special items totaling $35 million or $0.03 per share. A decline in aluminum prices combined with unfavorable currency movements more than offset the continuing benefits of our cash sustainability initiatives and higher volumes. Despite the decline in prices, revenues were higher as a majority of our end markets continued to strengthen.
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $602 million, and our continued focus on cash helped to generate free cash flow of $176 million. We strengthened our balance sheet, reducing debt by $491 million and extending our maturity profile by roughly one year to a successful tender offer in new debt issue. These actions helped to reduce debt-to-capital to 35.7%. Lastly, liquidity remained strong with cash on hand of $843 million.
Now let’s review our revenue change by market. Revenues in many of our markets improved sequentially. Aerospace continues to rise as destocking activity nears completion and volumes rise in the investment castings business. Expanding relationships with customers in North America and Russia drove packaging sales higher, while commercial transportation continues to benefit from increased global economic activity and building and construction continues to expand its customer base.
Let’s move on to the income statement. Third-party revenues rose 2% on higher third-party shipments in the upstream business and improved demand in most of our end markets. COGS as a percent of sales stood at 83.5%, up 2.3 percentage points from last quarter due to a decline in aluminum prices, adverse currency impacts, and higher cost at São Luís.
Lastly, our effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 82%. For your reference, we’ve attached an appendix to help gauge you through the tax rate, including the discrete items in the quarter. Our operational year-to-date rate, excluding these items, is 32%. Going forward, we would expect our operational rate to remain at that level. However, we will continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility of the profit drivers within each taxing jurisdiction.
The next slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring of special items in the quarter and their location in financial statements. Let me briefly review each one. Discrete tax items totaled $38 million in the quarter and were largely comprised of a favorable tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction, which allows us to carry forward net operating losses.
As we shared with you last month, the failure of our ship unloader at our São Luís facility resulted in higher cost, totaling $23 million in the quarter. In June of 2010, the area surrounding our smelter in Avilés, Spain, suffered severe flooding, which forced the temporarily idling of the facility. We’ve performed significant repair work, and the smelter began to ramp up operations in August. As a result of the flooding, we sustained charges in unfavorable impacts of $13 million, net of insurance recoveries, primarily representing higher cost in lost volumes.
The next item in connection with the tender offer and redemption of our bonds completed during the quarter, we recorded charges of $9 million. And lastly, non-cash mark-to-market impacts on power contracts totaled $29 million. You may remember last quarter this was a positive impact of $22 million. The net impact of these items totaled $35 million or $0.03 per share.
Now let’s move to the sequential earnings bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and special items. Negative impact sequentially related by lower realized aluminum pricing and adverse currency headwinds. These items more than offset the benefits of higher volumes in many of our businesses and the productivity gains generated from our cash sustainability initiatives.
Let’s move to the segments, and we’ll start with Alumina. Production was up 157,000 metric tons in the quarter, increases at São Luís, Pinjarra and Suriname were slightly offset by reduction in Point Comfort. The São Luís refinery continues to ramp up as it recovers from the failure of a ship unloader.
Higher production equipment costs of $25 million related to the recovery ramp-up were incurred in the quarter. By quarter-end, São Luís was operating in an annualized run rate of 2.9 million metric tons, and we remain on track to achieve full annualized production run rate of roughly 3.5 million tons by the end of 2010.
Turning to profitability, the combined impact of a 5% decline in realized aluminum prices and depreciation of the US dollar against the A dollar more than offset the impact of higher volumes and productivity gains. Lastly, the Alumina segment benefited from a tax rate change totaling $42 million. This benefit is totally offsetting corporate to maintain our operating rate of 32%.
Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter, alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag, and we will continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives. Lastly, we expect production across our global alumina system to increase by 150,000 metric tons versus the third quarter.
Let’s now move to the Primary segment. This quarter’s performance was negatively impacted by a 2% decline in realized prices and unfavorable currency movements against the US dollar. Productivity gains driven by cash sustainability were largely offset by cost increases in carbon products and energy. During the quarter, we restarted production at Avilés and anticipate achieving full capacity by the end of this year.
Looking forward to next quarter, we anticipate pricing to continue to follow 15-day lag. Production is expected to increase by 25,000 metric tons, as Avilés ramps up and we continue to expect to receive benefits from cash sustainability initiatives and headwinds from higher carbon costs.
Moving to the Flat Rolled Products segment, Flat Rolled Products ATOI of $66 million was a 7% sequential decline, an exceptional performance when you put it in the perspective of the typical sequential decline of nearly 40%. When you view it on a year-over-year basis, profitability improved $56 million. This quarter we generated revenue growth in substantially all end markets and gained volumes in China, North America and Russia, as we continued to expand our customer base.
Higher cost stemming from the Tennessee fire and reduced production in North America related to the depletion of strike prep inventories negatively impacted profitability. As a result of the rapid response by our Tennessee team, the financial impact of the fire at our hot mill was significantly mitigated. In fact, repairs are nearly completed and we are very pleased that the mill will return to full operation this month.
Customer commitments were substantially met with inventory on hand and additional volumes out of our Warrick facility. The total financial impact in the third quarter was $3 million. Our Russian operations achieved a second consecutive quarter of profitability, and our Bohai, China facility continues to ramp up.
Next quarter, we expect continued strength in volumes, as Russia and Europe demand remains strong and China continues to ramp up. We will see gains from cash sustainability initiatives, and we expect normal seasonal volume declines in can sheet.
Let’s turn to the last segment, which is Engineered Products and Solutions. ATOI of $114 million was up 7% sequentially. Continued strong performance in our cash sustainability initiatives helped generate a record EBITDA margin of 18%. That’s 5 points higher than the third quarter of last year. These results illustrate how this segment has structurally improved its cost position through sustainable actions. Offsetting the normal seasonal impacts, revenues increased 5% sequentially on higher volumes in aerospace and increased market share in the building and construction market.
While the global commercial building and construction market continues to decline, improved sales in this market reflect our leading brands and strong relationships with well positioned customers. And despite the continued downward pressure in the IGT market, revenues remained flat sequentially. Looking ahead, we anticipate our customers to undertake normal seasonal plant shutdowns and to continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiative in the fourth quarter.
Let’s now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $392 million. The sequential increase was driven by reduction in working capital. We currently stand at 42 days working capital, which is a five-day improvement over the same period last year and down one day sequentially. This quarter we reduced debt by $ 491 million through the pay-down of our August 2010 maturity.
We also successfully executed a tender program for our 2011 maturity and pieces of our 2012 and 2013 maturities. Purchases of these securities were made with proceeds from a $1 billion 20/20 offering. In sum, we reduced our debt outstanding bringing our debt-to-capital to 35.7% and increased our maturity profile by nearly one year.
Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $216 million. If you include the net investment of the Ma'aden joint venture, spending totaled $271 million, which keeps us on track against our 2010 goal of $1.25 billion. Finally, we had very strong cash flow generation in the third quarter of $176 million.
Let me summarize on the next slide. We are improving free cash flow generation, strengthening the company and driving shareholder value. The rapid response of Alcoans across each business to recover production after recent adverse events and to quickly repair damaged facilities was an exceptional achievement. As we effectively managed through challenges this quarter, we continued to aggressively pursue our 2010 goal. For the second year in a row, we remain on track to achieve these targets.
All of our actions are focused on driving improved, sustainable performance across Alcoa. We have established higher baseline performance levels in our mid and downstream businesses and increased our balance sheet flexibility through debt reduction and well timed capital market transactions. We have generated roughly $240 million of free cash flow this year, and we anticipate higher levels of free cash flow as we move into the fourth quarter.
I’d like to now turn it over to Klaus.

Let’s start on the usual fashion with a view on the economy and our end market first. So, in general, we are mutedly optimistic. We see good pockets of growth in some major regions and some specific end markets. Let's start with the end markets. Can we have that slide, please? Thank you.
Aerospace, large commercial aircraft, largest segment, our outlook has improved from essentially flat to roughly 2% to 4% growth versus 2009. We see orders, build rate, as well as deliveries up. Deliveries year-to-date are up 3%. Boeing and Airbus at the same time are ramping up their narrow-body production.
To give you a little bit of a more detailed indication, the orders that have come in year-to-date 511 units compared to last year comparable timeframe, 195 units. And also keep in mind, there is still a backlog that exists between five to six years. The national air traffic is up, expected to rise roughly 8% this year. Airline profitability improving. IATA expects the airlines to earn roughly $9 billion. Last year they lost $10 billion. Regional and business jets, about 10% to 20% of the market, continues to be weak in orders as well as deliveries.
Automotive, the next segment here on that chart. Let's start with the US. August - lowest August sales since nearly 30 years, and then came September, highest selling month since August last year, and August last year was still marked by the Cash for Clunkers program. So we believe sales will continue to improve on a slow pace, probably slower than we are historically accustomed to.
The OEMs are tightly controlling the inventory, currently at 50 to 55 days versus normally 65 days. And they are doing that to avoid price pressure via lot clearing field - do that very effectively. China sales in automotive, up 40% through August. We are expecting on an annual basis an increase of 15% to 20%.
Europe sales expected to decline versus last year. And keep in mind last year was marked by very strong government incentive, pretty much across all the European countries. At the same time, export demand is up. So if you netted all out, production in Europe in automotive will be up between 5% and 10%.
So next segment, Heavy Truck & Trailer, pretty much we revised our projections in all regions driven by increased global industrial activity, better freight rates, as well as depleted used and new truck inventories. If you move to the US on heavy trucks and trailers to see some more specifics there, the truck production year-to-date is up 55%. We expect on an annual basis 25%. Trailer production, up year-to-date on a 46%; annual expectation is 53%. Trailer backlog given that growth is up 79% since December 2009.
Interesting to note and also gives us a good dimension on things that are moving around here, sales in China are up - we expect them to be up 35%. Interestingly in the first half of 2010, to give you an absolute number, 570,000 trucks have been sold. We expect by the end of 2010, 870,000 trucks. If you just take absolute number, it actually is more than two times the sales of North America and Europe together.
Beverage Can Packaging, North American can, we expect a modest decline pretty much caused by the weak summer promotions here. Chuck, I think, just did an outstanding ad, four good aluminum cans in the very start, but we saw weak summer promotions around that and then inclement weather in parts of Mexico. Growth in other regions will offset the North American decline. So, in total, we expect in the beverage can and packaging market flat 2010 compared to 2009.
Commercial Building and Construction, that was USA, we expect it to go further down. Our expectation is 25% reduction. You can look at some indicators and probably get the impression as though this market has not yet bottomed out. Unfortunately, looking at commercial mortgage-backed securities, delinquency rate, topped with 7.8% in July and expected to go further up at the end of this year 9% to 10%, this was the expert estimate, or look at office vacancy rates 17% during the second quarter, expected to go further up. Europe, pretty much the same in commercial building and construction. China, very different picture. We expect it to go up 10% to 15%. And India, more in the same league than China.
So, last segment here, Industrial Gas Turbines. We see basically three factors; reduced energy demand, power plant constructions delays as well as deferrals, as well as the uncertainty around carbon legislation. All of this comes together in the industrial gas turbines market and weighs heavy on the demand, and that's the impact that we see there.
So, to sum the end market overview that you have on this chart up, we see significant improvement for 2009 in most end markets, although the overall is below the historic norms.
So with that, let's go to the aluminum demand and see what implications the end markets drive has on the aluminum demand, and this is actually pretty good news. Many of you who follow us know that we have raised our forecast in the second quarter here from 10% growth to 12%, and we are raising our forecast again another percentage points. And this is re-driven by us seeing rising consumption levels in India, Asia, Brazil, as well as Russia, and that will come too in the second half of this year. And the second aspect that one has to take into account here is the tight scrap conditions, unavailability of scrap, which drives primary demand and growth in here too.
So let's look also at the inventory side, and some of you are familiar with the chart. On the left hand side here, you see all the aluminum inventories listed and kind of stacked on each other. You can already see with the dark blue one, which reflects the LME. LME has come down or continues to come down.
If you look at the total, which we accumulated here, the total comes up to 59 days of consumption. And for those of you who remember the Q2 number, this is four days lower than what we had at the end of the second quarter. So that's actually pretty good news. We continue to see financial participants as well as logistic constraints as well as the scrap shortage is basically driving the accessibility or reducing the accessibility and then - of metal.
And if you go to the right hand side, where you see the regional premiums depicted in the three big regions, you actually see that the regional premiums are high. If you look at the blue curve, you have Europe there almost at an all-time high. And it's further pressured by some of the curtailments and closers in Europe. And then you look at the U.S. as another example there, and you see the Midwest premium as almost at the five-year high.
So what does that mean now in terms of supply demand? Let's put those two sides together and start with aluminum. Okay? So if you look at aluminum, as you know, we always split China and the western world. As we revised our global demand side, I mean, we are also revising our global surplus estimate for the aluminum march.
We now believe it's going to be around 1 million tons, and that is a reduction of about 180,000 tons lower than what we had previously set in the second quarter. This is driven basically by two factors. One is increased demand. We talked about it. And the second thing is production outages like we saw in the Middle East, Canada, as well as India.
Let's talk a little bit about China because that's an interesting dynamic that we see there. I mean, if you look at this year, it looks like not much is going on. China manages very well to stay in balance, but there is actually a lot going on in China these days. Two things come together, a very short-term thing, which is China at the end of this, the 11th five-year plan, and at the same time they are ramping up to the new five-year plan, and that is very, very important changes on the way.
On the one hand, you see provinces truly scrambling to reach the energy efficiency as well as emission targets that are tied into the 11th fifth-year plan. This is leading, as we speak, to massive closures and curtailments. About 700,000 tons of smelting are in the process of getting short-term shut and others are getting shut as we speak.
There will be most likely another 600,000 tons that are planned to get shut until the end of this year. So that's a huge, huge shift. At the same time, you actually do see that there is new capacity, mainly in the west, that could potentially come online. That's the one thing, and obviously having an impact short-term already on pricing.
The second thing is the discussion around the new five-year plan. The new five-year plan, it is very clear in the whole setup of this plan that the administration fees, energy efficiency and emission as one of the most critical things driving in the country going forward. And they have clear target for energy-intense industries like the aluminum industry. The draft of this new plan is currently out and gets circulated in the usual fashion. And it basically says, until 2015, China will not allow more than 20 million tons of capacity.
Talking to some of the experts there, experts basically say, the Chinese government is very, very serious about this approach of emissions control and the energy efficiency, and they would rather expect around 17 million to 18 million tons by 2015, probably being the limit. It doesn't take much to understand that. That comes along with quite a number of opportunities here.
Let's move on to the alumina market, talking about opportunities, equally exciting things going on there in that market. We see on the one hand, the market is essentially balance with a little tightness emerging in the Atlantic region. The more exciting thing happens here on the changeover of the pricing. We've talked about - I'm sure in this call, we have talked more about it.
This quarter Platts has launched smelter-grade alumina, the price index. This is a very thorough index, hats off to them, very transparent, lots of good data, benchmarking daily spot prices amongst other things out of Australia. If you take that as an index, the average price since the start of the index for alumina has been $327 per ton and the last price today was $348 per ton.
So now we are leaving the markets behind us, and let's talk about how our businesses are doing and what we are doing in our businesses going forward. So let's start with Alumina. As I said, exciting things going on in Alumina. And there is a couple of things how we drive value. One thing is the changing of the pricing. I mean, we are going away - as we said before, announced it long time ago, we are going away from LME linkage to a pricing that more and better reflects the underlying cost of this specific inventory.
And we have been successfully concluding contracts for 2011 volume on a price index basis. The way the new contracts have been built, the one that we have to have signed is we have used the monthly average of the basket of different published alumina prices. So, not favoring one over the other, and I think that's a very, very fair - much fairer than the pricing that existed before.
That's one value driver. Another value driver is that we are growing our low cost production base. The Juruti Bauxite Mine and the São Luís refinery are both coming online. We've achieved good record production level in September. Even though we had to overcome the failures of a ship unloader, we expect that we'll have a permanent solution in place by the end of this month. And in general, we are on track to achieve full production by the end of this year.
And the next value driver that is really well underway is Ma'aden. This will be the lowest lost refinery that exists. It will start by end of 2014. It's, as I said, well underway. We expect the project financing to be completed in this year - by the end of this year.
The alumina profitability is recovering, as you can see here on the left hand side, but it's also very clear that it has not yet reached levels that we would expect from this business, particularly talking about these value drivers that I just mentioned. So we expect the benefits of the higher pricing as well as a lower cost position to get us to EBITDA margin levels that are better than where we have historically performed once the market returns.
So, so much on alumina. Let's go to aluminum on the next slide. Thank you. Our smelting system currently is producing around 3.6 million tons. So we are at about 80% utilization. We've secured power for 85% of the capacity until minimum 2025. We've streamlined our system. We've reduced cost and permanently curtailed smelters like Eastalco and Badin.
We are further reducing our cost position. The Ma'aden joint venture here is clearly the next big, big step, bringing online the lowest cost smelter that will exist then. It will come online by the end of 2013, so kind of already around the corner. All of these are actions that will improve the EBITDA margin, and here we also believe that it will be higher than historic levels once the market returns.
So let's go to Flat Rolled Products side. On the Flat Rolled Products side, we've taken massive actions, drive the bottom line. We reduced costs, divested underperforming assets. We exited commodity markets. We emphasized high value-added products like aerospace. And on the can sheet side, we adjusted our pricing to be consistent with the highest quality, the delivery performance and the innovativeness we have in our product. All of that, you can already see today, has an impact on the EBITDA margins.
We have reached 9% year-to-date, although the utilization rate is at 80% in this business, and you may remember it was 75% by the end of the second quarter. So it's up a little bit, but it's still only at 80%. We continue to see destocking in aerospace, sheet and plate. This will run through the end of 2010, and also lower can sheet volume. That's what leads into the utilization rate here, up 80%.
At the same time, profitability in Russia is good, second consecutive quarter of profit. We are ramping up our Chinese facilities. All of that looks good. The Ma'aden rolling mill is well underway, also on the right path. We expect profitability to exceed historic levels once the market accelerates.
Last, but absolutely not least, our Engineered Products and Solutions business. Year-to-date, the number that you can see here is 17% EBITDA margins. Q3 is at 18%. That's at a historic high. And not only is it at a historic high, but then look at the right hand side and see the utilization that we currently have; 70% in aerospace, 65% in the rest. So, obviously, I mean, to reach this margin level with this utilization, I mean, is a clear reflection of how well we've worked in reducing our cost and improving our portfolio.
We actually, also in this quarter, have further strengthened our portfolio with the acquisition of Traco in the Building and Construction space. Integration is well underway. It's really -Engineered Product and Solution business that we see is a good combination of great execution and a proven top and bottom line performance, and that gives this team the license to further roll. So we will continue to build around the core of our EPS business, improve our performance further, and that’s obviously with this turn utilization a pretty substantial upside once the economy improves and utilization will go up.
So let's now review the progress against our 2010 operational targets. Procurement, our target was $2.5 billion of savings. We are at $2.154 billion. That's good. Overhead, $500 million target. We are at $431 million. Good. Total CapEx, $1.250 billion target. We currently have spent $785 million. This is in line with the expectation, and keep in mind it includes $250 million on an annual basis for Ma'aden.
Typically, the fourth quarter, just for you to note, already is higher, as we take advantage of our customers shutting down and we use that time to upgrade some of our facilities and to do the maintenance. So keep that in mind when you look into the fourth quarter.
Last but not least, working capital, year-on-year working capital declined by five days on target to reduce two days working capital this year. By now, we've talked about a lot of financial benchmarks that we have achieved this quarter, but I really don't want to go with this presentation before I have talked also about some other things that I think make this company a great company and where we have continued to expand our leadership position and this is about safety and sustainability on this chart here.
On the left hand side, you actually see our safety performance, and the blue curve, which shows the totally recordable incident rate, or in the green curve, the last workday incident rate. It's the best ever safety performance. And if you look at the last workday incident rates just as in for example, we've further improved about 40% compared to the end of 2009, which already had a very, very low number. We made clear what a number like that means. 85% of all of the Alcoa facilities up to today and 2010 had zero loss workdays, 85%.
Then if you go to the right hand side, you actually see that we received some nice recognition that really shows the leadership that we have and it indicates leadership that we have in sustainability. Maplecroft ranked us third of 339 companies for our climate-related innovations and the carbon management practices.
Dow Jones Sustainability Index, it's the 9th consecutive year we’re named in the world, as well as the North American Index. And Cradle to Cradle certified us on a silver level for primary aluminum, our product, emphasizing the sustainable characteristic of our metal.
All of these achievements, I believe, are testament of our ability to manage more than just the bottom line. This is important also for the bottom line, because at very, very many places that we've seen from Iceland to Brazil, this is what gives us the license to operate and to have new opportunities to grow profitably in future.
Right. So let me sum it all up here on this last slide. We've positioned the company for driving growth as well as profitability. At the lean place, we've learned our lesson and we will always be lean. Disciplined execution is our middle name with personalized accountability and powering the Alcoa employees. And the most important thing, we are driving shareholder returns.
You can see on the right hand side where we are currently, where it comes to the EBITDA margin, 12%. You see that this is the same level than 2008, but then you compare the time of 2008 with today. I just showed you utilization levels at the current market conditions. So this makes us all feel very inspired by this achievement, and I can tell you, we are all committed to exceed our historic performance levels.
That said, why don't we open it for the Q&A?

I mean, to the spot index, and I talked about flats and I talked about the first contract that we have concluded, which basically are a monthly average stock price based on a number of indexes and we use a basket of indexes. We believe that that really better reflects the different cost structures that we have in alumina and with caustic, ocean freight, oil and gas and coal in there compared to what we seen in LME. It gives more pricing flexibility. It's more reflective of the short-term volatility.
The concept, I think, is very well understood by our customers in the meantime. We are concluding business on that basis and really - I mean, it’s good that flats have added that index. On a daily reporting, it’s even more differentiated than what we currently use. It’s very transparent to that. But at the same time, I think you have to be very clear. I mean, every pricing change takes a while until it gets done. We have about 20% of our volume coming up and really take that as an about number. 20% of our volume in alumina coming up every year. So it will take a while until this will ripple through the system, but we are concluding contracts as we speak on that basis. Thank you, Curt.

The second thing on how do we have our customers, as I just said before, Brian, I mean, obviously this is a discussion with the customers. And the discussion with the customers is - I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily totally easy, but I mean, I don’t think anybody expects a change like that to be easy. But I think at the same time the customer understands why a change like that is needed because frankly alumina has very different cost drivers from aluminum. And the flexibility that the customers gain here is very high. And given that there are now indices around that give a very good transparency, I think the concern that probably some customers have had are often in transparent price setting is also taken away. So we will continue to go that route as we have announced. Thank you.

And that’s the level, which we believe is going to be the right level. And then Ma’aden comes into it, and the rest is pure speculation. But I think you have to really see where we have been coming from. There were a lot of investments starting with Iceland, Russia, China, Juruti, São Luís expansion, and I’m sure I forgot something here. But that’s all been happening in, I would say, less than five to eight years - probably last five years.
And you see that Russia, take it for instance - I mean, let’s start with Iceland. Iceland has been making good returns and even has been making good returns in the worst of our crisis. And the reason for that is very simple because it brought up lower on the cost curve. Take Russia, and finally Russia has turned the corner, second consecutive quarter that we are profitable there. And I’ve said many times on these calls and with you all individually that the assets that we have in Russia, once we run them well, which we do now, are very unique and are well positioned in that market.
We are only ones who can produce can sheet and tab, as for instance, also in Russia, and that market is actually starting to bloom as the economy comes back. China, the positioning of us in the automotive market in China with brazing sheet in Kunshan couldn’t happen any better, just went through the growth numbers there. Bohai is - so it’s profitable. Bohai is ramping up. And also it’s nicely positioned. Juruti, São Luís breaks us further down the cost curve with that on line. We’re going to come down to 25th percentile in the cost curve. And then comes Ma’aden. So that’s the logic that we are following here. Chuck, do you want to add anything into it?

And one thing is bolt-on acquisitions, but the other thing is with internal innovation. And we are very good at that. I mean, just when you look at the things that we brought out newly and how we expanded, I mean, from our new level-one wheel to new fasteners, the BOBTAIL system, as well as to some of the defense products that we have, so those two things basically we will continue to do and we will continue to hold the margin, and I would believe not only drive it further up through the utilization here, but also drive it further up to the other options that we have here.

As many of you know, during this quarter, we encountered several operational challenges, which we attacked and resolved on a rapid basis. We restarted our Aviles smelter, maintained high output levels at São Luis despite the loss of a ship unloader and have almost completely recovered from a fire at our Tennessee operations. 
In the face of a typically weak quarter, on Midstream segment increased shipments and revenue and maintained margins, while our Downstream segment increased revenues and achieved a record-high EBITDA margin.  From a liquidity standpoint, cash from operations and free cash flow improved. That was reduced, and our leverage ratio was down 270 basis points. 
Now let's move on to the next slide, and I'll highlight the financial results for the quarter. Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $61 million or $0.06 per share, which included restructuring and other special items totaling $35 million or $0.03 per share. A decline in aluminum prices, combined with the unfavorable currency movements, more than offset the continuing benefits of our cash sustainability initiatives and higher volumes. 
Despite the decline in prices, revenues were higher and the majority of our end markets that continue to strengthen. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $602 million, and our continued focus on cash helped to generate free cash flow of $176 million. 
We strengthened our balance sheet, reducing debt by $491 million, and extending our maturity profile by roughly one year for a successful tender offer and new debt issue. These actions helped to reduce debt to capital to 35.7%. Lastly, liquidity remains strong with cash on hand of $843 million. 
Now let's review our revenue change by market. Revenues in many of our markets improved sequentially. Aerospace continues to rise as destocking activity nears completion and volumes rise in the Investment Castings business. Expanding relationships with customers in North America and Russia drove Packaging sales higher, while Commercial Transportation continues to benefit from increased global economic activity, and Building & Construction continues to expand its customer base. 
Let's move on to the income statement. Third-party revenues rose 2% on higher third-party shipments in the Upstream business and improved demand in most of our end markets. COGS as a percent of sales stood at 83.5%, up 2.3 percentage points from last quarter due to a decline in aluminum prices, adverse currency impacts and higher costs at São Luis. Lastly, our effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 82%. For your reference, we've attached an appendix to help guide you through the tax rate, including the discreet items in the quarter. 
Our operational year-to-date rate, excluding these items is 32%. Going forward, we would expect our operational rate to remain at that level. However, we will continue to experience swings in the rate given the volatility of the profit drivers within each taxing jurisdiction.
The next slide provides you with an overview of the restructuring and special items in the quarter and their location and financial statements. Let me briefly review each one. Discreet tax items totaled $38 million in the quarter and were largely comprised of a favorable tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction, which allows us to carry forward net operating losses. As we shared with you last month, the failure of a ship unloader at our São Luis facility resulted in higher cost totaling $23 million in the quarter. 
In June of 2010, the area surrounding our smelter in Aviles, Spain suffered severe flooding, which forced the temporarily idling of the facility. We performed significant repair work and the smelter began to ramp up operations in August. As a result of the flooding, we sustained charges and unfavorable impacts of the $13 million, net of insurance recoveries, primarily representing higher costs in loss volumes. 
The next item in connection with the tender offer in redemption of our bonds completed during the quarter, we recorded charges of $9 million. And lastly, non-cash, mark-to-market impacts on power contracts totaled $29 million. You may remember last quarter, this was a positive impact of $22 million. The net impact of these items totaled $35 million or $0.03 per share.
Now let's move to the sequential earnings bridge. This slide bridges our income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and special items. The negative impact sequentially were led by lower realized aluminum pricing and adverse currency headwinds. These items more than offset the benefits of higher volumes in many of our businesses and the productivity gains generated from our cash sustainability initiatives. 
Let's move to the segments, and we'll start with alumina. Production was up 157,000 metric tons in the quarter, increases at São Luis, Pinjarra and Suriname was slightly offset by a reduction at Point Comfort. The São Luis refinery continues to ramp up, as it recovers from the failure of a ship unloader. Higher production and equipment costs of $25 million related to the recovery ramp-up were incurred in the quarter. By quarter end, Sao Luis was operating in an annualized run rate of $2.9 million metric tons, and we remain on track to achieve full annualized run rates of roughly $3.5 million tons by the end of 2010.
Turning to profitability, the combined impact of the 5% decline in realized alumina prices and depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the A dollar more than offset the impact of higher volumes and productivity gains. Lastly, the alumina segment benefited from a tax rate change totaling $42 million. This benefit is totally offset in Corporate to maintain our operating rate of 32%.
Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter, alumina pricing will follow a 60-day lag, and we will continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives. Lastly, we expect production across our global alumina system to increase by 150,000 metric tons versus the third quarter. 
Let's now move to the Primary segment. This quarter's performance was negatively impacted by a 2% decline in realized prices and unfavorable currency movements against the U.S. dollar. Productivity gains driven by cash sustainability were largely offset by cost increases in carbon products and energy. During the quarter, we restarted production at Aviles and anticipate achieving full capacity by the end of this year. 
Looking forward to next quarter, we anticipate pricing to continue to follow a 15-day lag. Production is expected to increase by 25,000 metric tons as Aviles ramps up, and we continue to expect to receive benefits from cash sustainability initiatives and headwinds from higher carbon costs. 
Moving to the Flat-Rolled Products segment. Okay, Flat-Rolled Products, ATOI with $66 million was a 7% sequential decline, an exceptional performance when you put it in the perspective of the typical sequential decline of nearly 40%. When viewed on a year-over-year basis, profitability improved $56 million. This quarter, we generate a revenue growth in substantially all end markets and gained volumes in China, North America and Russia, as we continue to expand our customer base. Higher costs stemming from the Tennessee fire and reduced production in North America related to the depletion of strike prep inventories negatively impacted profitability.
As a result of the rapid response by our Tennessee team, the financial impact of the fire to hot mill was significantly mitigated. In fact, repairs were nearly completed, and we're very pleased that the mill will return to full operation this month. Customer commitments were substantially met with inventory on hand and additional volumes out of our Warrick facility. The total financial impact in the third quarter was $3 million. Our Russian operations achieved its second consecutive quarter of profitability, and our Bohai, China facility continues to ramp up.
Next quarter, we expect continued strength in volumes, as Russia and Europe demand remains strong and China continues to ramp up. We will see gains from cash sustainability initiatives, and we expect normal seasonal volume declines in Can Sheet.
Let's turn to the last segment, which is Engineered Products and Solutions. ATOI of $114 million was up 7% sequentially. Continued strong performance in our cash sustainability initiatives helped generate our record EBITDA margin of 18%. That's five points higher than the third quarter of last year. These results illustrate how this segment has structurally improved its cost position through sustainable actions. 
Offsetting the normal seasonal impacts, revenues increased 5% sequentially on higher volumes in Aerospace and increased market share in the Building & Construction market. While the global commercial building and construction market continues to decline, improved sales in this market reflect our leading brands and strong relationships with well-positioned customers.  And despite the continued downward pressure in the IGT market, revenues remained flat sequentially.  Looking ahead, we anticipate our customers to undertake normal seasonal plant shutdowns and to continue to benefit from our cash sustainability initiatives in the fourth quarter. 
Let's now move to the cash flow statement. For the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $392 million. The sequential increase was driven by a reduction in working capital. We currently stand at 42 days working capital, which is a five-day improvement over the same period last year and down one day sequentially. This quarter, we reduced debt by $491 million through the paydown of our August 2010 maturity. We also successfully executed a tender program for our 2011 maturity and pieces of our 2012 and 2013 maturities. 
Purchases of these securities were made with proceeds from $1 billion 20/20 offering. In sum, we reduced our debt outstanding, bringing our debt to capital to 35.7%, and increased our maturity profile by nearly one year.
Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $216 million. If you include the net investment of the Ma'aden joint venture, spending total $271 million, which keeps us on track against our 2010 goal of $1.25 billion. Finally, we had very strong cash flow generation in the third quarter of $176 million. 
Let me summarize on the next slide. We are improving free cash flow generation, strengthening the company and driving shareholder value. The rapid response of Alcoans across each business to recover production after recent adverse events and to quickly repair damaged facilities was an exceptional achievement. As we effectively manage through challenges this quarter, we continue to aggressively pursue our 2010 goals. 
For the second year in a row, we remain on track to achieve these targets. All of our actions are focused on driving improved, sustainable performance across Alcoa. We have established higher baseline performance levels in our mid and downstream businesses and increased our balance sheet flexibility through debt reduction and well-timed capital market transactions. We have generated roughly $240 million of free cash flow this year, and we anticipate higher levels of free cash flow as we move into the fourth quarter. 
I'd like to now turn it over to Klaus."

Let's start on the usual fashion with a view on the economy and our end markets, first. So in general, we are muted, being optimistic. We see good profits of growth in some major regions and some specific end markets. Let's start with the end markets. 
The Aerospace, the large commercial aircraft, the largest segment, our outlook has improved from essentially flat to roughly 2% to 4% growth, whereas 2009, we see orders, build rates, as well as deliveries up. Deliveries year-to-date are up 3%. Boeing and Airbus at the same time are ramping up their narrow-body production. 
To give you a little bit of a more detailed indication, the orders that have come in year-to-date, 511 units compared to last year comparable timeframe, 195 units. And also keep in mind, there's still a backlog that exists between five to six years. 
International Air Traffic is up. We expect it to rise roughly 8% this year. This year, airline profitability improving. IATA expects the airlines to earn roughly $9 billion. Last year, they lost $10 billion. Regional and Business Jets, about 10% to 20% of the market, continues to be weak in order as well as deliveries.
Automotive, the next segment here on that chart. Let's start with the U.S., August, the lowest August sales since nearly 30 years and then came September, highest-selling months since August last year. And August last year was still marked by the Cash for Clunkers program. So we believe sales will continue to improve on a slow pace, probably slower than we are historically accustomed too. The OEMs are tightly controlling the inventory, currently at 50 to 55 days where this is normally 65 days. They are doing that to avoid price pressure via lot clearing sales. We do that very effectively.
China's sales in Automotive, up 40%. Through August, we are expecting on an annual basis, an increase of 15% to 20%. Europe sales expected to decline compared to last year. And keep in mind, last year was marked by very strong government incentives, pretty much all across all the European countries. At the same time, export demand is up. So if you net it all out, production in Europe within Automotive will be up between 5% and 10%.
So next segments, Heavy Truck and Trailer, pretty much we upward revised our projections in all regions, driven by increased global industrial activity, better freight rates, as well as a depleted use of new truck inventories. If you move to the U.S. on heavy trucks and trailers, you'll see some more specifics there. The truck production year-to-date is up 55%. We expect on an annual basis 25%; trailer production up year-to-date on 46%; annual expectation is 53%; trailer backlog, given that growth is up 79% since December of 2009. 
It's interesting to note and also gives a good dimension on things that are going around here, sales in China are up 30%, we expect them to be up 35%, interestingly in the first half of 2010, given an absolute number of 570,000 trucks have been sold. We expect by the end of 2010, 870,000 trucks. And if you just take the absolute number, it actually is more than 2x the sales of North America and Europe together.
Beverage Can and Packaging, North American Can, we expect a modest decline, pretty much caused by the weak summer promotions here. Chuck, I think, just did an outstanding -- for good aluminum cans in the very start, but we saw promotions around that and inclement weather in parts of Mexico. Growth in other regions will offset the North American decline. So in total, we expect in the beverage can and packaging market flat 2010 compared to 2000. 
Commercial Building & Construction, start with USA, we expect it to go further down. Our expectation is 25%. Reduction can look at some indicators and probably get the impression as though this market has not yet bottomed out, unfortunately. Looking at commercial mortgage-backed securities, delinquency rate topped with 7.8% in July and expected to go further up at the end of this year, 9% to 10% is what the experts estimate, or look at the office vacancy rates at 17% during the second quarter. Expect it to go further up. 
Europe, pretty much the same in Commercial Building & Construction. At China, a very different picture. We expect it to go up 10% to 15%, and India more in the same niche as China. 
So last segment here and that's for Gas Turbines. We see basically three factors we've used: Energy demand, power plant construction delays as well as deferrals, as well as the uncertainty around carbon legislation. All of this comes together in the industrial gas turbine market and weighs heavy on the demand, and that's the impact that we see there.
So to sum the end market overview that you have on this chart. We see a significant improvement for 2009 in most end markets, although the overall is below the historic norms. 
So with that, let's go to the aluminum demand and see what implications the end markets drive has on the aluminum demand, and this is actually pretty good news. Many of you who follow us know that we have raised our forecast in the second quarter here from 10% growth to 12%, and we are raising our forecast again another percentage points. And this is re-driven by us seeing the rising consumption levels that India, Asia, Brazil, as well as Russia, and the second thing that will come through in the second half of this year. And the second aspect that one has to take into account here is the tight scrap conditions, unavailability of scrap, which drives the primary demand and growth in here too. 
So let's look at the inventory side, and some of you are familiar with this chart.  On the left-hand side here, you'll see all the aluminum inventories listed and kind of stacked on each other. You can already see where the dark blue one which reflects the LME. LME has come down, it continues to come down. If you look at the total, which we accumulated here, the total comes up to 59 days of consumption. And for those of you who remember the Q2 number, this is four days lower than what we had at the end of the second quarter. So that's actually pretty good news. We continue to see financial participants, as well as logistic constraints as well as the scrap shortage. It's basically driving the accessibility or reducing the accessibility of metal. And if you go to the right-hand side, where you see the regional premiums depicted in the three big regions. You'll actually see that the regional premiums are high. If you look at the blue curve you have for Europe there, they're almost at an all-time high, and it's further pressured by some of the containments and closures in Europe. And then you look at the U.S. as another example there, you'll see the Midwest premium is almost at the five-year high.
So what does that mean now in terms of supply and demand? Let's put those two slides together, and start with Aluminum. So if you look at Aluminum, you know, we always mix China and the Western world. As we revised our global demand size, we're also revising our global surplus estimate for the aluminum mark. We now believe it's going to be around 1 million tons. That is a reduction of about 180,000 tons lower than what we had previously said in the second quarter. This is driven basically by two factors: One is increased demand, we talked about it; and the second thing is production outages like we saw in the Middle East, Canada, as well as India. 
Let's talk a little bit about China, because that's an interesting dynamic that we see there. If you look at this year, it looks like not much is going on. China manages very well to stay in balance, but there's actually a lot going on in China these days. As two things come together, a very short-term thing which is China at the end of this 11th five-year plan. And at the same time, they are ramping up to the new five-year plan, and that is very, very important changes on the way. On the one hand, you'll see provinces truly scrambling to reach the energy efficiency as well as the emission targets that are tied into the 11th fifth-year plan. This is leading, as we speak, to massive floaters and curtailment. About 700,000 tons of smelting are in the process of getting shut, some is shut, and others are getting shut as we speak.  That will be most likely another 600,000 tons that are planned to getting shut until the end of this year. So that's a huge, huge shift. At the same time, we actually do see that there's new capacity, mainly in the West, that could potentially come online. That's the one thing and, obviously, having an impact short term already on pricing. 
The second thing is the discussion around the new five-year plan. The new five-year plan, it is very clear in the whole setup of this plan that the administration fees, energy efficiency and emission as one of the most critical things driving the country going forward. And they have clear target for the energy-intense industries, like the aluminum industry, the draft of this new plan is currently out and gets circulated in the usual fashion. And it's basically says until 2015, China will not allow more than 20 million tons of capacity. Talking to some of the experts there, experts basically say the Chinese government is very, very serious about this approach of emissions control and the energy efficiency. And they would rather expect around 17 million to 18 million tons by 2015, probably being the limit. It doesn't take much to understand that, that comes along with quite a number of opportunities here.
Let's move on to the alumina market. Talking about opportunities, equally exciting things going on there in that market. We see on the one hand, the market is essentially balanced, with a little tightness emerging in the Atlantic region. The more exciting thing happens here on the changeover of the pricing. We talked about, I'm sure, in this call, we've talked more about it. This quarter, plants have launched their smelter grade alumina, their price index. This is a very thorough index, a hats off to them. It is very transparent, a lots of good data, benchmarking, daily spot prices amongst other things out of Australia. If you take that as an index, the average price at the start of the index for alumina has been $327 per ton, and the last price today was $348 per ton. 
So now we're leaving the markets behind us, and let's talk about how our businesses are doing and what we are doing in our businesses going forward. So let's start with Alumina. As I said, exciting things going on in Alumina. There's a couple of things how we drive value. One thing is the changing of the pricing. We're going away, as we said before, announced that a long time ago, we're going away from LNE linkage to a pricing that's more and better reflects the underlying costs of this specific industry. And we have been successfully concluding contracts for our 2011 volumes on a price index basis. It's the way that the new contracts have been built. The ones that we have signed, as we have used the monthly average of the basket of different published alumina prices. So not favoring one over the other, and I think that's very, very fair, much fairer than the pricing that existed before. That's one value driver. 
Another value driver is that we are growing our low-cost production base. I mean the Juruti bauxite mine and the São Luis refinery are both coming online. We've achieved a good record production level in September, even though we have to overcome the failures of the ship unloader. We expect that we have a permanent solution in place by the end of this month. And in general, we are on track to achieve full production by the end of this year.
And the next value driver that is really well underway is Ma'aden. This will be the lowest cost refinery that exists. We'll start by end of 2014, as I said, well on the way. We expect the project financing to be completed in this year by the end of this year. 
The Alumina profitability is recovering, as you can see here on the left-hand side. It's also very clear that it has not yet reached the levels that we would expect from this business, particularly talking about these value drivers that I just mentioned. So we expect the benefits of the higher pricing as well as the lower-cost position to get us to EBITDA margin levels that will be better than where we have historically performed once the market returns. So much on alumina, let's go to Aluminum on the next slide. 
So our smelting system currently is producing around 3.6 million tons. So we are at about 80% utilization, with secured power for 85% of the capacity until minimum 2025. We streamlined our system, we've reduced costs and permanently curtailed smelters like Suralco and Badin. We are further reducing our cost position. The Ma'aden joint venture here is clearly the next big, big step for bringing online the lowest-cost smelter that will exist. Then it will come online by the end of 2013, so kind of already around the corner. All of these actions that will improve the EBITDA margin. And here, we also believe that we'll be higher than historic levels once the market returns.
So let's go to Flat-Rolled Product side. On the Flat-Rolled Products side, we've taken massive actions. We drived the bottom line. We reduced costs, divested underperforming assets. We exited to commodity markets. We emphasized high-valued products like Aerospace. And on the Can Sheet side, we adjusted our pricing to be consistent with the highest quality, the delivery performance and the innovativeness we have in our products. All of that, we can already see today, has an impact on the EBITDA margins. We have reached 9% year-to-date, although the utilization rate is at 80% in this business, and you may remember was 75% by the end of the second quarter. So it's up a little bit. But it still only at 80%, and we continue to see destocking in Aerospace sheet and plate, since we run through the end of 2010 and also lower can sheet volumes. That's what leads them to the utilization rate here of 80%. 
At the same time, profitability in Russia is good, the second consecutive quarter. Our profits, we're ramping up our Chinese facilities, all of that looks good, demand, rolling mill is well underway, also on the right path. We expect profitability to exceed historic levels once the market accelerates.
Last but absolutely not least, our Engineered Products and Solution business. Year-to-date, the number as you can see here is 17% EBITDA margin. Q3 is at 18%, that's at a historic high. And not only at a historic high, but then look at the right-hand side and see the utilization that we currently have. 70% in Aerospace, 65% in the Rest. So obviously, we reached this margin level with this utilization, the clear reflection of how well we've worked in reducing our costs and improving our portfolio. 
We actually also in this quarter have further strengthened our portfolio with the acquisition of Traco and the building and construction space integration is well underway. It's really in Engineered Products and Solutions business that we see this good combination of great execution and improved top and bottom line performance, and that gives this team the license to further grow. 
So we will continue to build around the core of our EPS business, improve our performance further. And it's obviously, with its current utilization, a pretty substantial upside once the economy improves, and utilization will go up.
So let's now review the progress against our 2010 operational targets. Procurement, our target was $2.5 billion. Our savings, we are at $2.154 billion. That's good. Overhead, $500 million target, we have $431 million, good. Total CapEx, $1.250 million target; we currently have spent $785,000. This is in line with the expectation and keep in mind that it includes this $250 million on an annual basis for Ma’aden. Typically, the fourth quarter, just for you to note already, is higher as we take advantage of our customers shutting down, and we used that time to upgrade some of our facilities and to do the maintenance. So keep that in mind when you look into the fourth quarter. Last but not least, working capital, year-on-year working capital declined by five days, on target to reduce two days working capital this year.
Right now, we've talked a lot about financial benchmarks that we have achieved this quarter. But I really don't want to go with this presentation before I haven't talked also about some other things that I think make this company a great company. And where we have continued to expand our leadership position and this is about safety and sustainability on this chart here. On the left-hand side, you will actually see our safety performance. In the blue curve, which shows the total recordable incident rate or in the green curve, the lost workday incident rate that's the best-ever safety performance. 
If you look at the lost workday incident rate, just as for example, we further improved it by 40% compared to the end of 2009, which already had a very, very low number. We make clear what a number like that means. 85% of all of our core facilities, up to today and 2010, had zero lost work days, 85%. Then if you go to the right-hand side, you'll actually see that we received some nice recognition that really shows the leadership that we have, and it indicates leadership that we have in sustainability. Maplecroft ranked us third of 339 companies for our client-related innovations in the carbon management practices. Dow Jones Sustainability Index is the ninth consecutive year, we're Named to the World as well as the North American Index, and Cradle to Cradle certified us on a silver level for primary aluminum for product, emphasizing the sustainable characteristics of our metal.
All of these achievements, I believe, are testament of our ability to manage more than just the bottom line. This is important also for the bottom line because at very, very many places that we've seen from Iceland to Brazil, this is what gives us the license to operate and to have a new opportunities to grow profitably in the future. 
All right, so let me sum it all up here on this last slide. We positioned the company for driving growth as well as profitability. It's a lean place, we've learned our lesson, and we will always be lean. Disciplined execution is our middle name, with personalize accountability and powering the Alcoa employees. And the most important thing, we're drive sales and returns, you can see on the right-hand side where we are currently when it comes to the EBITDA margins, 12%, do you see that this is the same level as 2008. But then you compare the time of 2008 with today, I just showed you the utilization levels and the current market conditions. So I think this makes us all feel very inspired by this achievement, and I can tell you we're all committed to exceed our historic performance levels. 
That said, why don't we open this for the Q&A?"

To the spot index, and I talked about Flats and I talked about the first contract that we have concluded, which basically are a monthly average spot price based on a number of indexes, and we used a basket of indexes. We believe that, that really better reflects the different cost structures that we have in alumina, and with the cost like ocean freight, oil, gas and coal in there compared to what we see in LME, it gives some more pricing flexibility. It's more reflective of the short-term volatility. The concept, I think, is very well-understood by our customers in the meantime. We are concluding business on that basis. And really, it's good that Flats has added this index on a daily reporting. It's even more differentiated than what we currently use, but it's very transparent to that. But at the same time, you'll to be very clear, every pricing change takes a while until it gets done. And we have about 20% of our volumes coming up, and we really take that as an about number. 20% of all volume in alumina coming up every year. So it will take a while until this will ripple through the system, but we are concluding contracts as we speak on that basis."

But I don't think anybody expects the change like that to be easy. But I think at the same time, the customer understands why a change like that is needed, because frankly, alumina has very different cost drivers from aluminum. And the flexibility that the customers gain here is very high. And given that there are now indices around that gives a very good transparency, I think the concern that probably some customers have had are often in transparent price setting is also taken away. So we will continue to go that route as we have announced."

And that's the level which we believe is going to be the right level. And then Ma'aden comes into it and the rest is pure speculation. But I think you have to really see where we have been coming from. There were a lot of investments starting with Iceland, Russia, China, Juruti, São Luis expansion, and I'm sure I forgot something here. But that's all been happening and, I would say, less than five, eight years, probably in the last five years, and you'll see that Russia, just take it for instance. Let's start with Iceland, Iceland has been making good returns and even had making good returns during the worse of the crisis. And the reason for that is very simple because they brought up lower in the cost curve, right? Take Russia, and finally Russia has turned the quarter, second consecutive quarter that we are profitable there. And I said many times on these calls and with you all individually that the assets that we have in the Russia, once we run them well, which we do now, are very unique and are well-positioned in that market. We're the only ones who can produce can sheet and have it capped, in for instance, also in Russia, and that market is actually starting to boom as the economy comes back. China, the positioning of us in the automotive market in China with grading sheet in Kunshan couldn't have been any better. I just went through growth numbers there. Bohai is there, so it's profitable. Bohai is ramping up. And also, it's nicely positioned. Juruti, São Luis brings us further down at the cost curve, we've got a 9%. We're going to come down to 25th percentile in the cost curve. And then comes Ma'aden. So that's the logic that we're following here. Chuck, you want to add anything into this?"

So you look at whether you include those shares or not and the after-tax impact of the interest associated with that debt, okay? And whatever gives you the lower-per-share amount, whichever one is more dilutive, it's the one you have to use. So in the second quarter, adding those shares back and deducting the after-tax interest gave you a lower EPS number. And if you had done this time, it would would've been anti-dilutive. That's why the share count has not been added for those convertibles. As far as interest expense, the biggest reason for the interest expense increase this quarter is a result of the tender offer premium that we paid, which was about $14 million before tax. So that's a one-time item, and it was listed as a line after-tax on our discreet items."

But one other thing, I think that was the question that Paretosh was asking and remembering the presentation, quite a while ago -- I think if we have Christopher here, when Bill who was heading up the Engineered Products and Solutions business, Bill is going through the innovations, because there are obviously two ways how you can grow on that business. One thing is with bolt-on acquisitions, but the other thing is with internal innovation. And we are very good at that. Just when you look at the things that we brought our view and how we expand it, from our new Level one wheels to new fasteners, boxing systems and as well as to some of the Defense product that we have. So those two things, basically, we will continue to do. And we will continue to hold the margin.
