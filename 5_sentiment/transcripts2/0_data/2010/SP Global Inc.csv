As Don said, with me today is Bob Bahash, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. We will start today by reviewing the fourth quarter operating results, and then we'll move on to the prospects for 2010. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials. After the presentation is done and said [ph], we'll be pleased to address any comments or questions about The McGraw-Hill Companies that you may have. Let's get started.  Earlier today, we reported a 43.2% increase in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the fourth quarter included a pretax gain of $10.5 million or $0.02 on the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December. That compares with a $0.37 last year, which included a restructuring charge of $0.05 per diluted share. Revenue increased by 3.3% in the fourth quarter.The fourth quarter results marked the first quarterly increases in diluted earnings per share and revenue for The McGraw-Hill Companies since the third quarter of 2007. These results set the stage for more growth in 2010. Our assessment of improving prospects is reflected in the guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share for 2010.We're encouraged by the improvement in the economy, which has finally begun to recover, albeit at a modest pace. Financial markets are definitely improving. Bond spreads have narrowed. Interest rates remain low. Our Chief Accountant at Standard & Poor's, David Wyss, believes no tightening by the Federal Reserve is likely before the summer and perhaps not until after the November elections. We expect a better year in our education markets.Last week, the Board of Directors underscored its confidence in our financial strength and growth prospects by increasing the dividend by 4.4% and announcing the corporation's intention to resume share repurchases this year. We will buyback over time the 17.1 million shares remaining in the program that was authorized by the Board in 2007.We have now increased the dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. Since 1974, the dividend has grown at an average compound annual rate of 9.9%. Since 1996, we have returned approximately $9.4 billion to shareholders, and that's through dividends as well as stock buybacks.With that as an overview, let's take a closer look at our operations and the prospects for 2010. And we'll start with the McGraw-Hill Education.  A solid finish in the key education markets helped produce an upswing in the fourth quarter performance at McGraw-Hill Education. In the fourth quarter for McGraw-Hill Education, revenue increased by 2.6%. Operating profit was $33.5 million, and that compares to a loss of $12.7 million in 2008, which included a restructuring charge of $11.4 million. The operating margin was 6.4%. Including restructuring charges of $11.6 million, the operating margin for 2009 was 11.6%. Excluding the restructuring charges, the operating margin was 12%.In 2009, Education has been a tale of two markets, a steady decline in the elementary-high school sales and growth in the U.S. college and university market. But as this bar chart shows, revenue started improving in the el-hi market in September and kept growing in October and November. And while we don't have AAP [Association of American Publishers] figures for December, we expect to see another increase in sales.  Despite the recent gains, industry revenue will be down about 15% in 2009, far better than the previous expectations of a decline of 20% or more.In this challenging environment, we still captured 30% of total available dollars in the state new adoption market, which will close out the year in the $500 million to $510 million range. That's about a 50% decline, by the way, from the 2008 state new adoption market. And we also won a 30% market share in 2008.In the fourth quarter, state allocations that reached local districts later than usual in some regions, together with the arrival of some Federal stimulus funds, helped produced the pick up in ordering. We caught the wave with our base of products and our intervention programs, which benefited from the incremental Title 1 and IDEA funding for disadvantaged and special education students, respectively provided in the stimulus package.But these gains were offset by a substantial decline in Testing. The result was a 7.6% decrease in fourth quarter revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group. The major reason for this decline was testing and was the managed phaseout of the statewide summative contracts in Arizona, California and Florida as part of a more selective approach to the custom testing market.  In rebalancing the Testing business, we're increasing our focus on the expanding formative market and the non-custom or off-the-shelf market, while decreasing our emphasis on lower-margin custom contracts.We continue to win summative contracts with a selective-bidding strategy. In the fourth quarter, we were awarded contracts in North Dakota, Alabama, Indiana and New York State. Acuity, which is our formative testing program, continues to show solid growth, retaining existing subscription customers and adding new ones. New York City, the largest school district in the nation, is now in the third year of its Acuity contract, and Philadelphia has signed on for the start of the new school year. These are multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts. Many district-level opportunities for the new business are in the pipeline for 2010.  Some states have also included the introduction or the expanded use of Acuity in their applications for the Federal Race to the Top funding.Growth in the el-hi market in 2010 hinges on substantial increase in state new adoption opportunities. We estimate that the state new adoption market this year will be in the $925 million to $975 million range. Given state budget pressures, we expect industry sales in the open territory to decline in 2010. We also expect a decline in residual sales in the adoption states, which usually fall off in a strong state new adoption year. But given the strength of the state new adoption schedule, we think the el-hi market could grow now in the 6% to 7% range off of 2009's low base.  Texas and Florida, of course, are the key adoption states in 2010, and we are well positioned in both. The Florida legislative session starts in March. Senate and House leaders have given early indications of full support for funding K-12 instructional materials. Mass [Massachusetts] [ph] is scheduled to buy K-12 math this year. The state recently adopted new math standards, which essentially is obsoletes books now in the classroom. Adoption activity in Florida is already very brisk at the district level, something we did not see at this time last year when the state still planned to buy literature. Texas returns to the market this year with funding already in place for a K-12 reading and literature adoption. The state legislature has appropriated $465 million for the adoption. We continue to see evidence of pent-up demand in the market, but budget pressures also remain until the economic recovery is further along.We may also see some purchasing postponed from 2009 in adoption states like California. Funding levels in California remain uncertain, but some districts may buy K-8 reading programs as part of the second year of that adoption. There are also some potential for math sales at the middle school, that's grades six through eight, and high school, grades nine through 12. The Governor's budget proposal for the 2010-2011 fiscal year calls for $332.5 million for instructional materials, which is flat with 2009. We are following this situation closely, and we'll keep you updated on the developments there.A solid 2009 performance in Higher Education culminated with a surge in second semester ordering late in the year. We don't have the final 2009 figures, but it now appears that the industry is going to outstrip our 8% to 10% growth estimate. Revenue in the fourth quarter at our Higher Educational, Professional and International Group grew by 7.5%. We expect the U.S. college market to grow in the 5% to 7% range in 2010.A surge in enrollments helped drive industry growth in 2009 and is going to do so again in 2010, although probably not at the same pace. Based on a number of surveys and reports, we estimate the most rapid rate of growth was concentrated in two-year colleges and career colleges. We saw the benefits in career education. It was the fastest-growing imprint in our Higher Education line up in 2009.  All our major imprints grew in 2009 and are expected to do so again in 2010. Fourth quarter and full year digital sales increased at double-digit rates. It includes e-books, online courses and online study tools for students, including McGraw-Hill Connect, the industry's most advanced interactive platform. There's clearly acceleration in the pace of integrating content, technology and distribution, and we will take full advantage of the rapidly-evolving digital opportunity. There is growing momentum in the e-book market, and that's evidenced by the almost daily announcement of new devices and new formats. We will continue to look for optimal ways to deliver data and source files for each of these devices. And in the near future, you will undoubtedly see a McGraw-Hill e-book for the college market running on an Apple Tablet.All our titles on CourseSmart, the industry e-book consortium, are already available to students on an iPhone operating system. That's because CourseSmart developed an iPhone application last summer with the support from Apple. The goal was to have core educational content available on the iPhone operating system, which also makes it possible for e-books to run on new Apple devices using that system, such as the Tablet.Consider the Apple Tablet computer, which will be introduced shortly. There is a lot of secrecy about the introduction, but many expect that the Apple device will use the iPhone operating system. If that's the case, and we believe it is, we are confident that our CourseSmart e-books should run well right out of the box on any Apple Tablet. Stay tuned.I should also point out that CourseSmart does not share revenue with Apple. For a student to access our e-books, they must subscribe to CourseSmart or its college bookstore partners. The e-textbooks feature the iPhone application, and it lets students access our titles on a device that runs on the iPhone operating system. That application is free to subscribers.  About 95% of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education current titles are available as e-books, with interactive features, including search and note-taking functionalities.  Digital publishing is also a bright spot in our Professional market, with subscriptions to our services growing at a consistent double-digit pace, and we continue to innovate in this space.In the first quarter of 2010, we will launch AccessPhysiotherapy, the sixth vertical or specialty site in the AccessMedicine family of online medication information subscription sites. The new specialty offers an excellent opportunity to broaden the market for the respected Access brand beyond medical education and clinical practice to the allied health field. Our Professional Business Group will also launch more digital products in the first quarter. Kiss, Bow or Shake Hands is a new subscription-based reference for international business etiquette. Clearly, that's a digital product with widespread global appeal. Change is coming rapidly in our markets. Growth in the digital world will be transformational. For the prepared, it will unlock huge new opportunities. We are not waiting for a tipping point. That means we will continue to ramp up our investments in learning platforms and content management capabilities to stay ahead of the curve in creating the next generation of innovative products and programs.  The increase in marketing and sales expenses associated with a robust state new adoption schedule will also put some pressure on operating margins in 2010. Let's sum up then for the McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key education markets, 6% to 7% increase in the elementary-high school market, 5 to 7% growth in the U.S. college and university market, revenue growth for the segment at 7% to 8% level and operating margins unchanged from 2009.With that, let's go on over to Financial Services. And in Financial Services, improving conditions in the financial market, marked by the narrowing spreads, low interest rates and a growing investor appetite for yield, were important factors in the strong finish this year. In the fourth quarter for Financial Services, revenue increased by 10.6%. Operating profit grew by 14.6%, and the operating margin was 36.3%. Excluding the loss of a divestiture of Vista Research and the net restructuring charge, the segment's operating margin for the year was 39.4%.This 2009, operating margin also reflects the cost of compliance to meet the increased regulation of Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services. The improvement in 2009 in investment-grade industrials and high-yield issuance culminated in a 19.4% increase in fourth quarter revenue against the easiest comparisons of the year at Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services.In the United States, we saw 181 industrials issued with a par value of $93 billion compared to 94 deals with a par value of $78.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. That's a 92.6% increase in the number of issues and a 19% increase in the par value of the issuance.  There were 101 high-yield industrial and financial institution issues for $44.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to three for  $1.3 billion for in the same period in 2008, obviously tremendous improvement.  In Europe, the dollar value of industrial issuance was $93.6 billion, up 36.9% in the fourth quarter. That represented 154 deals, an increase of 46.7%.  And there were 27 high-yield deals in the fourth quarter 2009 in Europe and none in the same period of 2008, obviously a clear pick up.All this activity helped produce a 62.5% increase in the fourth quarter transaction revenue at S&P Credit Market Services. For 2009, transaction revenue was up 0.2% after being down 20.2% for the first six months.  Non-transaction revenue, which represented 69.2% of S&P Credit Market Services total revenue in 2009, grew by 6% in the fourth quarter to finish the year at just over $1.2 billion. It was the first quarterly increase in non-transaction revenue in 2009.This continues to be a durable revenue stream. It includes annual and surveillance fees and subscription revenue. If you back out the impact of brokerage fees, non-transaction revenue grew by 2% in 2009 instead of the reported decline of 0.6%. We expect growth in 2010 in transaction and non-transaction revenue for the S&P Credit Market Services, and we expect growth in domestic and international markets in 2010.International markets finished strongly in 2009. S&P Credit Market Services international revenue in the fourth quarter was up 17.7%. And all regions, Europe, Canada, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, grew in the fourth quarter and provided 49.4% of total revenue. Improving financial market conditions are clearly making the difference in the worldwide outlook for S&P Credit Market Services. Consider the changes in spreads. Spreads to U.S. treasuries, always a key factor in the level of issuance, are continuing to narrow for investment and speculative-grade issues. As this table shows, since the record highs at the start of 2009, investment in speculative-grade spreads have tightened and are near the range of their five-year daily moving averages. Spreads continue to tighten in January, another indication of why the month is off to a good start. That's a reflection of optimistic sentiment in the credit markets and an expectation of some stabilization in credit quality.  The spread between the three month LIBOR and the Federal Reserve's overnight rate, this is a key gauge of how banks assess the riskiness of lending to one another, and it is down to 0.25%.We have also seen spread contraction across the major consumer asset-backed securities during 2009. And as this table shows, the spreads narrowed dramatically in autos, credit cards and student loans. S&P expects further contraction in credit spreads this year.There are other important favorable trends in the credit markets. There is a strong demand for non-financial institution paper by investors who want to diversify their portfolio. Investors have already demonstrated that they are increasingly comfortable in buying low-rated bonds. In the fourth quarter of 2009, 60% of speculative-grade issuance was rated at single B+ or below. In corporates, the high-yield bond market has become more attractive than the leveraged loan market and companies with riskier credits are lining up to tap it. Some issuers choose speculative-grade bonds because covenants are less restrictive and in some cases, maturities are longer. Because it is widely expected that corporate borrowing costs will increase as the economy improves, some non-financial firms are borrowing now to repay expensive debt, including commercial paper, as well as bank loans. Some companies are beefing up their balance sheets with an eye on merger and acquisition activity or buying new equipment. The deleveraging of financial institutions is another factor in credit market, as these institutions shrink the liabilities on their balance sheet and tightening lending standards, credit availability is declining systemically. Limited availability of bank loan funding will result in a greater reliance on the primary bond market.  S&P believes that 2010 may offer a window of opportunity for refinancing debt. Refinancing of current and future maturities was robust in 2009 and should be again in 2010.  Above 1/3 of the estimated $300 billion coming due in 2010 was refinanced in 2009. Let me repeat that about 1/3 of the estimated $300 billion coming due in 2010 was refinanced in 2009. There is a dramatic rise in corporate debt coming due from 2011 through 2014. It's estimated to be $2 trillion. Some of that debt may be refinanced in 2010, adding to the remaining $200 billion that is coming due this year.In Public Finance, 2009 was a solid year and 2010 looks even better. Municipalities sold the second heaviest volume of debt in 2009, $468.3 billion, $468.3 billion. The all-time record, by the way, was  $468.4 billion, and that was set in 2007.The biggest factor boosting issuance here was the Building America Bonds (sic) [Build America Bonds] program, which authorized municipalities to sell taxable debt and receive a Federal subsidy equal to 35% of their interest cost. Munis sold $84 billion in taxable debt in 2009, about 18% of total issuance.S&P expects sales of taxable bonds to help drive growth in this market in 2010, although tax-exempt securities will continue to comprise the largest share of overall issuance. Lower tax receipts and added expenses for pensions and infrastructure need should keep state and local government active in this market.The outlook for structured finance in 2010 remains more problematic, with asset-backed securities showing the most promise. In the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market, we expect to see a continuation of the re-REMIC [Resecuritization of Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Securities] activity in 2010, as financial institutions continue to seek ways to improve balance sheet capital requirements. In the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, we saw small but marked  note of confidence as issuers bought single-borrower instruments to market in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the near term, S&P expects very modest pick up in the activity of this part of the market.The asset-backed securities market continues to be a positive story. Volume began to grow last March as the TALF stimulus program took hold. By the end of 2009, there was activity outside of the TALF program. Dollar volume issuance in the U.S. market grew by 179.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009.Although our outlook for the U.S. asset-backed securities issuance is relatively flat in 2010, there is a healthy pipeline as we move into the first quarter with a good mix of TALF and non-TALF activity. Tighter spreads have limited the economic incentives for using TALF leverage for many issuers. The collateralized debt obligation market will continue to be soft in 2010.About 33% of Financial Services revenue was produced last year by Standard & Poor's Investment Services. Fourth quarter revenue was down 4.8% in 2009 but was down only 1.7%, excluding divestitures. For the full year 2009, revenue declined 4.2% to $861.9 million but was off 1.5% if you exclude divestitures. The expiration of the Independent Equity Research Settlement in July also was a factor in the fall off in revenue. But in some key markets, the year ended strongly. A new high of $247 billion was established at the end of 2009 for assets under management based on S&P indices. The previous high was $235.3 billion, and that was set at the end of 2007. From a small family of equity indices, S&P has expanded into commodities, fixed income real estate, custom, thematic indices. S&P indices have successful relationships with exchanges literally around the world. At the end of 2009, there were 217 exchange-traded funds based on S&P indices. Five were added in the fourth quarter and more are coming in 2010, and they will be in the areas of commodities, equities, fixed income and alternative investments.  It is our strategic goal to provide an S&P index for every type of investment. And in 2009, S&P introduced 90 new indices. And we expect more new products and more growth from S&P indices  in 2010.In the challenging market, Capital IQ added new clients in 2009 to end the year with more than 2,900, an increase of 9.9% for the year. Sales to new customers and increases from current customers are expected to produce another year of growth for Capital IQ in 2010. With more growth from S&P indices and Capital IQ, we expect revenue to increase in 2010 at S&P Investment Services. The divestiture of Vista in May of 2009 and the expiration of the Research Settlement last July will be mitigating factors in the first part of the year.Let's complete our review of the Financial Services with a few comments on the current legal and regulatory situation. The regulatory situation is still evolving, and we continue to strive for global consistency, trying to avoid a patchwork of regulatory frameworks. This is very, very important. The good news is that we're getting close to the finish line on global regulation.In November, the European Union issued its final regulation for credit rating agencies. By next September, S&P will need to apply for registration in Europe. Regulations are being developed in Europe by the Committee of European Security Regulators (sic) [Committee of European Securities Regulators] better known as CESR. We are following that process closely. In general, the proposed regulations are based on the International Organization of Security Commissions' (sic) [International Organization of Securities Commissions'] Code of Conduct, that's IOSCO out of Madrid. And that's a very good thing for them to take the leadership in terms of providing those Code of Conduct principles.Starting on January 1, 2010, S&P has been licensed in Australia to provide its ratings to wholesale investors. We continue to work with regulators in Canada, Japan and India. In the United States, both the House and Senate continue to consider regulation of the rating agencies as part of the omnibus financial markets reform legislation. We continue to work with Congress on draft legislation. We're somewhat concerned that proposed discriminatory liability standards would create an uneven playing field and have unintended consequences for financial markets.In the legal arena, there's not much to report. In the underwriter cases, we continue to make applications seeking dismissal, and oral arguments have been proceeding in several of them. In the stock drop suits, motions to dismiss have been fully briefed, and oral arguments have been held in two of these cases. In the state law claim cases, we also are making applications or awaiting decisions on motions to dismiss. We're in the discovery phase of the Abu Dhabi case.Summing up then for Financial Services, in 2010, there will be a return to growth and revenue at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services. The segments' operating profits will grow, but there will be pressure on margins, as S&P makes investments in the infrastructure of its business to support future growth and to comply with new regulatory requirement.The majority of these costs support the Credit Ratings business. They include investments in surveillance systems and the infrastructure for quality, criteria, compliance, as well as risk management. We will also continue to invest in key S&P Investment Services business so that they are well positioned to take advantage of an improving market.There's an additional factor. S&P Investment Services is primarily subscription based. In a challenging market in 2009, the S&P Investment Services added fewer net subscribers than in 2008, and that will have some impact on revenue in 2010. Prospects look good for increasing net subscribers this year, which will lead to a more favorable impact on revenue in 2011. Revenue for this segment is expected to grow in the high-single digits. Operating margins will decline about 100 basis points.Now let's shift over to Information & Media. In that area, continued strength in the global energy markets, a soft advertising market and the divestiture of BusinessWeek were major factors in the fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter for Information & Media, revenue declined 11.4%. Including a pretax gain of $10.5 million from the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December, operating profit increased 40.6%. However, excluding a pretax gain on the sale of BusinessWeek and a prior-year restructuring charge, operating profit declined 6.8%.  The operating margin was 18.1% compared to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Reflecting the gain on the sale of BusinessWeek, the operating margin for the year was 9.7%, but excluding the gain and the 2009 restructuring charge of $4 million, it was 9%.The weak advertising market and problems in the automotive sector were evident in the 9.5% revenue decline in our Business-to-Business Group in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group was off 26.6% in the fourth quarter, and obviously especially with the absence of political advertising.  In 2009, advertising represented approximately 3.5% of total corporation revenue, down from 4% in 2008. Virtually, all of it is in this segment. With the sale of BusinessWeek, our exposure to this cyclical advertising market will be reduced to approximately 2% in 2010.Political advertising in the Broadcasting Group will be a positive factor in 2010. There are U.S. Senate and House races in Indiana, Colorado, California. There will also be races for governor in Colorado and California, plus spending on issues and propositions. The outlook for political spending on local television stations also got a boost from last week's U.S. Supreme Court decision to remove campaign spending restrictions from corporations. The Broadcasting Group also recently renewed its affiliation agreement with ABC. The new agreement will have adverse but immaterial impact on the segment's future revenue and profitability.With all the reporting on problems of the big three auto companies in Detroit, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that J.D. Power operates successfully in a recovering global automotive market. Here's a snapshot of J.D. Power's latest forecast for the global market. Global light vehicle sales are expected to rise to 65 million units, and that's an increase of 1.6% over 2009 after a decline of 3.1% last year.  Growth continues in China, an increasingly-important market for J.D. Power. The recovery begins in North America, with volume up 10% to 13.9 million units in 2010.J.D. Power will also complete the migration of its syndicated study deliverables to an online platform, which will reduce cost and improve the quality and the utility of its research data. The digital transformation of this segment will continue to be a plus in 2010. Business-to-Business digital revenue grew again in 2009 and now represents more than half of the B2B Group sales in 2009. In 2008, it was under 50% of the B2B Group's revenue.Platts continues its global expansion, strengthening its benchmark status and core commodity market. Platts has launched the series of new oil price benchmarks for Indian markets. In December, Platts announced the launch of the new price assessment for the very first Russian petroleum stream that's flowing through the Eastern Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline for Asian markets.It's an interesting example of how Platts keeps abreast of the developments in this market. The pipeline, rail and port facilities in Russia's Far East provide the country with the logistics to target increasing amounts of oil to Asia rather than to the West. Over time, the operation is well positioned to serve the market as a major price indicator of spot oil values in the Far East. The exports are set to grow, and the oil has wide equity ownership, key elements for an emerging benchmark.Summing up then for Information & Media, the sale of BusinessWeek will impact revenue and operating margin in 2010. Revenue will decline in the middle single-digits, but excluding the $100 million from the BusinessWeek divestiture, revenue will increase in the mid single-digit range. Operating margins will rebound climbing into the mid-teens.Okay that completes our review of the three operating segments and the outlook for the segments in 2010. For The McGraw-Hill Companies, we expect diluted earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65 in 2010. Okay, let's hold it there. Let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, and let's get the inside detail on some of the financials. Bob?"

This morning, I want to review how we main",2153,"Okay. Thank you, Terry. A major focus during 2009 was our balance sheet management. We did that in order to maintain and enhance our strong financial position to ensure adequate and appropriate access to capital. This morning, I want to review how we maintained and improved upon the corporation's financial strength in 2009. We'll also look at our plans for this year 2010.So we start 2010 in a strong financial position. Due to a very strong free cash flow, we ended 2009 with cash and short-term investments of $1.23 billion. Total debt at year-end was $1.2 billion. This comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes, and there was no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2009. So as a result, we're now in a slight positive net cash position versus a net debt position last year of $796 million. Keeping a tight grip on costs and expenses was a year-long priority. Terry has discussed revenues and margins, so I'll concentrate on providing some additional color on expenses.For purposes of this discussion, I'll deal with adjusted expenses, which represent reported expenses adjusted to exclude restructuring charges in both years, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Adjusted expenses are shown on Exhibit 3 of the press release.Despite increases in incentive compensation, consolidated adjusted expenses at segment expenses, gross corporate expense declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. Now if you will exclude the impact of currency, adjusted expenses declined 3.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year.Now let's look on a segment basis. For McGraw-Hill Education, adjusted expenses declined 4.2% in the fourth quarter and 8.4% for the year. At constant currencies, adjusted expenses declined 6.2% in the fourth quarter and 7.3% for the full year. Full year expenses declined despite higher incentive compensation as declining revenue opportunities resulted in lower cost of sales and in reduced selling and marketing costs. This segment also benefited from savings from previous restructuring actions. For 2010, we expect McGraw-Hill Education expenses to increase 7% to 8% versus 2009 adjusted expense. Expense growth is driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs given the robust new state adoption opportunities that Terry mentioned. As I have mentioned in the past, we incur significant promotion and marketing expense in the first year of a new adoption. Profit contribution increases in the subsequent years from residual sales. Additionally, we are investing in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at Higher Educational and Professional in order to provide value and choices for our customers. The expense growth is partially mitigated by savings from our second quarter 2009 action to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 10.3% in the fourth quarter and 1.6% for the full year. For the constant currencies, adjusted expense increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. The full year expense growth was driven by increases in incentive compensation and compliance costs, mitigated by the benefits of restructuring, tight expense control and the impact of divestitures.For 2010, we expect expenses to increase roughly 9% to 10% versus 2009 adjusted expense. The expense growth is largely driven by continued investments in our fast growing businesses, the carry over impact of 2009 new staff hires and planned new hires in 2010 and additional investment to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.For the full year 2009, costs related to regulatory and compliance initiatives resulted in approximately $20 million of additional costs versus 2008. Our expense guidance assumes a comparable increase in 2010, though this is obviously highly dependent on the final form of regulation. For Information & Media, adjusted expenses declined 12.1% in the fourth quarter and 8.7% for the full year. At constant currencies, adjusted expenses declined 12.7% in the fourth quarter and 7.9% for the full year. Restructuring savings and lower cost of sales due to reduced revenue were key drivers for the full year expense decline. Fourth quarter expense of course benefited from the divestiture of BusinessWeek.For 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. You will recall from our third quarter call that we expected the BusinessWeek divestiture to benefit 2010 pretax profit by approximately $20 million to $25 million. We refined our estimate now, and expect the benefit to be roughly $25 million. Information & Media, the segment I'm referring to now, will actually reflect savings from the BusinessWeek divestiture of $38 million, as we manage vacant space and certain other support costs within corporate expense, which is increasing by approximately $13 million due to the divestiture.As we've indicated on previous calls, Information & Media's 2009 results were negatively impacted by the non-cash accounting impact of converting studies on to Compass, J.D. Power's online reporting and analytical tool. Revenue previously recognized at the time of our syndicated studies' release will now be recognized ratably over the 12-month life of the subscription. And this again, of course, is similar to the Sweets transition activity in 2006. For the full year, there was an $11 million decrease in revenue and $7 million decrease in profit due to the impact of Compass. In 2010, we expect all customers to be accessing this digital delivery platform, and the impact in 2010 is expected to be similar to 2009. Corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $36.4 million, a $7.4 million increase versus the previous year excluding the 2008 restructuring charge. The increase was primarily driven by a $10.3 million increase in incentive compensation. For the year, excluding the 2009 restructuring charge, expenses were up $21 million driven by a $23 million increase in incentive compensation. For 2010, we expect corporate expense to increase $25 million to $30 million. The primary reason for the increase is driven by higher excess space in New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as excess space generated from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.Incentive compensation has increased in previous quarters, and again in the fourth quarter when compared to a depressed 2008. Incentive compensation increased by $96 million for the full year 2009 and approximately $57 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by stronger than anticipated results and reversals taken in accruals in the previous year. For 2010, incentive compensation should now grow in normal patterns with projected performance. However, stock-based compensation is expected to reach about $50 million compared to $22.3 million in 2009, and that's due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off of course a depressed base.Foreign exchange had a significant impact in our operating results in 2009. For nine months, foreign exchange decreased revenue and expense but had a minimal impact on profits. In the fourth quarter, the trend reversed, benefiting revenue by almost $26 million while increasing expenses by $36 million, result in operating profits declining by about $10.5 million. For the year, foreign exchange decreased revenue by $70.4 million, and expense by almost $61 million resulting in a decline in operating profit of $9.5 million.Prudent management of investments and tight cost controls contributed to a strong free cash flow performance. For the year, free cash flow was $770 million compared to $503 million in 2008. We define free cash flow in the following manner. We start with cash provided by operations per GAAP cash flow statement. And then we then substract the following items, which would be pre-publication investments, purchases of property and equipment, additions to technology projects and dividends paid to our shareholders. The result is free cash flow that would then be available for acquisitions, share repurchases or to pay down debt.I'll spend a moment reviewing the changes in free cash flow in 2009 compared to 2008. As the table highlights, cash provided by operation increased $152 million over 2008 despite a reduction in net income. The primary drivers of the strong free cash flow were: A significant reduction in cash incentive compensation payments; lower inventory purchases reflecting decreased revenue opportunities from McGraw-Hill Education; significant improvement in accounts receivable collections generating $50 million as the company's days sales outstanding was reduced by nine days; and of course, investments declined $116 million primarily driven by a reduction in prepublication cost of $77 million, reflecting the continuing efficiency gains and the development process as well as lower investments due to a later adoption calendar.Based on our operating performance or on guidance, I should say, for 2010, we anticipate free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $600 million. Reduction in the free cash flow versus 2009 is due largely to more challenging working capital comparisons, as well as increased investments that I'll discuss in just a moment. We took advantage of our strong free cash flow to contribute approximately $50 million to our U.S. pension plan. The U.S. plan continues to be in underfunded position following the significant market declines in 2008, though it has improved since last year end. Based on current projections, we anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. However, we do expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $20 million in 2010. Our strong cash flow generation and balance sheet leave us well positioned to fund investments, and return cash to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility. Last week, we announced a 4.4% increase in our dividend, the 37 straight increase. We're one of few within 30 companies in S&P 500 that can make that statement. We also announced that we plan to resume share repurchases, as our $17.1 million shares remaining from the 2007 authorization from the Board of Directors. Unlike previous years, we have not indicated either a share or a dollar repurchase target for the year. I reiterate, it is our plan to resume the program. But the economic environment remains uncertain, so we'll watch this carefully and determine when we will commence share repurchases. We plan to increase our investments in 2010 to take advantage of the opportunities we see in our growing global markets.Prepublication investments for 2010 are expected to be $225 million to $235 million versus $177 million in 2009, primarily due to opportunities in the growing state new adoption market. Purchases of property and equipment for 2010 are projected at $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and largely due to increased technology spending.Let's now review our non-cash items. For 2010, we expect amortization of prepublication costs to be $260 million to $265 million versus $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the lower level of investments made in 2009. We expect depreciation to grow to $120 million in 2010 versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $16 million in the fourth quarter due to the acceleration of the amortization of certain acquired intangibles. That brought the total for 2009 to almost $53 million. For 2010, we expect amortization to decline and to be approximately in the $40 million range. The decline is due to the accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in 2009 as well as other items being fully amortized also in 2009.Our fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $314.5 million in the fourth quarter, a $1.6 million share increase versus the same period last year, and a $0.8 million share increase from the third quarter of 2009. Full year WASO was 313.3 million shares, a 5.4 million share year-over-year decline, driven largely by the full year impact of the 2008 share repurchases. Fully-diluted shares at the end of 2009 were approximately 315 million.Interest expense was $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to $15.4 million in the same period last year, and $17.8 million in the third quarter. For the full year, interest expense was $77 million compared to $75.6 million in 2008, and we expect 2009 to be roughly comparable to 2009. Regarding the company's effective tax rate, we finished 2009 with a full year rate of 36.4%, and we expect the comparable rate in 2010.I'll end with a recap of growth in unearned revenue. Unearned revenue ended 2009 at $1.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and including the impact of divestitures, that most notably BusinessWeek, it grew 2.8%. Financial Services makes up 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. Financial Services unearned revenue was roughly flat, as strong growth for subscription products including RatingsDirect was offset by reductions in equity research C to D [ph] (1:09:54) and of the independent equity research settlement, as well as declines driven by lower Structured Finance revenues.While comparatively small, McGraw-Hill Education's strong unearned revenue growth was driven by an increase in subscription-based [ph] (1:10:09) products particularly at Higher Education, where digital products are growing at a double-digit rate. For 2010, we expect a mid- single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry."

So we're probably looking a little less than that, so mid-single digits. Residuals will also be a little bit soft, again given some of the new adoption activity of 2008 and 2009. And of course, the bright spot is the new adoption opportunities for this year. But right now, unless we see some changes in all of that, we see that a decline in the open territories and residuals on that part. And again, probably mid-single digits on both of those. New adoptions in 2009 are probably similar between $500 million and $510 million. We're looking for $925 million to $975 million for new adoptions in 2010. Residual was about $3 billion in 2009, and we see a little bit of a decline to similar in the neighborhood of about $2.8 billion, maybe $2.85 billion for 2010."

Some of the digits for Higher Education, it can range anywhere from four years. Some of the digits down to two years, some of the digits on Professional faster.

As Don said, with me today is Bob Bahash, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. We will start today by reviewing the fourth quarter operating results, and then we'll move on to the prospects for 2010. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials. After the presentation is done and said [ph], we'll be pleased to address any comments or questions about The McGraw-Hill Companies that you may have. Let's get started.  Earlier today, we reported a 43.2% increase in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the fourth quarter included a pretax gain of $10.5 million or $0.02 on the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December. That compares with a $0.37 last year, which included a restructuring charge of $0.05 per diluted share. Revenue increased by 3.3% in the fourth quarter.The fourth quarter results marked the first quarterly increases in diluted earnings per share and revenue for The McGraw-Hill Companies since the third quarter of 2007. These results set the stage for more growth in 2010. Our assessment of improving prospects is reflected in the guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share for 2010.We're encouraged by the improvement in the economy, which has finally begun to recover, albeit at a modest pace. Financial markets are definitely improving. Bond spreads have narrowed. Interest rates remain low. Our Chief Accountant at Standard & Poor's, David Wyss, believes no tightening by the Federal Reserve is likely before the summer and perhaps not until after the November elections. We expect a better year in our education markets.Last week, the Board of Directors underscored its confidence in our financial strength and growth prospects by increasing the dividend by 4.4% and announcing the corporation's intention to resume share repurchases this year. We will buyback over time the 17.1 million shares remaining in the program that was authorized by the Board in 2007.We have now increased the dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. Since 1974, the dividend has grown at an average compound annual rate of 9.9%. Since 1996, we have returned approximately $9.4 billion to shareholders, and that's through dividends as well as stock buybacks.With that as an overview, let's take a closer look at our operations and the prospects for 2010. And we'll start with the McGraw-Hill Education.  A solid finish in the key education markets helped produce an upswing in the fourth quarter performance at McGraw-Hill Education. In the fourth quarter for McGraw-Hill Education, revenue increased by 2.6%. Operating profit was $33.5 million, and that compares to a loss of $12.7 million in 2008, which included a restructuring charge of $11.4 million. The operating margin was 6.4%. Including restructuring charges of $11.6 million, the operating margin for 2009 was 11.6%. Excluding the restructuring charges, the operating margin was 12%.In 2009, Education has been a tale of two markets, a steady decline in the elementary-high school sales and growth in the U.S. college and university market. But as this bar chart shows, revenue started improving in the el-hi market in September and kept growing in October and November. And while we don't have AAP [Association of American Publishers] figures for December, we expect to see another increase in sales.  Despite the recent gains, industry revenue will be down about 15% in 2009, far better than the previous expectations of a decline of 20% or more.In this challenging environment, we still captured 30% of total available dollars in the state new adoption market, which will close out the year in the $500 million to $510 million range. That's about a 50% decline, by the way, from the 2008 state new adoption market. And we also won a 30% market share in 2008.In the fourth quarter, state allocations that reached local districts later than usual in some regions, together with the arrival of some Federal stimulus funds, helped produced the pick up in ordering. We caught the wave with our base of products and our intervention programs, which benefited from the incremental Title 1 and IDEA funding for disadvantaged and special education students, respectively provided in the stimulus package.But these gains were offset by a substantial decline in Testing. The result was a 7.6% decrease in fourth quarter revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group. The major reason for this decline was testing and was the managed phaseout of the statewide summative contracts in Arizona, California and Florida as part of a more selective approach to the custom testing market.  In rebalancing the Testing business, we're increasing our focus on the expanding formative market and the non-custom or off-the-shelf market, while decreasing our emphasis on lower-margin custom contracts.We continue to win summative contracts with a selective-bidding strategy. In the fourth quarter, we were awarded contracts in North Dakota, Alabama, Indiana and New York State. Acuity, which is our formative testing program, continues to show solid growth, retaining existing subscription customers and adding new ones. New York City, the largest school district in the nation, is now in the third year of its Acuity contract, and Philadelphia has signed on for the start of the new school year. These are multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts. Many district-level opportunities for the new business are in the pipeline for 2010.  Some states have also included the introduction or the expanded use of Acuity in their applications for the Federal Race to the Top funding.Growth in the el-hi market in 2010 hinges on substantial increase in state new adoption opportunities. We estimate that the state new adoption market this year will be in the $925 million to $975 million range. Given state budget pressures, we expect industry sales in the open territory to decline in 2010. We also expect a decline in residual sales in the adoption states, which usually fall off in a strong state new adoption year. But given the strength of the state new adoption schedule, we think the el-hi market could grow now in the 6% to 7% range off of 2009's low base.  Texas and Florida, of course, are the key adoption states in 2010, and we are well positioned in both. The Florida legislative session starts in March. Senate and House leaders have given early indications of full support for funding K-12 instructional materials. Mass [Massachusetts] [ph] is scheduled to buy K-12 math this year. The state recently adopted new math standards, which essentially is obsoletes books now in the classroom. Adoption activity in Florida is already very brisk at the district level, something we did not see at this time last year when the state still planned to buy literature. Texas returns to the market this year with funding already in place for a K-12 reading and literature adoption. The state legislature has appropriated $465 million for the adoption. We continue to see evidence of pent-up demand in the market, but budget pressures also remain until the economic recovery is further along.We may also see some purchasing postponed from 2009 in adoption states like California. Funding levels in California remain uncertain, but some districts may buy K-8 reading programs as part of the second year of that adoption. There are also some potential for math sales at the middle school, that's grades six through eight, and high school, grades nine through 12. The Governor's budget proposal for the 2010-2011 fiscal year calls for $332.5 million for instructional materials, which is flat with 2009. We are following this situation closely, and we'll keep you updated on the developments there.A solid 2009 performance in Higher Education culminated with a surge in second semester ordering late in the year. We don't have the final 2009 figures, but it now appears that the industry is going to outstrip our 8% to 10% growth estimate. Revenue in the fourth quarter at our Higher Educational, Professional and International Group grew by 7.5%. We expect the U.S. college market to grow in the 5% to 7% range in 2010.A surge in enrollments helped drive industry growth in 2009 and is going to do so again in 2010, although probably not at the same pace. Based on a number of surveys and reports, we estimate the most rapid rate of growth was concentrated in two-year colleges and career colleges. We saw the benefits in career education. It was the fastest-growing imprint in our Higher Education line up in 2009.  All our major imprints grew in 2009 and are expected to do so again in 2010. Fourth quarter and full year digital sales increased at double-digit rates. It includes e-books, online courses and online study tools for students, including McGraw-Hill Connect, the industry's most advanced interactive platform. There's clearly acceleration in the pace of integrating content, technology and distribution, and we will take full advantage of the rapidly-evolving digital opportunity. There is growing momentum in the e-book market, and that's evidenced by the almost daily announcement of new devices and new formats. We will continue to look for optimal ways to deliver data and source files for each of these devices. And in the near future, you will undoubtedly see a McGraw-Hill e-book for the college market running on an Apple Tablet.All our titles on CourseSmart, the industry e-book consortium, are already available to students on an iPhone operating system. That's because CourseSmart developed an iPhone application last summer with the support from Apple. The goal was to have core educational content available on the iPhone operating system, which also makes it possible for e-books to run on new Apple devices using that system, such as the Tablet.Consider the Apple Tablet computer, which will be introduced shortly. There is a lot of secrecy about the introduction, but many expect that the Apple device will use the iPhone operating system. If that's the case, and we believe it is, we are confident that our CourseSmart e-books should run well right out of the box on any Apple Tablet. Stay tuned.I should also point out that CourseSmart does not share revenue with Apple. For a student to access our e-books, they must subscribe to CourseSmart or its college bookstore partners. The e-textbooks feature the iPhone application, and it lets students access our titles on a device that runs on the iPhone operating system. That application is free to subscribers.  About 95% of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education current titles are available as e-books, with interactive features, including search and note-taking functionalities.  Digital publishing is also a bright spot in our Professional market, with subscriptions to our services growing at a consistent double-digit pace, and we continue to innovate in this space.In the first quarter of 2010, we will launch AccessPhysiotherapy, the sixth vertical or specialty site in the AccessMedicine family of online medication information subscription sites. The new specialty offers an excellent opportunity to broaden the market for the respected Access brand beyond medical education and clinical practice to the allied health field. Our Professional Business Group will also launch more digital products in the first quarter. Kiss, Bow or Shake Hands is a new subscription-based reference for international business etiquette. Clearly, that's a digital product with widespread global appeal. Change is coming rapidly in our markets. Growth in the digital world will be transformational. For the prepared, it will unlock huge new opportunities. We are not waiting for a tipping point. That means we will continue to ramp up our investments in learning platforms and content management capabilities to stay ahead of the curve in creating the next generation of innovative products and programs.  The increase in marketing and sales expenses associated with a robust state new adoption schedule will also put some pressure on operating margins in 2010. Let's sum up then for the McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key education markets, 6% to 7% increase in the elementary-high school market, 5 to 7% growth in the U.S. college and university market, revenue growth for the segment at 7% to 8% level and operating margins unchanged from 2009.With that, let's go on over to Financial Services. And in Financial Services, improving conditions in the financial market, marked by the narrowing spreads, low interest rates and a growing investor appetite for yield, were important factors in the strong finish this year. In the fourth quarter for Financial Services, revenue increased by 10.6%. Operating profit grew by 14.6%, and the operating margin was 36.3%. Excluding the loss of a divestiture of Vista Research and the net restructuring charge, the segment's operating margin for the year was 39.4%.This 2009, operating margin also reflects the cost of compliance to meet the increased regulation of Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services. The improvement in 2009 in investment-grade industrials and high-yield issuance culminated in a 19.4% increase in fourth quarter revenue against the easiest comparisons of the year at Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services.In the United States, we saw 181 industrials issued with a par value of $93 billion compared to 94 deals with a par value of $78.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. That's a 92.6% increase in the number of issues and a 19% increase in the par value of the issuance.  There were 101 high-yield industrial and financial institution issues for $44.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to three for  $1.3 billion for in the same period in 2008, obviously tremendous improvement.  In Europe, the dollar value of industrial issuance was $93.6 billion, up 36.9% in the fourth quarter. That represented 154 deals, an increase of 46.7%.  And there were 27 high-yield deals in the fourth quarter 2009 in Europe and none in the same period of 2008, obviously a clear pick up.All this activity helped produce a 62.5% increase in the fourth quarter transaction revenue at S&P Credit Market Services. For 2009, transaction revenue was up 0.2% after being down 20.2% for the first six months.  Non-transaction revenue, which represented 69.2% of S&P Credit Market Services total revenue in 2009, grew by 6% in the fourth quarter to finish the year at just over $1.2 billion. It was the first quarterly increase in non-transaction revenue in 2009.This continues to be a durable revenue stream. It includes annual and surveillance fees and subscription revenue. If you back out the impact of brokerage fees, non-transaction revenue grew by 2% in 2009 instead of the reported decline of 0.6%. We expect growth in 2010 in transaction and non-transaction revenue for the S&P Credit Market Services, and we expect growth in domestic and international markets in 2010.International markets finished strongly in 2009. S&P Credit Market Services international revenue in the fourth quarter was up 17.7%. And all regions, Europe, Canada, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, grew in the fourth quarter and provided 49.4% of total revenue. Improving financial market conditions are clearly making the difference in the worldwide outlook for S&P Credit Market Services. Consider the changes in spreads. Spreads to U.S. treasuries, always a key factor in the level of issuance, are continuing to narrow for investment and speculative-grade issues. As this table shows, since the record highs at the start of 2009, investment in speculative-grade spreads have tightened and are near the range of their five-year daily moving averages. Spreads continue to tighten in January, another indication of why the month is off to a good start. That's a reflection of optimistic sentiment in the credit markets and an expectation of some stabilization in credit quality.  The spread between the three month LIBOR and the Federal Reserve's overnight rate, this is a key gauge of how banks assess the riskiness of lending to one another, and it is down to 0.25%.We have also seen spread contraction across the major consumer asset-backed securities during 2009. And as this table shows, the spreads narrowed dramatically in autos, credit cards and student loans. S&P expects further contraction in credit spreads this year.There are other important favorable trends in the credit markets. There is a strong demand for non-financial institution paper by investors who want to diversify their portfolio. Investors have already demonstrated that they are increasingly comfortable in buying low-rated bonds. In the fourth quarter of 2009, 60% of speculative-grade issuance was rated at single B+ or below. In corporates, the high-yield bond market has become more attractive than the leveraged loan market and companies with riskier credits are lining up to tap it. Some issuers choose speculative-grade bonds because covenants are less restrictive and in some cases, maturities are longer. Because it is widely expected that corporate borrowing costs will increase as the economy improves, some non-financial firms are borrowing now to repay expensive debt, including commercial paper, as well as bank loans. Some companies are beefing up their balance sheets with an eye on merger and acquisition activity or buying new equipment. The deleveraging of financial institutions is another factor in credit market, as these institutions shrink the liabilities on their balance sheet and tightening lending standards, credit availability is declining systemically. Limited availability of bank loan funding will result in a greater reliance on the primary bond market.  S&P believes that 2010 may offer a window of opportunity for refinancing debt. Refinancing of current and future maturities was robust in 2009 and should be again in 2010.  Above 1/3 of the estimated $300 billion coming due in 2010 was refinanced in 2009. Let me repeat that about 1/3 of the estimated $300 billion coming due in 2010 was refinanced in 2009. There is a dramatic rise in corporate debt coming due from 2011 through 2014. It's estimated to be $2 trillion. Some of that debt may be refinanced in 2010, adding to the remaining $200 billion that is coming due this year.In Public Finance, 2009 was a solid year and 2010 looks even better. Municipalities sold the second heaviest volume of debt in 2009, $468.3 billion, $468.3 billion. The all-time record, by the way, was  $468.4 billion, and that was set in 2007.The biggest factor boosting issuance here was the Building America Bonds (sic) [Build America Bonds] program, which authorized municipalities to sell taxable debt and receive a Federal subsidy equal to 35% of their interest cost. Munis sold $84 billion in taxable debt in 2009, about 18% of total issuance.S&P expects sales of taxable bonds to help drive growth in this market in 2010, although tax-exempt securities will continue to comprise the largest share of overall issuance. Lower tax receipts and added expenses for pensions and infrastructure need should keep state and local government active in this market.The outlook for structured finance in 2010 remains more problematic, with asset-backed securities showing the most promise. In the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market, we expect to see a continuation of the re-REMIC [Resecuritization of Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Securities] activity in 2010, as financial institutions continue to seek ways to improve balance sheet capital requirements. In the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, we saw small but marked  note of confidence as issuers bought single-borrower instruments to market in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the near term, S&P expects very modest pick up in the activity of this part of the market.The asset-backed securities market continues to be a positive story. Volume began to grow last March as the TALF stimulus program took hold. By the end of 2009, there was activity outside of the TALF program. Dollar volume issuance in the U.S. market grew by 179.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009.Although our outlook for the U.S. asset-backed securities issuance is relatively flat in 2010, there is a healthy pipeline as we move into the first quarter with a good mix of TALF and non-TALF activity. Tighter spreads have limited the economic incentives for using TALF leverage for many issuers. The collateralized debt obligation market will continue to be soft in 2010.About 33% of Financial Services revenue was produced last year by Standard & Poor's Investment Services. Fourth quarter revenue was down 4.8% in 2009 but was down only 1.7%, excluding divestitures. For the full year 2009, revenue declined 4.2% to $861.9 million but was off 1.5% if you exclude divestitures. The expiration of the Independent Equity Research Settlement in July also was a factor in the fall off in revenue. But in some key markets, the year ended strongly. A new high of $247 billion was established at the end of 2009 for assets under management based on S&P indices. The previous high was $235.3 billion, and that was set at the end of 2007. From a small family of equity indices, S&P has expanded into commodities, fixed income real estate, custom, thematic indices. S&P indices have successful relationships with exchanges literally around the world. At the end of 2009, there were 217 exchange-traded funds based on S&P indices. Five were added in the fourth quarter and more are coming in 2010, and they will be in the areas of commodities, equities, fixed income and alternative investments.  It is our strategic goal to provide an S&P index for every type of investment. And in 2009, S&P introduced 90 new indices. And we expect more new products and more growth from S&P indices  in 2010.In the challenging market, Capital IQ added new clients in 2009 to end the year with more than 2,900, an increase of 9.9% for the year. Sales to new customers and increases from current customers are expected to produce another year of growth for Capital IQ in 2010. With more growth from S&P indices and Capital IQ, we expect revenue to increase in 2010 at S&P Investment Services. The divestiture of Vista in May of 2009 and the expiration of the Research Settlement last July will be mitigating factors in the first part of the year.Let's complete our review of the Financial Services with a few comments on the current legal and regulatory situation. The regulatory situation is still evolving, and we continue to strive for global consistency, trying to avoid a patchwork of regulatory frameworks. This is very, very important. The good news is that we're getting close to the finish line on global regulation.In November, the European Union issued its final regulation for credit rating agencies. By next September, S&P will need to apply for registration in Europe. Regulations are being developed in Europe by the Committee of European Security Regulators (sic) [Committee of European Securities Regulators] better known as CESR. We are following that process closely. In general, the proposed regulations are based on the International Organization of Security Commissions' (sic) [International Organization of Securities Commissions'] Code of Conduct, that's IOSCO out of Madrid. And that's a very good thing for them to take the leadership in terms of providing those Code of Conduct principles.Starting on January 1, 2010, S&P has been licensed in Australia to provide its ratings to wholesale investors. We continue to work with regulators in Canada, Japan and India. In the United States, both the House and Senate continue to consider regulation of the rating agencies as part of the omnibus financial markets reform legislation. We continue to work with Congress on draft legislation. We're somewhat concerned that proposed discriminatory liability standards would create an uneven playing field and have unintended consequences for financial markets.In the legal arena, there's not much to report. In the underwriter cases, we continue to make applications seeking dismissal, and oral arguments have been proceeding in several of them. In the stock drop suits, motions to dismiss have been fully briefed, and oral arguments have been held in two of these cases. In the state law claim cases, we also are making applications or awaiting decisions on motions to dismiss. We're in the discovery phase of the Abu Dhabi case.Summing up then for Financial Services, in 2010, there will be a return to growth and revenue at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services. The segments' operating profits will grow, but there will be pressure on margins, as S&P makes investments in the infrastructure of its business to support future growth and to comply with new regulatory requirement.The majority of these costs support the Credit Ratings business. They include investments in surveillance systems and the infrastructure for quality, criteria, compliance, as well as risk management. We will also continue to invest in key S&P Investment Services business so that they are well positioned to take advantage of an improving market.There's an additional factor. S&P Investment Services is primarily subscription based. In a challenging market in 2009, the S&P Investment Services added fewer net subscribers than in 2008, and that will have some impact on revenue in 2010. Prospects look good for increasing net subscribers this year, which will lead to a more favorable impact on revenue in 2011. Revenue for this segment is expected to grow in the high-single digits. Operating margins will decline about 100 basis points.Now let's shift over to Information & Media. In that area, continued strength in the global energy markets, a soft advertising market and the divestiture of BusinessWeek were major factors in the fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter for Information & Media, revenue declined 11.4%. Including a pretax gain of $10.5 million from the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December, operating profit increased 40.6%. However, excluding a pretax gain on the sale of BusinessWeek and a prior-year restructuring charge, operating profit declined 6.8%.  The operating margin was 18.1% compared to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Reflecting the gain on the sale of BusinessWeek, the operating margin for the year was 9.7%, but excluding the gain and the 2009 restructuring charge of $4 million, it was 9%.The weak advertising market and problems in the automotive sector were evident in the 9.5% revenue decline in our Business-to-Business Group in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group was off 26.6% in the fourth quarter, and obviously especially with the absence of political advertising.  In 2009, advertising represented approximately 3.5% of total corporation revenue, down from 4% in 2008. Virtually, all of it is in this segment. With the sale of BusinessWeek, our exposure to this cyclical advertising market will be reduced to approximately 2% in 2010.Political advertising in the Broadcasting Group will be a positive factor in 2010. There are U.S. Senate and House races in Indiana, Colorado, California. There will also be races for governor in Colorado and California, plus spending on issues and propositions. The outlook for political spending on local television stations also got a boost from last week's U.S. Supreme Court decision to remove campaign spending restrictions from corporations. The Broadcasting Group also recently renewed its affiliation agreement with ABC. The new agreement will have adverse but immaterial impact on the segment's future revenue and profitability.With all the reporting on problems of the big three auto companies in Detroit, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that J.D. Power operates successfully in a recovering global automotive market. Here's a snapshot of J.D. Power's latest forecast for the global market. Global light vehicle sales are expected to rise to 65 million units, and that's an increase of 1.6% over 2009 after a decline of 3.1% last year.  Growth continues in China, an increasingly-important market for J.D. Power. The recovery begins in North America, with volume up 10% to 13.9 million units in 2010.J.D. Power will also complete the migration of its syndicated study deliverables to an online platform, which will reduce cost and improve the quality and the utility of its research data. The digital transformation of this segment will continue to be a plus in 2010. Business-to-Business digital revenue grew again in 2009 and now represents more than half of the B2B Group sales in 2009. In 2008, it was under 50% of the B2B Group's revenue.Platts continues its global expansion, strengthening its benchmark status and core commodity market. Platts has launched the series of new oil price benchmarks for Indian markets. In December, Platts announced the launch of the new price assessment for the very first Russian petroleum stream that's flowing through the Eastern Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline for Asian markets.It's an interesting example of how Platts keeps abreast of the developments in this market. The pipeline, rail and port facilities in Russia's Far East provide the country with the logistics to target increasing amounts of oil to Asia rather than to the West. Over time, the operation is well positioned to serve the market as a major price indicator of spot oil values in the Far East. The exports are set to grow, and the oil has wide equity ownership, key elements for an emerging benchmark.Summing up then for Information & Media, the sale of BusinessWeek will impact revenue and operating margin in 2010. Revenue will decline in the middle single-digits, but excluding the $100 million from the BusinessWeek divestiture, revenue will increase in the mid single-digit range. Operating margins will rebound climbing into the mid-teens.Okay that completes our review of the three operating segments and the outlook for the segments in 2010. For The McGraw-Hill Companies, we expect diluted earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65 in 2010. Okay, let's hold it there. Let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, and let's get the inside detail on some of the financials. Bob?"
21719,84102535,46913,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2010",2010-01-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Terry. A major focus during 2009 was our balance sheet management. We did that in order to maintain and enhance our strong financial position to ensure adequate and appropriate access to capital. This morning, I want to review how we main",2153,"Okay. Thank you, Terry. A major focus during 2009 was our balance sheet management. We did that in order to maintain and enhance our strong financial position to ensure adequate and appropriate access to capital. This morning, I want to review how we maintained and improved upon the corporation's financial strength in 2009. We'll also look at our plans for this year 2010.So we start 2010 in a strong financial position. Due to a very strong free cash flow, we ended 2009 with cash and short-term investments of $1.23 billion. Total debt at year-end was $1.2 billion. This comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes, and there was no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2009. So as a result, we're now in a slight positive net cash position versus a net debt position last year of $796 million. Keeping a tight grip on costs and expenses was a year-long priority. Terry has discussed revenues and margins, so I'll concentrate on providing some additional color on expenses.For purposes of this discussion, I'll deal with adjusted expenses, which represent reported expenses adjusted to exclude restructuring charges in both years, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Adjusted expenses are shown on Exhibit 3 of the press release.Despite increases in incentive compensation, consolidated adjusted expenses at segment expenses, gross corporate expense declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. Now if you will exclude the impact of currency, adjusted expenses declined 3.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year.Now let's look on a segment basis. For McGraw-Hill Education, adjusted expenses declined 4.2% in the fourth quarter and 8.4% for the year. At constant currencies, adjusted expenses declined 6.2% in the fourth quarter and 7.3% for the full year. Full year expenses declined despite higher incentive compensation as declining revenue opportunities resulted in lower cost of sales and in reduced selling and marketing costs. This segment also benefited from savings from previous restructuring actions. For 2010, we expect McGraw-Hill Education expenses to increase 7% to 8% versus 2009 adjusted expense. Expense growth is driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs given the robust new state adoption opportunities that Terry mentioned. As I have mentioned in the past, we incur significant promotion and marketing expense in the first year of a new adoption. Profit contribution increases in the subsequent years from residual sales. Additionally, we are investing in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at Higher Educational and Professional in order to provide value and choices for our customers. The expense growth is partially mitigated by savings from our second quarter 2009 action to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 10.3% in the fourth quarter and 1.6% for the full year. For the constant currencies, adjusted expense increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. The full year expense growth was driven by increases in incentive compensation and compliance costs, mitigated by the benefits of restructuring, tight expense control and the impact of divestitures.For 2010, we expect expenses to increase roughly 9% to 10% versus 2009 adjusted expense. The expense growth is largely driven by continued investments in our fast growing businesses, the carry over impact of 2009 new staff hires and planned new hires in 2010 and additional investment to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.For the full year 2009, costs related to regulatory and compliance initiatives resulted in approximately $20 million of additional costs versus 2008. Our expense guidance assumes a comparable increase in 2010, though this is obviously highly dependent on the final form of regulation. For Information & Media, adjusted expenses declined 12.1% in the fourth quarter and 8.7% for the full year. At constant currencies, adjusted expenses declined 12.7% in the fourth quarter and 7.9% for the full year. Restructuring savings and lower cost of sales due to reduced revenue were key drivers for the full year expense decline. Fourth quarter expense of course benefited from the divestiture of BusinessWeek.For 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. You will recall from our third quarter call that we expected the BusinessWeek divestiture to benefit 2010 pretax profit by approximately $20 million to $25 million. We refined our estimate now, and expect the benefit to be roughly $25 million. Information & Media, the segment I'm referring to now, will actually reflect savings from the BusinessWeek divestiture of $38 million, as we manage vacant space and certain other support costs within corporate expense, which is increasing by approximately $13 million due to the divestiture.As we've indicated on previous calls, Information & Media's 2009 results were negatively impacted by the non-cash accounting impact of converting studies on to Compass, J.D. Power's online reporting and analytical tool. Revenue previously recognized at the time of our syndicated studies' release will now be recognized ratably over the 12-month life of the subscription. And this again, of course, is similar to the Sweets transition activity in 2006. For the full year, there was an $11 million decrease in revenue and $7 million decrease in profit due to the impact of Compass. In 2010, we expect all customers to be accessing this digital delivery platform, and the impact in 2010 is expected to be similar to 2009. Corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $36.4 million, a $7.4 million increase versus the previous year excluding the 2008 restructuring charge. The increase was primarily driven by a $10.3 million increase in incentive compensation. For the year, excluding the 2009 restructuring charge, expenses were up $21 million driven by a $23 million increase in incentive compensation. For 2010, we expect corporate expense to increase $25 million to $30 million. The primary reason for the increase is driven by higher excess space in New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as excess space generated from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.Incentive compensation has increased in previous quarters, and again in the fourth quarter when compared to a depressed 2008. Incentive compensation increased by $96 million for the full year 2009 and approximately $57 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by stronger than anticipated results and reversals taken in accruals in the previous year. For 2010, incentive compensation should now grow in normal patterns with projected performance. However, stock-based compensation is expected to reach about $50 million compared to $22.3 million in 2009, and that's due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off of course a depressed base.Foreign exchange had a significant impact in our operating results in 2009. For nine months, foreign exchange decreased revenue and expense but had a minimal impact on profits. In the fourth quarter, the trend reversed, benefiting revenue by almost $26 million while increasing expenses by $36 million, result in operating profits declining by about $10.5 million. For the year, foreign exchange decreased revenue by $70.4 million, and expense by almost $61 million resulting in a decline in operating profit of $9.5 million.Prudent management of investments and tight cost controls contributed to a strong free cash flow performance. For the year, free cash flow was $770 million compared to $503 million in 2008. We define free cash flow in the following manner. We start with cash provided by operations per GAAP cash flow statement. And then we then substract the following items, which would be pre-publication investments, purchases of property and equipment, additions to technology projects and dividends paid to our shareholders. The result is free cash flow that would then be available for acquisitions, share repurchases or to pay down debt.I'll spend a moment reviewing the changes in free cash flow in 2009 compared to 2008. As the table highlights, cash provided by operation increased $152 million over 2008 despite a reduction in net income. The primary drivers of the strong free cash flow were: A significant reduction in cash incentive compensation payments; lower inventory purchases reflecting decreased revenue opportunities from McGraw-Hill Education; significant improvement in accounts receivable collections generating $50 million as the company's days sales outstanding was reduced by nine days; and of course, investments declined $116 million primarily driven by a reduction in prepublication cost of $77 million, reflecting the continuing efficiency gains and the development process as well as lower investments due to a later adoption calendar.Based on our operating performance or on guidance, I should say, for 2010, we anticipate free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $600 million. Reduction in the free cash flow versus 2009 is due largely to more challenging working capital comparisons, as well as increased investments that I'll discuss in just a moment. We took advantage of our strong free cash flow to contribute approximately $50 million to our U.S. pension plan. The U.S. plan continues to be in underfunded position following the significant market declines in 2008, though it has improved since last year end. Based on current projections, we anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. However, we do expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $20 million in 2010. Our strong cash flow generation and balance sheet leave us well positioned to fund investments, and return cash to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility. Last week, we announced a 4.4% increase in our dividend, the 37 straight increase. We're one of few within 30 companies in S&P 500 that can make that statement. We also announced that we plan to resume share repurchases, as our $17.1 million shares remaining from the 2007 authorization from the Board of Directors. Unlike previous years, we have not indicated either a share or a dollar repurchase target for the year. I reiterate, it is our plan to resume the program. But the economic environment remains uncertain, so we'll watch this carefully and determine when we will commence share repurchases. We plan to increase our investments in 2010 to take advantage of the opportunities we see in our growing global markets.Prepublication investments for 2010 are expected to be $225 million to $235 million versus $177 million in 2009, primarily due to opportunities in the growing state new adoption market. Purchases of property and equipment for 2010 are projected at $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and largely due to increased technology spending.Let's now review our non-cash items. For 2010, we expect amortization of prepublication costs to be $260 million to $265 million versus $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the lower level of investments made in 2009. We expect depreciation to grow to $120 million in 2010 versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $16 million in the fourth quarter due to the acceleration of the amortization of certain acquired intangibles. That brought the total for 2009 to almost $53 million. For 2010, we expect amortization to decline and to be approximately in the $40 million range. The decline is due to the accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in 2009 as well as other items being fully amortized also in 2009.Our fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $314.5 million in the fourth quarter, a $1.6 million share increase versus the same period last year, and a $0.8 million share increase from the third quarter of 2009. Full year WASO was 313.3 million shares, a 5.4 million share year-over-year decline, driven largely by the full year impact of the 2008 share repurchases. Fully-diluted shares at the end of 2009 were approximately 315 million.Interest expense was $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to $15.4 million in the same period last year, and $17.8 million in the third quarter. For the full year, interest expense was $77 million compared to $75.6 million in 2008, and we expect 2009 to be roughly comparable to 2009. Regarding the company's effective tax rate, we finished 2009 with a full year rate of 36.4%, and we expect the comparable rate in 2010.I'll end with a recap of growth in unearned revenue. Unearned revenue ended 2009 at $1.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and including the impact of divestitures, that most notably BusinessWeek, it grew 2.8%. Financial Services makes up 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. Financial Services unearned revenue was roughly flat, as strong growth for subscription products including RatingsDirect was offset by reductions in equity research C to D [ph] (1:09:54) and of the independent equity research settlement, as well as declines driven by lower Structured Finance revenues.While comparatively small, McGraw-Hill Education's strong unearned revenue growth was driven by an increase in subscription-based [ph] (1:10:09) products particularly at Higher Education, where digital products are growing at a double-digit rate. For 2010, we expect a mid- single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry."

So we're probably looking a little less than that, so mid-single digits. Residuals will also be a little bit soft, again given some of the new adoption activity of 2008 and 2009. And of course, the bright spot is the new adoption opportunities for this year. But right now, unless we see some changes in all of that, we see that a decline in the open territories and residuals on that part. And again, probably mid-single digits on both of those. New adoptions in 2009 are probably similar between $500 million and $510 million. We're looking for $925 million to $975 million for new adoptions in 2010.

Again we have it somewhere around mid-single digit decline and if it's a little bit more, that might put a little bit more pressure on us on that part.

Remember the amortization cost, it really is a multi-year amortization schedule depending upon the type of product that we're creating. For K-12, it's generally five years. Some of the digits for Higher Education, it can range anywhere from four years. Some of the digits down to two years, some of the digits on Professional faster. So it's a mixture of a number of properties. I think the point that we're making here is that the marketing cost, the complementary copies prepub [ph] (1:27:52) costs are much more robust in the first year of an adoption. In order to secure that 30% plus share that we're after, we're going to be very aggressive in that marketplace.

As Don said, with me today is Bob Bahash, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. We will start today by reviewing the fourth quarter operating results, and then we'll move on to the prospects for 2010. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials. After the presentation, as Don said, we'll be pleased to address any comments or questions about The McGraw-Hill Companies that you may have. Let's get started.  Earlier today, we reported a 43.2% increase in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the fourth quarter included a pretax gain of $10.5 million or $0.02 on the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December. That compares with $0.37 last year, which included a restructuring charge of $0.05 per diluted share. Revenue increased by 3.3% in the fourth quarter.The fourth quarter results marked the first quarterly increases in diluted earnings per share and revenue for The McGraw-Hill Companies since the third quarter of 2007. These results set the stage for more growth in 2010. Our assessment of improving prospects is reflected in the guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share for 2010.We're encouraged by the improvement in the economy, which has finally begun to recover, albeit at a modest pace. Financial markets are definitely improving. Bond spreads have narrowed. Interest rates remain low. Our Chief Accountant at Standard & Poor's, David Wyss, believes no tightening by the Federal Reserve is likely before this summer and perhaps not until after the November elections. We expect a better year in our education markets.Last week, the Board of Directors underscored its confidence in our financial strength and growth prospects by increasing the dividend by 4.4% and announcing the corporation's intention to resume share repurchases this year. We will buy back, over time, the 17.1 million shares remaining in the program that was authorized by the Board in 2007. We have now increased the dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. Since 1974, the dividend has grown at an average compound annual rate of 9.9%. Since 1996, we have returned approximately $9.4 billion to shareholders, and that's through dividends as well as stock buybacks.With that as an overview, let's take a closer look at our operations and the prospects for 2010. And we'll start with the McGraw-Hill Education.  A solid finish in the key education markets helped produce an upswing in the fourth quarter performance at McGraw-Hill Education. In the fourth quarter for McGraw-Hill Education, revenue increased by 2.6%. Operating profit was $33.5 million, and that compares to a loss of $12.7 million in 2008, which included a restructuring charge of $11.4 million. The operating margin was 6.4%. Including restructuring charges of $11.6 million, the operating margin for 2009 was 11.6%. Excluding the restructuring charges, the operating margin was 12%.In 2009, Education has been a tale of two markets, a steady decline in the elementary-high school sales and growth in the U.S. college and university market. But as this bar chart shows, revenue started improving in the el-hi market in September and kept growing in October and November. And while we don't have AAP [Association of American Publishers] figures for December, we expect to see another increase in sales.  Despite the recent gains, industry revenue will be down about 15% in 2009, far better than the previous expectations of a decline of 20% or more.In this challenging environment, we still captured 30% of total available dollars in the state new adoption market, which will close out the year in the $500 million to $510 million range. That's about a 50% decline, by the way, from the 2008 state new adoption market. And we also won a 30% market share in 2008.In the fourth quarter, state allocations that reached local districts later than usual in some regions, together with the arrival of some Federal stimulus funds, helped produce the pick up in ordering. We caught the wave with our Basel products and our intervention program, which benefited from the incremental Title 1 and IDEA funding for disadvantaged and special education students respectively, provided in the stimulus package.But these gains were offset by a substantial decline in Testing. The result was a 7.6% decrease in fourth quarter revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group. The major region for this decline was testing and was the managed phaseout of the statewide summative contracts in Arizona, California and Florida as part of a more selective approach to the custom testing market.  In rebalancing the Testing business, we're increasing our focus on the expanding formative market and the non-custom or off-the-shelf market, while decreasing our emphasis on lower-margin custom contracts.We continue to win summative contracts with a selective-bidding strategy. In the fourth quarter, we were awarded contracts in North Dakota, Alabama, Indiana and New York State. Acuity, which is our formative testing program, continues to show solid growth, retaining existing subscription customers and adding new ones. New York City, the largest school district in the nation, is now in the third year of its Acuity contract, and Philadelphia has signed on for the start of the new school year. These are multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts. Many district-level opportunities for the new business are in the pipeline for 2010.  Some states have also included the introduction or the expanded use of Acuity in their applications for the Federal Race to the Top funding.Growth in the el-hi market in 2010 hinges on substantial increase in state new adoption opportunities. We estimate that the state new adoption market this year will be in the $925 million to the $975 million range. Given state budget pressures, we expect industry sales in the open territory to decline in 2010. We also expect a decline in residual sales in the adoption states, which usually fall off in a strong state new adoption year. But given the strength of the state new adoption schedule, we think the el-hi market could grow now in the 6% to 7% range off of 2009's low base.  Texas and Florida, of course, are the key adoption states in 2010, and we are well positioned in both. The Florida legislative session starts in March. Senate and House leaders have given early indications of full support for funding K-12 instructional materials. Mass [Massachusetts] is scheduled to buy K-12 math this year. The state recently adopted new math standards, which essentially is obsolete books now in the classroom. Adoption activity in Florida is already very brisk at the district level, something we did not see at this time last year when the state still planned to buy literature. Texas returns to the market this year with funding already in place for a K-12 reading and literature adoption. The state legislature has appropriated $465 million for the adoption. We continue to see evidence of pent-up demand in the market, but budget pressures also remain until the economic recovery is further along.We may also see some purchasing postponed from 2009 in adoption states like California. Funding levels in California remain uncertain, but some districts may buy K-8 reading programs as part of the second year of that adoption. There are also some potential for math sales at the middle school, that's grades six through eight, and high school, grades nine through 12. The Governor's budget proposal for the 2010-2011 fiscal year calls for $332.5 million for instructional materials, which is flat with 2009. We are following this situation closely, and we'll keep you updated on the developments there.A solid 2009 performance in Higher Education culminated with a surge in second semester ordering late in the year. We don't have the final 2009 figures, but it now appears that the industry is going to outstrip our 8% to 10% growth estimate. Revenue in the fourth quarter at our Higher Educational, Professional and International Group grew by 7.5%. We expect the U.S. college market to grow in the 5% to 7% range in 2010.A surge in enrollments helped drive industry growth in 2009 and is going to do so again in 2010, although probably not at the same pace. Based on a number of surveys and reports, we estimate the most rapid rate of growth was concentrated in two-year colleges and career colleges. We saw the benefits in career education. It was the fastest-growing imprint in our Higher Education line up in 2009.  All our major imprints grew in 2009 and are expected to do so again in 2010. Fourth quarter and full year digital sales increased at double-digit rates. It includes e-books, online courses and online study tools for students, including McGraw-Hill Connect, the industry's most advanced interactive platform. There's clearly acceleration in the pace of integrating content, technology and distribution, and we will take full advantage of the rapidly-evolving digital opportunity. There is growing momentum in the e-book market, and that's evidenced by the almost daily announcement of new devices and new formats. We will continue to look for optimal ways to deliver data and source files for each of these devices. And in the near future, you will undoubtedly see a McGraw-Hill e-book for the college market running on an Apple Tablet.All our titles on CourseSmart, the industry e-book consortium, are already available to students on an iPhone operating system. That's because CourseSmart developed an iPhone application last summer with the support from Apple. The goal was to have core educational content available on the iPhone operating system, which also makes it possible for e-books to run on new Apple devices using that system, such as the Tablet.Consider the Apple Tablet computer, which will be introduced shortly. There is a lot of secrecy about the introduction, but many expect that the Apple device will use the iPhone operating system. If that's the case, and we believe it is, we are confident that our CourseSmart e-books should run well right out of the box on any Apple Tablet. Stay tuned.I should also point out that CourseSmart does not share revenue with Apple. For a student to access our e-books, they must subscribe to CourseSmart or its college bookstore partners. The e-textbooks feature the iPhone application, and it lets students access our titles on a device that runs on the iPhone operating system. That application is free to subscribers.  About 95% of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education current titles are available as e-books, with interactive features, including search and note-taking functionalities.  Digital publishing is also a bright spot in our Professional market, with subscriptions to our services growing at a consistent double-digit pace, and we continue to innovate in this space.In the first quarter of 2010, we will launch AccessPhysiotherapy, the sixth vertical or specialty site in the AccessMedicine family of online medication information subscription sites. The new specialty offers an excellent opportunity to broaden the market for the respected Access brand beyond medical education and clinical practice to the allied health field. Our Professional Business Group will also launch more digital products in the first quarter. Kiss, Bow or Shake Hands is a new subscription-based reference for international business etiquette. Clearly, that's a digital product with widespread global appeal. Change is coming rapidly in our markets. Growth in the digital world will be transformational. For the prepared, it will unlock huge new opportunities. We are not waiting for a tipping point. That means we will continue to ramp up our investments in learning platforms and content management capabilities to stay ahead of the curve in creating the next generation of innovative products and programs.  The increase in marketing and sales expenses associated with a robust state new adoption schedule will also put some pressure on operating margins in 2010. Let's sum up then for the McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key education markets, 6% to 7% increase in the elementary-high school market, 5 to 7% growth in the U.S. college and university market, revenue growth for the segment at 7% to 8% level and operating margins unchanged from 2009.With that, let's go on over to Financial Services. And in Financial Services, improving conditions in the financial market, marked by the narrowing spreads, low interest rates and a growing investor appetite for yield, were important factors in the strong finish this year. In the fourth quarter for Financial Services, revenue increased by 10.6%. Operating profit grew by 14.6%, and the operating margin was 36.3%. Excluding the loss of a divestiture of Vista Research and the net restructuring charge, the segment's operating margin for the year was 39.4%.This 2009, operating margin also reflects the cost of compliance to meet the increased regulation of Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services. The improvement in 2009 in investment-grade industrials and high-yield issuance culminated in a 19.4% increase in fourth quarter revenue against the easiest comparisons of the year at Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services.In the United States, we saw 181 industrials issued with a par value of $93 billion compared to 94 deals with a par value of $78.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. That's a 92.6% increase in the number of issues and a 19% increase in the par value of the issuance.  There were 101 high-yield industrial and financial institution issues for $44.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to three for  $1.3 billion for in the same period in 2008, obviously tremendous improvement.  In Europe, the dollar value of industrial issuance was $93.6 billion, up 36.9% in the fourth quarter. That represented 154 deals, an increase of 46.7%.  And there were 27 high-yield deals in the fourth quarter 2009 in Europe and none in the same period of 2008, obviously a clear pick up.All this activity helped produce a 62.5% increase in the fourth quarter transaction revenue at S&P Credit Market Services. For 2009, transaction revenue was up 0.2% after being down 20.2% for the first six months.  Non-transaction revenue, which represented 69.2% of S&P Credit Market Services total revenue in 2009, grew by 6% in the fourth quarter to finish the year at just over $1.2 billion. It was the first quarterly increase in non-transaction revenue in 2009.This continues to be a durable revenue stream. It includes annual and surveillance fees and subscription revenue. If you back out the impact of brokerage fees, non-transaction revenue grew by 2% in 2009 instead of the reported decline of 0.6%. We expect growth in 2010 in transaction and non-transaction revenue for the S&P Credit Market Services, and we expect growth in domestic and international markets in 2010.International markets finished strongly in 2009. S&P Credit Market Services international revenue in the fourth quarter was up 17.7%. And all regions, Europe, Canada, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, grew in the fourth quarter and provided 49.4% of total revenue. Improving financial market conditions are clearly making the difference in the worldwide outlook for S&P Credit Market Services. Consider the changes in spreads. Spreads to U.S. treasuries, always a key factor in the level of issuance, are continuing to narrow for investment and speculative-grade issues. As this table shows, since the record highs at the start of 2009, investment in speculative-grade spreads have tightened and are near the range of their five-year daily moving averages. Spreads continue to tighten in January, another indication of why the month is off to a good start. That's a reflection of optimistic sentiment in the credit markets and an expectation of some stabilization in credit quality.  The spread between the three month LIBOR and the Federal Reserve's overnight rate, this is a key gauge of how banks assess the riskiness of lending to one another, and it is down to 0.25%.We have also seen spread contraction across the major consumer asset-backed securities during 2009. And as this table shows, the spreads narrowed dramatically in autos, credit cards and student loans. S&P expects further contraction in credit spreads this year.There are other important favorable trends in the credit markets. There is a strong demand for non-financial institution paper by investors who want to diversify their portfolio. Investors have already demonstrated that they are increasingly comfortable in buying low-rated bonds. In the fourth quarter of 2009, 60% of speculative-grade issuance was rated at single B+ or below. In corporates, the high-yield bond market has become more attractive than the leveraged loan market and companies with riskier credits are lining up to tap it. Some issuers choose speculative-grade bonds because covenants are less restrictive and in some cases, maturities are longer. Because it is widely expected that corporate borrowing costs will increase as the economy improves, some non-financial firms are borrowing now to repay expensive debt, including commercial paper, as well as bank loans. Some companies are beefing up their balance sheets with an eye on merger and acquisition activity or buying new equipment. The deleveraging of financial institutions is another factor in credit market, as these institutions shrink the liabilities on their balance sheet and tightening lending standards, credit availability is declining systemically. Limited availability of bank loan funding will result in a greater reliance on the primary bond market.  S&P believes that 2010 may offer a window of opportunity for refinancing debt. Refinancing of current and future maturities was robust in 2009 and should be again in 2010.  Above 1/3 of the estimated $300 billion coming due in 2010 was refinanced in 2009. Let me repeat that about 1/3 of the estimated $300 billion coming due in 2010 was refinanced in 2009. There is a dramatic rise in corporate debt coming due from 2011 through 2014. It's estimated to be $2 trillion. Some of that debt may be refinanced in 2010, adding to the remaining $200 billion that is coming due this year.In Public Finance, 2009 was a solid year and 2010 looks even better. Municipalities sold the second heaviest volume of debt in 2009, $468.3 billion, $468.3 billion. The all-time record, by the way, was  $468.4 billion, and that was set in 2007.The biggest factor boosting issuance here was the Building America Bonds (sic) [Build America Bonds] program, which authorized municipalities to sell taxable debt and receive a Federal subsidy equal to 35% of their interest cost. Munis sold $84 billion in taxable debt in 2009, about 18% of total issuance.S&P expects sales of taxable bonds to help drive growth in this market in 2010, although tax-exempt securities will continue to comprise the largest share of overall issuance. Lower tax receipts and added expenses for pensions and infrastructure need should keep state and local government active in this market.The outlook for structured finance in 2010 remains more problematic, with asset-backed securities showing the most promise. In the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market, we expect to see a continuation of the re-REMIC [Resecuritization of Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Securities] activity in 2010, as financial institutions continue to seek ways to improve balance sheet capital requirements. In the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, we saw small but marked  note of confidence as issuers bought single-borrower instruments to market in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the near term, S&P expects very modest pick up in the activity of this part of the market.The asset-backed securities market continues to be a positive story. Volume began to grow last March as the TALF stimulus program took hold. By the end of 2009, there was activity outside of the TALF program. Dollar volume issuance in the U.S. market grew by 179.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009.Although our outlook for the U.S. asset-backed securities issuance is relatively flat in 2010, there is a healthy pipeline as we move into the first quarter with a good mix of TALF and non-TALF activity. Tighter spreads have limited the economic incentives for using TALF leverage for many issuers. The collateralized debt obligation market will continue to be soft in 2010.About 33% of Financial Services revenue was produced last year by Standard & Poor's Investment Services. Fourth quarter revenue was down 4.8% in 2009 but was down only 1.7%, excluding divestitures. For the full year 2009, revenue declined 4.2% to $861.9 million but was off 1.5% if you exclude divestitures. The expiration of the Independent Equity Research Settlement in July also was a factor in the fall off in revenue. But in some key markets, the year ended strongly. A new high of $247 billion was established at the end of 2009 for assets under management based on S&P indices. The previous high was $235.3 billion, and that was set at the end of 2007. From a small family of equity indices, S&P has expanded into commodities, fixed income real estate, custom, thematic indices. S&P indices have successful relationships with exchanges literally around the world. At the end of 2009, there were 217 exchange-traded funds based on S&P indices. Five were added in the fourth quarter and more are coming in 2010, and they will be in the areas of commodities, equities, fixed income and alternative investments.  It is our strategic goal to provide an S&P index for every type of investment. And in 2009, S&P introduced 90 new indices. And we expect more new products and more growth from S&P indices  in 2010.In the challenging market, Capital IQ added new clients in 2009 to end the year with more than 2,900, an increase of 9.9% for the year. Sales to new customers and increases from current customers are expected to produce another year of growth for Capital IQ in 2010. With more growth from S&P indices and Capital IQ, we expect revenue to increase in 2010 at S&P Investment Services. The divestiture of Vista in May of 2009 and the expiration of the Research Settlement last July will be mitigating factors in the first part of the year.Let's complete our review of the Financial Services with a few comments on the current legal and regulatory situation. The regulatory situation is still evolving, and we continue to strive for global consistency, trying to avoid a patchwork of regulatory frameworks. This is very, very important. The good news is that we're getting close to the finish line on global regulation.In November, the European Union issued its final regulation for credit rating agencies. By next September, S&P will need to apply for registration in Europe. Regulations are being developed in Europe by the Committee of European Security Regulators (sic) [Committee of European Securities Regulators] better known as CESR. We are following that process closely. In general, the proposed regulations are based on the International Organization of Security Commissions' (sic) [International Organization of Securities Commissions'] Code of Conduct, that's IOSCO out of Madrid. And that's a very good thing for them to take the leadership in terms of providing those Code of Conduct principles.Starting on January 1, 2010, S&P has been licensed in Australia to provide its ratings to wholesale investors. We continue to work with regulators in Canada, Japan and India. In the United States, both the House and Senate continue to consider regulation of the rating agencies as part of the omnibus financial markets reform legislation. We continue to work with Congress on draft legislation. We're somewhat concerned that proposed discriminatory liability standards would create an uneven playing field and have unintended consequences for financial markets.In the legal arena, there's not much to report. In the underwriter cases, we continue to make applications seeking dismissal, and oral arguments have been proceeding in several of them. In the stock drop suits, motions to dismiss have been fully briefed, and oral arguments have been held in two of these cases. In the state law claim cases, we also are making applications or awaiting decisions on motions to dismiss. We're in the discovery phase of the Abu Dhabi case.Summing up then for Financial Services, in 2010, there will be a return to growth and revenue at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services. The segments' operating profits will grow, but there will be pressure on margins, as S&P makes investments in the infrastructure of its business to support future growth and to comply with new regulatory requirement.The majority of these costs support the Credit Ratings business. They include investments in surveillance systems and the infrastructure for quality, criteria, compliance, as well as risk management. We will also continue to invest in key S&P Investment Services business so that they are well positioned to take advantage of an improving market.There's an additional factor. S&P Investment Services is primarily subscription based. In a challenging market in 2009, the S&P Investment Services added fewer net subscribers than in 2008, and that will have some impact on revenue in 2010. Prospects look good for increasing net subscribers this year, which will lead to a more favorable impact on revenue in 2011. Revenue for this segment is expected to grow in the high-single digits. Operating margins will decline about 100 basis points.Now let's shift over to Information & Media. In that area, continued strength in the global energy markets, a soft advertising market and the divestiture of BusinessWeek were major factors in the fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter for Information & Media, revenue declined 11.4%. Including a pretax gain of $10.5 million from the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December, operating profit increased 40.6%. However, excluding a pretax gain on the sale of BusinessWeek and a prior-year restructuring charge, operating profit declined 6.8%.  The operating margin was 18.1% compared to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Reflecting the gain on the sale of BusinessWeek, the operating margin for the year was 9.7%, but excluding the gain and the 2009 restructuring charge of $4 million, it was 9%.The weak advertising market and problems in the automotive sector were evident in the 9.5% revenue decline in our Business-to-Business Group in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group was off 26.6% in the fourth quarter, and obviously especially with the absence of political advertising.  In 2009, advertising represented approximately 3.5% of total corporation revenue, down from 4% in 2008. Virtually, all of it is in this segment. With the sale of BusinessWeek, our exposure to this cyclical advertising market will be reduced to approximately 2% in 2010.Political advertising in the Broadcasting Group will be a positive factor in 2010. There are U.S. Senate and House races in Indiana, Colorado, California. There will also be races for governor in Colorado and California, plus spending on issues and propositions. The outlook for political spending on local television stations also got a boost from last week's U.S. Supreme Court decision to remove campaign spending restrictions from corporations. The Broadcasting Group also recently renewed its affiliation agreement with ABC. The new agreement will have adverse but immaterial impact on the segment's future revenue and profitability.With all the reporting on problems of the big three auto companies in Detroit, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that J.D. Power operates successfully in a recovering global automotive market. Here's a snapshot of J.D. Power's latest forecast for the global market. Global light vehicle sales are expected to rise to 65 million units, and that's an increase of 1.6% over 2009 after a decline of 3.1% last year.  Growth continues in China, an increasingly-important market for J.D. Power. The recovery begins in North America, with volume up 10% to 13.9 million units in 2010.J.D. Power will also complete the migration of its syndicated study deliverables to an online platform, which will reduce cost and improve the quality and the utility of its research data. The digital transformation of this segment will continue to be a plus in 2010. Business-to-Business digital revenue grew again in 2009 and now represents more than half of the B2B Group sales in 2009. In 2008, it was under 50% of the B2B Group's revenue.Platts continues its global expansion, strengthening its benchmark status and core commodity market. Platts has launched the series of new oil price benchmarks for Indian markets. In December, Platts announced the launch of the new price assessment for the very first Russian petroleum stream that's flowing through the Eastern Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline for Asian markets.It's an interesting example of how Platts keeps abreast of the developments in this market. The pipeline, rail and port facilities in Russia's Far East provide the country with the logistics to target increasing amounts of oil to Asia rather than to the West. Over time, the operation is well positioned to serve the market as a major price indicator of spot oil values in the Far East. The exports are set to grow, and the oil has wide equity ownership, key elements for an emerging benchmark.Summing up then for Information & Media, the sale of BusinessWeek will impact revenue and operating margin in 2010. Revenue will decline in the middle single-digits, but excluding the $100 million from the BusinessWeek divestiture, revenue will increase in the mid single-digit range. Operating margins will rebound climbing into the mid-teens.Okay that completes our review of the three operating segments and the outlook for the segments in 2010. For The McGraw-Hill Companies, we expect diluted earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65 in 2010. Okay, let's hold it there. Let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, and let's get the inside detail on some of the financials. Bob?"
21719,84102535,46988,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2010",2010-01-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Terry. A major focus during 2009 was our balance sheet management. We did that in order to maintain and enhance our strong financial position to ensure adequate and appropriate access to capital. This morning, I want to review how we main",2150,"Okay. Thank you, Terry. A major focus during 2009 was our balance sheet management. We did that in order to maintain and enhance our strong financial position to ensure adequate and appropriate access to capital. This morning, I want to review how we maintained and improved upon the corporation's financial strength in 2009. We'll also look at our plans for this year 2010.So we start 2010 in a strong financial position. Due to a very strong free cash flow, we ended 2009 with cash and short-term investments of $1.23 billion. Total debt at year-end was $1.2 billion. This comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes, and there was no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2009. So as a result, we're now in a slight positive net cash position versus a net debt position last year of $796 million. Keeping a tight grip on costs and expenses was a year-long priority. Terry has discussed revenues and margins, so I'll concentrate on providing some additional color on expenses.For purposes of this discussion, I'll deal with adjusted expenses, which represent reported expenses adjusted to exclude restructuring charges in both years, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Adjusted expenses are shown on Exhibit 3 of the press release.Despite increases in incentive compensation, consolidated adjusted expenses at segment expenses, gross corporate expense declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. Now if you will exclude the impact of currency, adjusted expenses declined 3.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year.Now let's look on a segment basis. For McGraw-Hill Education, adjusted expenses declined 4.2% in the fourth quarter and 8.4% for the year. At constant currencies, adjusted expenses declined 6.2% in the fourth quarter and 7.3% for the full year. Full year expenses declined despite higher incentive compensation as declining revenue opportunities resulted in lower cost of sales and in reduced selling and marketing costs. This segment also benefited from savings from previous restructuring actions. For 2010, we expect McGraw-Hill Education expenses to increase 7% to 8% versus 2009 adjusted expense. Expense growth is driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs given the robust new state adoption opportunities that Terry mentioned. As I have mentioned in the past, we incur significant promotion and marketing expense in the first year of a new adoption. Profit contribution increases in the subsequent years from residual sales. Additionally, we are investing in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at Higher Educational and Professional in order to provide value and choices for our customers. The expense growth is partially mitigated by savings from our second quarter 2009 action to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 10.3% in the fourth quarter and 1.6% for the full year. For the constant currencies, adjusted expense increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. The full year expense growth was driven by increases in incentive compensation and compliance costs, mitigated by the benefits of restructuring, tight expense control and the impact of divestitures.For 2010, we expect expenses to increase roughly 9% to 10% versus 2009 adjusted expense. The expense growth is largely driven by continued investments in our fast growing businesses, the carry over impact of 2009 new staff hires and planned new hires in 2010 and additional investment to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.For the full year 2009, costs related to regulatory and compliance initiatives resulted in approximately $20 million of additional costs versus 2008. Our expense guidance assumes a comparable increase in 2010, though this is obviously highly dependent on the final form of regulation. For Information & Media, adjusted expenses declined 12.1% in the fourth quarter and 8.7% for the full year. At constant currencies, adjusted expenses declined 12.7% in the fourth quarter and 7.9% for the full year. Restructuring savings and lower cost of sales due to reduced revenue were key drivers for the full year expense decline. Fourth quarter expense of course benefited from the divestiture of BusinessWeek.For 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. You will recall from our third quarter call that we expected the BusinessWeek divestiture to benefit 2010 pretax profit by approximately $20 million to $25 million. We refined our estimate now, and expect the benefit to be roughly $25 million. Information & Media, the segment I'm referring to now, will actually reflect savings from the BusinessWeek divestiture of $38 million, as we manage vacant space and certain other support costs within corporate expense, which is increasing by approximately $13 million due to the divestiture.As we've indicated on previous calls, Information & Media's 2009 results were negatively impacted by the non-cash accounting impact of converting studies on to Compass, J.D. Power's online reporting and analytical tool. Revenue previously recognized at the time of our syndicated studies' release will now be recognized ratably over the 12-month life of the subscription. And this again, of course, is similar to the Sweets transition activity in 2006. For the full year, there was an $11 million decrease in revenue and $7 million decrease in profit due to the impact of Compass. In 2010, we expect all customers to be accessing this digital delivery platform, and the impact in 2010 is expected to be similar to 2009. Corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $36.4 million, a $7.4 million increase versus the previous year excluding the 2008 restructuring charge. The increase was primarily driven by a $10.3 million increase in incentive compensation. For the year, excluding the 2008 restructuring charge, expenses were up $21 million driven by a $23 million increase in incentive compensation. For 2010, we expect corporate expense to increase $25 million to $30 million. The primary reason for the increase is driven by higher excess space in New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as excess space generated from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.Incentive compensation has increased in previous quarters, and again in the fourth quarter when compared to a depressed 2008. Incentive compensation increased by $96 million for the full year 2009 and approximately $57 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by stronger than anticipated results and reversals taken in accruals in the previous year. For 2010, incentive compensation should now grow in normal patterns with projected performance. However, stock-based compensation is expected to reach about $50 million compared to $22.3 million in 2009, and that's due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off, of course, a depressed base.Foreign exchange had a significant impact in our operating results in 2009. For nine months, foreign exchange decreased revenue and expense, but had a minimal impact on profits. In the fourth quarter, the trend reversed, benefiting revenue by almost $26 million while increasing expenses by $36 million, resulting in operating profits declining by about $10.5 million. For the year, foreign exchange decreased revenue by $70.4 million, and expense by almost $61 million resulting in a decline in operating profit of $9.5 million.Prudent management of investments and tight cost controls contributed to a strong free cash flow performance. For the year, free cash flow was $770 million compared to $503 million in 2008. We define free cash flow in the following manner. We start with cash provided by operations per GAAP cash flow statement. And then we then subtract the following items, which would be pre-publication investments, purchases of property and equipment, additions to technology projects and dividends paid to our shareholders. The result is free cash flow that would then be available for acquisitions, share repurchases or to pay down debt.I'll spend a moment reviewing the changes in free cash flow in 2009 compared to 2008. As the table highlights, cash provided by operation increased $152 million over 2008 despite a reduction in net income. The primary drivers of the strong free cash flow were: A significant reduction in cash incentive compensation payments; lower inventory purchases reflecting decreased revenue opportunities from McGraw-Hill Education; significant improvement in accounts receivable collections generating $50 million as the company's days sales outstanding was reduced by nine days; and of course, investments declined $116 million primarily driven by a reduction in prepublication cost of $77 million, reflecting the continuing efficiency gains and the development process as well as lower investments due to a later adoption calendar.Based on our operating performance or on guidance, I should say, for 2010, we anticipate free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $600 million. Reduction in the free cash flow versus 2009 is due largely to more challenging working capital comparisons, as well as increased investments that I'll discuss in just a moment. We took advantage of our strong free cash flow to contribute approximately $50 million to our U.S. pension plan. The U.S. plan continues to be in underfunded position following the significant market declines in 2008, though it has improved since last year end. Based on current projections, we anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. However, we do expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $20 million in 2010. Our strong cash flow generation and balance sheet leave us well positioned to fund investments, and return cash to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility. Last week, we announced a 4.4% increase in our dividend, the 37 straight increase. We're one of few within 30 companies in S&P 500 that can make that statement. We also announced that we plan to resume share repurchases, as our $17.1 million shares remaining from the 2007 authorization from the Board of Directors. Unlike previous years, we have not indicated either a share or a dollar repurchase target for the year. I reiterate, it is our plan to resume the program. But the economic environment remains uncertain, so we'll watch this carefully and determine when we will commence share repurchases. We plan to increase our investments in 2010 to take advantage of the opportunities we see in our growing global markets.Prepublication investments for 2010 are expected to be $225 million to $235 million versus $177 million in 2009, primarily due to opportunities in the growing state new adoption market. Purchases of property and equipment for 2010 are projected at $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and largely due to increased technology spending.Let's now review our non-cash items. For 2010, we expect amortization of prepublication costs to be $260 million to $265 million versus $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the lower level of investments made in 2009. We expect depreciation to grow to $120 million in 2010 versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $16 million in the fourth quarter due to the acceleration of the amortization of certain acquired intangibles. That brought the total for 2009 to almost $53 million. For 2010, we expect amortization to decline and to be approximately in the $40 million range. The decline is due to the accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in 2009 as well as other items being fully amortized also in 2009.Our fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $314.5 million in the fourth quarter, a $1.6 million share increase versus the same period last year, and a $0.8 million share increase from the third quarter of 2009. Full year WASO was 313.3 million shares, a 5.4 million share year-over-year decline, driven largely by the full year impact of the 2008 share repurchases. Fully-diluted shares at the end of 2009 were approximately 315 million.Interest expense was $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to $15.4 million in the same period last year, and $17.8 million in the third quarter. For the full year, interest expense was $77 million compared to $75.6 million in 2008, and we expect 2009 to be roughly comparable to 2009. Regarding the company's effective tax rate, we finished 2009 with a full year rate of 36.4%, and we expect the comparable rate in 2010.I'll end with a recap of growth in unearned revenue. Unearned revenue ended 2009 at $1.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and including the impact of divestitures, that most notably BusinessWeek, it grew 2.8%. Financial Services makes up 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. Financial Services unearned revenue was roughly flat, as strong growth for subscription products including RatingsDirect was offset by reductions in equity research C to D [ph] (1:09:54) and of the independent equity research settlement, as well as declines driven by lower Structured Finance revenues.While comparatively small, McGraw-Hill Education's strong unearned revenue growth was driven by an increase in subscription-based products particularly at Higher Education, where digital products are growing at a double-digit rate. For 2010, we expect mid- single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry."

And of course, the bright spot is the new adoption opportunities for this year. But right now, unless we see some changes in all of that, we see that a decline in the open territories and residuals on that part. And again, probably mid-single digits on both of those. New adoptions in 2009 are probably similar between $500 million and $510 million. We're looking for $925 million to $975 million for new adoptions in 2010.

Again we have it somewhere around mid-single digit decline and if it's a little bit more, that might put a little bit more pressure on us on that part.

And welcome to our review of the first quarter earnings and the outlook for the year. With me today is Bob Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

With me today is Bob Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And we're going to start today by reviewing our first quarter operating results and guidance for the segments and for the corporation. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials. And after the formal presentation, obviously, we'll be pleased to answer any questions or take comments that you may have about The McGraw-Hill Companies.
Earlier today, we reported a 65% increase in diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. That's $0.33 versus $0.20 for the same period last year. Revenue increased 3.7%, but excluding the divestitures of BusinessWeek and Vista Research, revenue grew by 6.7% in the first quarter.
When the 43.2% increase in the fourth quarter earnings per share was announced at the end of January, we said those results set the stage for more growth in 2010. Although the first quarter is seasonally the smallest of the year, we are obviously clearly off to a good start. 
The economy will continue to improve this year. Real GDP is expected to rise about 3% in 2010. We're encouraged by improvement in financial markets. Interest rates are expected to remain low. Bond spreads narrowed again in the first quarter. And we still expect growth in our key education markets. With that as an overview, let's now review operations and our prospects by each of the operating segments, and let's begin with the McGraw-Hill Education segment.
In higher education, it is called the echo effect, second semester ordering that echoes the pattern of the first semester orders from the previous summer. In this seasonally light first quarter for Education, we saw the favorable side of the echo effect as our higher education group once again reported solid results, including double-digit growth in digital products and services. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group grew by 8.3% in the first quarter to $205.7 million. Revenue from the McGraw-Hill School Education Group declined by 9% to $111.6 million in the first quarter. For McGraw-Hill Education in the first quarter, revenue increased by 1.5%, and the operating loss was cut by 19.3% to $61.8 million.  
The first quarter is typically a light one for McGraw-Hill School Education because of the seasonality of the market. It was accentuated this year in the state adoption market because North Carolina did not order. North Carolina is the only adoption state that usually makes substantial purchases of new materials before the end of March. It did so in 2008, again last year, but not in 2010.  As a result, most of the orders from adoption states in the first quarter were for supplemental, residual or intervention products. The adoption states were down slightly from last year but were offset by stronger results in the open territory. We benefited from large orders from school districts in Ohio, Maryland, South Dakota that initiated adoptions in 2009 but completed the purchasing earlier this year as funds became available. The increase in the sale of instructional materials in the first quarter was offset by a decline in the testing market, where we have elected to discontinue custom contracts in Florida, California and Arizona.
In a formative market, we continue to make progress with Acuity, our market-leading assessment program. It's early in the year and we're watching buying patterns closely. In some adoption state, local school districts have two years or even longer to purchase materials in what may be an indication of the way the stimulus funds are reaching districts. We have seen a year-over-year increase in industry sales for six consecutive months now. It started last September and has continued through February. That's not intuitive because historically, the fourth and first quarters are the slowest each year for the el-hi market. Based on early trends this year, we still expect that el-hi market to grow 6% to 7% in 2010, even though we are trimming our estimate for the state new adoption market.
As you know, previously we had forecasted this market to grow between $925 million and $975 million. We are now forecasting a slight decline in that, $875 million to $925 million, which still represents about an 80% year-over-year increase for the industry. Although no formal postponements were announced during the quarter, our reduced estimate for state new adoption right [ph] reflects pullbacks that have become apparent in several states.
In Indiana, which is officially adopting K-12 Math this year, the state Department of Education has recommended that districts delay purchasing until materials are available that align with the Common Core Standards, even though it will probably take the state several years to implement the instruction and assessments based on those standards.
The adoption has been funded, so it is difficult to gauge district response to this recommendation, but some effect is probable. As an aside, where common core standards or an issue, we have promised to provide online and print supplements to cover any concepts or skills not presented in accordance with those standards in the newly state-approved materials now being sold. As budget pressures drive more district level postponements than originally anticipated, we are also forecasting lower spending in several other adoption states including Georgia, California, Virginia and Kentucky.
In Florida, the math adoption is looking very solid at the K-5 level, but some districts are delaying high school math purchases for budgetary reasons. It is also a possibility that South Carolina will delay the implementation of its 9-12 math adoption. The reduction in this state new adoption market will be partially offset by higher residual sales in these states as districts buy replacement copies and consumable materials of their older programs. 
We still expect a low single-digit decline in the industry's open territory sales, we are seeing some district level postponements in the open territory, but the field sales force is also identifying new opportunities as the selling season develops and the outlook at this time is reasonably optimistic.
We continue to see pent-up demand in both the open territory and adoption states. Federal stimulus funding distributed last year helped some districts implement delayed adoptions in the second half of 2009, and will contribute to purchasing in 2010. But the budget pressures are real. So we will continue to monitor market developments carefully. It is early days in the battle for state new adoption dollars. And let me reassure you that our School Education Group is still aiming for a share of at least 30% or better this year.
In Testing, we continue to gain share in the market for formative assessments, which is largely made up at district level adoptions. We also see new opportunities ahead for both formative and summative testing as the winners of federal Race to the Top grants begin to implement their long-range plans, and as the movement towards common core standards and assessments continues to gain momentum.
As many of you know, the common core movement represents a cooperative effort among the states to agree upon concepts and skills in math and language arts, that all students should master at each grade level in order to meet internationally benchmarked criteria for college and career readiness. Drafts of the standards have been finalized and are now under review. 48 states plus the District of Columbia are taking part in this movement, which has been endorsed by the U.S. Department of Education. The only two states that are not included at this point are Texas and Alaska.
Applicants that declared their intention to adopt the standards by August of 2010, can earn extra points in the Race to the Top grant competition. Delaware and Tennessee have already won Phase I awards of $100 million and $500 million, respectively, and Phase II winners will be announced in September.  Each state will have four years in which to spend its award, half of which will be distributed as sub-grants to the local districts. Later this year, the Department of Education will also award a total of $350 million to multi-state consortia with winning proposals for developing new assessments based on Common Core Standards.
All this means is that we expect to see a very active market in the Testing business over the next few years, with RFPs coming from consortia, states and districts. McGraw-Hill with its outstanding reputation for psychometric research and its complete range of assessment and reporting capabilities will be well positioned to benefit from these new opportunities.
Present indications are that testing development work will begin in late 2010, or perhaps early 2011, and that common assessments will be implemented from 2012 through 2014. The common core movement has favorable implications for the instructional material side of our business as well. We can expect to see more purchasing as states adopt materials that incorporate the new standards. And we also anticipate delivering more content to the schools in digital form, because most of the states Race to the Top plans involve building out their technology infrastructures. 
We should also see cost-savings in content development as there'll be less need for obviously state-by-state customization in the common core environment.
In Higher Education, we continue to benefit from increased enrolments. According to our own survey and information from other sources, enrollments for the spring semester held steady with the gains recorded last fall. We believe that federal stimulus dollars also helped to increase enrollments last fall and did so again this year, although the effect is not easily measurable. The funding has gone to students in the form of increased Pell Grants, higher allowable tax deductions for college-related expenses and the new post-9/11 GI Bill that is provided educational subsidies for more than 150,000 veterans since the fall of 2009. 
Student Aid got another boost in March when Congress passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. It includes provisions to keep the Pell Grant programs solvent, and to continue increasing the maximum awards from $5,550 this year to $5,975 in 2017.
In the U.S. college and university markets, students are embracing our digital products at a record pace. We saw strong growth in the usage of McGraw-Hill Connect, that's our new homework management and assessment platform, and implementations of our online courses and in purchases of e-books. We now have more than 1.2 million registered users of McGraw-Hill Connect and our other digital study and homework management products with more to come. In fact, McGraw-Hill Connect will add an additional 170 courses in 2010.
Creating original, media-rich digital products in all of our market is a priority. In the first quarter, we introduced our first digital subscription products for the professional business market. They are Kiss, Bow or Shake Hands, a global business etiquette database with information on customs in more than 60 countries. And another one is Perfect Phrases for Managers, a performance support tool, based on a series of successful McGraw-Hill books that helps managers find the right phrase at the right time.
For on-the-spot convenience, these products can be downloaded to virtually any digital device. Also for the business market, we launched a program called Select, e-chapters in an instant. This program enables customers to downloads of chapters from our best-selling business books as standalone items. More than 750 chapters are currently available from major titles in finance and investing.
In Medicine, we added a six-specialty site to our internationally successful Access Medicines Suite. It's called Access Physiotherapy and broadens our addressable market by going beyond medical education and clinical practice, and it goes into the allied health field. It is a powerful new site providing searchable access to our leading physical therapy and internal medicine titles, interactive imaging content, curricular management tracking tools and tests, and more than 80 videos and exclusive lectures.
We are also broadening our market geographically by signing a partnership agreement with the Chinese Education and Research Network, which will make our Access Suite of products available for the first time to Chinese students, educators and researchers. Just more fuel for the double-digit growth. Our digital products are already producing in professional markets.
Let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key education markets in 2010, 6% to 7% growth in the elementary-high school market, 5% to 7% in the U.S. college market. Segment revenue growth of 6% to 7%, and an operating margin unchanged from 2009.
All right, let's now go to the Financial Services segment. Here, robust growth in transaction revenue was a key factor in Financial Services' start to this year. In first quarter for Financial Services, revenue increased by 9.3%. Operating profit grew by 12.3%. The operating margin was 39% versus 38% for the same period last year.
For Standard & Poor's, Credit Market Services, the 15.4% increase in the first quarter revenue was driven by record high yield issuance, strong growth in bank loan ratings, a solid gain in public finance, modest improvement in structured finance, 18.4% growth in international markets and 12.8% growth in domestic market.
For S&P Investment Services, first quarter revenues declined by 1.5%. The decline can primarily be attributed to the divestiture of Vista Research and the expiration of contracts for the independent equity research required by the Research Settlement. Let's take a closer look at these numbers.
For S&P Credit Market Services, transaction revenue increased by 33.6%. That's revenue from new issuance in domestic and international markets. The key growth drivers in the first quarter were surging high yield volume, bank loan ratings and public finance. Corporate high-yield debt insurance grew globally 565% to set an all-time record for the first quarter, and obviously coming off of a lower base. It was the first quarter for a speculative grade issuance since 2007.
The surge was driven partly by private equity-backed companies refinancing the debt they took on for buyouts in the last decade. These companies aim to preempt the so-called maturity cliff by largely an LBL-related loans coming due in the next few years. High-yield issuers raised billions of dollars in the first quarter as risk premiums tightened. The increase in the global bank loan activity was primarily amend to extend to push out maturities.
Credit spreads, that's the excess interest rate over treasury bonds, decreased dramatically during the past year. Both investment-grade and speculative-grade spreads continue to tighten in the first quarter. And as this table shows, we're near or just below their five-year moving averages at the end of March. And by the way, there was more contraction in April.
We have also seen steady and significant contraction in spreads across all asset-backed security classes. As this table shows, there's been significant contraction in spreads for auto loans, credit cards, student loans, and that's all since the beginning of 2009.
U.S. public finance issuance in the first quarter of 2010 of $106 billion was up 17.4% and just missed the all-time first quarter record of $112 billion set in 2007.
Community market continues to be fueled by the growth of Build America Bonds. This program enabled municipalities to issue a huge amount of taxable debt. In the first quarter, taxable bonds represented 31% of the muni market well above the previous market of 11%. Structured finance also contributing modestly to the increase, primarily from asset-backed securities and increases in re-REMIC activity in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market. But the growth of transaction revenue essentially driven by new issuance activity is not the whole story. 
Non-transaction revenue is a critical component, and here too, we grew. Standard & Poor's credit services' solid base of non-transaction revenue grew by 8.1% in the first quarter. And produced 67% of S&P Credit Market Services first quarter revenue. 67%.
To reduce dependency on any single market or asset class, S&P created a deferred revenue stream by emphasizing reoccurring annual fees through frequent issuant programs, surveillance fees as well as subscription services. That's how we define non-transaction revenue. And despite changes in debt issuance levels, capital markets and the economic environment, we expect the non-transaction revenue stream to be durable for some time.
The growth of non-transaction revenue in the first quarter primarily came from increased subscriptions in annual fees. We're also benefiting though [ph] for increased demand for products and services not tied to new issuance, such as ratings, evaluation services. An increase in new credits under surveillance, price increases, a modest favorable foreign exchange impact.
Turning to the investment services side of S&P. Capital IQ and S&P indices were primary drivers in the first quarter. Capital IQ continues to add clients with more than 3,000 at the end of the first quarter. The number increased 13.5% from the same quarter last year and sequentially 4.8% since the end of 2009.
To me growing client demand, Capital IQ is expanding European and Asian operations by opening new offices in Milan and Tokyo. S&P indices are experiencing a rebound in asset-based revenue which has earned from issuers of exchange traded funds and mutual funds benchmarked to our indices. Assets under management and exchange traded funds based on S&P indices set a new record of $254.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, topping the record established at the end of 2009 by 2.9%.
In the first quarter, 21 new exchange traded funds based on S&P indices were launched bringing the total to 238 exchange traded funds and endless permutations here, an index for every type of investment is our goal. And in March, we introduced indices and commodities, fixed income, equities, strategy and customized for a number clients and obviously more are on the way.
As we look at the pipeline for S&P Credit Market Services, here's what we see. High yield issuance should continue at a good pace with proceeds predominantly used for leverage loan repayments. The bank loan market will continue to be active, refinancing these will be a factor for some time with $2 trillion in debt maturities due through 2014. We anticipate a greater number of investment grade corporate transactions in 2010, although at a moderate par amounts compared to the high levels of 2009. The muni market still looks promising despite constant headlines about state and local budget deficits.
What the financial press fails to recognize is that these conditions have not translated into reduced ability to issue debt. Taxable bonds are expected to drive growth, although traditional tax exempt security will continue to comprise the largest share of new issuance. The structured finance market has improved, but new federal rules and regulations will increase the cost of securitization and could tamper new issuance. Longer term, these new rules underscore the importance of securitization as a funding tool.
Now no discussion of prospects for Financial Services is complete these days without a review of the legal and regulatory outlook. Since our last update on litigation in late January, the courts have begun to issue significant decisions in lawsuits brought against The McGraw-Hill Companies and Standard & Poor's. At last count, 12 cases have been dismissed by eight federal court judges, 11 of which have been dismissed since the beginning of the year. 
During that same period, a motion dismissed two related cases alleging fraud, has been denied pending discovery as in the Abu Dhabi case last September. The court, and by the way the same Judge Scheindlin, who issued the Abu Dhabi ruling, was required by law to assume the plaintiffs' allegations to be true at this preliminary stage of the litigations. We believe both of these cases are without merit, and we'll ask the court to dismiss them as soon as discovery is concluded.
The 12 dismissals have occurred in all three of the three major categories of claim. And again, the three major categories of claims are: One, the underwriter lawsuits that claim that we're a distributor and seller of securities, which we're not; secondly, the stock-drop suits; and third, the suits involving state law claims alleging or including alleged fraud. These recent favorable decisions have not attracted a lot of attention so let's review what's happened, since many of the key allegations against Standard & Poor's are starting to unravel under judicial scrutiny. 
Significantly, none of the dismissals have been based on the assertion of the First Amendment defense, underscoring again the erroneous claim by critics that Standard & Poor's uses the First Amendment to shield it from all legal claims. In the first category, plaintiffs allege that McGraw-Hill is liable under the Securities Act of 1933 as an underwriter or seller of residential mortgage-backed securities rated by Standard & Poor's. To date, four federal judges have granted our motions to dismiss in six separate underwriter actions. In light of these favorable rulings in the underwriter cases, class action counsel in another underwriter case has recently amended its complaint. And this is in the Fort Worth employees' Retirement Fund litigation by dropping all claims against Standard & Poor's and two other rating agencies.
In the second category, this is in the stock-drop area, our motions to dismiss were granted in three cases in which purchasers of McGraw-Hill stock alleged the company's statements about its Earnings and Ratings business were misleading and that purportedly violated the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and ERISA [Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act]. 
In the third category, we can report three dismissals of various state law claims. There also have been some significant decision in cases in which Standard & Poor's and other rating agencies were not parties. In these cases, the plaintiffs attempted to assert claims against an issuer or an underwriter on the basis of allegedly misleading statements about ratings included in the disputed offering document. Many of these claims were based on much publicized testimony regarding rating agencies given at congressional hearings. 
In three cases, the federal courts have rejected these legal claims outright. We believe that these decisions constitute meaningful legal precedent which should help guide judicial rulings in the remaining cases. The courts have been clear and unambiguous in their decisions. And here's what I mean. 
In dismissing the underwriter claims against the rating agencies and in the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund case, Judge Baer, spelled B-A-E-R, Judge Baer wrote, and I quote, ""Plaintiffs' allegations do not support an inference that rating agency defendants were involved in the sale or distribution of the securities such that they could be considered underwriters.""
In rejecting claims that the rating agencies somehow controlled Lehman, Judge Kaplan wrote in the Lehman Brothers Securities and ERISA Litigation suit, ""This complaint, fairly read, alleges only that the rating agencies had the power to influence Lehman with respect to the composition of pools of mortgages to be securitized and the credit enhancements the rating agencies regarded as necessary to obtain the desired ratings. But these allegations fall considerably short of anything that could justify a reasonable trier of fact in concluding the decision-making power lay entirely with the rating agencies.""
In concluding that ratings are opinions and not statements of fact that are actionable under the securities law, Judge Baer also pointed out that, ""Credit ratings and the relative adequacy of protective credit enhancements are statements of opinion as they are predictions of future value and future protection of that value.""
In discussing the allegations based upon alleged purported failures to disclose rating agencies conflicts of interest, Judge Kaplan wrote, ""The Securities Act does not require disclosure of that which is publicly known. And the risk that rating agencies operating under a conflict of interest because they were paid by the issuers has been known publicly for years,"" and by the way, I might add for more than 40 years as a matter fact that on that. 
Another critical point was recognized by the court in the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund case in ruling that investors were adequately cautioned in offering documents about the risks and limitations of using credit ratings. Judge Baer wrote, ""The offering documents adequately bespoke caution about the risk entailed by the credit ratings and credit enhancements and disclosed the risk of relying on credit ratings that potential inadequacy of credit enhancements, and then a lack of historical data made future projections about value inherently difficult. In other words, the offering documents ""warned investors of exactly the risk the plaintiffs' claimed were not disclosed.""
A few minutes ago, I said that the federal courts were making important decisions in the three similar cases in which Standard & Poor's and other rating agencies were not defendants. They are: The Plumbers Union Local versus Nomura Asset Acceptance Corporation, the other one was New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund versus DLJ and New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund versus RALI.
Addressing after-the-fact criticism of rating agencies, Judge Stearns pointed out in the Plumbers Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund versus Nomura, and I quote, ""None of the purported comments made by S&P and Moody's employees in the wake of the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in 2007, ""supported the inference that the ratings were compromised as of the dates in 2005 and 2006, when registration statements and prospectus supplements became affected.""""
We think there are some clear takeaways from these recent decisions. The courts are ruling that rating agencies are not underwriters under the securities law. Rating agencies are not sellers of the securities under the securities laws. Rating agencies are not controlling persons under the securities laws, that ratings are opinions, not statements of fact. 
After-the-fact criticisms of rating agencies, such as those that have appeared in the press, do not support an inference that rating agencies did not believe the ratings were appropriate at the time they were issued, that rating agencies alleged conflicts of interest were widely known by investors. And that investors were adequately cautioned about the risks and limitations of using credit ratings. For example, they are not recommendations, obviously, to buy, sell or hold securities. They never were.
Clearly, the courts are also demonstrating that they understand the difference between credit risk and market risk. That others do not is on display almost daily by some sophisticated investors, who claim they relied on ratings to make their investment decisions for themselves or as fiduciaries for others.
Turning to the regulatory situation. It obviously remains a fluid situation. Legislation in this setting is paradoxical and a potential problem. A court tenant in the proposed legislation expressed unambiguously in the preamble to the Senate Bill says, ""NRSROs [Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations] should be subject to the same standards of liability and accountability as: One, security analysts who recommend the buying of security; two, the investment banks that structured and sold securities; and three, auditors who certified the issuer's financial statements and other market participants.
And yet as currently written, other parts of the legislation would lead to the opposite result. They would impose materially different legal pleading standards for federal securities fraud claims, distinguishing NRSROs from all other defendants in the same case. In other words, a separate lower pleading standard would apply only to NRSROs in the same cases alleging federal securities' fraud violations. 
And let me be clear here. We're not looking for special legal treatment in lawsuits for securities fraud. We are simply saying that NRSROs should be subject to the same legal pleading standard as everybody else, no more, no less. To impose a lower pleading standard just on NRSROs is clearly unprecedented and discriminatory. We fully support congressional proposals to increase accountability, transparency and oversight of credit rating agencies. They should be accountable if they knowingly issue misleading ratings. We continue to work with Democrats and Republicans to make our position very clear.
The passage of the bill by Senate and reconciliation with the version passed by the House of Representatives is difficult to predict. Some expect the Senate to vote on this bill before Memorial Day, but there's also uncertainty on when the Senate and the House would convene a conference committee to work out the difference. I guess it's stay tuned.
S&P is also focused on new SEC Regulations that go into effect on June 2. A key new rule is known as 17g5. And it requires issuers and arrangers to make the underlying information that they provide on structured financing available to all NRSROs, whether they are paid or not to produce a rating. The goal is to encourage NRSROs which have not been asked to rate transaction to issue unsolicited ratings.
S&P is working with market participants to implement this new rule. S&P also is working to meet new disclosure rules on its history of rating actions. We also continue to work with regulators overseas to ensure timely compliance with their new rules and regulations. We continue to push for a regulatory framework that provides consistent standards across all geographic boundaries and jurisdictions.
So let me sum up Financial Service. The market is clearly recovering. We are making progress in the courts. We're proceeding to meet the new regulatory requirement. The outlook for legislation in the United States remains fluid. And by the way, Europe is complete. Australia is complete. Japan is complete. 
Revenue is expected to grow in high single digits, with improvements at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services, and operating profit will grow. The operating margin will decline by about 100 basis points, reflecting investments in the infrastructures to support future grow and to comply with new regulatory requirements.
And finally, let's take a look at the Information & Media area. In the first quarter, revenue declined 8.5%. Operating profit increased by $25 million to $27.8 million. The operating margin was 13.5% compared to 1.2% for the same period last year. Last year, we had a full year margin in this range. The last time we had a full year margin in this range was in 2004. That year, the segment reported an operating margin of 14.9%.
In the Business-to-Business market, we have been building on leading the industry positions where Information & Media products and services represent the standard or provide leading benchmark. A lot of progress has been masked by deterioration in the advertising market experienced by BusinessWeek. In the first quarter, the impact on operating profit in the operating margin is apparent, now that BusinessWeek's expenses have been eliminated. And because BusinessWeek did not divest until December 1, 2009 loan. The positive impact' on year-over-year comparisons will be with us for 11 months of 2010. Excluding the divestiture of BusinessWeek, revenue for the segment grew by 4.3% and the revenue for the Business-to-Business Group increased 4.5% instead of the reported 9.5% decline.
Revenue growth that flat was the primary driver in the Business-to-Business Group's first quarter. Demand for our global energy data and information product produced strong growth in both domestics and the international markets. There also was improvement at JD Power and Associates and Aviation. Softness and construction reflect difficult conditions for smaller regional contractors in the current downturn. The digital transformation of this segment continues to be a positive factor. Business-to-Business digital products and services accounted for more than 60% of the Group's first quarter revenue and contributed to margin improvement. Broadcasting produced a 2.2% revenue increase in the first quarter, benefiting from a pick up in auto advertising and some political advertising. 
Summing up for Information & Media, the 2009 sale of BusinessWeek will impact revenue and the operating margin in 2010. Revenue will decline in the mid-single digits excluding $100 million from BusinessWeek, will increase in the mid-single digits range. And the operating margin will rebound climbing into the mid-teens. 
That completes our review of the operations and the outlook for the segments in 2010. Summing up for the corporation. This year is off to a good start. But until we get a little bit better visibility on some of the trends in our key markets, we're maintaining our original guidance of diluted earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65.
Okay. With that, let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, our CFO, and go into a little more depth on the financials. Bob?"
21719,100610432,57918,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Terry.

We had a healthy balance sheet at the end of 2009, then we ended the first quarter in roughly the same position. Some key measures were virtually flat with our year-end position. 
Total debt stood at $1.2 billion and cash on short-term investments at $1.235 billion, which resulted in a slight positive net cash position. Our debt is comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes, as we have no commercial paper outstanding. We'll look at the free cash flow in more detail in a few minutes, but first, I want to focus on the expenses for 2010.
Segment expenses were down 2.6% in the first quarter, though we expect some ramp up for the balance of the year, as we make investments in technology, incur additional expense related to selling and marketing McGraw-Hill Education, and also incur expenses to increase our talent base in each of our segments to contribute to our future growth. Increased investments later in the year are our key reason why we are not changing our guidance after reporting a substantial increase in earnings per share in the seasonally slow first quarter.
So let's look at what we anticipate in each of the segments as the year unfolds. As a reminder, for purposes of full year expense guidance, I'll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth adjusted to exclude 2009 restructuring charges, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek.
Let's start with McGraw-Hill Education. The year is off to a good start. First quarter expenses declined 2.6% or 4.7% at constant currencies. The segment benefited from savings from the second quarter 2009 action to combine our core of basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations, as well as reduced expenses due to the planned phase out of statewide custom contracts in California, Florida and Arizona.
For the full year 2010, as Terry indicated, we now expect segment revenue growth of 6% to 7% versus the previous guidance of 7% to 8% increase. Despite the reduced revenue growth, we're maintaining our guidance of an unchanged adjusted operating margin as we now anticipate the expenses to increase 6% to 7% compared to our previous guidance of a 7% to 8% increase.
Expense growth is driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs due to the robust state new adoption opportunities. Given the seasonality of the business, these costs are generally not significant in the first quarter. Additionally, we continue to invest in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at Higher Ed and Professional in order to provide value and choices for our customers. For our Financial Services, expenses increased 7.5% in the first quarter. At constant currencies and excluding the impact of the divestiture of Vista, expenses increased 5.4%.
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect expenses to increase roughly 9% to 10% versus the 2009 adjusted expense. Expense growth is largely driven by continued investment in our fast-growing businesses, the carryover impact of 2009 hires, as well as planned hires in 2010, and additional investments to support our regulatory and compliance efforts. The impact of investments, including new hires, will be more pronounced as the year progresses. Our expense guidance assumes approximately $20 million in additional costs relating to our regulatory and compliance initiatives, though this is obviously highly dependent on the final form of regulation.
At Information & Media, first quarter expenses declined 19.9% or 20.5% at constant currencies. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $27.8 million and expenses by $40 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $12 million in the quarter.
This segment also benefited from restructuring actions taken in 2009. For the full year, Information & Media will reflect savings from the BusinessWeek divestiture of $38 million as we manage vacant space and certain other support costs within corporate expense, which is increasing approximately $13 million due to the divestiture.
For 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, the expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. Corporate expense in the first quarter was $36 million, a $2.4 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased excess space.
For 2010, we continue to expect corporate expense to increase $25 million to $30 million. The primary reason for the increase is driven by higher excess space in New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education. Excess space will increase later in the year when BusinessWeek moves to the Bloomberg offices.
Now let's discuss free cash flow. As a reminder, we define free cash flow in the following manner. We start with cash provided by operations for the cash flow statement. We then subtract the following items: Prepublication investments, purchases of property and equipment, additions to technology projects and dividends paid to our shareholders. The result is free cash flow that is available for acquisitions, share repurchases or to pay down debt.  For the quarter, free cash flow improved to a negative $12.8 million compared to a negative $56.2 million in the prior year.
Since this is by far our smallest quarter due to the seasonal nature of our businesses, we normally incur a net cash outflow in the first quarter. Improved operating results reduced our cash outlay. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year in the range of $550 million to $600 million. Reduction in free cash flow versus 2009 is due largely to more challenging working capital comparisons, as well as increased investments, which I will address in a moment.
Turning our U.S. pension plan, we still anticipate no cash funding requirements this year but continue to expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $20 million in 2010. 
Earlier, I pointed out our investments will grow in 2010, so let's take a look at some of the growth areas. Prepublication investments were $30 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $12.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2009 largely due to timing. We expect prepublication investments to ramp up in the second half of the year. So for the full year of 2010, we continue to expect prepublication investments of approximately $225 million to $235 million, a $48 million to $58 million increase versus 2009, primarily due to opportunities in the growing state new adoption markets.
Purchases of property and equipment were $7.6 million in the first quarter, a slight decrease in versus the first quarter of 2009. But we do continue to expect full year expenditures of approximately $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009. And this is largely driven by increased technology spending.
Let's now review non-cash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $26 million in the first quarter of 2010, a $1.5 million decrease versus the prior year. In 2010, we continued to expect $260 million to $265 million versus the $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the lower level of investment made in 2009.
Depreciation was $26 million in the first quarter versus $29.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. We now expect depreciation to be closer to $115 million versus our previous estimate of $120 million, due to a shift in the timing of certain capital expenditures.
Amortization of intangibles was $10 million for the first quarter, and we continue to expect it to be approximately $40 million for the full year. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $316.3 million in the first quarter, a $4.2 million share increase versus the same period last year, and a $1.8 million share increase from the fourth quarter of 2009. 
The increase was driven by stock price appreciation, as well as issuance relating to employee plans. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately $317 million. Net interest expense was $22 million in the first quarter. That compares to $20.6 million in the same period of last year and $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable with 2009 which was $77 million.
Regarding the company's effective tax rate, the rate in the first quarter for 2010 was 36.4%. That's unchanged from 2009 and we expect the comparable rate for the full year. Now while it does not impact the tax rate, I did want to point out that in the first quarter, we made a cash tax payment of approximately $35 million, due to organizational restructuring actions related to our international operations that will largely be recovered through reduced tax payments in the second half of this year.
There has been a great deal of publicity recently regarding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law on March 23, 2010. And the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 signed into law on March 30, 2010, which together eliminate the tax deductibility of employer paid retiree prescription drug benefits, which are reimbursed by the government in accordance with the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.
Our postretirement benefits program does not include a very significant portion of retiree prescription drug benefits, which are reimbursed for the Medicare Modernization Act. So in short, the impact of this new legislation on our financials is immaterial.
Our unearned revenue continues to grow ending the quarter at $1.1 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of divestitures, most notably BusinessWeek, it grew 4.3%. Financial Services makes up 75% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. 
While comparatively small, McGraw-Hill Education continues to show strong unearned revenue growth, driven by an increase in subscription-based products, particularly at Higher Education. For 2010, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in unearned revenue. 
Lastly, I like to provide an update on our share repurchase program. In January, we announced that we plan to resume share repurchases in 2010. In the first quarter, we did not make any repurchases, so there continues to be 17.1 million shares remaining from the 2007 authorization from the Board of Directors. We remain committed to resuming the program in 2010. Thanks, and now back to Terry."

In terms of the pleading standards and the liability standard that as part of the current Senate bill, we're still hopeful, that we get more clarification. We're not looking to change anything, Peter, in that one and we're certainly not saying that we shouldn't have a liability standard. We just want a liability standard that's consistent for all market participants in all of that. And so when they talk about in the legislation, ""reasonable investigation,"" they just leave it at that point. And what it's really doing is leading to the court what constitutes a reasonable investigation. So all we're pushing for is be a little bit more forthcoming and clarify the position. So we think we have a good chance of getting that part done. If for whatever reason, the pleading standard for rating agencies was lower, it would impact us because we would -- what we would do is in terms of rating activity, we would probably not rate some smaller, more speculative emerging companies. And that doesn't do anybody any good and it limits the capital formation process. So we're pushing hard for clarification on what a reasonable investigation is, and I think at the end of the day, we'll get that."

I will review the second quarter results and the guidance. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials. And after the formal presentation, again, as Don said, we'll be pleased to answer any questions or take any comments that you have about The McGraw-Hill Companies.
Earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.61 for the second quarter, and that's an increase of 17.3% compared to $0.52 last year. And of course, that $0.52 last year included a total of $0.06 for a net restructuring charge and a loss on a divestiture. Revenue of $1.5 billion was up 0.6% for the second quarter, but increased 2.7% if you exclude the divestitures of BusinessWeek and Vista Research.
In the current environment, regulatory and legal matters are clearly top-of-mind issues with investors, so I will start this morning by reviewing developments in these areas and their impact on financial services. But let me say at the outset that regarding financial reform and legal issues, we are pleased, very pleased that this period of uncertainty is largely over. With the signing of the Dodd-Frank Act, we have now greater clarity on the new legal and regulatory landscape for credit rating agencies and that again, is a welcome development. It reduces some of the uncertainty and gives us a clear picture of the way forward.
From our vantage point, some things are not clear. First, there were no surprises in the legislation, we've been at it for sometime. Second, we have anticipated the key provisions becoming law for sometime. And third, the new legislation calls for greater disclosure, accountability and oversight. These are all actions that we believe will increase confidence in the markets as well as in ratings.
In this period of change, Standard & Poor's has been investing in systems and processes and people to prepare us; to operate effectively in this new regulated environment; to produce ratings that are relevant to investors, issuers and other market participants; to compete effectively and to comply with regulations in all jurisdictions as well as being able to manage and mitigate risk.
Now the key to meeting these regulatory requirements is S&P's QCCR framework. Now those initials, QCCR, stands for quality, criteria, compliance and risk. And over the past few years, S&P has continually strengthened its QCCR framework within each of those four area that has met establishing control groups independent of the Ratings business, and investing staff, training, technology and processes around the QCCR function, and let me elaborate.
The Q, the quality team uses formulized review procedures to oversee the integrity, quality and transparency of S&P's ratings. The criteria team oversees the development and approval of criteria for our ratings that would include new and revised economic-stress scenarios for the rating criteria to meeting emerging market and regulatory expectations. In the compliance organization, they're now about 50 people helping to monitor that S&P meets regulatory requirements through regular compliance examinations. They also provide training and guidance on policies and guidelines. And finally, the risk control function is designed to assess various risk that could affect the integrity and quality of the ratings process. Risk control will also assess the feasibility of rating new types of securities.
More global regulation is expected, but our investment in the QCCR framework in recent years has created the foundation that S&P needs to implement the control and compliance function. In short, not only is S&P well positioned now to deal with the pending changes, it has a leverageable framework to deal with the new regulations. Last year, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. In 2010, spending will increase by about $15 million or up to about $78 million.
At beginning of the year, we said we expected a decline of about 100 basis points in the operating margin for Financial Services. Despite additional cost, the operating margin forecast has not changed, and reflects infrastructure investments and new regulatory requirements that we have anticipated.  Looking ahead, there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with all the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
The new Dodd-Frank Act will require more changes, and let's go through some of those changes and what they include. They include the elimination of statutory references in various U.S. laws to credit ratings, we supported this action. Ratings across the globe should continue to provide investors a common and transparent language, and a fundamental credit-risk benchmark across sectors and geographies. Independent analytical insight and transparency are the key to our value proposition.
Another issue, the repeal of the Rule 436(g). Under this rule, issuers of U.S. public offerings included the rating of a security in registration statements without triggering potential expert liability exposure for the credit rating agencies. In view of the new legal risk created by the repeal of 436(g), S&P will not consent to the inclusion of its ratings and registrations statement and prospectuses. And in a new development as of yesterday, by suspending Regulation AB requirements for six months, AB in the asset-backed area, the SEC has given the market time to study potential solutions to the problem created by the repeal of 436(g). But S&P will explore many mechanisms outside of registration statements to allow ratings to continue to be disseminated to the debt market. As always, S&P ratings on new issues and presale reports are available, at no charge, to all market participants on our website. And let me just give you those while we're at this point, simply log on to www.standard&poors.com/newissues and another, www.standard&poors.com/presalesreports.
Another issue is the repeal of the exception to Regulation Fair Disclosure. Under this exception, issuers could share material nonpublic information with rating agencies without violating Reg FD. There are other ways to satisfy Reg FD so we can continue to receive confidential information as part of the ratings process, and we're currently evaluating those options. The proposed change in the law that has attracted the most attention concerns new pleading standards and federal securities fraud suits brought against credit rating agencies. The legislation permits lawsuits against the credit rating agency that, ""knowingly or recklessly failed to conduct a ""reasonable investigation"" or obtain reasonable verification of the data it uses to determine a rating."" Undoubtedly, the new pleading standard will be tested at some point in the future. More litigation would obviously be burdensome and motions to dismiss may be more difficult to achieve, but we will be ready to meet this new challenge.
Among other things, as our board [ph](39:11) pointed out, S&P continues to make changes in its business to improve its procedures and control processes. But don't lose sight of another crucial point, it is simply this: Ultimately, the current fraud liability standards still applies, that has not changed. And let me be clear on this point. The new law changes what plaintiffs are required to allege in order to survive a motion to dismiss at the pleading stage. The law does not change what plaintiffs must ultimately prove to a judge or a jury in order for a credit rating agency to be held liable. And that is the same federal securities fraud liability standard to which all market participants are subject to.
On the litigation front, the outright dismissals of current cases now stands at 13, and five cases have been just withdrawn. We believe these decisions constitute meaningful precedent. Since our last update on litigation, there have been three important decisions involving S&P. Two involve a subprime case and the third, relates to S&P's Index businesses and a grant of summary judgment that thwarts an assault on S&P's intellectual property rights.
First, the Abu Dhabi subprime case and new rulings by Judge Scheindlin. Here on June 15, she emphatically denied class-action certification to the plaintiffs. In denying the motion for class certification, the judge wrote, ""defendants argue with considerable force against the certifying the proposed class. As defendants point out, this action is a collection of a relatively small number of sophisticated institutional investors that acquired one of three different categories of rated notes at different times, pursuant to different internal requirements and after conducting different due diligence inquiries.""
On July 20, she allowed the plaintiffs to reinstate one of the 10 original claims against both the credit rating agencies and Morgan Stanley that she had previously dismissed with prejudice. In responding to the plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint, the judge concluded that she was mistaken in dismissing the aiding and abetting fraud claim because they are related to the allegations of fraud, the one claim that has been allowed to proceed.
There are three takeaways from the latest development. The first is that the decision does not affect the dismissal of the nine claims which were not based on fraud. The court, secondly, has made no finding of fraud or aiding and abetting fraud. At this early stage in the case, the court's ruling must be based on accepting the plaintiffs' assertion as true until you get to a discovery dialog. The third, the key issue here has not changed with the restoration of the aiding and abetting claim. The plaintiff still must prove fraud, and we remain very confident that neither claim can be sustained.
The victory in the Illinois Circuit Court also was significant. Judge William MaKi ruled that index providers are entitled to protection of misappropriation of their indices. The International Securities Exchange, ISE, sought to offer options based on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Index without obtaining a license from the owners of these indices. In his ruling, the judge observed, ""it bears noting that ISE unabashedly admits to attempted to create a competitive product, the ISE 250, which is an index highly correlated to the S&P 500. After spending a large sum of money developing and promoting options on the ISE 250, ISE discontinued the project which had failed to garner significant trading volume. The court fails to understand how ISE's failure somehow entitles it to profit for free from the efforts, skills and reputation of the index providers.""
With that, on some of the regulatory and legal issues, I will leave that for now, and let's move on to the operations. Let's begin and let's take a look at the Financial Services operating results in the second quarter and the prospects for the second half of the year. 
Revenue at S&P Credit Market Services was up 0.1% as a surge in syndicated-leverage-bank-loan ratings helped offset continued softness in the structured finance market. The value of diversity was underscored by the 4.9% increase in revenue at S&P Investment Services. For the second quarter at Financial Services, revenue increased by 1.6%, operating profit declined by 4.2%. The operating margin was 38.7% compared to 41.0% last year, which reflected a pretax loss of $13.8 million from the divestiture of Vista Research and a pretax net benefit of $0.4 million from restructuring charges.
The second quarter started strongly, and then softened in May and June as doubts grew about the pace of economic recovery and uncertainty developed over European sovereigns and bank debt. In this environment, credit spreads for the investment and speculative-grade bonds, and again, when we talk about credit spreads, it's the excess interest over the treasury bonds, began to widen after reaching two-year lows at the end of April. As this table shows, both the investment and speculative-grade composite spreads were, on July 15, above their five-year daily moving averages. The three-month LIBOR rose to more than 0.5% and by the way, that's the highest since the middle of 2009. Although the volume of bank loan ratings is still at the low end of its historical average, the market picked up substantially in the first half. As this chart shows, the volume in syndicated-leveraged bank loans, which are rated BBB or lower, started climbing in the first quarter and accelerated in the second quarter of 2010. Bank loan activity was primarily amend to extend the push out maturities.
The investment-grade corporate market was soft in both Europe and in the United States, but refinancing requirements resulted in increased high-yield debt issuance in Europe. New issuance in the high-yield market increased 15.3% globally in the second quarter, with gains in European issuance more than offsetting the decline in U.S. issuance. About 73% of the total U.S. high-yield volume in the second quarter was designated for refinancing. The structured finance market declined again in the second quarter, and a key to the second half outlook is the wave of corporate debt coming due in the United States and the European markets.
As these charts show, S&P estimates that U.S. and European debt maturities, by dollar amounts, will grow steadily through 2014. Looking ahead, S&P expects companies to take advantage of increased investor appetite for yield to either amend credit agreements to extend maturities or refinance bank debt with longer-dated, high-yield debt.
Credit spreads will be a factor for the level of issuance in the second half. Stable or tightening spreads could spur some healthy issuance volume in the corporate sector. The outlook for public finance is mixed. Taxable bonds, including the new Build America Bonds, will probably drive growth, although S&P expects traditional tax exempt issuance to decline in the second half.
In Structured Finance, we may see a modest pickup in activity. There may be a slow rebirth of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market in the second half. That would be welcoming. In the near term, S&P expects to see re-REMIC activity continue in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market.
In the asset-backed securities market, activity could stall somewhat as various regulations are digested. The SEC's Rule 17g5 became effective on June 2, and the FDIC Safe Harbor rules which are expected to take effect in September. We also continue to monitor our competitive position in the marketplace.
In 2009, excluding sovereign issuance, S&P rated approximately 95% of the addressable debt issued in the United States. As this chart shows, S&P has performed consistently in the range for the last six years. In the European market S&P rated 89% of the addressable market last year, up from 83% in 2008.  It is also worth noting that at $1.8 trillion, the rated European debt market, with fewer but larger issues, was actually bigger than the rated U.S. market which is just over $1.5 trillion. 
The market share performance underscores another important part about S&P's track record. S&P provides a range of ratings from AAA to CCC. And if the initial credit opinion meets the test of time, you will see fewer defaults at the top of the scale and higher defaults at the lower end of the scale. S&P tracks these default rates with great care, and recently updated the tables on the global corporate average cumulative default rate from 1981 through 2009 and the global structured finance average cumulative default rate from 1978 to 2009. There is a lot of information on these two tables, which will appear in our new Investor Fact Book next month, but the key point is unmistakable. In both Corporate and Structured Finance, over long periods of time, the higher the S&P rating, the fewer defaults have been experienced. That's the way it is supposed to be if S&P is doing its job properly.
In addition to defaults, S&P also looked at rating transition by conducting a comprehensive review of credit ratings spanning the spectrum of corporate, government, structured finance debt. This report is entitled, ""Default, Transition and Recovery: A Global Cross Asset Report Card of Ratings Performance in Times of Stress"", and that was published last month. This review demonstrated that ratings issued in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia for nearly all asset classes generally performed as expected, with the exception of ratings on the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities and on collateralized debt obligations backed by structured finance collateral. That is, rated credits withstood the recent financial crisis with results in line with expectations for the economic environment. In contrast, the performance of ratings for U.S. RMBS and CDOs issued from 2005 through 2007 have been disappointing and below our expectations. 
Standard & Poor's performance review reaffirms two key attributes of rating. First, even during periods of economic stress, ratings have been and continue to be reasonable predictors of the relative likelihoods of default or different credits. In short, credits with higher ratings generally experienced lower default rates. This trend held up across asset classes for the three stressful period studied in 1991, 2001 and the 2008-2009 period, with the exception of residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs during the recent crisis.
Second, sectors other than RMBS and CDOs did not experience disproportionate downgrades relative to the degree of economic stress. Downgrades typically increased in all sectors during periods of stress, but apart from residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs issued between 2005 and 2007, the pace was not exceptional.
Earlier in this presentation, I mentioned the value of diversity that S&P Investment Services brings to our portfolio. Nowhere is that more evident than in S&P indices which are providing greater access to more markets for more investors around the world. The team at S&P indices is dedicated to finding new ways to grow the business. With the expiration of a 10-year exclusive agreement with Barclays, S&P has recently licensed Vanguard to launch exchange-traded funds based in our indices. Vanguard is introducing eight new exchange-traded funds targeting Growth and Value segments of the S&P 500, and Growth and Value and Blend segments of the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600.
In May, S&P licensed seven major European exchange-traded fund sponsors to create and list S&P 500 ETFs on major European exchanges for real-time trading. In the spring, S&P licensed the National Stock Exchange, the NSE of India, to create and list Indian rupee-denominated futures contracts based on the S&P 500. S&P will be adding new indices in commodities, fixed income, equities, strategy and customize others for its clients. The goal, an index for every type of investment.
So let's sum up for the Financial Services segment. New clarity on the regulatory and legal front, new requirements are manageable, mid single-digit revenue growth for the segment versus our previous estimate of high single-digit growth due to some unanticipated softness in the market. With improvement at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services, operating profit will improve. Operating margin will decline approximately 100 basis points. And this reflects infrastructure investments in compliance with new regulatory requirements.
All right. Let's move on to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education in the second quarter, a strong performance in the U.S. Higher Education market, and increases in the state new adoption market by the School Education Group were partially offset by declines in the open territory and the custom-testing markets. As a result, McGraw-Hill School Education Group's revenue declined by 4%.  McGraw-Hill Higher Education and Professional and International Group's revenue increased by 10.8%. 
For the segment in the second quarter, revenue increased by 1.8%, but the gain in the U.S. Higher Education market had a substantial impact in the second quarter operating profit, which grew to $51.6 million and an operating margin which increased to 9.1%. That compares to an operating profit for the second quarter of 2009 of $21 million which included a pretax restructuring charge of $11.6 million and an operating margin of 3.8%.
State budget pressures continue to be a factor in this year's elementary-high school market. As we had expected, only the state new adoption market will show solid growth this year. But here too, funding concerns are driving reduced purchasing levels. As the spring adoption season progressed, it became clear that fewer California districts would be making new reading, literature or math purchases than originally projected. South Carolina's math adoption was effectively canceled in the second quarter when the legislature did not provide funding, and many districts in Indiana decided to postpone buying math this year. District activity has been limited in other states as well, including Georgia and Oklahoma.
In view of these conditions, we are adjusting our estimates for 2010. We are now expecting the state new adoption market to range from $825 million to $875 million, and our previous forecast has have $875 million to $925 million. We now look for the el-hi [elementary-high school] market now to grow by 4% to 6%, down from our previous forecast of 6% to 7%. The market's growth will come from the increase of nearly 70% in state new adoption sales. We still anticipate declines in both open territory sales and residual sales.
The McGraw-Hill School Group [McGraw-Hill School Education Group] still expects to capture about 30% of the state new adoption business this year. The biggest opportunities as we know are in Texas, Florida, and even despite the market shrinkage there, in California as well. 
In Texas, we are forecasting a capture rate of about 40% of the K-5 reading market and about 18% of the 6-12 literature market. Some of those orders were deferred and will be shipped in the third quarter, so we'll see that pick up there. In Florida, we anticipate winning 40% of the 6-8 math market, about 27% of the 9-12 market, but only 5% of the K-5  market. In California, strong performances by our California Treasures program and Imagine It! program should enable us to capture more than half the available dollars in the state for new K-5 reading program.
In smaller states, the McGraw-Hill School Group expects to capture more than 40% of Mississippi's K-12 science adoption and more than 60% of West Virginia's K-12 math adoption. And while math postponements have been heavy in Indiana and Oklahoma, we are winning substantial shares in those states, particularly at the 6-12 grade level.
The School Group has been strong historically in non-academic subjects as well, and this year is no exception. We're seeing good capture rates in family and consumer sciences, technical education and business and computer education. In Testing, growth in the formative market was offset by planned phaseouts of statewide-custom contracts in Florida and in Arizona. 
The increase in federal funds for education remains one of the wildcards in this market. There is no doubt that the federal government is continuing to pump significant dollars into the education market. The availability and the ultimate use of these funds are developments that we are tracking very carefully, and we'll keep you informed as we go.
The massive stimulus program passed last year, now that was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or ARRA, has $11.5 billion available for distribution to the states in 2010 through Phase 2 of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. This fund is intended to supplement education budgets in the fiscal year that has just begun in most states. 
Last year, most of the Phase 1 funds were used to save teaching jobs, and we believe that the same will be true on the Phase 2 funds this year. But the ARRA stimulus legislation is also funding other programs that will released new dollars in 2010. Race to the Top grants at $4 billion, Common Core Assessment Grants at $350 million and Investing for Innovation Grants (sic) [Investing in Innovation Grants] at $650 million.
In addition, states are receiving School Improvement Grants from a $3.5 billion program funded by stimulus dollars and the U.S. Department of Education's current budget. To date, 32 states and the District of Columbia have been approved for these grants, which are earmarked for low-performing schools.
For the McGraw-Hill School Education Group, these grant programs offer potential for both assessment and instructional materials. For example, all Race to the Top proposals, including formative testing, so winning states will require these products and services. Our formative products, such as Acuity, Yearly ProgressPro and Writing Roadmap, and our reporting services, such as The Parent Network, are naturals to meet the market's need. At the same time, our research-based instructional and intervention products, such as Number Worlds and Reading Mastery, are proven solutions for turning around low-performing schools.
Timing will vary for each of these programs but some revenues stemming from School Improvement and Investing in Innovation grants could begin to show up by, at least, the fourth quarter. 
All this is developing as the states embrace Common Core Standards for K-12 math and for reading and language arts. To date, 23 states have adopted the standards and more are expected to follow in August. More than 40 states are expected to sign on by the end of this year, very important development.  
As a result of all this activity, we expect to see an expansion of digital delivery systems for instructional materials, professional development and classroom-level assessment, and we like these opportunities. 
In higher education, the digital opportunity is big and it's getting bigger. Our revenue in this space is growing at a double-digit rate. The McGraw-Hill Connect family of homework management and assessment program are currently being used by 1.8 million students and instructors.
And now, by creating a partnership with Blackboard, we will dramatically increase the reach and ease of access for our suite of digital products on U.S. campuses. As the clear leader in course management, Blackboard reaches 70% to 80% of the U.S. college and university market. Students and faculty will be able to use a single Blackboard log-on to gain access to our content and tools. Scores on McGraw-Hill Connect assignments, quizzes, tests will post directly to the Blackboard grade book, eliminating the need for students and instructors to manage access and updates on two separate systems. 
We are off to a solid start this year in the U.S. college and university market. And while a strong performance earlier in this year puts us in a good position, it is not necessarily a barometer of full year results. Those will be determined by the heavy ordering season that we have just entered into.
We have benefited so far this year from last fall's surge in enrollments, which carried through into the spring semester. And while we think fall enrollments will continue at this higher level, no further surge is projected. That is why we expect the market to grow by 5% to 7% despite the very strong start to the year.
In professional markets, digital products are also producing double-digit growth. We now have 5,000 e-books available, and their sales accelerated last April following the introduction of the Apple iPad. The e-book is on its way to becoming a staple of the business-to-consumer market, as individuals increasingly discover the convenience of downloading content to e-reading devices. 
Digital products are also growing rapidly in the business-to-business market. Here, the content is assessed on a platform that is updated with news feeds, augmented with video, enriched with searchable information and professionals required to remain current with developments in their fields. Our growing family of Access products offers a growing array of professional resources in medicine, engineering and business.
So let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key markets in 2010: 4% to 6% in the elementary-high school market, 5% to 7% in the U.S. college market. Segment revenue, low single-digit growth, down from previous guidance of 6% to 7% growth, given a more challenging el-hi market. Operating margin unchanged from 2009. 
And finally, let's now take a look at the Information & Media segment. The growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television and advertising and the continuing impact of the BusinessWeek divestiture were key to this segment's second quarter performance. 
For the second quarter, revenue declined by 5.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, grew by 7.4%. Operating profit increased by $33.1 million to $47.5 million compared to $14.4 million for the same period last year, and by the way, that included a pretax restructuring charge of $4 million. The operating margin was 21.2% compared to 6.1% for the same period last year. The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.8%, but excluding BusinessWeek, grew by 5.6%.
In volatile energy market, the demand for Platts data and information product continues to produce solid growth both in the United States and in international markets. To keep its clients abreast of the changing marketplace, Platts is also introducing new information services. The Bakken Shale formation in the Central U.S. is one of the most significant new sources of regional oil for our nation's refiners. 
In the second quarter, Platts began publishing the world's first price assessment for crude oil produced from the Bakken Shale formation. Platts also began publishing daily price assessments for liquefied natural gas imported to Southwest Europe and to Northwest Europe, two very key consumer regions.
For Broadcasting, second quarter revenue increased by 24% compared to the period last year. National, local and political time sales all contributed to the growth. A pickup in automotive advertising was a key factor and an improvement in local and national advertising. 
Political advertising benefited from the June 8 primary in California and the contest for Governor in that state. In the third quarter, political advertising should again be strong. There is an August 10 primary in Colorado and spending for the Senate race and propositions expected to be key drivers.
Summing up then for the Information & Media. 2009 sale of BusinessWeek is having a positive impact on revenue and operating margins. Revenue, expect a mid single-digit decline. But excluding BusinessWeek, revenue will increase in the mid single-digit range. Operating margin, expect a rebound into the mid-teens. 
And therefore, summing up overall now for The McGraw-Hill Companies, our previous earnings per diluted share guidance for 2010 was $2.55 to $2.65. Due to the choppiness in some of our key market, we now expect to finish the year at the lower end of that range. Okay, that concludes a review of our operations and various situations. 
Let's turn it over now to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer and our other financial matters. Bob?"
21719,109060284,68904,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Terry. There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies' financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow is building. There is no short-term debt outstanding. No long-term debt come",1726,"Okay. Thank you, Terry. There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies' financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow is building. There is no short-term debt outstanding. No long-term debt comes due until 2012. 
And in the second quarter, we started repurchasing shares. We repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total cost of $186.9 million, at an average price of $28.76 per share. This is the first time we've repurchased their shares since the third quarter of 2008. 10.6 million shares remain in the 2007 program authorized by the Board of Directors.
Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 313.2 million in the second quarter, relatively flat versus the prior year, as the second quarter share repurchases were offset by issuance related to employee plans as well as stock price appreciation. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.1 million from the first quarter, reflecting the weighted impact of second quarter share repurchases.
Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 310 million.
We continue to be well capitalized, with a net debt position as of June 30 of $53 million. The shift to a net debt position from the end of the first quarter is driven primarily by funding for share repurchases. 
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.145 billion, while gross debt was comprised of $1.198 billion in senior notes. Our debt is comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes, and there's no commercial paper outstanding, again, as I mentioned earlier. 
The outlook for the free cash flow continues to improve. To calculate free cash flow, we start with after-tax cash from operations and deduct working capital, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt.
In the first half of 2010, we generated free cash flow of $98 million, that's an improvement of $61 million from the prior year due to improved operating results and the continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow for the year in the range of $600 million to $650 million versus our previous guidance of $550 million to $600 million. The improvement is driven by reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated. 2009 full year free cash flow was $770 million. 
We generate the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year because of the seasonality of our Education business. Our guidance implies second half free cash flow that will be roughly $500 million to $550 million, which is lower than prior year due to increased investments and more challenging working capital comparisons during that second half.
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we still anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. We now expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $15 million versus our previous estimate of $20 million.
Now let's look at our segment expenses, particularly in the context of the reduced revenue outlook for McGraw-Hill Education and Financial Services. As a reminder, I'll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth excluding the 2009 restructuring charges, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek. 
So let's start now with Education. Second quarter adjusted expenses declined 1.8%, and the first half adjusted expenses declined 2.1%. At constant currencies, the first half decline is actually larger at 3.1%. 
The segment benefited from savings from last year's strategy to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations, as well as reduced expenses due to the planned phaseout of statewide-custom contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. The increases in selling and marketing costs in the second quarter for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings.
For the full year 2010, as Terry indicated, we now expect segment revenue growth in the low single digits versus our previous guidance of 6% to 7% increase. Despite the reduced revenue growth, we are maintaining our guidance of an unchanged adjusted operating margin, as we now anticipate expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to our previous guidance of a 6% to 7% increase. 
Our full year guidance implies that second half expense will be in the mid single digits, driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs because of the state adoption calendar, as well as cycling through the phaseout of the previously mentioned statewide-custom contracts. Additionally, we continue to ramp up investment in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at higher education and professional, in order to provide value and choices for our customers.
For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 9.4% in the second quarter and 10.8% at constant currencies. First half expenses increased 8.5%. Expense increase was driven by increased salaries and occupancy costs, mainly from our international hires and increased incentive compensation. 
For the full year 2010, we now expect expenses to increase roughly 7% to 8%, down slightly versus our previous guidance of roughly 9% to 10%. The expense growth is largely driven by: continued investment in our fast-growing businesses; the carryover impact of 2009 hires, as well as planned hires for 2010; and additional investments to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.
Our expense guidance assumes approximately $15 million in additional costs related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives, which will occur mostly in the second half of the year. As Terry indicated, there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
In Information & Media, second quarter and first-half adjusted expenses declined 18.9% and 19.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced second quarter revenue by $27.5 million and expenses by $38.5 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $11 million in the quarter. For the first half, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $55 million and expenses by $78 million for a positive impact of roughly $23 million. This segment also benefited from restructuring actions taken in 2009.
For the full year, Information & Media will reflect savings from BusinessWeek divestiture of approximately $38 million. For 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. 
Corporate expense in the second quarter was $37.6 million, an $8.3 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased excess space, increased incentive compensation and growth in selected support functions. For the first half, corporate expense was $73.4 million, which is a $10.6 million increase. 
For the full year, we continue to expect corporate expense to increase about $25 million to $30 million, and the primary reason for the increase is driven by the higher excess space for New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as excess space from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.
Let's now turn to Investments where we are expecting increases in the second half. Prepub investments were $30 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. At first half, we invested $60 million, which is a $25 million decrease. The decline largely is largely due to timing as we expect increased prepublication investments in the second half of the year. 
For 2010, we now expect prepub investments of approximately $195 million to $205 million, an $18 million to $28 million increase versus 2009. But on the other hand, this investment is $30 million less than our previous estimate of $225 million to $235 million, reflecting the fact that with changes in state adoption call schedules, investments are being delayed to better align with projected opportunities. In addition, we continue to benefit from combining our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Purchase of property and equipment were $14.5 million in the second quarter, a $6 million increase versus the second quarter of last year. First half purchases of property and equipment were $22 million. We expect increased investments in the second half and continue to expect that. On a full year basis, expenditures will be approximately $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and the increase is largely driven by technology spending.
Now let's take a look now at the noncash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $69 million in the second quarter, which had $2 million decrease versus last year. In 2010, we continue to expect $260 million to $265 million versus $270 million last year. Depreciation was $26 million in the second quarter versus $29 million the previous quarter last year. We continue to expect depreciation to be roughly $115 million versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $13 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $23 million for the first half, and we expect for the full year about $40 million.
Net interest expense was approximately $21 million in the second quarter compared to $18.5 million in the same period last year and $22 million in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was $77 million. Regarding the company's effective tax rate, during the second quarter and the first half of 2010, it was 36.4%, which was unchanged from 2009, and that's what we expect to see for the full year. 
Our unearned revenue continues to grow, ending the quarter at $1.1 billion, which is up 4.2% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of the divestiture of BusinessWeek, the growth was 7%. Unearned revenue was impacted by deferral of revenue at McGraw-Hill School Education Group where shipping will be completed in the third quarter. Excluding this impact, unearned revenue would have grown at approximately 3.5%.
Financial Services continues to represent 73% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digit, as strong growth in ratings-related information, S&P Indices and Capital IQ offset declines at credit ratings and equity research products.

And quite frankly, we were a little surprised by it on that one. But again, what it did is it led into a May-June-July period of softness. And it was a lot slower than we anticipated on that one, and we'll just have to see going forward. I think it reflects a little bit at that Chairman Bernanke's comment, when he was talking about entering into sort of a summer lull of more modest recovery, but we'll have to see. We have to see what the effect of some of the economic recovery and some of the effect that that's going to have on business investment, and what that means then for our issuance. But right now, it's pretty soft. And again, the charts in the slides that -- show that. We're not going to anticipate stronger issuance at this point. If it comes, it will obviously offset any additional cost and should improve margins, but we'll just stay tuned at this point on that one. Competitive issues, Brian, on S&P? No, I mean, again, when you talk about the extensiveness globally of providing credit rating services, it is a huge undertaking. We carry some-1,300 analysts around the world that are providing all of these kind of functions. And so for new entrants, that's a big hurdle to get over. We're hearing on the fringe of a lot of different people that would like to get involved or be a part of or something like that, but we're not seeing anything from a competitive standpoint that concerns us from that one. On the textbook side, Brian, what was the question?"

But it also gives us a lot of upside in terms of some of the new things we're doing, very pleased with the online learning platforms like McGraw-Hill  Connect. It is doing extremely well, especially at the community-college level, and so that part is good. Also, what we're seeing is increased activity in the educational services area. These are online learning platforms that are very targeted to corporate professional skills in places like India and China. Where to get certain jobs, you have to have certain skill sets. And we can rifle-shoot in with online learning platforms, and we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. So I mean, I think it's a good situation at this point. But we just have to stay tuned. On the K-12 side, it really is going to depend on some of the Recovery Act federal stimulus. There's $11.5 billion that is scheduled for spending in 2010. Certainly, I think teacher jobs are part of it. But I think, also, we ought to see some very, very important support in some of the key states. So we'll see. The Higher Ed is going to clearly be the winner of the year."

As you know, in terms of the pleading standards, in here, we were taking a look at fraud. And then, you're talking about gross negligence and then dropping down to a negligence level. And all have implications on intent and so forth. Where we are is just a little bit lower than the fraud level that we saw originally in the credit rating agency we formed back of '06. So it's very livable. What we've always been concerned about is clarification of some of the language. When you talk about a reasonable investigation, what's the definition of reasonable investigation? Knowingly and recklessly, what constitutes that? And I think what we're seeing here is a sort of dust-settling period with the SEC, and I think yesterday's pronouncement of suspending AB requirements for six months is really -- okay, we've got to get our arms around all of this, and we've got to clarify certain language, and we've got to put things in place that does no harm and all that. And so, we're actually satisfied with where that is. And regardless, we think that we are in a good position to deal with that. As far as conflicts of interest and questions about the business model or things like that, we feel quite good. I mean, again, it's what you're trying to solve the equation for. If you're trying to solve the equation for higher transparency, which is a good thing, then you're going to go with the issuer-pay model. And you've just got to make sure because we disseminate all the information free around the world, so you get higher transparency. What you just got to make sure and obviously, being regulated, that you're compliance systems and your firewalls and all of that is very, very pronounced and clearly articulated. And that is exactly what the new overhaul reform bill articulates. They're going to be inspecting those compliance systems and the like, and we're working with various regulators to make sure that they understand our compliances systems and that they are in all of that. So that's what I think. So I don't see anything at this point in either the business model or any potential conflicts of interest that would surface."

But what we're focused on would be the revenue side, because the ongoing costs have already been adjusted. The one-time cost will subside, and then that should have a better situation."

I will review the second quarter results and the guidance, Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials and after the formal presentation, again, as Don said, we will be pleased to answer any questions or take any comments that you have about the McGraw-Hill Companies.
Earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.61 for the second quarter. That’s an increase of 17.3% compared to $0.52 last year. Of course, the $0.52 last year included a total $0.06 for a net restructuring charge and a loss on a divestiture.
Revenue of $1.5 billion was up 0.6% for the second quarter, but increased 2.7% if you exclude the divestitures of BusinessWeek and Vista Research. In the current environment, regulatory and legal matters are clearly top of mind issues with investors.
So, I will start this morning by reviewing developments in these areas and their impact on Financial Services, but let me say at the outset that regarding financial reform and legal issues, we are very pleased that this period of uncertainty is largely over.
With the signing of Dodd-Frank Act, we have now greater clarity on the new legal and regulatory landscape for credit rating agencies and that again is a welcome development. It reduces some of the uncertainty and gives us a clear picture of the way forward.
From our vantage point, some things are now clear. First, there were no surprises in the legislation. We’ve been at it for some time. Second, we have anticipated the key provisions becoming law for some time. Third, the new legislation calls for greater disclosure, accountability and oversight. These are all actions that we believe will increase confidence in the markets as well as in ratings.
In this period of change, Standard & Poor’s has been investing in systems and processes and people to prepare us to operate effectively in this new regulated environment to produce ratings that are relevant to investors, issuers and other market participants to compete effectively and to comply with regulations in all jurisdictions as well as being able to manage and mitigate risk.
Now, the key to meeting these regulatory requirements is S&P’s QCCR framework. Now, those initials, Q-C-C-R, stand for quality, criteria, compliance and risk.
Over the past few years, S&P has continually strengthened its QCCR framework within each of those four areas; that is, made establishing control groups independent of the ratings business and investing in staff, training, technology and processes around the QCCR function.
Let me elaborate. The ‘Q,’ the quality team uses formulized review procedures to oversee the integrity, quality and transparency of S&P’s ratings. The criteria team oversees the development and approval of criteria for our ratings that would include new and revised economic stress scenarios for the rating criteria to meeting emerging market and regulatory expectations.
In the compliance organization, there are now 50 people helping to monitor that S&P meets regulatory requirements through regular compliance examinations. They also provide training and guidance on policies and guidelines.
Finally, the risk control function is designed to assess various risks that could affect the integrity and quality of the ratings process. Risk control will also assess the feasibility of rating new types of securities.
More global regulation is expected, but our investment in the QCCR framework in recent years has created the foundation that S&P needs to implement the control and compliance function.
In short, not only is S&P well positioned now to deal with the pending changes it has a leveragable framework to deal with the new regulations. Last year S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR related items. In 2010 spending will increase by about $15 million or up to about $78 million.
At the beginning of the year we said we expected a decline of about 100 basis points in the operating margin for financial services. Despite additional cost the operating margin forecast has not changed. It reflects infrastructure investments and new regulatory requirements that we have anticipated.
Looking ahead there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with all the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
The new Dodd-Frank Act will require more changes. And let’s go through some of those changes and what they include. They include the elimination of statutory references in various U.S. laws to credit ratings. We supported this action.
Ratings across the globe should continue to provide investors a common and transparent language and a fundamental credit risk benchmark across sectors and geographies. Independent analytical insight and transparency is the key to our value proposition.
The repeal of the Rule 436(g), under this rule issuer’s of U.S. public offerings included the rating of a security and registration statements without triggering potential expert liability exposure for the credit rating agencies. In view of the new legal risk created by the repeal of 436(g), S&P will not consent to the inclusion of its ratings in registration statement and prospectuses.
In a new development as of yesterday by suspending Regulation AB requirements for six months, AB in asset-backed area, the SEC has given the market time to study potential solutions to the problem created by the repeal of 436(g), but S&P will explore many mechanisms outside of registration statements to allow ratings to continue to be disseminated to the debt market.
As always, S&P ratings on new issues and presale reports are available at no charge to all market participants on our website, and let me just give you those while we are at this point, simply log on to ww.standardandpoors.com/newissues, and another www.standardandpoors.com/presalesreports.
Another issue is the repeal of the exception to Regulation Fair Disclosure. Under this exception issuers could share material non-public information with rating agencies without violating Reg FD. There are other ways to satisfy Reg FD, so we can continue to receive confidential information as part of the ratings process and we’re currently evaluating those options.
The proposed change in the law that has attracted the most attention concerns new pleading standards in Federal Securities fraud suits brought against credit rating agencies. The legislation permits lawsuits against the credit rating agency that, knowingly or recklessly fail to conduct reasonable investigation or obtain reasonable verification of the day-to-day usage to determine a rating.
Undoubtedly, the new pleading standard will be tested at some point in the future. More litigation would obviously be burdensome and motions to this may be more difficult to achieve, but we will be ready to meet this new challenge.
Among other things, as I’ve already pointed out, S&P continues to make changes in its business to improve its procedures and control processes. But don’t lose sight of another crucial point. It is simply this. Ultimately, the current fraud liability standards still apply. That has not changed.
Let me be clear on this point. The new law changes what plaintiffs are required to allege in order to survive a motion to dismiss at the pleading stage. The law does not change what plaintiffs must ultimately prove to a judge or a jury in order for a credit rating agency to be held liable. That is the same federal securities fraud liability standard to which all market participants are subject to.
On the litigation front, the outright dismissals of current cases now stands at 13 and 5 cases have been just withdrawn. We believe these decisions constitute meaningful precedent.
Since our last update on litigation, there have been three important decisions involving S&P, two involve a subprime case and the third relates to S&P’s Index businesses and a grant of summary judgment that thwarts an assault on S&P’s intellectual property rights.
First, the Abu Dhabi subprime case and new rulings by Judge Scheindlin. Here, on June 15, she emphatically denied class action certification to the plaintiffs. In denying the motion for a class certification, the judge wrote and I quote ‘Defendants argue, with considerable force, against certifying the proposed class. As defendants point out, this action is a collection of a relatively small number of sophisticated, institutional investors that acquired one of three different categories of Rated Notes, at different times, pursuant to different internal requirements, and after conducting different due diligence inquiries.’
On July 20, she allowed the plaintiffs to reinstate one of the ten original claims against both the credit rating agencies and Morgan Stanley that she had previously dismissed with prejudice. In responding to the plaintiff’s motion to amend their complain, the judge concluded that she was mistaken in dismissing the aiding and abetting fraud claims because they are related to the allegations of fraud, the one claim that has been allowed to proceed.
There are three takeaways from the latest development. The first is that the decision does not affect the dismissal of the nine claims which were not based on fraud.
The court, secondly, has made no finding of fraud or aiding and abetting fraud. At this early stage of the case, the court’s ruling must be based on accepting the plaintiff’s assertion as true until you get to a discovery dialogue.
The third, the key issue here has not changed with the restoration of the aiding and abetting claim. The plaintiff still must prove fraud and we remain very confident that neither claim can be sustained.
The victory in the Illinois Circuit Court also was significant. Judge William Maki ruled that index providers are entitled to protection against the misappropriation of their indices. The International Securities Exchange, ISE, sought to offer options based on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Index without obtaining the license from the owner of these indices.
In his ruling, the judge observed, ‘It bears noting that ISE unabashedly admits to attempted to create a competitive product, the ISE 250, which was an index highly correlated to the S&P 500. After spending a large sum of money developing and promoting options on the ISE 250, ISE discontinued the project, which had failed to garner significant trading volume. The court fails to understand how ISE’s failure somehow entitles it to profit for free from the efforts, skills and reputation of the index providers.’ With that, on some of the regulatory and the legal issues, I will leave that for now and let’s move on to the operations.
Let’s begin and let’s take a look at the Financial Services operating results in the second quarter and their prospects for the second half of the year. Revenue at S&P Credit Markets Services was up 0.1% as a surge in syndicated leveraged bank loan ratings helped to offset continued softness in the structured finance market. The value of diversity was underscored by the 4.9% increase in revenue at S&P Investment Services.
For the second quarter at Financial Services, revenue increased by 1.6%, operating profit declined by 4.2%. The operating margin was 38.7%, compared to 41.0% last year, which reflected a pre-tax loss of $13.8 million from the divestiture of Vista Research and a pre-tax net benefit of $0.4 million from restructuring charges.
The second quarter started strongly and then softened in May and June as doubts grew about the pace of the economic recovery and uncertainty developed over European sovereigns and bank debt.
In this environment credit spreads for the investment in speculative grade bonds, and again, when we talk about credit spreads it’s the excess interest rate over the treasury bonds, began to widen after reaching two year lows at the end of the April. As this table shows both the investment and speculative-grade composite spreads were, on July 15, above their five-year daily moving averages.
The three months LIBOR rose to more than 0.5%, and by the way that’s the highest since the middle of 2009. Although the volume of bank loan ratings is still at the low end of its historical average, the market picked up substantially in the first half.
As this chart shows, the volume in syndicated leverage bank loans, which are rated BBB or lower, started climbing in the first quarter and accelerated in the second quarter of 2010. Bank loan activity was primarily meant to extend, to push up maturities.
The investment grade corporate market was soft in both Europe and in the United States, but refinancing requirements resulted in increased high-yield debt issuance in Europe. New issuance in the high-yield market increased 15.3% globally in the second quarter, with gains in European issuance more than offsetting the decline in U.S. issuance.
About 73% of the total U.S. high-yield volume in the second quarter was designated for refinancing. The structured finance market declined again in the second quarter and a key to the second half outlook is the wave of corporate debt coming due in the United States, and the European markets.
As these charts show, S&P estimates that U.S. and European debt maturities by dollar amounts will grow steadily through 2014. Looking ahead, S&P expects companies to take advantage of increased investor appetite for yield to either amend credit agreements to extend maturities or refinance bank debt with longer-dated high-yield debt.
Credit spreads will be a factor for the level of issuance in the second half. Stable or tightening spreads could spur some healthy issuance volume in the corporate sector. The outlook for public finances mix, taxable bonds, including the new Build America Bonds, will probably drive growth, although S&P expects traditional tax-exempt issuance to decline in the second half.
In structured finance, we may see a modest pickup in activity. There may be a slow rebirth of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market in the second half. That would be welcoming. In the near term, S&P expects to see re-REMIC activity continue in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market.
In the asset-backed securities market, activity could stall somewhat as various regulations are digested. The SEC’s Rule 17g-5 became effective on June 2 and the FDIC safe harbor rules which are expected to take effect in September. We also continue to monitor our competitive position in the marketplace.
In 2009, excluding sovereign issuance, S&P rated approximately 95% of the addressable debt issued in the United States. As this chart shows, S&P has performed consistently in the range for the last six years.
In the European market, S&P rated 89% of the addressable market last year, up from 83% in 2008. It is also worth noting that, at $1.8 trillion, the rated European debt market with fewer, but larger issues was actually bigger than the rated U.S. market, which is just over $1.5 trillion.
The market share performance underscores another important part about S&P’s track record. S&P provides a range of ratings from AAA to CCC, and if the initial credit opinion meets the test of time, you will see fewer defaults at the top of the scale and higher defaults at the lower end of the scale.
S&P tracks these default rates with great care and recently updated the tables on the Global Corporate Average Cumulative Default Rates from 1981 through 2009 and the Global Structured Finance Average Cumulative Default Rates from 1978 through 2009.
There is a lot of information on these two tables, which will appear in our new investor fact book next month. But the key point is unmistakable. In both corporate and structured finance, over long periods of time, the higher the S&P rating, the fewer defaults have been experienced. That’s the way it is supposed to be if S&P is doing its job properly.
In addition to defaults, S&P also looked at rating transition by conducting a comprehensive review of credit ratings, spanning the spectrum of corporate, government, structured finance debt. This report is entitled ‘Default, Transition, and Recovery - A Global Cross-Asset Report Card of Ratings Performance in Times of Stress.’ That was published last month.
This review demonstrated that ratings issued in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia for nearly all asset classes generally performed as expected, with the exception of ratings on the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities and on collateralized debt obligations backed by structured finance collateral.
That is rated credits withstood the recent financial crisis with results in line with expectations for the economic environment. In contrast, the performance of ratings for U.S. RMBS and CDOs issued from 2005 through 2007 have been disappointing and below our expectations.
Standard & Poor’s performance review reaffirms two key attributes of rating. First, even during periods of economic stress, ratings have been and continue to be reasonable predictors of the relative likelihoods of default of different credits. In short, credits with higher ratings generally experience lower default rates.
This trend held up across asset classes for the three stressful period studies in 1991, 2001, and the 2008 and 2009 period, with the exception of residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs during the recent crisis.
Second, sectors other than RMBS and CDOs did not experience disproportionate downgrades relative to the degree of economic stress. Downgrades typically increase in all sectors during periods of stress, but apart from residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs issued between 2005 and 2007, the pace was not exceptional.
Earlier in this presentation, I mentioned the value of diversity that S&P Investment Services brings to our portfolio. Nowhere is that more evident than in S&P indices, which are providing greater access to more markets for more investors around the world. The team at S&P indices is dedicated to finding new ways to grow the business.
With the expiration of a 10-year exclusive agreement with Barclays, S&P has recently licensed Vanguard to launch exchange credit funds based on our indices. Vanguard is introducing eight new exchange-traded funds, targeting growth and value segments of the S&P 500, and growth and value and blend segments of the S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600.
In May S&P licensed seven major European exchange-traded fund sponsors to create and list S&P 500 ETFs on major European exchanges for real-time trading. In the spring S&P licensed the national stock exchange, the NSE of India to create and list Indian rupee denominated futures contracts based on the S&P 500.
S&P will be adding new indices in commodities, fixed income, equities, strategy and customize others for its clients. The goal, an index for every type of investment.
So, let’s sum up for the Financial Services segment. New clarity on the regulatory and legal front, new requirements are manageable. Mid single-digit revenue growth for the segment versus our previous assessment of high single-digit growth due to some unanticipated softness in the market, with improvement in S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services, operating profit will improve.
Operating margin will decline approximately 100 basis points, and this reflects infrastructure investments and compliance with new regulatory requirements.
Let’s move on to McGraw Hill Education. McGraw Hill Education in the second quarter, a strong performance in the U.S. higher education market, and increases in the state new adoption market by the School Education Group were partially offset by declines in the open territory and the custom testing markets.
As a result, McGraw-Hill School Education Group’s revenue declined by 4%, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Professional and International Group’s revenue increased by 10.8%.
For this segment in the second quarter, revenue increased by 1.8%, but the gain in the U.S. higher education market had a substantial impact in the second quarter on operating profit, which grew to $51.6 million and on operating margin, which increased to 9.1%.
That compares to an operating profit for the second quarter of 2009 of $21 million, which included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $11.6 million and an operating margin of 3.8%.
State budget pressures continue to be a factor in this year’s elementary high school market. As we had expected, only the state new adoption market will show solid growth this year, but here too, funding concerns are driving reduced purchasing levels.
As the spring adoption season progressed, it became clear that fewer California districts would be making new reading, literature or math purchases than originally projected.
South Carolina’s math adoption was effectively cancelled in the second quarter, when the legislature did not provide funding and many districts in Indiana decided to postpone buying math this year. District activity has been limited in other states as well, including Georgia and Oklahoma.
In view of these conditions, we’re adjusting our estimates for 2010. We are now expecting the state new adoption market to range from $825 million to $875 million, and our previous forecast had been $875 million to $925 million.
We now look for the el-hi market now to grow by 4% to 6%, down from our previous forecast of 6% to 7%. The market’s growth will come from the increase of nearly 70% in state new adoption sales. We still anticipate declines in both open territory sales and residual sales.
The McGraw-Hill School Group still expects to capture about 30% of the state new adoption business this year. The biggest opportunities as we know are in Texas, Florida, and even despite the market shrinkage there, in California as well.
In Texas, we are forecasting a capture rate of about 40% of the K-5 reading market and about 18% of the 6-12 literature market. Some of those orders were deferred and will be shipped in the third quarter. So we’ll see that pick up there.
In Florida, we anticipate winning 40% of the 6-8 math market, about 27% of the 9-12 market, but only 5% of the K-5 market. In California, strong performances by our California Treasures program and Imagine It program should enable us to capture more than half the available dollars in the state for new K-5 reading program.
In smaller states, the McGraw-Hill School Group expects to capture more than 40% of Mississippi’s K-12 science adoption and more than 60% of West Virginia’s K-12 math adoption. While math postponements have been heavy in Indiana and Oklahoma, we are winning substantial shares in those states, particularly at the 6-12 grade level.
The School Group has been strong historically in non-academic subjects as well, and this year is no exception. We are seeing good capture rates in family and consumer sciences, technical education and business and computer education. In testing, growth in the formative market was offset by planned phase outs of statewide custom contracts in Florida and in Arizona.
The increase in federal funds for education remains one of the wildcards in this market. There is no doubt that the federal government is continuing to pump significant dollars into the education market. The availability and the ultimate use of these funds are developments that we are tracking very carefully and we’ll keep you informed as we go.
The massive stimulus program passed last year; now that was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or ARRA, has $11.5 billion available for distribution to the states in 2010 through phase two of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. This fund is intended to supplement education budgets in the fiscal year that has just begun in most states.
Last year, most of the phase one funds were used to save teaching jobs, and we believe that the same will be true on the phase two funds this year, but the ARRA stimulus legislation is also funding other programs that will release new dollars in 2010, Race to the Top grants at $4 billion, common core assessment grants at $350 million and investing for innovation grants at $650 million.
In addition, states are receiving school improvement grants from a $3.5 billion program funded by stimulus dollars and the U.S Department of Education’s current budget. To-date, 32 states and the District of Columbia have been approved for these grants, which are earmarked for low-performing schools.
For the McGraw-Hill School Education Group, these grant programs offer potential for both assessment and instructional material. For example, all Race to the Top proposals, including formative testing, so states will require these products and services. Our formative products, such as Acuity, Yearly ProgressPro and Writing Roadmap, and our reporting services, such as the Parent Network, are naturals to meet the market’s needs.
At the same time, our research-based instructional and intervention products, such as Number Worlds and Reading Mastery, are proven solutions for turning around low-performing schools. Timing will vary for each of these programs, but some revenues stemming for School Improvement and Investing in Innovation grants could begin to show up by at least the fourth quarter.
All this is developing as the states embrace common course standards for K-12 math and for reading and language arts. To-date, 23 states have adopted these standards and more are expected to follow in August. More than 40 states are expected to sign on by the end of this year - very important development.
As a result of all this activity, we expect to see an expansion of digital delivery systems for instructional materials, professional development and classroom level assessment, and we like these opportunities. In higher education the digital opportunity is big and it’s getting bigger. Our revenue in this space is growing at a double-digit rate. The McGraw-Hill Connect family of homework management and assessment programs are currently being used by 1.8 million students and instructors.
Now, by creating a partnership with Blackboard, we will dramatically increase the reach and ease of access for our suite of digital products on U.S. campuses. As the clear leader in course management, Blackboard reaches 70% to 80% of the U.S. college and university market.
Students and faculty will be able to use a single Blackboard log on to gain access to our content and tools. Scores on McGraw-Hill Connect assignments, quizzes, tests will post directly to the Blackboard grade book, eliminating the need for students and instructors to mange access and updates on two separate systems.
We’re off to a solid start this year in the U.S. college and university market and while a strong performance earlier in this year puts us in a good position, it is not necessarily a parameter of full year results, those will be determined by the heavy ordering season that we have just entered into.
We have benefited so far this year from last fall’s surge in enrollments, which carried through into the spring semester. While we think fall enrollments will continue at this higher level, no further surge is projected. That is why we expect the market to grow by 5%-7% despite the very strong start to the year.
In professional markets, digital products are also producing double-digit growth. We now have 5,000 eBooks available, and their sales accelerated last April following the introduction of the Apple iPad. The eBook is on its way to becoming a staple of the business-to-consumer market as individuals increasingly discover the convenience of downloading content to e-reading devices.
Digital products are also growing rapidly in the business-to-business market. Here the content is assessed on a platform that is updated with new speeds, augmented with video, and rich with searchable information and professionals required to remain current with developments in their fields.
Our growing family of access products offers a growing array of professional resources in medicine, engineering and business.
So, let’s sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key markets in 2010, 4%-6% in the elementary high school market, 5%-7% in the U.S. college market, segment revenue low single-digit growth, down from previous guidance of 6%-7% growth, given a more challenging el-hi market, operating margin unchanged from 2009.
Finally, let’s now take a look at the Information & Media segment. The growth of our global energy information business, an increase in television and advertising, and the continuing impact of the BusinessWeek divestiture were keys to the segment’s second quarter performance.
For the second quarter revenue declined by 5.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek grew by 7.4%. Operating profit increased by $33.1 million to $47.5 million, compared to $14.4 million for the same period last year, and by the way that included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $4 million. The operating margin was 21.2% compared to 6.1% for the same period last year.
The Business-to-Business Group’s revenue declined by 7.8%, but excluding BusinessWeek grew by 5.6%. In volatile energy markets the demand for Platts’ data and information product continues to produce solid growth both in the United States and in international markets.
To keep its clients abreast of the changing marketplace Platts is also introducing new information services. The Bakken Shale formation in the Central U.S. is one of the new sources of regional oil for our nation’s refiners.
In the second quarter Platts began publishing the world’s first price assessment for crude oil produced from the Bakken Shale formation. Platts also began publishing daily price assessments for liquefied natural gas imported to Southwest Europe and to Northwest Europe, two very key consumer regions.
For broadcasting second quarter revenue increased by 24%, compared to the period last year. National, local and political time sales all contributed to the growth. Pickup in automotive advertising was a key factor in improvement in local and national advertising. Political advertising benefited from the June 8 primary in California and a contest for Governor in that State.
In the third quarter, political advertising should again be strong. There is an August 10, primary in Colorado, and spending for the senate race and proposition is expected to be key drivers.
Summing up then for the Information & Media, 2009 sale of BusinessWeek is having a positive impact on revenue and operating margins. Revenue - expect a mid single-digit decline, but excluding BusinessWeek, revenue will increase in the mid single-digit range. Operating margin - expect to rebound into the mid-teens.
Therefore, summing up overall now for the McGraw-Hill Companies, our previous earnings per diluted share guidance for 2010 was $2.55 to $2.65. Due to the choppiness in some of our key market, we now expect to finish the year at the lower end of that range.
That concludes a review of our operations and various situations. Let’s turn it over now to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer and our other financial matters. Bob?

There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies’ financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow was building. There is no short-term debt outstanding, no long-term debt comes d",1733,"Thank you, Terry. There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies’ financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow was building. There is no short-term debt outstanding, no long-term debt comes due until 2012, and in the second quarter we started repurchasing shares.
We repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total cost of $186.9 million at an average price of $28.76 per share. This is the first time we’ve repurchased shares since the third quarter of 2008. 10.6 million shares remain in the 2007 program authorized by the Board of Directors.
Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $313.2 million in the second quarter, relatively flat versus the prior year as the second quarter share repurchases were offset by issuance related to employee plans as well as stock price appreciation.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined $3.1 million from the first quarter reflecting the weighted impact of second quarter share repurchases. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 310 million.
We continue to be well capitalized with a net debt position as of June 30 of $53 million. This shift to a net debt position from the end of the first quarter is driven primarily by funding for share repurchases.
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.145 billion, while gross debt was comprised of $1.198 billion in senior notes. Our debt is comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes and there is no commercial paper outstanding, again, as I mentioned earlier.
The outlook for the free cash flow continues to improve. To calculate free cash flow, we start with after-tax cash from operations and deduct working capital, investments and dividends. What’s left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt.
In the first half of 2010, we generated free cash flow of $98 million. That’s an improvement of $61 million from the prior year due to improved operating results and a continuing focus on asset management.
We now expect free cash flow for the year in the range of $600 million to $650 million versus our previous guidance of $550 million to $600 million. The improvement is driven by reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated. 2009 full year free cash flow was $770 million.
We generate the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year because of the seasonality of our education business. Our guidance implies second half free cash flow. It will be roughly $500 million to $550 million, which is lower than the prior year due to increased investments and more challenging working capital comparisons during that second half.
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we still anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. We now expect an increase in pension expense to approximately $15 million versus our previous estimate of $20 million.
Now, let’s look at our segment expenses, particularly in the context of the reduced revenue outlook from McGraw-Hill Education and Financial Services. Now, as a reminder, I’ll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth excluding the 2009 restructuring charges as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek.
So, let’s start now with Education. Second quarter adjusted expenses declined 1.8% and the first half adjusted expenses declined 2.1%. At constant currencies, the first half declines are actually larger at 3.1%.
The segment benefited from savings from last year’s strategy to combine our core Basel Publishing operations with our alternative Basel and supplemental publishing operations, as well as reduced expenses due to the planned phase out of statewide custom contracts in California, Florida and Arizona.
Increases in selling and marketing costs in the second quarter for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings.
For the full year 2010, as Terry indicated, we now expect segment revenue growth in the low single digits versus our previous guidance of 6% to 7% increase. Despite the reduced revenue growth, we are maintaining our guidance of an unchanged adjusted operating margin as we now anticipate expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to our previous guidance of a 6% to 7% increase.
Our full year guidance implies that second half expense will be in the mid single digits, driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs because of the state adoption calendar as well as cycling through the phase out of the previously mentioned statewide custom contracts.
Additionally, we continue to ramp up investment in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at Higher Education and Professional in order to provide value and choices for our customers. For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 9.4% in the second quarter and 10.8% at constant currencies. First half expenses increased 8.5%.
Expense increase was driven by increased salaries and occupancy costs mainly from our international hires and increased incentive compensation. For the full year 2010, we now expect expenses to increase roughly 7% to 8%, down slightly versus our previous guidance of roughly 9% to 10%.
The expense growth is largely driven by continued investment in our fast-growing businesses, the carryover impact of 2009 hires as well as planned hires for 2010 and additional investments to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.
Our expense guidance assumes approximately $15 million in additional cost related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives, which will occur mostly in the second half of the year.
As Terry indicated, there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
At Information & Media, second quarter and first half adjusted expenses declined 18.9% and 19.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced second quarter revenue by $27.5 million and expenses by $38.5 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $11 million in the quarter.
For the first half, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $55 million and expenses by $78 million, for a positive impact of roughly $23 million. This segment also benefited from restructuring actions taken in 2009.
For the full year, Information & Media will reflect savings from BusinessWeek divestiture of approximately $38 million. For 2010 reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teen versus 2009 adjusted expenses.
Corporate expense in the second quarter was $37.6 million, an $8.3 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased excess space, increased incentive compensation and growth in selected support functions. For the first half, corporate was $73.4 million, which is a $10.6 million increase.
For the full year, we continue to expect corporate expense to increase about $25 million to $30 million and the primary reason for the increase is driven by the higher excess space for New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as excess space from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.
Let’s now turn to investments where we are expecting increases in the second half. Pre-pub investments were $30 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $12 million, compared to the second quarter of 2009. in first half we invested $20 million, which is a $25 million decrease. The decline is largely due to timing as we expect increased pre-publication investments in the second half of the year.
For 2010, we now expect pre-pub investments of approximately $195 million to $205 million, an $18 million to $28 million increase versus 2009, but on the other hand this investment is $30 million less than our previous estimates of $225 million to $235 million, reflecting the fact that with changes in the state adoption call schedules, investments are being delayed to better align with projected opportunities.
In addition, we continue to benefit from combing our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Purchase of property and equipment were $14.5 billion in the second quarter, a $6 million increases versus the second quarter of last year. First half purchases of property and equipment were $22 million.
We expect increased investments in the second half and continue to expect that on a full year basis, expenditures will be approximately $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and the increase is largely driven by technology spending.
Now, let’s take a look at the non-cash items; amortization of pre-publication cost was $69 million in the second quarter, which is a $2 million decrease versus last year. In 2010, we continue to expect $260 million to $265 million versus $270 million last year.
Depreciation was $26 million in the second quarter versus $29 million the previous quarter of last year. We continue to expect depreciation to be roughly $115 million versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $13 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $23 million for the first half and we expect for the full year about $40 million.
Net interest expense was approximately $21 million in the second quarter, compared to $18.5 million in the same period last year, and $22 million in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was $77 million
Regarding the company’s effective tax rate, during the second quarter and the first half of 2010 it was 36.4%, which was unchanged from 2009, and that’s what we expect to see for the full year.
Our unearned revenue continues to grow, ending the quarter at $1.1 billion, which is up 4.2% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of the divestiture of BusinessWeek, the growth was 7%.
Unearned revenue was impacted by a deferral of revenue at McGraw-Hill Education’s School Education Group, where shipping will be completed in the third quarter. Excluding this impact, unearned revenue would have grown at approximately 3.5%.
Financial Services continues to represent 73% of the Corporation’s total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single-digits as strong growth in ratings related information, S&P indices and Capital IQ offset declines at credit ratings and equity research products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue.
Thank you and now back to Terry.

First of all, on the S&P issuance whether you’re talking corporate governance, munis, structured finance, the story for the first part of the year, as we all know, January through the end of April was very strong. Quite frankly, we were a little surprised by it on that one. Again, what it did is it led into a May, June, July period of softness. It was a lot slower than we anticipated on that one and we’ll just have to see going forward. I think it reflects a little bit of Fed Chairman Bernanke’s comment when he has talking about entering into a summer law of more modest recovery. We’ll have to see. We have to see what the effect of some of the economic recovery and some of the effect that that’s going to have on business investment and what that means then for issuance.
Right now, it’s pretty soft, and again, the charts and the slides show that. We’re not going to anticipate stronger issuance at this point. If it comes, it will obviously offset any additional cost and should improve margin, but we’ll just stay tuned at this point on that one.
Competitive issues, Brian, on S&P, no, again, when you talk about the extensiveness globally of providing credit rating services, it is a huge undertaking. We carry some 1,300 analysts around the world that are providing all of these functions. So, for new entrants, that’s a big hurdle to get over. We’re hearing on the fringe of a lot of different people that would like to get involved or be a part of or is something like that, but we’re not seeing anything from a competitive standpoint that concerns us from that point. On the textbook side, Brian, what was the question?

More people have gone back to school. More people are staying longer, and therefore, we’re entering into a period that I think should be very advantageous for us. We would see, but it also gives us a lot of upside in terms of some of the new things we’re doing, very pleased with the online learning platforms, like McGraw Hill Connect. It is doing extremely well especially at the community college level. That part is good.
Also what we’re seeing is increased activity in the Educational Services area. These are online learning platforms that are very, targeted toward professional skills in places like India and China where to get certain jobs you have to have certain skill sets and we can rifle shoot in with online learning platforms, and we’re seeing a lot of success in that as well. I think it’s a good situation, but we just have to stay tuned.
On the K-12 side, it really is going to depend on some of the Recovery Act and Federal stimulus. There’s $11.5 billion that is scheduled for spending in 2010. Certainly, I think teacher jobs are part of it, but I think also, we ought to see some very, very important support in some of the key states. So we’ll see. The higher ed is going to clearly be the winner of the year.

As you know, in terms of depleting standards we were a taking a look at fraud and then you’re talking about gross negligence and then dropping down to a negligence level, and all have implications on intent, and so forth. Where we are is just a little bit lower than the fraud level that we saw originally in our Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of ‘06. So, it’s very livable.
What we’ve always been concerned about is clarification of some of the language. When you talk about a reasonable investigation, what’s the definition of reasonable investigation, knowingly and recklessly, what constitutes that? I think what we’re seeing here is a sort of dust settling period with the SEC.
I think yesterday’s pronounced suspending AB requirements for six month is really, okay, we’ve got to get our arms around all of this and we got to clarify certain language, and we’ve got to put things in place that does no harm and all that. So, we’re actually, satisfied with where that is and regardless we think that, we are in a good position to deal with that.
As far as conflicts of interests and questions about the business model or things like that, we feel quite good. again, it’s what you’re trying to solve the equation for. If you’re trying to solve the equation for higher transparency, which is a good thing, then you’re going to go with the issuer pay model. You just got to make sure, because we disseminate all the information free around the world, so you get higher transparency, but you just got to make sure and obviously being regulated, that your compliance systems and your firewalls and all of that is very, very pronounced and clearly articulated.
That is exactly what the new Overhaul Reform Bill articulates, that they are going to be inspecting those compliances and the like. We’re working with various regulators to make sure they understand our compliances and that they are and all of that. So, that’s what it is. So I don’t see anything at this point in either of the business model or in any potential conflicts of interest that would surface.

We’ve also seen some of the smaller states, Oklahoma, for example, cut back, but overall we’re still seeing a pretty good number. Now, we dropped the new state adoption number to 825 to 875 down from 875 to 925 just to reflect some of that, but you still have strong representation from Texas and Florida and the market share numbers there. So, it is fluid.
And the Recovery Act dollars, as we were saying, at $11.5 billion is being sent to the states on, obviously, a variety of uses, but we feel pretty confident that instructional materials and testing materials are going to be a part of that.

The majority of the costs, the one-time costs have already been taken in terms of compliance systems and all of those kinds of things. So, we’re still studying on what some of the ramifications of some of the new rules might have, especially on staffing and things like that, but if there is a pressure on margins, we think they are going to be very modest at this point.
So, once the one-time costs are gone and your run rate is already being adjusted on that part and if revenue through new issuance picks up, that should all go straight to the bottom line and that would be margin improvement, but we’re being cautious at this point with revenue and transaction and direction, because we just got to see a little bit more in terms of how this recovery takes place. What we’re focused on would be the revenue side, because the ongoing costs have already been adjusted, the one-time costs will subside, and then that should have a better situation.

I will review the second quarter results and the guidance. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials. And after the formal presentation, again, as Don said, we'll be pleased to answer any questions or take any comments that you have about The McGraw-Hill Companies.
Earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.61 for the second quarter, and that's an increase of 17.3% compared to $0.52 last year. And of course, that $0.52 last year included a total of $0.06 for a net restructuring charge and a loss on a divestiture. Revenue of $1.5 billion was up 0.6% for the second quarter, but increased 2.7% if you exclude the divestitures of BusinessWeek and Vista Research.
In the current environment, regulatory and legal matters are clearly top-of-mind issues with investors, so I will start this morning by reviewing developments in these areas and their impact on financial services. But let me say at the outset that regarding financial reform and legal issues, we are pleased, very pleased that this period of uncertainty is largely over. With the signing of the Dodd-Frank Act, we have now greater clarity on the new legal and regulatory landscape for credit rating agencies and that again, is a welcome development. It reduces some of the uncertainty and gives us a clear picture of the way forward.
From our vantage point, some things are not clear. First, there were no surprises in the legislation, we've been at it for sometime. Second, we have anticipated the key provisions becoming law for sometime. And third, the new legislation calls for greater disclosure, accountability and oversight. These are all actions that we believe will increase confidence in the markets as well as in ratings.
In this period of change, Standard & Poor's has been investing in systems and processes and people to prepare us; to operate effectively in this new regulated environment; to produce ratings that are relevant to investors, issuers and other market participants; to compete effectively and to comply with regulations in all jurisdictions as well as being able to manage and mitigate risk.
Now the key to meeting these regulatory requirements is S&P's QCCR framework. Now those initials, QCCR, stands for Quality, Criteria, Compliance and Risk. And over the past few years, S&P has continually strengthened its QCCR framework within each of those four area that has met establishing control groups independent of the Ratings business, and investing in staff, training, technology and processes around the QCCR function, and let me elaborate.
The Q, the quality team uses formulized review procedures to oversee the integrity, quality and transparency of S&P's ratings. The criteria team oversees the development and approval of criteria for our ratings that would include new and revised economic-stress scenarios for the rating criteria to meeting emerging market and regulatory expectations. In the compliance organization, they're now about 50 people helping to monitor that S&P meets regulatory requirements through regular compliance examinations. They also provide training and guidance on policies and guidelines. And finally, the risk control function is designed to assess various risk that could affect the integrity and quality of the ratings process. Risk control will also assess the feasibility of rating new types of securities.
More global regulation is expected, but our investment in the QCCR framework in recent years has created the foundation that S&P needs to implement the control and compliance function. In short, not only is S&P well positioned now to deal with the pending changes, it has a leverageable framework to deal with the new regulations. Last year, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. In 2010, spending will increase by about $15 million or up to about $78 million.
At beginning of the year, we said we expected a decline of about 100 basis points in the operating margin for Financial Services. Despite additional cost, the operating margin forecast has not changed, and reflects infrastructure investments and new regulatory requirements that we have anticipated.  Looking ahead, there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with all the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
The new Dodd-Frank Act will require more changes, and let's go through some of those changes and what they include. They include the elimination of statutory references in various U.S. laws to credit ratings, we supported this action. Ratings across the globe should continue to provide investors a common and transparent language, and a fundamental credit-risk benchmark across sectors and geographies. Independent analytical insight and transparency are the key to our value proposition.
Another issue, the repeal of the Rule 436(g). Under this rule, issuers of U.S. public offerings included the rating of a security in registration statements without triggering potential expert liability exposure for the credit rating agencies. In view of the new legal risk created by the repeal of 436(g), S&P will not consent to the inclusion of its ratings in registrations statement and prospectuses. And in a new development as of yesterday, by suspending Regulation AB requirements for six months, AB in the asset-backed area, the SEC has given the market time to study potential solutions to the problem created by the repeal of 436(g). But S&P will explore many mechanisms outside of registration statements to allow ratings to continue to be disseminated to the debt market. As always, S&P ratings on new issues and presale reports are available, at no charge, to all market participants on our website. And let me just give you those while we're at this point, simply log on to www.standard&poors.com/newissues and another, www.standard&poors.com/presalesreports.
Another issue is the repeal of the exception to Regulation Fair Disclosure. Under this exception, issuers could share material nonpublic information with rating agencies without violating Reg FD. There are other ways to satisfy Reg FD so we can continue to receive confidential information as part of the ratings process, and we're currently evaluating those options. The proposed change in the law that has attracted the most attention concerns new pleading standards and federal securities fraud suits brought against credit rating agencies. The legislation permits lawsuits against the credit rating agency that, ""knowingly or recklessly failed to conduct a ""reasonable investigation"" or obtain reasonable verification of the data it uses to determine a rating."" Undoubtedly, the new pleading standard will be tested at some point in the future. More litigation would obviously be burdensome and motions to dismiss may be more difficult to achieve, but we will be ready to meet this new challenge.
Among other things, as I've already pointed out, S&P continues to make changes in its business to improve its procedures and control processes. But don't lose sight of another crucial point, it is simply this: Ultimately, the current fraud liability standards still applies, that has not changed. And let me be clear on this point. The new law changes what plaintiffs are required to allege in order to survive a motion to dismiss at the pleading stage. The law does not change what plaintiffs must ultimately prove to a judge or a jury in order for a credit rating agency to be held liable. And that is the same federal securities fraud liability standard to which all market participants are subject to.
On the litigation front, the outright dismissals of current cases now stands at 13, and five cases have been just withdrawn. We believe these decisions constitute meaningful precedent. Since our last update on litigation, there have been three important decisions involving S&P. Two involve a subprime case and the third, relates to S&P's Index businesses and a grant of summary judgment that thwarts an assault on S&P's intellectual property rights.
First, the Abu Dhabi subprime case and new rulings by Judge Scheindlin. Here on June 15, she emphatically denied class-action certification to the plaintiffs. In denying the motion for class certification, the judge wrote, ""defendants argue with considerable force against the certifying the proposed class. As defendants point out, this action is a collection of a relatively small number of sophisticated institutional investors that acquired one of three different categories of rated notes at different times, pursuant to different internal requirements and after conducting different due diligence inquiries.""
On July 20, she allowed the plaintiffs to reinstate one of the 10 original claims against both the credit rating agencies and Morgan Stanley that she had previously dismissed with prejudice. In responding to the plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint, the judge concluded that she was mistaken in dismissing the aiding and abetting fraud claim because they are related to the allegations of fraud, the one claim that has been allowed to proceed.
There are three takeaways from the latest development. The first is that the decision does not affect the dismissal of the nine claims which were not based on fraud. The court, secondly, has made no finding of fraud or aiding and abetting fraud. At this early stage in the case, the court's ruling must be based on accepting the plaintiffs' assertion as true until you get to a discovery dialog. The third, the key issue here has not changed with the restoration of the aiding and abetting claim. The plaintiff still must prove fraud, and we remain very confident that neither claim can be sustained.
The victory in the Illinois Circuit Court also was significant. Judge William MaKi ruled that index providers are entitled to protection of misappropriation of their indices. The International Securities Exchange, ISE, sought to offer options based on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Index without obtaining a license from the owners of these indices. In his ruling, the judge observed, ""it bears noting that ISE unabashedly admits to attempted to create a competitive product, the ISE 250, which is an index highly correlated to the S&P 500. After spending a large sum of money developing and promoting options on the ISE 250, ISE discontinued the project which had failed to garner significant trading volume. The court fails to understand how ISE's failure somehow entitles it to profit for free from the efforts, skills and reputation of the index providers.""
With that, on some of the regulatory and legal issues, I will leave that for now, and let's move on to the operations. Let's begin and let's take a look at the Financial Services operating results in the second quarter and the prospects for the second half of the year. 
Revenue at S&P Credit Market Services was up 0.1% as a surge in syndicated-leverage-bank-loan ratings helped offset continued softness in the structured finance market. The value of diversity was underscored by the 4.9% increase in revenue at S&P Investment Services. For the second quarter at Financial Services, revenue increased by 1.6%, operating profit declined by 4.2%. The operating margin was 38.7% compared to 41.0% last year, which reflected a pretax loss of $13.8 million from the divestiture of Vista Research and a pretax net benefit of $0.4 million from restructuring charges.
The second quarter started strongly, and then softened in May and June as doubts grew about the pace of economic recovery and uncertainty developed over European sovereigns and bank debt. In this environment, credit spreads for the investment and speculative-grade bonds, and again, when we talk about credit spreads, it's the excess interest over the treasury bonds, began to widen after reaching two-year lows at the end of April. As this table shows, both the investment and speculative-grade composite spreads were, on July 15, above their five-year daily moving averages. The three-month LIBOR rose to more than 0.5% and by the way, that's the highest since the middle of 2009. Although the volume of bank loan ratings is still at the low end of its historical average, the market picked up substantially in the first half. As this chart shows, the volume in syndicated-leveraged bank loans, which are rated BBB or lower, started climbing in the first quarter and accelerated in the second quarter of 2010. Bank loan activity was primarily amend to extend the push out maturities.
The investment-grade corporate market was soft in both Europe and in the United States, but refinancing requirements resulted in increased high-yield debt issuance in Europe. New issuance in the high-yield market increased 15.3% globally in the second quarter, with gains in European issuance more than offsetting the decline in U.S. issuance. About 73% of the total U.S. high-yield volume in the second quarter was designated for refinancing. The structured finance market declined again in the second quarter, and a key to the second half outlook is the wave of corporate debt coming due in the United States and the European markets.
As these charts show, S&P estimates that U.S. and European debt maturities, by dollar amounts, will grow steadily through 2014. Looking ahead, S&P expects companies to take advantage of increased investor appetite for yield to either amend credit agreements to extend maturities or refinance bank debt with longer-dated, high-yield debt.
Credit spreads will be a factor for the level of issuance in the second half. Stable or tightening spreads could spur some healthy issuance volume in the corporate sector. The outlook for public finance is mixed. Taxable bonds, including the new Build America Bonds, will probably drive growth, although S&P expects traditional tax exempt issuance to decline in the second half.
In Structured Finance, we may see a modest pickup in activity. There may be a slow rebirth of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market in the second half. That would be welcoming. In the near term, S&P expects to see re-REMIC activity continue in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market.
In the asset-backed securities market, activity could stall somewhat as various regulations are digested. The SEC's Rule 17g5 became effective on June 2, and the FDIC Safe Harbor rules which are expected to take effect in September. We also continue to monitor our competitive position in the marketplace.
In 2009, excluding sovereign issuance, S&P rated approximately 95% of the addressable debt issued in the United States. As this chart shows, S&P has performed consistently in the range for the last six years. In the European market S&P rated 89% of the addressable market last year, up from 83% in 2008.  It is also worth noting that at $1.8 trillion, the rated European debt market, with fewer but larger issues, was actually bigger than the rated U.S. market which is just over $1.5 trillion. 
The market share performance underscores another important part about S&P's track record. S&P provides a range of ratings from AAA to CCC. And if the initial credit opinion meets the test of time, you will see fewer defaults at the top of the scale and higher defaults at the lower end of the scale. S&P tracks these default rates with great care, and recently updated the tables on the global corporate average cumulative default rate from 1981 through 2009 and the global structured finance average cumulative default rate from 1978 to 2009. There is a lot of information on these two tables, which will appear in our new Investor Fact Book next month, but the key point is unmistakable. In both Corporate and Structured Finance, over long periods of time, the higher the S&P rating, the fewer defaults have been experienced. That's the way it is supposed to be if S&P is doing its job properly.
In addition to defaults, S&P also looked at rating transition by conducting a comprehensive review of credit ratings spanning the spectrum of corporate, government, structured finance debt. This report is entitled, ""Default, Transition and Recovery: A Global Cross Asset Report Card of Ratings Performance in Times of Stress"", and that was published last month. This review demonstrated that ratings issued in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia for nearly all asset classes generally performed as expected, with the exception of ratings on the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities and on collateralized debt obligations backed by structured finance collateral. That is, rated credits withstood the recent financial crisis with results in line with expectations for the economic environment. In contrast, the performance of ratings for U.S. RMBS and CDOs issued from 2005 through 2007 have been disappointing and below our expectations. 
Standard & Poor's performance review reaffirms two key attributes of rating. First, even during periods of economic stress, ratings have been and continue to be reasonable predictors of the relative likelihoods of default or different credits. In short, credits with higher ratings generally experienced lower default rates. This trend held up across asset classes for the three stressful period studied in 1991, 2001 and the 2008-2009 period, with the exception of residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs during the recent crisis.
Second, sectors other than RMBS and CDOs did not experience disproportionate downgrades relative to the degree of economic stress. Downgrades typically increased in all sectors during periods of stress, but apart from residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs issued between 2005 and 2007, the pace was not exceptional.
Earlier in this presentation, I mentioned the value of diversity that S&P Investment Services brings to our portfolio. Nowhere is that more evident than in S&P indices which are providing greater access to more markets for more investors around the world. The team at S&P indices is dedicated to finding new ways to grow the business. With the expiration of a 10-year exclusive agreement with Barclays, S&P has recently licensed Vanguard to launch exchange-traded funds based in our indices. Vanguard is introducing eight new exchange-traded funds targeting Growth and Value segments of the S&P 500, and Growth and Value and Blend segments of the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600.
In May, S&P licensed seven major European exchange-traded fund sponsors to create and list S&P 500 ETFs on major European exchanges for real-time trading. In the spring, S&P licensed the National Stock Exchange, the NSE of India, to create and list Indian rupee-denominated futures contracts based on the S&P 500. S&P will be adding new indices in commodities, fixed income, equities, strategy and customize others for its clients. The goal, an index for every type of investment.
So let's sum up for the Financial Services segment. New clarity on the regulatory and legal front, new requirements are manageable, mid single-digit revenue growth for the segment versus our previous estimate of high single-digit growth due to some unanticipated softness in the market. With improvement at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services, operating profit will improve. Operating margin will decline approximately 100 basis points. And this reflects infrastructure investments in compliance with new regulatory requirements.
All right. Let's move on to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education in the second quarter, a strong performance in the U.S. Higher Education market, and increases in the state new adoption market by the School Education Group were partially offset by declines in the open territory and the custom-testing markets. As a result, McGraw-Hill School Education Group's revenue declined by 4%.  McGraw-Hill Higher Education and Professional and International Group's revenue increased by 10.8%. 
For the segment in the second quarter, revenue increased by 1.8%, but the gain in the U.S. Higher Education market had a substantial impact in the second quarter operating profit, which grew to $51.6 million and an operating margin which increased to 9.1%. That compares to an operating profit for the second quarter of 2009 of $21 million which included a pretax restructuring charge of $11.6 million and an operating margin of 3.8%.
State budget pressures continue to be a factor in this year's elementary-high school market. As we had expected, only the state new adoption market will show solid growth this year. But here too, funding concerns are driving reduced purchasing levels. As the spring adoption season progressed, it became clear that fewer California districts would be making new reading, literature or math purchases than originally projected. South Carolina's math adoption was effectively canceled in the second quarter when the legislature did not provide funding, and many districts in Indiana decided to postpone buying math this year. District activity has been limited in other states as well, including Georgia and Oklahoma.
In view of these conditions, we are adjusting our estimates for 2010. We are now expecting the state new adoption market to range from $825 million to $875 million, and our previous forecast has have $875 million to $925 million. We now look for the el-hi [elementary-high school] market now to grow by 4% to 6%, down from our previous forecast of 6% to 7%. The market's growth will come from the increase of nearly 70% in state new adoption sales. We still anticipate declines in both open territory sales and residual sales.
The McGraw-Hill School Group [McGraw-Hill School Education Group] still expects to capture about 30% of the state new adoption business this year. The biggest opportunities as we know are in Texas, Florida, and even despite the market shrinkage there, in California as well. 
In Texas, we are forecasting a capture rate of about 40% of the K-5 reading market and about 18% of the 6-12 literature market. Some of those orders were deferred and will be shipped in the third quarter, so we'll see that pick up there. In Florida, we anticipate winning 40% of the 6-8 math market, about 27% of the 9-12 market, but only 5% of the K-5  market. In California, strong performances by our California Treasures program and Imagine It! program should enable us to capture more than half the available dollars in the state for new K-5 reading program.
In smaller states, the McGraw-Hill School Group expects to capture more than 40% of Mississippi's K-12 science adoption and more than 60% of West Virginia's K-12 math adoption. And while math postponements have been heavy in Indiana and Oklahoma, we are winning substantial shares in those states, particularly at the 6-12 grade level.
The School Group has been strong historically in non-academic subjects as well, and this year is no exception. We're seeing good capture rates in family and consumer sciences, technical education and business and computer education. In Testing, growth in the formative market was offset by planned phaseouts of statewide-custom contracts in Florida and in Arizona. 
The increase in federal funds for education remains one of the wildcards in this market. There is no doubt that the federal government is continuing to pump significant dollars into the education market. The availability and the ultimate use of these funds are developments that we are tracking very carefully, and we'll keep you informed as we go.
The massive stimulus program passed last year, now that was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or ARRA, has $11.5 billion available for distribution to the states in 2010 through Phase 2 of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. This fund is intended to supplement education budgets in the fiscal year that has just begun in most states. 
Last year, most of the Phase 1 funds were used to save teaching jobs, and we believe that the same will be true on the Phase 2 funds this year. But the ARRA stimulus legislation is also funding other programs that will released new dollars in 2010. Race to the Top grants at $4 billion, Common Core Assessment Grants at $350 million and Investing for Innovation Grants (sic) [Investing in Innovation Grants] at $650 million.
In addition, states are receiving School Improvement Grants from a $3.5 billion program funded by stimulus dollars and the U.S. Department of Education's current budget. To date, 32 states and the District of Columbia have been approved for these grants, which are earmarked for low-performing schools.
For the McGraw-Hill School Education Group, these grant programs offer potential for both assessment and instructional materials. For example, all Race to the Top proposals, including formative testing, so winning states will require these products and services. Our formative products, such as Acuity, Yearly ProgressPro and Writing Roadmap, and our reporting services, such as The Parent Network, are naturals to meet the market's need. At the same time, our research-based instructional and intervention products, such as Number Worlds and Reading Mastery, are proven solutions for turning around low-performing schools.
Timing will vary for each of these programs but some revenues stemming from School Improvement and Investing in Innovation Grants could begin to show up by, at least, the fourth quarter. 
All this is developing as the states embrace Common Core Standards for K-12 math and for reading and language arts. To date, 23 states have adopted the standards and more are expected to follow in August. More than 40 states are expected to sign on by the end of this year, very important development.  
As a result of all this activity, we expect to see an expansion of digital delivery systems for instructional materials, professional development and classroom-level assessment, and we like these opportunities. 
In higher education, the digital opportunity is big and it's getting bigger. Our revenue in this space is growing at a double-digit rate. The McGraw-Hill Connect family of homework management and assessment program are currently being used by 1.8 million students and instructors.
And now, by creating a partnership with Blackboard, we will dramatically increase the reach and ease of access for our suite of digital products on U.S. campuses. As the clear leader in course management, Blackboard reaches 70% to 80% of the U.S. college and university market. Students and faculty will be able to use a single Blackboard log-on to gain access to our content and tools. Scores on McGraw-Hill Connect assignments, quizzes, tests will post directly to the Blackboard grade book, eliminating the need for students and instructors to manage access and updates on two separate systems. 
We are off to a solid start this year in the U.S. college and university market. And while a strong performance earlier in this year puts us in a good position, it is not necessarily a barometer of full year results. Those will be determined by the heavy ordering season that we have just entered into.
We have benefited so far this year from last fall's surge in enrollments, which carried through into the spring semester. And while we think fall enrollments will continue at this higher level, no further surge is projected. That is why we expect the market to grow by 5% to 7% despite the very strong start to the year.
In professional markets, digital products are also producing double-digit growth. We now have 5,000 e-books available, and their sales accelerated last April following the introduction of the Apple iPad. The e-book is on its way to becoming a staple of the business-to-consumer market, as individuals increasingly discover the convenience of downloading content to e-reading devices. 
Digital products are also growing rapidly in the business-to-business market. Here, the content is assessed on a platform that is updated with news feeds, augmented with video, enriched with searchable information and professionals required to remain current with developments in their fields. Our growing family of Access products offers a growing array of professional resources in medicine, engineering and business.
So let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key markets in 2010: 4% to 6% in the elementary-high school market, 5% to 7% in the U.S. college market. Segment revenue, low single-digit growth, down from previous guidance of 6% to 7% growth, given a more challenging el-hi market. Operating margin unchanged from 2009. 
And finally, let's now take a look at the Information & Media segment. The growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television and advertising and the continuing impact of the BusinessWeek divestiture were key to this segment's second quarter performance. 
For the second quarter, revenue declined by 5.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, grew by 7.4%. Operating profit increased by $33.1 million to $47.5 million compared to $14.4 million for the same period last year, and by the way, that included a pretax restructuring charge of $4 million. The operating margin was 21.2% compared to 6.1% for the same period last year. The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.8%, but excluding BusinessWeek, grew by 5.6%.
In volatile energy market, the demand for Platts data and information product continues to produce solid growth both in the United States and in international markets. To keep its clients abreast of the changing marketplace, Platts has also introduced a new information services. The Bakken Shale formation in the Central U.S. is one of the most significant new sources of regional oil for our nation's refiners. 
In the second quarter, Platts began publishing the world's first price assessment for crude oil produced from the Bakken Shale formation. Platts also began publishing daily price assessments for liquefied natural gas imported to Southwest Europe and to Northwest Europe, two very key consumer regions.
For Broadcasting, second quarter revenue increased by 24% compared to the period last year. National, local and political time sales all contributed to the growth. A pickup in automotive advertising was a key factor and an improvement in local and national advertising. 
Political advertising benefited from the June 8 primary in California and the contest for Governor in that state. In the third quarter, political advertising should again be strong. There is an August 10 primary in Colorado and spending for the Senate race and propositions expected to be key drivers.
Summing up then for the Information & Media. 2009 sale of BusinessWeek is having a positive impact on revenue and operating margins. Revenue, expect a mid single-digit decline. But excluding BusinessWeek, revenue will increase in the mid single-digit range. Operating margin, expect a rebound into the mid-teens. 
And therefore, summing up overall now for The McGraw-Hill Companies, our previous earnings per diluted share guidance for 2010 was $2.55 to $2.65. Due to the choppiness in some of our key market, we now expect to finish the year at the lower end of that range. Okay, that concludes a review of our operations and various situations. 
Let's turn it over now to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer and our other financial matters. Bob?"
21719,109060284,69082,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Terry. There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies' financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow is building. There is no short-term debt outstanding. No long-term debt come",1726,"Okay. Thank you, Terry. There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies' financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow is building. There is no short-term debt outstanding. No long-term debt comes due until 2012. 
And in the second quarter, we started repurchasing shares. We repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total cost of $186.9 million, at an average price of $28.76 per share. This is the first time we've repurchased their shares since the third quarter of 2008. 10.6 million shares remain in the 2007 program authorized by the Board of Directors.
Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 313.2 million in the second quarter, relatively flat versus the prior year, as the second quarter share repurchases were offset by issuance related to employee plans as well as stock price appreciation. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.1 million from the first quarter, reflecting the weighted impact of second quarter share repurchases.
Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 310 million.
We continue to be well capitalized, with a net debt position as of June 30 of $53 million. The shift to a net debt position from the end of the first quarter is driven primarily by funding for share repurchases. 
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.145 billion, while gross debt was comprised of $1.198 billion in senior notes. Our debt is comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes, and there's no commercial paper outstanding, again, as I mentioned earlier. 
The outlook for the free cash flow continues to improve. To calculate free cash flow, we start with after-tax cash from operations and deduct working capital, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt.
In the first half of 2010, we generated free cash flow of $98 million, that's an improvement of $61 million from the prior year due to improved operating results and the continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow for the year in the range of $600 million to $650 million versus our previous guidance of $550 million to $600 million. The improvement is driven by reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated. 2009 full year free cash flow was $770 million. 
We generate the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year because of the seasonality of our Education business. Our guidance implies second half free cash flow that will be roughly $500 million to $550 million, which is lower than prior year due to increased investments and more challenging working capital comparisons during that second half.
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we still anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. We now expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $15 million versus our previous estimate of $20 million.
Now let's look at our segment expenses, particularly in the context of the reduced revenue outlook for McGraw-Hill Education and Financial Services. As a reminder, I'll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth excluding the 2009 restructuring charges, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek. 
So let's start now with Education. Second quarter adjusted expenses declined 1.8%, and the first half adjusted expenses declined 2.1%. At constant currencies, the first half decline is actually larger at 3.1%. 
The segment benefited from savings from last year's strategy to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations, as well as reduced expenses due to the planned phaseout of statewide-custom contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. The increases in selling and marketing costs in the second quarter for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings.
For the full year 2010, as Terry indicated, we now expect segment revenue growth in the low single digits versus our previous guidance of 6% to 7% increase. Despite the reduced revenue growth, we are maintaining our guidance of an unchanged adjusted operating margin, as we now anticipate expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to our previous guidance of a 6% to 7% increase. 
Our full year guidance implies that second half expense will be in the mid single digits, driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs because of the state adoption calendar, as well as cycling through the phaseout of the previously mentioned statewide-custom contracts. Additionally, we continue to ramp up investment in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at higher education and professional, in order to provide value and choices for our customers.
For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 9.4% in the second quarter and 10.8% at constant currencies. First half expenses increased 8.5%. Expense increase was driven by increased salaries and occupancy costs, mainly from our international hires and increased incentive compensation. 
For the full year 2010, we now expect expenses to increase roughly 7% to 8%, down slightly versus our previous guidance of roughly 9% to 10%. The expense growth is largely driven by: continued investment in our fast-growing businesses; the carryover impact of 2009 hires, as well as planned hires for 2010; and additional investments to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.
Our expense guidance assumes approximately $15 million in additional costs related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives, which will occur mostly in the second half of the year. As Terry indicated, there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
In Information & Media, second quarter and first-half adjusted expenses declined 18.9% and 19.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced second quarter revenue by $27.5 million and expenses by $38.5 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $11 million in the quarter. For the first half, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $55 million and expenses by $78 million for a positive impact of roughly $23 million. This segment also benefited from restructuring actions taken in 2009.
For the full year, Information & Media will reflect savings from BusinessWeek divestiture of approximately $38 million. For 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. 
Corporate expense in the second quarter was $37.6 million, an $8.3 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased excess space, increased incentive compensation and growth in selected support functions. For the first half, corporate expense was $73.4 million, which is a $10.6 million increase. 
For the full year, we continue to expect corporate expense to increase about $25 million to $30 million, and the primary reason for the increase is driven by the higher excess space for New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as excess space from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.
Let's now turn to Investments where we are expecting increases in the second half. Prepub investments were $30 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. At first half, we invested $60 million, which is a $25 million decrease. The decline largely is largely due to timing as we expect increased prepublication investments in the second half of the year. 
For 2010, we now expect prepub investments of approximately $195 million to $205 million, an $18 million to $28 million increase versus 2009. But on the other hand, this investment is $30 million less than our previous estimate of $225 million to $235 million, reflecting the fact that with changes in state adoption call schedules, investments are being delayed to better align with projected opportunities. In addition, we continue to benefit from combining our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Purchase of property and equipment were $14.5 million in the second quarter, a $6 million increase versus the second quarter of last year. First half purchases of property and equipment were $22 million. We expect increased investments in the second half and continue to expect that. On a full year basis, expenditures will be approximately $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and the increase is largely driven by technology spending.
Now let's take a look now at the noncash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $69 million in the second quarter, which had $2 million decrease versus last year. In 2010, we continue to expect $260 million to $265 million versus $270 million last year. Depreciation was $26 million in the second quarter versus $29 million the previous quarter last year. We continue to expect depreciation to be roughly $115 million versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $13 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $23 million for the first half, and we expect for the full year about $40 million.
Net interest expense was approximately $21 million in the second quarter compared to $18.5 million in the same period last year and $22 million in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was $77 million. Regarding the company's effective tax rate, during the second quarter and the first half of 2010, it was 36.4%, which was unchanged from 2009, and that's what we expect to see for the full year. 
Our unearned revenue continues to grow, ending the quarter at $1.1 billion, which is up 4.2% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of the divestiture of BusinessWeek, the growth was 7%. Unearned revenue was impacted by deferral of revenue at McGraw-Hill School Education Group where shipping will be completed in the third quarter. Excluding this impact, unearned revenue would have grown at approximately 3.5%.
Financial Services continues to represent 73% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digit, as strong growth in ratings-related information, S&P Indices and Capital IQ offset declines at credit ratings and equity research products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue. 
Thank you, and now back to Terry."

And quite frankly, we were a little surprised by it on that one. But again, what it did is it led into a May-June-July period of softness. And it was a lot slower than we anticipated on that one, and we'll just have to see going forward. I think it reflects a little bit at that Chairman Bernanke's comment, when he was talking about entering into sort of a summer lull of more modest recovery, but we'll have to see. We have to see what the effect of some of the economic recovery and some of the effect that that's going to have on business investment, and what that means then for our issuance. But right now, it's pretty soft. And again, the charts in the slides that -- show that. We're not going to anticipate stronger issuance at this point. If it comes, it will obviously offset any additional cost and should improve margins, but we'll just stay tuned at this point on that one. Competitive issues, Brian, on S&P? No, I mean, again, when you talk about the extensiveness globally of providing credit rating services, it is a huge undertaking. We carry some-1,300 analysts around the world that are providing all of these kind of functions. And so for new entrants, that's a big hurdle to get over. We're hearing on the fringe of a lot of different people that would like to get involved or be a part of or something like that, but we're not seeing anything from a competitive standpoint that concerns us from that one. On the textbook side, Brian, what was the question?"

More people have gone back to school, more people are staying longer. And therefore, we're entering into a period that I think should be very advantageous for us, we will see. But it also gives us a lot of upside in terms of some of the new things we're doing, very pleased with the online learning platforms like McGraw-Hill  Connect. It is doing extremely well, especially at the community-college level, and so that part is good. Also, what we're seeing is increased activity in the educational services area. These are online learning platforms that are very targeted toward professional skills in places like India and China. Where to get certain jobs, you have to have certain skill sets. And we can rifle-shoot in with online learning platforms, and we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. So I mean, I think it's a good situation at this point. But we just have to stay tuned. On the K-12 side, it really is going to depend on some of the Recovery Act federal stimulus. There's $11.5 billion that is scheduled for spending in 2010. Certainly, I think teacher jobs are part of it. But I think, also, we ought to see some very, very important support in some of the key states. So we'll see. The Higher Ed is going to clearly be the winner of the year."

As you know, in terms of the pleading standards, in here, we were taking a look at fraud. And then, you're talking about gross negligence and then dropping down to a negligence level. And all have implications on intent and so forth. Where we are is just a little bit lower than the fraud level that we saw originally in the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of '06. So it's very livable. What we've always been concerned about is clarification of some of the language. When you talk about a reasonable investigation, what's the definition of reasonable investigation? Knowingly and recklessly, what constitutes that? And I think what we're seeing here is a sort of dust-settling period with the SEC, and I think yesterday's pronouncement of suspending AB requirements for six months is really -- okay, we've got to get our arms around all of this, and we've got to clarify certain language, and we've got to put things in place that does no harm and all that. And so we're actually satisfied with where that is. And regardless, we think that we are in a good position to deal with that. As far as conflicts of interest and questions about the business model or things like that, we feel quite good. I mean, again, it's what you're trying to solve the equation for. If you're trying to solve the equation for higher transparency, which is a good thing, then you're going to go with the issuer-pay model. And you've just got to make sure because we disseminate all the information free around the world, so you get higher transparency. But you just got to make sure and obviously, being regulated, that you're compliance systems and your firewalls and all of that is very, very pronounced and clearly articulated. And that is exactly what the new overhaul reform bill articulates, that they're going to be inspecting those compliance systems and the like, and we're working with various regulators to make sure that they understand our compliances systems and that they are in all of that. So that's what I think. So I don't see anything at this point in either the business model or any potential conflicts of interest that would surface."

But I think we're on a pretty good path and a pretty good situation, and we're handling it as it comes. Now obviously, the part that pleases us the most is the fact that when you still have the regulatory reform bill out there and all the headline risk and all of those kind of things, the uncertainty levels were pretty high. What we're doing is we're moving from a world of uncertainty to one that is more certain, and that's good. And I think the SEC pronouncement yesterday about sort of a six-month moratorium, especially with the AB requirement is a good sign that the dust is settling, and we now have to get after managing the requirements. So at this point, we feel pretty good about it."

So we want to -- we're still studying on what some of the ramifications of some of the new rules might have, especially on staffing and things like that. But if there is pressure on margins or, we think they're going to be very modest at this point. So once the one-time costs are gone and your run rate has already been adjusted on that part, and if revenue through new issuance picks up, that should all go straight to the bottom line, and that would be margin improvement. But we're being cautious, at this point, with revenue and transaction and direction because we just got to see a little bit more in terms of how this recovery takes place. But what we're focused on would be the revenue side, because the ongoing costs have already been adjusted. The one-time cost will subside, and then that should have a better situation."

I will review the second quarter results and the guidance. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials. And after the formal presentation, again, as Don said, we'll be pleased to answer any questions or take any comments that you have about The McGraw-Hill Companies.
Earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.61 for the second quarter, and that's an increase of 17.3% compared to $0.52 last year. And of course, that $0.52 last year included a total of $0.06 for a net restructuring charge and a loss on a divestiture. Revenue of $1.5 billion was up 0.6% for the second quarter, but increased 2.7% if you exclude the divestitures of BusinessWeek and Vista Research.
In the current environment, regulatory and legal matters are clearly top-of-mind issues with investors, so I will start this morning by reviewing developments in these areas and their impact on financial services. But let me say at the outset that regarding financial reform and legal issues, we are pleased, very pleased that this period of uncertainty is largely over. With the signing of the Dodd-Frank Act, we have now greater clarity on the new legal and regulatory landscape for credit rating agencies and that again, is a welcome development. It reduces some of the uncertainty and gives us a clear picture of the way forward.
From our vantage point, some things are not clear. First, there were no surprises in the legislation, we've been at it for sometime. Second, we have anticipated the key provisions becoming law for sometime. And third, the new legislation calls for greater disclosure, accountability and oversight. These are all actions that we believe will increase confidence in the markets as well as in ratings.
In this period of change, Standard & Poor's has been investing in systems and processes and people to prepare us; to operate effectively in this new regulated environment; to produce ratings that are relevant to investors, issuers and other market participants; to compete effectively and to comply with regulations in all jurisdictions as well as being able to manage and mitigate risk.
Now the key to meeting these regulatory requirements is S&P's QCCR framework. Now those initials, QCCR, stands for Quality, Criteria, Compliance and Risk. And over the past few years, S&P has continually strengthened its QCCR framework within each of those four area that has met establishing control groups independent of the Ratings business, and investing in staff, training, technology and processes around the QCCR function, and let me elaborate.
The Q, the quality team uses formulized review procedures to oversee the integrity, quality and transparency of S&P's ratings. The criteria team oversees the development and approval of criteria for our ratings that would include new and revised economic-stress scenarios for the rating criteria to meeting emerging market and regulatory expectations. In the compliance organization, they're now about 50 people helping to monitor that S&P meets regulatory requirements through regular compliance examinations. They also provide training and guidance on policies and guidelines. And finally, the risk control function is designed to assess various risk that could affect the integrity and quality of the ratings process. Risk control will also assess the feasibility of rating new types of securities.
More global regulation is expected, but our investment in the QCCR framework in recent years has created the foundation that S&P needs to implement the control and compliance function. In short, not only is S&P well positioned now to deal with the pending changes, it has a leverageable framework to deal with the new regulations. Last year, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. In 2010, spending will increase by about $15 million or up to about $78 million.
At beginning of the year, we said we expected a decline of about 100 basis points in the operating margin for Financial Services. Despite additional cost, the operating margin forecast has not changed, and reflects infrastructure investments and new regulatory requirements that we have anticipated.  Looking ahead, there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with all the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
The new Dodd-Frank Act will require more changes, and let's go through some of those changes and what they include. They include the elimination of statutory references in various U.S. laws to credit ratings, we supported this action. Ratings across the globe should continue to provide investors a common and transparent language, and a fundamental credit-risk benchmark across sectors and geographies. Independent analytical insight and transparency are the key to our value proposition.
Another issue, the repeal of the Rule 436(g). Under this rule, issuers of U.S. public offerings included the rating of a security in registration statements without triggering potential expert liability exposure for the credit rating agencies. In view of the new legal risk created by the repeal of 436(g), S&P will not consent to the inclusion of its ratings in registrations statement and prospectuses. And in a new development as of yesterday, by suspending Regulation AB requirements for six months, AB in the asset-backed area, the SEC has given the market time to study potential solutions to the problem created by the repeal of 436(g). But S&P will explore many mechanisms outside of registration statements to allow ratings to continue to be disseminated to the debt market. As always, S&P ratings on new issues and presale reports are available, at no charge, to all market participants on our website. And let me just give you those while we're at this point, simply log on to www.standard&poors.com/newissues and another, www.standard&poors.com/presalesreports.
Another issue is the repeal of the exception to Regulation Fair Disclosure. Under this exception, issuers could share material nonpublic information with rating agencies without violating Reg FD. There are other ways to satisfy Reg FD so we can continue to receive confidential information as part of the ratings process, and we're currently evaluating those options. The proposed change in the law that has attracted the most attention concerns new pleading standards and federal securities fraud suits brought against credit rating agencies. The legislation permits lawsuits against the credit rating agency that, ""knowingly or recklessly failed to conduct a ""reasonable investigation"" or obtain reasonable verification of the data it uses to determine a rating."" Undoubtedly, the new pleading standard will be tested at some point in the future. More litigation would obviously be burdensome and motions to dismiss may be more difficult to achieve, but we will be ready to meet this new challenge.
Among other things, as I've already pointed out, S&P continues to make changes in its business to improve its procedures and control processes. But don't lose sight of another crucial point, it is simply this: Ultimately, the current fraud liability standards still applies, that has not changed. And let me be clear on this point. The new law changes what plaintiffs are required to allege in order to survive a motion to dismiss at the pleading stage. The law does not change what plaintiffs must ultimately prove to a judge or a jury in order for a credit rating agency to be held liable. And that is the same federal securities fraud liability standard to which all market participants are subject to.
On the litigation front, the outright dismissals of current cases now stands at 13, and five cases have been just withdrawn. We believe these decisions constitute meaningful precedent. Since our last update on litigation, there have been three important decisions involving S&P. Two involve a subprime case and the third, relates to S&P's Index businesses and a grant of summary judgment that thwarts an assault on S&P's intellectual property rights.
First, the Abu Dhabi subprime case and new rulings by Judge Scheindlin. Here on June 15, she emphatically denied class-action certification to the plaintiffs. In denying the motion for class certification, the judge wrote, ""defendants argue with considerable force against the certifying the proposed class. As defendants point out, this action is a collection of a relatively small number of sophisticated institutional investors that acquired one of three different categories of rated notes at different times, pursuant to different internal requirements and after conducting different due diligence inquiries.""
On July 20, she allowed the plaintiffs to reinstate one of the 10 original claims against both the credit rating agencies and Morgan Stanley that she had previously dismissed with prejudice. In responding to the plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint, the judge concluded that she was mistaken in dismissing the aiding and abetting fraud claim because they are related to the allegations of fraud, the one claim that has been allowed to proceed.
There are three takeaways from the latest development. The first is that the decision does not affect the dismissal of the nine claims which were not based on fraud. The court, secondly, has made no finding of fraud or aiding and abetting fraud. At this early stage in the case, the court's ruling must be based on accepting the plaintiffs' assertion as true until you get to a discovery dialog. The third, the key issue here has not changed with the restoration of the aiding and abetting claim. The plaintiff still must prove fraud, and we remain very confident that neither claim can be sustained.
The victory in the Illinois Circuit Court also was significant. Judge William MaKi ruled that index providers are entitled to protection of misappropriation of their indices. The International Securities Exchange, ISE, sought to offer options based on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Index without obtaining a license from the owners of these indices. In his ruling, the judge observed, ""it bears noting that ISE unabashedly admits to attempted to create a competitive product, the ISE 250, which is an index highly correlated to the S&P 500. After spending a large sum of money developing and promoting options on the ISE 250, ISE discontinued the project which had failed to garner significant trading volume. The court fails to understand how ISE's failure somehow entitles it to profit for free from the efforts, skills and reputation of the index providers.""
With that, on some of the regulatory and legal issues, I will leave that for now, and let's move on to the operations. Let's begin and let's take a look at the Financial Services operating results in the second quarter and the prospects for the second half of the year. 
Revenue at S&P Credit Market Services was up 0.1% as a surge in syndicated-leverage-bank-loan ratings helped offset continued softness in the structured finance market. The value of diversity was underscored by the 4.9% increase in revenue at S&P Investment Services. For the second quarter at Financial Services, revenue increased by 1.6%, operating profit declined by 4.2%. The operating margin was 38.7% compared to 41.0% last year, which reflected a pretax loss of $13.8 million from the divestiture of Vista Research and a pretax net benefit of $0.4 million from restructuring charges.
The second quarter started strongly, and then softened in May and June as doubts grew about the pace of economic recovery and uncertainty developed over European sovereigns and bank debt. In this environment, credit spreads for the investment and speculative-grade bonds, and again, when we talk about credit spreads, it's the excess interest over the treasury bonds, began to widen after reaching two-year lows at the end of April. As this table shows, both the investment and speculative-grade composite spreads were, on July 15, above their five-year daily moving averages. The three-month LIBOR rose to more than 0.5% and by the way, that's the highest since the middle of 2009. Although the volume of bank loan ratings is still at the low end of its historical average, the market picked up substantially in the first half. As this chart shows, the volume in syndicated-leveraged bank loans, which are rated BBB or lower, started climbing in the first quarter and accelerated in the second quarter of 2010. Bank loan activity was primarily amend to extend the push out maturities.
The investment-grade corporate market was soft in both Europe and in the United States, but refinancing requirements resulted in increased high-yield debt issuance in Europe. New issuance in the high-yield market increased 15.3% globally in the second quarter, with gains in European issuance more than offsetting the decline in U.S. issuance. About 73% of the total U.S. high-yield volume in the second quarter was designated for refinancing. The structured finance market declined again in the second quarter, and a key to the second half outlook is the wave of corporate debt coming due in the United States and the European markets.
As these charts show, S&P estimates that U.S. and European debt maturities, by dollar amounts, will grow steadily through 2014. Looking ahead, S&P expects companies to take advantage of increased investor appetite for yield to either amend credit agreements to extend maturities or refinance bank debt with longer-dated, high-yield debt.
Credit spreads will be a factor for the level of issuance in the second half. Stable or tightening spreads could spur some healthy issuance volume in the corporate sector. The outlook for public finance is mixed. Taxable bonds, including the new Build America Bonds, will probably drive growth, although S&P expects traditional tax exempt issuance to decline in the second half.
In Structured Finance, we may see a modest pickup in activity. There may be a slow rebirth of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market in the second half. That would be welcoming. In the near term, S&P expects to see re-REMIC activity continue in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market.
In the asset-backed securities market, activity could stall somewhat as various regulations are digested. The SEC's Rule 17g5 became effective on June 2, and the FDIC Safe Harbor rules which are expected to take effect in September. We also continue to monitor our competitive position in the marketplace.
In 2009, excluding sovereign issuance, S&P rated approximately 95% of the addressable debt issued in the United States. As this chart shows, S&P has performed consistently in the range for the last six years. In the European market S&P rated 89% of the addressable market last year, up from 83% in 2008.  It is also worth noting that at $1.8 trillion, the rated European debt market, with fewer but larger issues, was actually bigger than the rated U.S. market which is just over $1.5 trillion. 
The market share performance underscores another important part about S&P's track record. S&P provides a range of ratings from AAA to CCC. And if the initial credit opinion meets the test of time, you will see fewer defaults at the top of the scale and higher defaults at the lower end of the scale. S&P tracks these default rates with great care, and recently updated the tables on the global corporate average cumulative default rate from 1981 through 2009 and the global structured finance average cumulative default rate from 1978 to 2009. There is a lot of information on these two tables, which will appear in our new Investor Fact Book next month, but the key point is unmistakable. In both Corporate and Structured Finance, over long periods of time, the higher the S&P rating, the fewer defaults have been experienced. That's the way it is supposed to be if S&P is doing its job properly.
In addition to defaults, S&P also looked at rating transition by conducting a comprehensive review of credit ratings spanning the spectrum of corporate, government, structured finance debt. This report is entitled, ""Default, Transition and Recovery: A Global Cross Asset Report Card of Ratings Performance in Times of Stress"", and that was published last month. This review demonstrated that ratings issued in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia for nearly all asset classes generally performed as expected, with the exception of ratings on the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities and on collateralized debt obligations backed by structured finance collateral. That is, rated credits withstood the recent financial crisis with results in line with expectations for the economic environment. In contrast, the performance of ratings for U.S. RMBS and CDOs issued from 2005 through 2007 have been disappointing and below our expectations. 
Standard & Poor's performance review reaffirms two key attributes of rating. First, even during periods of economic stress, ratings have been and continue to be reasonable predictors of the relative likelihoods of default or different credits. In short, credits with higher ratings generally experienced lower default rates. This trend held up across asset classes for the three stressful period studied in 1991, 2001 and the 2008-2009 period, with the exception of residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs during the recent crisis.
Second, sectors other than RMBS and CDOs did not experience disproportionate downgrades relative to the degree of economic stress. Downgrades typically increased in all sectors during periods of stress, but apart from residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs issued between 2005 and 2007, the pace was not exceptional.
Earlier in this presentation, I mentioned the value of diversity that S&P Investment Services brings to our portfolio. Nowhere is that more evident than in S&P indices which are providing greater access to more markets for more investors around the world. The team at S&P indices is dedicated to finding new ways to grow the business. With the expiration of a 10-year exclusive agreement with Barclays, S&P has recently licensed Vanguard to launch exchange-traded funds based in our indices. Vanguard is introducing eight new exchange-traded funds targeting Growth and Value segments of the S&P 500, and Growth and Value and Blend segments of the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600.
In May, S&P licensed seven major European exchange-traded fund sponsors to create and list S&P 500 ETFs on major European exchanges for real-time trading. In the spring, S&P licensed the National Stock Exchange, the NSE of India, to create and list Indian rupee-denominated futures contracts based on the S&P 500. S&P will be adding new indices in commodities, fixed income, equities, strategy and customize others for its clients. The goal, an index for every type of investment.
So let's sum up for the Financial Services segment. New clarity on the regulatory and legal front, new requirements are manageable, mid single-digit revenue growth for the segment versus our previous estimate of high single-digit growth due to some unanticipated softness in the market. With improvement at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services, operating profit will improve. Operating margin will decline approximately 100 basis points. And this reflects infrastructure investments in compliance with new regulatory requirements.
All right. Let's move on to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education in the second quarter, a strong performance in the U.S. Higher Education market, and increases in the state new adoption market by the School Education Group were partially offset by declines in the open territory and the custom-testing markets. As a result, McGraw-Hill School Education Group's revenue declined by 4%.  McGraw-Hill Higher Education and Professional and International Group's revenue increased by 10.8%. 
For the segment in the second quarter, revenue increased by 1.8%, but the gain in the U.S. Higher Education market had a substantial impact in the second quarter operating profit, which grew to $51.6 million and an operating margin which increased to 9.1%. That compares to an operating profit for the second quarter of 2009 of $21 million which included a pretax restructuring charge of $11.6 million and an operating margin of 3.8%.
State budget pressures continue to be a factor in this year's elementary-high school market. As we had expected, only the state new adoption market will show solid growth this year. But here too, funding concerns are driving reduced purchasing levels. As the spring adoption season progressed, it became clear that fewer California districts would be making new reading, literature or math purchases than originally projected. South Carolina's math adoption was effectively canceled in the second quarter when the legislature did not provide funding, and many districts in Indiana decided to postpone buying math this year. District activity has been limited in other states as well, including Georgia and Oklahoma.
In view of these conditions, we are adjusting our estimates for 2010. We are now expecting the state new adoption market to range from $825 million to $875 million, and our previous forecast has have $875 million to $925 million. We now look for the el-hi [elementary-high school] market now to grow by 4% to 6%, down from our previous forecast of 6% to 7%. The market's growth will come from the increase of nearly 70% in state new adoption sales. We still anticipate declines in both open territory sales and residual sales.
The McGraw-Hill School Group [McGraw-Hill School Education Group] still expects to capture about 30% of the state new adoption business this year. The biggest opportunities as we know are in Texas, Florida, and even despite the market shrinkage there, in California as well. 
In Texas, we are forecasting a capture rate of about 40% of the K-5 reading market and about 18% of the 6-12 literature market. Some of those orders were deferred and will be shipped in the third quarter, so we'll see that pick up there. In Florida, we anticipate winning 40% of the 6-8 math market, about 27% of the 9-12 market, but only 5% of the K-5  market. In California, strong performances by our California Treasures program and Imagine It! program should enable us to capture more than half the available dollars in the state for new K-5 reading program.
In smaller states, the McGraw-Hill School Group expects to capture more than 40% of Mississippi's K-12 science adoption and more than 60% of West Virginia's K-12 math adoption. And while math postponements have been heavy in Indiana and Oklahoma, we are winning substantial shares in those states, particularly at the 6-12 grade level.
The School Group has been strong historically in non-academic subjects as well, and this year is no exception. We're seeing good capture rates in family and consumer sciences, technical education and business and computer education. In Testing, growth in the formative market was offset by planned phaseouts of statewide-custom contracts in Florida and in Arizona. 
The increase in federal funds for education remains one of the wildcards in this market. There is no doubt that the federal government is continuing to pump significant dollars into the education market. The availability and the ultimate use of these funds are developments that we are tracking very carefully, and we'll keep you informed as we go.
The massive stimulus program passed last year, now that was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or ARRA, has $11.5 billion available for distribution to the states in 2010 through Phase 2 of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. This fund is intended to supplement education budgets in the fiscal year that has just begun in most states. 
Last year, most of the Phase 1 funds were used to save teaching jobs, and we believe that the same will be true on the Phase 2 funds this year. But the ARRA stimulus legislation is also funding other programs that will released new dollars in 2010. Race to the Top grants at $4 billion, Common Core Assessment Grants at $350 million and Investing for Innovation Grants (sic) [Investing in Innovation Grants] at $650 million.
In addition, states are receiving School Improvement Grants from a $3.5 billion program funded by stimulus dollars and the U.S. Department of Education's current budget. To date, 32 states and the District of Columbia have been approved for these grants, which are earmarked for low-performing schools.
For the McGraw-Hill School Education Group, these grant programs offer potential for both assessment and instructional materials. For example, all Race to the Top proposals, including formative testing, so winning states will require these products and services. Our formative products, such as Acuity, Yearly ProgressPro and Writing Roadmap, and our reporting services, such as The Parent Network, are naturals to meet the market's need. At the same time, our research-based instructional and intervention products, such as Number Worlds and Reading Mastery, are proven solutions for turning around low-performing schools.
Timing will vary for each of these programs but some revenues stemming from School Improvement and Investing in Innovation Grants could begin to show up by, at least, the fourth quarter. 
All this is developing as the states embrace Common Core Standards for K-12 math and for reading and language arts. To date, 23 states have adopted the standards and more are expected to follow in August. More than 40 states are expected to sign on by the end of this year, very important development.  
As a result of all this activity, we expect to see an expansion of digital delivery systems for instructional materials, professional development and classroom-level assessment, and we like these opportunities. 
In higher education, the digital opportunity is big and it's getting bigger. Our revenue in this space is growing at a double-digit rate. The McGraw-Hill Connect family of homework management and assessment program are currently being used by 1.8 million students and instructors.
And now, by creating a partnership with Blackboard, we will dramatically increase the reach and ease of access for our suite of digital products on U.S. campuses. As the clear leader in course management, Blackboard reaches 70% to 80% of the U.S. college and university market. Students and faculty will be able to use a single Blackboard log-on to gain access to our content and tools. Scores on McGraw-Hill Connect assignments, quizzes, tests will post directly to the Blackboard grade book, eliminating the need for students and instructors to manage access and updates on two separate systems. 
We are off to a solid start this year in the U.S. college and university market. And while a strong performance earlier in this year puts us in a good position, it is not necessarily a barometer of full year results. Those will be determined by the heavy ordering season that we have just entered into.
We have benefited so far this year from last fall's surge in enrollments, which carried through into the spring semester. And while we think fall enrollments will continue at this higher level, no further surge is projected. That is why we expect the market to grow by 5% to 7% despite the very strong start to the year.
In professional markets, digital products are also producing double-digit growth. We now have 5,000 e-books available, and their sales accelerated last April following the introduction of the Apple iPad. The e-book is on its way to becoming a staple of the business-to-consumer market, as individuals increasingly discover the convenience of downloading content to e-reading devices. 
Digital products are also growing rapidly in the business-to-business market. Here, the content is assessed on a platform that is updated with news feeds, augmented with video, enriched with searchable information and professionals required to remain current with developments in their fields. Our growing family of Access products offers a growing array of professional resources in medicine, engineering and business.
So let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key markets in 2010: 4% to 6% in the elementary-high school market, 5% to 7% in the U.S. college market. Segment revenue, low single-digit growth, down from previous guidance of 6% to 7% growth, given a more challenging el-hi market. Operating margin unchanged from 2009. 
And finally, let's now take a look at the Information & Media segment. The growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television and advertising and the continuing impact of the BusinessWeek divestiture were key to this segment's second quarter performance. 
For the second quarter, revenue declined by 5.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, grew by 7.4%. Operating profit increased by $33.1 million to $47.5 million compared to $14.4 million for the same period last year, and by the way, that included a pretax restructuring charge of $4 million. The operating margin was 21.2% compared to 6.1% for the same period last year. The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.8%, but excluding BusinessWeek, grew by 5.6%.
In volatile energy market, the demand for Platts data and information product continues to produce solid growth both in the United States and in international markets. To keep its clients abreast of the changing marketplace, Platts has also introduced a new information services. The Bakken Shale formation in the Central U.S. is one of the most significant new sources of regional oil for our nation's refiners. 
In the second quarter, Platts began publishing the world's first price assessment for crude oil produced from the Bakken Shale formation. Platts also began publishing daily price assessments for liquefied natural gas imported to Southwest Europe and to Northwest Europe, two very key consumer regions.
For Broadcasting, second quarter revenue increased by 24% compared to the period last year. National, local and political time sales all contributed to the growth. A pickup in automotive advertising was a key factor and an improvement in local and national advertising. 
Political advertising benefited from the June 8 primary in California and the contest for Governor in that state. In the third quarter, political advertising should again be strong. There is an August 10 primary in Colorado and spending for the Senate race and propositions expected to be key drivers.
Summing up then for the Information & Media. 2009 sale of BusinessWeek is having a positive impact on revenue and operating margins. Revenue, expect a mid single-digit decline. But excluding BusinessWeek, revenue will increase in the mid single-digit range. Operating margin, expect a rebound into the mid-teens. 
And therefore, summing up overall now for The McGraw-Hill Companies, our previous earnings per diluted share guidance for 2010 was $2.55 to $2.65. Due to the choppiness in some of our key market, we now expect to finish the year at the lower end of that range. Okay, that concludes a review of our operations and various situations. 
Let's turn it over now to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer and our other financial matters. Bob?"
21719,109060284,69216,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Terry. There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies' financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow is building. There is no short-term debt outstanding. No long-term debt come",1726,"Okay. Thank you, Terry. There should be no doubt about the strength and flexibility of The McGraw-Hill Companies' financial position as we enter the third quarter. Free cash flow is building. There is no short-term debt outstanding. No long-term debt comes due until 2012. 
And in the second quarter, we started repurchasing shares. We repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total cost of $186.9 million, at an average price of $28.76 per share. This is the first time we've repurchased their shares since the third quarter of 2008. 10.6 million shares remain in the 2007 program authorized by the Board of Directors.
Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 313.2 million in the second quarter, relatively flat versus the prior year, as the second quarter share repurchases were offset by issuance related to employee plans as well as stock price appreciation. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.1 million from the first quarter, reflecting the weighted impact of second quarter share repurchases.
Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 310 million.
We continue to be well capitalized, with a net debt position as of June 30 of $53 million. The shift to a net debt position from the end of the first quarter is driven primarily by funding for share repurchases. 
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.145 billion, while gross debt was comprised of $1.198 billion in senior notes. Our debt is comprised entirely of long-term unsecured senior notes, and there's no commercial paper outstanding, again, as I mentioned earlier. 
The outlook for the free cash flow continues to improve. To calculate free cash flow, we start with after-tax cash from operations and deduct working capital, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt.
In the first half of 2010, we generated free cash flow of $98 million, that's an improvement of $61 million from the prior year due to improved operating results and the continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow for the year in the range of $600 million to $650 million versus our previous guidance of $550 million to $600 million. The improvement is driven by reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated. 2009 full year free cash flow was $770 million. 
We generate the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year because of the seasonality of our Education business. Our guidance implies second half free cash flow that will be roughly $500 million to $550 million, which is lower than prior year due to increased investments and more challenging working capital comparisons during that second half.
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we still anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. We now expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $15 million versus our previous estimate of $20 million.
Now let's look at our segment expenses, particularly in the context of the reduced revenue outlook for McGraw-Hill Education and Financial Services. As a reminder, I'll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth excluding the 2009 restructuring charges, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek. 
So let's start now with Education. Second quarter adjusted expenses declined 1.8%, and the first half adjusted expenses declined 2.1%. At constant currencies, the first half decline is actually larger at 3.1%. 
The segment benefited from savings from last year's strategy to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations, as well as reduced expenses due to the planned phaseout of statewide-custom contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. The increases in selling and marketing costs in the second quarter for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings.
For the full year 2010, as Terry indicated, we now expect segment revenue growth in the low single digits versus our previous guidance of 6% to 7% increase. Despite the reduced revenue growth, we are maintaining our guidance of an unchanged adjusted operating margin, as we now anticipate expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to our previous guidance of a 6% to 7% increase. 
Our full year guidance implies that second half expense will be in the mid single digits, driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs because of the state adoption calendar, as well as cycling through the phaseout of the previously mentioned statewide-custom contracts. Additionally, we continue to ramp up investment in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at higher education and professional, in order to provide value and choices for our customers.
For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 9.4% in the second quarter and 10.8% at constant currencies. First half expenses increased 8.5%. Expense increase was driven by increased salaries and occupancy costs, mainly from our international hires and increased incentive compensation. 
For the full year 2010, we now expect expenses to increase roughly 7% to 8%, down slightly versus our previous guidance of roughly 9% to 10%. The expense growth is largely driven by: continued investment in our fast-growing businesses; the carryover impact of 2009 hires, as well as planned hires for 2010; and additional investments to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.
Our expense guidance assumes approximately $15 million in additional costs related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives, which will occur mostly in the second half of the year. As Terry indicated, there will be some pressure on operating margins as we continue to deal with the provisions of the new U.S. legislation, new rulemaking by the SEC and regulations recently proposed by Canada and Hong Kong.
In Information & Media, second quarter and first-half adjusted expenses declined 18.9% and 19.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced second quarter revenue by $27.5 million and expenses by $38.5 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $11 million in the quarter. For the first half, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $55 million and expenses by $78 million for a positive impact of roughly $23 million. This segment also benefited from restructuring actions taken in 2009.
For the full year, Information & Media will reflect savings from BusinessWeek divestiture of approximately $38 million. For 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. 
Corporate expense in the second quarter was $37.6 million, an $8.3 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased excess space, increased incentive compensation and growth in selected support functions. For the first half, corporate expense was $73.4 million, which is a $10.6 million increase. 
For the full year, we continue to expect corporate expense to increase about $25 million to $30 million, and the primary reason for the increase is driven by the higher excess space for New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as excess space from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.
Let's now turn to Investments where we are expecting increases in the second half. Prepub investments were $30 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2009. At first half, we invested $60 million, which is a $25 million decrease. The decline largely is largely due to timing as we expect increased prepublication investments in the second half of the year. 
For 2010, we now expect prepub investments of approximately $195 million to $205 million, an $18 million to $28 million increase versus 2009. But on the other hand, this investment is $30 million less than our previous estimate of $225 million to $235 million, reflecting the fact that with changes in state adoption call schedules, investments are being delayed to better align with projected opportunities. In addition, we continue to benefit from combining our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Purchase of property and equipment were $14.5 million in the second quarter, a $6 million increase versus the second quarter of last year. First half purchases of property and equipment were $22 million. We expect increased investments in the second half and continue to expect that. On a full year basis, expenditures will be approximately $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and the increase is largely driven by technology spending.
Now let's take a look now at the noncash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $69 million in the second quarter, which had $2 million decrease versus last year. In 2010, we continue to expect $260 million to $265 million versus $270 million last year. Depreciation was $26 million in the second quarter versus $29 million the previous quarter last year. We continue to expect depreciation to be roughly $115 million versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $13 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $23 million for the first half, and we expect for the full year about $40 million.
Net interest expense was approximately $21 million in the second quarter compared to $18.5 million in the same period last year and $22 million in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was $77 million. Regarding the company's effective tax rate, during the second quarter and the first half of 2010, it was 36.4%, which was unchanged from 2009, and that's what we expect to see for the full year. 
Our unearned revenue continues to grow, ending the quarter at $1.1 billion, which is up 4.2% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of the divestiture of BusinessWeek, the growth was 7%. Unearned revenue was impacted by deferral of revenue at McGraw-Hill School Education Group where shipping will be completed in the third quarter. Excluding this impact, unearned revenue would have grown at approximately 3.5%.
Financial Services continues to represent 73% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digit, as strong growth in ratings-related information, S&P Indices and Capital IQ offset declines at credit ratings and equity research products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue. 
Thank you, and now back to Terry."

And quite frankly, we were a little surprised by it on that one. But again, what it did is it led into a May-June-July period of softness. And it was a lot slower than we anticipated on that one, and we'll just have to see going forward. I think it reflects a little bit at that Chairman Bernanke's comment, when he was talking about entering into sort of a summer lull of more modest recovery, but we'll have to see. We have to see what the effect of some of the economic recovery and some of the effect that that's going to have on business investment, and what that means then for our issuance. But right now, it's pretty soft. And again, the charts in the slides that -- show that. We're not going to anticipate stronger issuance at this point. If it comes, it will obviously offset any additional cost and should improve margins, but we'll just stay tuned at this point on that one. Competitive issues, Brian, on S&P? No, I mean, again, when you talk about the extensiveness globally of providing credit rating services, it is a huge undertaking. We carry some-1,300 analysts around the world that are providing all of these kind of functions. And so for new entrants, that's a big hurdle to get over. We're hearing on the fringe of a lot of different people that would like to get involved or be a part of or something like that, but we're not seeing anything from a competitive standpoint that concerns us from that one. On the textbook side, Brian, what was the question?"

But it also gives us a lot of upside in terms of some of the new things we're doing, very pleased with the online learning platforms like McGraw-Hill Connect. It is doing extremely well, especially at the community college level, and so that part is good. Also, what we're seeing is increased activity in the educational services area. These are online learning platforms that are very targeted toward professional skills in places like India and China where, to get certain jobs, you have to have certain skill sets. And we can rifle-shoot in with online learning platforms, and we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. So I mean, I think it's a good situation at this point, but we just have to stay tuned. On the K-12 side, it really is going to depend on some of the Recovery Act federal stimulus. There's $11.5 billion that is scheduled for spending in 2010. Certainly, I think teacher jobs are part of it. But I think, also, we ought to see some very, very important support in some of the key states. So we'll see. The Higher Ed is going to clearly be the winner of the year."

As you know, in terms of the pleading standards, in here, we were taking a look at fraud. And then, you're talking about gross negligence and then dropping down to a negligence level. And all have implications on intent and so forth. Where we are is just a little bit lower than the fraud level that we saw originally in the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of '06. So it's very livable. What we've always been concerned about is clarification of some of the language. When you talk about a reasonable investigation, what's the definition of reasonable investigation? Knowingly and recklessly, what constitutes that? And I think what we're seeing here is a sort of dust-settling period with the SEC, and I think yesterday's pronouncement of suspending AB requirements for six months is really -- okay, we've got to get our arms around all of this, and we've got to clarify certain language, and we've got to put things in place that does no harm and all that. And so we're actually satisfied with where that is. And regardless, we think that we are in a good position to deal with that. As far as conflicts of interest and questions about the business model or things like that, we feel quite good. I mean, again, it's what you're trying to solve the equation for. If you're trying to solve the equation for higher transparency, which is a good thing, then you're going to go with the issuer-pay model. And you've just got to make sure because we disseminate all the information free around the world, so you get higher transparency. But you just got to make sure and obviously, being regulated, that you're compliance systems and your firewalls and all of that is very, very pronounced and clearly articulated. And that is exactly what the new overhaul reform bill articulates, that they're going to be inspecting those compliance systems and the like, and we're working with various regulators to make sure that they understand our compliances systems and that they are in all of that. So that's what I think. So I don't see anything at this point in either the business model or any potential conflicts of interest that would surface."

But I think we're on a pretty good path and a pretty good situation, and we're handling it as it comes. Now obviously, the part that pleases us the most is the fact that when you still have the regulatory reform bill out there and all the headline risk and all of those kind of things, the uncertainty levels were pretty high. What we're doing is we're moving from a world of uncertainty to one that is more certain, and that's good. And I think the SEC pronouncement yesterday about sort of a six-month moratorium, especially with the AB requirement is a good sign that the dust is settling, and we now have to get after managing the requirements. So at this point, we feel pretty good about it."

The majority of the cost, the one-time cost have already been taken in terms of compliance systems and all of those kind of things. So we want to -- we're still studying on what some of the ramifications of some of the new rules might have, especially on staffing and things like that. But if there is pressure on margins or -- we think they're going to be very modest at this point. So once the one-time costs are gone and your run rate has already been adjusted on that part, and if revenue through new issuance picks up, that should all go straight to the bottom line, and that would be margin improvement. But we're being cautious, at this point, with revenue and transaction and direction because we just got to see a little bit more in terms of how this recovery takes place. But what we're focused on would be the revenue side, because the ongoing costs have already been adjusted. The one-time cost will subside, and then that should have a better situation."

As Don mentioned with me this morning is Bob Bahash, he's our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And I'll start by reviewing the third quarter results and our new guidance on earnings for 2010. After our presentations, obviously, we'll go in any direction you would like and answer any questions or take your comments about The McGraw-Hill Companies and our prospects.
Earlier this morning, we reported a 15% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter, earnings per share of $01.23, now that included a $0.02 gain on some divestitures and a $0.01 dilution on the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. Revenue grew by 5.5% in the third quarter, but increased 6.8% if you exclude the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Based on that strong performance in the seasonally most important quarter of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2010. We now anticipate earnings per share this year in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and we expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes the one-time gain of $0.02 from divestitures, but does include dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. There were many contributors to our strong third quarter. We are very pleased to be firing on so many cylinders. This morning, we'll provide the details on how those results were achieved.
Let's begin with the review of the Financial Services segment. The third quarter is normally the slowest each year in the Ratings business, but not this year, when S&P Credit Market Services produced the most revenue in any quarter so far this year. It is also noteworthy that the growth is coming without the benefit of a recovery in the structured finance market and despite a decline in European issuance. Revenue for S&P Credit Market Services in the third quarter increased by 11.1% based on strong performances in domestic markets. Domestic revenue grew about 20.9%. International revenue was up 0.9%. Revenue for S&P Investment Services grew by 6.3%. For Financial Services in the third quarter, revenue grew by 9.5%, including a $7.3 million pretax gain on divestitures. Operating profit increased by 6.6%. The operating margin was 39.2%, and it reflects the pretax gain on the divestitures and increases in incentive compensation, incremental cost for compliance and substantial staff increases overseas, basically and mainly in India and the acquisition  of TheMarkets.com. Our revenue growth was driven by increased refinancing activity, the investors search for yield, a robust bank loan market and recovery in the equity market, which benefited S&P Indices.
Spreads, the excess interest rate over treasury bonds is a key factor in the level of issuance volume. The composite spread on speculative grade bonds hit a two-year low at the end of April at 553 basis points and then began widening, but spreads began tightening in September and as our table shows, that trend has continued into October. At S&P Credit Market Services, the global high yield new issue market took off in the third quarter. After a slight decline in new issuance in July compared to the same period last year, the global high yield markets started climbing in August, and kept on climbing in September. The global high yield market has already produced more new issued dollar volume in nine months this year than it has in any previous single year. Companies are taking advantage of falling yields to refinance debt and repair the their balance sheets, as this S&P report shows, more than 2/3 of the high yield volume in the United States went for refinancing in the third quarter and for the year-to-date. High-yield issuers are finding a receptive market as investors search for yield at a time when cash is producing anemic returns. And as banks continue to deleverage, investment grade issuers are also stepping up their activity in the bond market to lock in low yields.
The composite spread for investment grade bonds widened over the past month when it was 200 basis points. The spread in mid October of 203 basis points is still slightly above the five-year daily moving average of 198 basis points. Global bank loan ratings also soared in the third quarter, although the absolute volume is still on the low end of the historical averages, fundamentals remained strong, liquidity is good in the United States, and only slightly less so in Europe. There is usually a seasonal slowdown in the summer months and in municipal market, but while the dollar volume of public finance issuers declined in the third quarter, deal volume actually increased. It was fueled by refundings, which were up 11% and the taxable Build America Bonds program, the taxable bond program, which was launched last April has been a boon to municipalities. Taxable bond debt year-to-date accounts for 32% of the muni market. 
The structured finance market is still struggling to recover. The current residential mortgage-backed securities market cannot compete with the spreads on structured vehicles that benefit from explicit or implicit government support provided to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginny Jamie. Refinancing needs have been the source of securitizations for residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities this year, but re-REMIC activity declined in the third quarter, and the residential mortgage-backed market remains under pressure in the face of continued uncertainty over home prices and a sluggish economic recovery.
We are seeing AAA-rated three-year spreads across major asset-backed asset classes, and this would include auto, credit card receivables, student loans, and we're seeing these spreads continue to tighten. The asset-backed securities market has benefited all year from strong auto and student loan issuance, which helped offset a general slowdown in credit card issuance, new regulatory requirements and higher capital cost of bank securitizations have tempered credit card issuance this year. New issuance in the fourth quarter is off to a solid start for corporate. It appears that high-yield issuers are continuing to find a receptive market, and investment grade issuers are still taking advantage of attractive funding rates. We also expect cash to continue to pour into the leveraged loan market, filling the institutional pipeline. Favorable rates and heavy demands should continue to fuel this market. 
The structured finance market will also have to adjust to a number of new measures, resulting from the Dodd-Frank legislation, also the new FDIC Safe Harbor rules and new SEC regulations that impose restrictions on sponsors of securitization and greater regulatory oversight on transactions. Greater disclosure and transparency will benefit investors and after a period of adjustment, S&P expects the use of securitization to be a significant funding tool for many issuers in the years ahead.
At S&P Investment Services, growth at S&P Indices and expansion by Capital IQ were clearly third quarter highlights. Assets under management based on S&P Indices and exchange traded funds set a new record at the end of September, $260.4 billion. That's a 17.9% year-over-year increase and a 12.9% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2010. Growth in spiders and high shares in exchange traded funds were major contributors to the growth.
19 new exchange traded funds links to S&P Indices were launched in the third quarter. That includes nine new Vanguard exchange traded funds based on our core U.S. indices, including the S&P 500. So in the aggregate now, there are 278 exchange traded funds based on S&P Indices. There also was 7.3% growth in the average daily volume for major exchange traded derivatives based on S&P Indices. The daily average in the third quarter was 3,069,000. At the end of each quarterly report, you can expect more new indices from us. This quarter is no exception. You can expect them in various asset classes, including commodities, fixed income and equities. It was also a historic first for S&P Indices in the third quarter. They licensed the Options Clearing Corporation to handle trades of over-the-counter S&P index-based option contracts and to receive royalties. This is the first time S&P has licensed its indices to a clearinghouse for central counter-party clearing.
Capital IQ continued its expansion in global markets, with the acquisition in September of TheMarkets.com. The acquisition positions Capital IQ for significant growth on the buy side. There is only modest overlap between TheMarkets.com's more than 2,000 clients and Capital IQ's 3,300 clients. We expect in the aggregate to add clients, and revenue, great cost synergies and to grow in both domestic and international markets. With this acquisition, Capital IQ now has earnings models, estimates, fixed income, research that are all a part and a key part of the buy side's workflow. This diagram illustrates how the acquisition improves Capital IQ's competitive offering to the buy side, private equity, venture capital, Investor Relations, as well as the business development departments at corporations. Those open circles indicate little or no availability. The acquisition fills in, and this acquisition fills in these circles with a complete investment research and analysis platform for asset managers worldwide based on contributions for more than 1,000 research and estimate contributors.
On the regulatory front, a lot of the uncertainty is now behind us. S&P has filed its application as called for by the European regulations, which took effect on September 7. S&P expects to be registered later this year. S&P received its license in Japan as an approved agency before the October deadline, and we're also discussing new regulatory proposals with Hong Kong, Canada and Taiwan. In the United States, SEC rule making will be required to implement many of the provisions of the new Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to engage with the SEC and market participants as part of the rule-making process.
In anticipation of new regulations, S&P has made significant investments in technology platforms and staffing for quality, criteria, compliance and risk management. We call this our QCCR framework, and again, that's quality, criteria, compliance and risk. And these are four individual groups within S&P that performed these various functions. In 2009, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. This year, spending will increase by about $15 million, mostly in the second half of this year and on a preliminary basis, incremental cost next year could be somewhere in the $12 million to $15 million range, and we're still trying to narrow in on that. Price increases have helped us to mitigate some of these costs, including the incremental expenses for QCCR-related items, we expect that price increases will help us again next year.
We also continue to monitor the impact of new regulations on bank lending. Regulators are forcing banks to shrink their balance sheets. It is already apparent that banks are retrenching and ceding out one of the busiest periods in the corporate bond market. With banks expected to keep more capital, it is inevitable that they will support less debt, and reduced bank lending is obviously a plus for the public debt markets.
Our assessment of legal risk facing the corporation is low, and that remains unchanged. 15 of our motions to dismiss complaints have not been granted, and five more cases have been withdrawn, that's 20. Last Friday, there was another favorable ruling in the case of Rice versus S&P and Moody's, a federal district court in California dismissed, with prejudice, a complaint concerning plaintiffs investments in Fannie Mae securities. There was some key points in this decision that we're studying. In dismissing the intentional misrepresentation claim, Judge Cormac Carney wrote, and I quote, ""Defendants credit ratings are opinions of the future creditworthiness or value of companies and therefore, are not actionable unless plaintiffs can demonstrate the defendants' representatives who publish credit ratings actually knew that credit ratings were false or did not believe that the credit ratings were true at the time that each credit rating was issued"". The judge also recognize that a negligent misrepresentation claim concerning a professional opinion can only be stated by ""A narrow and circumscribed group of persons to whom or for whom the misrepresentations were made. The rational for limiting liability to a specific group of persons is to protect professionals, who provide information from unlimited and uncertain liability"". In these important ways, this ruling recognizes limitations facing plaintiffs, who seek to assert legal claims concerning to S&P's ratings.
In Italy, there was a development earlier this month in the prime lot litigation, which got started in the fall of 2005. On October 1, two court-appointed expert, both accountants, filed a report that was critical of the ratings assigned to prime lot by S&P during the timeframe of 2000 to 2003. The S&P expert disputed the methodology, findings and conclusions of the accountant report, which is a matter of laws not binding in court. The judge who appointed the two accountants to assist her in her determination has scheduled a hearing in early January. We continue to believe that the outcome of this litigation against two subsidiaries of The McGraw-Hill Companies should not have any material adverse effect on our condition.
Let's sum up for Financial Services. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We had expected a 100 basis point decline in the operating margin. We are now expect 150 basis point decline in the operating margin, primarily due to the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. 
Okay, with that, let's move over to McGraw-Hill Education operations.  In the seasonally most important quarter of the year for Education, we grew both in the elementary-high school market and in the U.S. Higher Education markets, and we did so with an operating margin of 33.9% for the segment. And this includes a 40 basis points from the gain on a divestiture. That still makes this year's third quarter performance by McGraw-Hill Education the best since 2007 on an operating margin of 35.0% was reported. 
For McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter, revenue increased 5.5%. Operating profit, including the $3.8 million pretax gain on the divestiture, grew by 19.9%. The operating margin of 33.9% compares to 29.8% for the same period last year. Control of costs and expenses and improved results in the elementary-high school market and the U.S. Higher Education market contributed to this performance. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group increased by 6.7%. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education professional and international grew by 4.3%. As we had expected, state new adoptions were key to our performance in this year's el-hi [elementary-high] market. We're on track to capture about 30% of this year's state new adoption market at 825 million to 875 million this year, the state new adoption market will grow 65% to 75% over last year. This increased spending is the prime reason why we expect the el-hi market to grow 4% to 6% this year.
According to the most recent AAP, that's the Association of American Publishers' report, sales in the el-hi market were up 8% through August because of a 24.7% increase in state adoption sales. Open territory sales after eight months were down 7.3%. These non-adoption states represented 44.8%, roughly 45% of this year's revenue. Based on the August results, the el-hi market could hit the high end of our 4% to 6% growth forecast if industry sales remained flat with the last four months of 2010. As this marked chart shows, industry sales grew in each of the last four months of 2009, so achieving that level of growth will be challenging. September results for the industry are not yet available, but indications are that overall sales slowed during the month, adding to the challenge. For McGraw-Hill, however, September was another strong month, especially in adoption states.
Reading, literature and math represented the biggest revenue opportunities in this year's state new adoption market. The McGraw-Hill School Education Group did particularly well in the very large K-5 reading market, with strong performances in Texas and California. The school group expects to capture about 45% of the K-5 reading market and approximately 32% of the K-12 reading and literature opportunity. This school group's K-5 Treasures program is the key to its success in reading. In math, the school group expects to win more than 40% of the secondary school market, with programs in Florida, California, Indiana, West Virginia and Oklahoma. But underperformance in Florida's K-5 math adoption will probably hold our overall capture rate in K-12 math to about 28%.
Open territory sales were down in the third quarter for us, as well as for the industry, a reflection of budget pressures in such states as New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. In testing, the third quarter is normally slow and this year, we had the additional impact of the planned phaseout of custom contracts in Florida, California and Arizona. Procedural delays in signing some important contracts were also a factor, but those issues will be settled in the fourth quarter, a seasonally important period in the testing market. 
A really fine year is taking shape in the U.S. Higher Education market. For the second year in a row, the U.S. Higher Education market is benefiting from increased enrollments. An important driver is the federal government's huge step up in the student aid area under the new administration, spending on student aid has increased by nearly 50% to $145 billion. We think increased aid is reflected in the growing Higher Education enrollments that we are seeing at the start of the new school year. Preliminary information indicates that fall enrollments at colleges and universities grew by 4% to 5% this year, an increase we had not anticipated at the beginning of 2010. Enrollments in the fall of 2009 grew by 7% to 8%. All of our major product lines produced year-over-year growth in the Higher Education market in the critical third quarter, and there is added impetus from the double-digit growth of digital products and services. Our lineup of homework management, assessment and tutoring products for college and university students is gaining traction and expanding the addressable market.
Through September, registrations for these products have grown to $1.9 million, a 26% year-over-year increase. McGraw-Hill Connect, that's our all digital teaching and learning platform, is our leader in this rapidly growing market, and we continue to strengthen it. That's why we recently acquired Tegrity whose scalable, automated lecture capture service has become a core feature of McGraw-Hill Connect since it was introduced last fall. Lecture capture gives students the ability to review material presented in the classroom any time, anywhere, for replay online or on any mobile device. That is a powerful tool for studying and learning. More than 200 educational institutions already use the Tegrity cloud-based service.
We have also launched McGraw-Hill Create. It is a Google-like search engine that enables instructors to customize quality content for their courses. They can draw in 4,000 McGraw-Hill textbooks, 5,500 articles 11,000 literature, philosophy and humanities readings, and 25,000 business case studies from such providers as the Harvard Business School. Once a customized text has been developed on Create, the instructor can get a digital review copy in less than an hour. Printed review copies will be delivered in only three to five days. Students can purchase McGraw-Hill Create eBooks to the McGraw-Hill eBook store or buy printed copies at the campus bookstore. And through the recently announced partnership with Blackboard, instructors will have access to the full suite of McGraw-Hill Create content through their Blackboard accounts.
If you're looking for a window into our future in digital and international markets, take a look at this next slide. It's a custom site for the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Egypt. It is hosted on McGraw-Hill Education's international Create eBook Store, which is now live around the world. The McGraw-Hill Create eBook store made it possible to deliver 36 titles to this Egyptian institution for students to use in their new semester. The customer selection of 36 titles underscores the scope of McGraw-Hill's global content creation. The list includes titles drawn from U.S. McGraw-Hill Higher Education or U.S. professional catalog, as well as original titles published by our subsidiaries in India and in Europe. Because of the capabilities of McGraw-Hill Create, 30 of the titles will be delivered directly to students using institutionally purchased access codes at the school's request. Six titles will be delivered as eBooks for testing the student experience with the enTourage, that's the Ed.D trademark, it's a new e-reader.
Another site has been established at the Rotterdam School of Business in the Netherlands using McGraw-Hill Create. That micro site will host 29 custom eBooks from our catalog for student purchases. One more observation about using McGraw-Hill Create delivery, is this world, we're not supplying a physical product. That means no printing, no binding cost, no inventory of warehousing cost, no shipping charges, no returns and no used books. Clearly, connecting content and managing digital assets globally is a powerful combination that is creating new opportunities as we shift away from our legacy model to an interactive and digital model.
The same transition is taking place in professional markets. Here, we're seeing an acceleration in the online ordering of hard copies and a huge increase in the sale of eBooks. Since the beginning of the year, our eBook sales through the major eBook retailers to consumers have nearly tripled. Our best-selling eBooks in the third quarter ranged from the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, to the famous Graham and Dodd's work, Security Analysis. We have more than 5,000 professional titles available as eBooks. 
Even with the continued rapid growth of digital products and services, the fourth quarter this year will be challenging. Last year, we had a significant upswing in operating profits based on the surge in the second quarter semester orders in the U.S. Higher Education market, and improved results in the professional and international markets. The bulk of second semester ordering in Higher Education sometimes occurs in December and in other years, it comes in January, complicating the balancing between the fourth quarter forecasting in this market. The U.S. Higher Education market is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% this year. There is pent-up demand in the el-hi market, but budget pressures are continued to constraint school district spending in many regions. The arrival of new federal funds could positive factor, however. The McGraw-Hill school education group sales teams are still working on a number of large basal adoptions in the open territories, as well as some excellent fourth quarter opportunities for intervention products across the country. Federal funding will clearly play a part in some of these purchases, but in other cases, it will be harder to identify because large district orders tend to be paid for through a blend of funding sources, so it's difficult to predict what will materialize.
So with that, let sum up our McGraw-Hill Education revenue. We still expect a low single-digit increase, operating margin, we had been forecasting flat margins. We now expect an improvement of 200 basis points to 14% for 2010. 
Okay, let's move over to our review our third segment, and that's the Information & Media segment.  Key contributors to this segment's third quarter performance were the continued solid growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television advertising and the effect of the business we have divestiture. In the third quarter, revenue declined by 4.7%, but excluding business week, it actually grew by 5.1%. Operating profit increased by 55.1% or $16.3 million. The operating margin was 20.1%, up from 12.4% for the same period last year. 
The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, increased by 3.3%. In volatile energy markets, the demand for Platts data and information products continues to drive strong growth in both the United States and international markets, and incidentally more than 60% of Platts' revenue comes from outside of the United States.  Platts is growing rapidly across a number of commodities. It is continuing to expand its coverage of the refined petroleum markets in the United States, Europe and Asia, with new price assessments in gasoline, fuel oil, naptha, naptha, being the raw material for gasoline. 
Platts expanded its suite of daily spot price assessments to include alumina, that's a mineral produced from bauxite ore that is used to make aluminum. The new price assessments, the world's first daily price references for alumina address the needs of miners, smelders, refiners and traders for the independent source of open market spot prices to better determine valuations for short and long-term contracts. Platts also began producing new price assessments in the India coal market. India's thermal coal imports are changing trade flows radically, and increasing the need for expanded more frequent and transparent price information. These new assessments address the needs of power producers, coal traders and ship brokers for an independent source of India-related open market spot prices, making Platts even more relevant in this growing market.
There was some softness in construction, particularly among smaller regional contractors, who have been hardest hit by the declining activity in this market. Weakness in the global Automotive business offset improvements in the non-auto parts of the market at J.D. Power and Associates. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group increased by 23.5% to $23.6 million. The combination of political advertising and improved local and national time sales accounted for the increase. In this political season, the contest for governor and heated race rates for a Senate seat and issue related advertising in Colorado are attracting significant ad dollars.
Therefore, summing up for Information & Media, there is no change in our revenue guidance. We still expect the revenue decline in the mid-single digits, but mid-single-digit growth excluding BusinessWeek. We now expect the operating margin in the mid to high teens. we Had anticipated an operating margin in the mid-teens, and now we're addressing that upwards a little. 
That concludes our review of the operations and therefore, summing up for the corporation. We anticipate earnings per share in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes $0.02 of the onetime gains from divestitures, but includes dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. Okay, let's hold it there and with that, let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer, for his results."
21719,114360784,81691,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisi",2063,"Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisitions: the Research and Estimates Business of TheMarkets.com for Capital IQ; Tegrity, which becomes part of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group; and PIPAL Research by CRISIL. The acquisition of Tegrity closed in October and Pipal Research is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
We expect to spend approximately $360 million on these acquisitions and a recent equity investment in Ambow Education, a leading provider of educational and career enhancement services in China. The most significant of these acquisitions, of course, is TheMarkets.com, of diluted earnings per share by $0.01 in the third quarter, and will do so again in the fourth quarter. In 2011, TheMarkets.com acquisition is expected to generate approximately $60 million in revenue and despite an anticipated $15 million in intangible amortization, the acquisition will be both accounting and cash flow accretive in 2011. We also had three divestitures in the third quarter, a small secondary school business in Australia, which generated a $3.8 million pretax gain and two by CRISIL. They are a 7% equity interest in the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange of India. We continue to maintain a 5% ownership, the divestiture of the 7% was required to comply with local regulations regarding foreign ownership rules. And also, CRISIL's remaining 10% interest in Gas Strategies Group, the 90% interest we had sold that back in December of 2008.
The two CRISIL divestitures this year generated $7.3 million in pretax gains. Now because CRISIL is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, part of the gain is deductive for purposes of calculating EPS, and is shown as a component of net income attributable to non-controlling interest. This was $2.3 million, which represents the post-tax portion of the gain attributable to the minority owners of CRISIL. In addition to the acquisitions, we continued to actively repurchased shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $69 million at an average price of $31.14 per share.  
Year-to-date, we are purchased 8.7 million shares for $255.8 million, averaging $29.37 per share. 8.4 million shares remained in the 2007 program authorized by the board.  Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 309.3 million in the third quarter, a 4.4 million decrease versus the previous year due primarily to the full year impact of the second quarter share repurchases. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.9 million for the second quarter, reflecting the full impact of second quarter share repurchases, as well as the weighted impact of third quarter share repurchases. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 308 million.
We continued to be well capitalized with net cash and short-term investments as of September 30 of $158 million. The shift to a net cash position from a net debt position of $53 million at the end of the second quarter is driven primarily by strong free cash flow, partially offset by funding for acquisitions and share purchases. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.356 billion, while gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in senior notes. Our debt is entirely in long term unsecured senior notes, no commercial paper is outstanding.
The outlook for free cash flow continues to improve. Now to calculate free cash flow, we start with our after-tax cash from operations and deduct working, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt. During the third quarter, our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated free cash flow of $552 million. Year-to-date in 2010, we generated free cash flow of $651 million versus $507 million in the same period last year for an increase of $144 million. The improvement is due primarily to stronger operating results and a continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow this year to be clearly in excess of $700 million versus our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million. The improvement is driven by stronger operating results, reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated.  Just as a reminder, free cash flow last year was $770 million. 
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we made a $14 million discretionary contribution in the third quarter, and we anticipate making an additional discretionary payment in the fourth quarter, potentially in the range of $50 million, and that is factored into the free cash flow projections. 
Now let's look at expenses. As a reminder, I'll
Speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth, excluding 2009 restructuring charges, as well as 2009 and 2010 gains and losses on divestitures.  So let's start with Education. Third quarter adjusted expenses were roughly flat, declining 0.1%. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses declined 1.3%. Contributing to the lower expense levels were two key decisions last year. The first was to combine the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations. The second was the planned phaseout of statewide low-margin custom test contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. A $15 million decline in amortization of prepublication cost also benefited third quarter results. Increases in selling and marketing cost for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings. As Terry has indicated, we now expect margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guidance of flat margins.
For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 13.3% in the third quarter and 12.8% at constant currencies. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses increased 10.1% and 9.3% at constant currencies. The growth in expenses in the third quarter and year-to-date was driven by increased salaries and occupancy cost, primarily for international hires and higher incentive compensation. 
Third quarter expenses were also impacted by TheMarkets.com acquisition, that resulted in an incremental $5 million in expense. There also was $5.4 million in additional cost related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives. Now taken together, these increased total Financial Services expense by 2.7%. The fourth quarter is expected to show a comparable increase in cost related to our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're still projecting additional full year cost of approximately $15 million, as Terry stated.
One last comment on Financial Services. Third quarter expense growth in the beginning of the year, I indicated that total stock-based compensation for McGraw-Hill was expected to increase roughly $30 million versus 2009, due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off a depressed base. Due to stronger operating results, we now expect an increase of roughly $40 million. The majority of this increase as anticipated was realized in the third quarter due to particularly depressed levels in the third quarter 2009. As a result, Financial Services had a $10.6 million increase in stock-based compensation for the quarter.
As Terry indicated , we now expect Financial Services margins to decline by approximately 150 basis points, which implies expenses will increased roughly 9% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 7% to 8%, and increases largely driven by TheMarkets.com acquisition. 
At Information & Media, third quarter and year-to-date adjusted expenses declined 13.1% and 17.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced third quarter revenue by $22 million and expenses by $32 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $10 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $78 million and expenses by $111 million for a positive profit impact of $33 million. And of course, for the fourth quarter, the divestiture of BusinessWeek is expected to reduce revenue by $22 million and expense by $27 million. The positive impact here is $5 million. This will result in full year savings of $38 million. 
For 2010, we expect adjusted expenses to decline in the mid-teens versus our previous guidance of the decline in the low teens. Corporate expenses in the third quarter is $44.4 million, a $16.5 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation compared to lower levels in 2009, as well as normal increases due to the stronger operating results. Increased excess vacant space was also a contributor to increased corporate costs.
We are making progress in reducing excess space. We finalized one agreement to sublease some excess space in New York this month and have received several promising inquiries regarding additional space. Because we are subleasing the space at lower rates than what we are currently paying, the accounting rules require us to take a one-time charge for the difference between the present value of the payments we will receive versus the payments we will have to make over the term of the lease. Our new earnings per share guidance excludes this one-time charge, since we are still finalizing accounting for this charge.
Now excluding the charge, we now expect full year 2010 corporate expense to increased $30 million to $35 million versus our previous guidance of an increase of $25 million to $30 million due to additional incentive compensation accruals. Net interest expense was $19.3 million in the third quarter compared to about $18 million in the same period last year and $21 million in the second quarter of 2010.  We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was roughly $76.9 million. The company's effective tax rate in the third quarter and year-to-date was 36.4%, which is unchanged from 2009. We expect a comparable rate for the full year. 
Now let's turn to investments.  The publication investments were $39.3 million in the third quarter, $5.4 million lower than last year. Year-to-date, pre-pub investments were $99.3 million, a $30.4 million decrease versus the prior year. For the year, we now expect pre-pub investments of approximately $160 million, and that's versus our previous estimate of the $195 million to $205 million. 
Now the reduction in our pre-pub investment estimate is due to several factors. First, the timing of the adoption of Common Core Standards by various states. To date, 36 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards for K-12 math, reading and language arts. Also, we continued to reevaluate several programs to enhance our digital offerings. These actions have caused timing delays for a number of our pre-pub investments. In addition, we continue to realize savings from combining the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Now purchases of prop and equipment were $16.6 million the third quarter, about $1 million higher than last year. And year-to-date purchases were approximately $39 million. We now expect on a full-year basis the expenditures to be in the $70 million to $80 million range versus our previous estimate of $90 million to $100 million. This compares to $68.5 million in 2009.
Now let's take a look at some of non-cash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $112 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decrease versus the third quarter of 2009. For the full year, we now expect $245 million to $250 million versus the previous estimate of $260 million to $265 million. This compares to $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the recent lower level of investments. 
Depreciation was $25 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million last year. We now expect full year depreciation to be slightly below last year, which was $113 million. Amortization of intangibles was $9 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $32 million for the first nine months. Reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions, we now expect it to be closer to $50 million for the full year versus our previous estimate of $40 million. Our unearned revenue continues to grow. We ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, up 4.2% for the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, growth was approximately 5%. Financial Services represented 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digits, driven by strong growth in ratings-related information products, S&P Indices and Capital IQ. While still small, unearned revenue at McGraw-Hill Education is showing strong growth due to sales of digital products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry."

So it's a little bit early, but if you look just at the calendar, at or above 2010 is what we're thinking on that one. New issuance, Brian, as you know, coming off of a softer second quarter, we really ramped up, especially the high yield markets. And again, the big number that we watch is the refinancing numbers out through 2014, still it's about $2 trillion in terms of maturities coming due on that part. And of course, there was a lot of refinancing or refundings in the third quarter, a lot of the new issuance that way. We've seen a continued strong corporate market in here. Issuance, a little softer in Europe, but again, one would think that it should be still fairly strong, and we have evidence of that at this point.

As Don mentioned with me this morning is Bob Bahash, he's our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And I'll start by reviewing the third quarter results and our new guidance on earnings for 2010. After our presentations, obviously, we'll go in any direction you would like and answer any questions or take your comments about The McGraw-Hill Companies and our prospects.
Earlier this morning, we reported a 15% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter, earnings per share of $01.23, now that included a $0.02 gain on some divestitures and a $0.01 dilution on the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. Revenue grew by 5.5% in the third quarter, but increased 6.8% if you exclude the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Based on that strong performance in the seasonally most important quarter of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2010. We now anticipate earnings per share this year in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and we expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes the one-time gain of $0.02 from divestitures, but does include dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. There were many contributors to our strong third quarter. We are very pleased to be firing on so many cylinders. This morning, we'll provide the details on how those results were achieved.
Let's begin with the review of the Financial Services segment. The third quarter is normally the slowest each year in the Ratings business, but not this year, when S&P Credit Market Services produced the most revenue in any quarter so far this year. It is also noteworthy that the growth is coming without the benefit of a recovery in the structured finance market and despite a decline in European issuance. Revenue for S&P Credit Market Services in the third quarter increased by 11.1% based on strong performances in domestic markets. Domestic revenue grew about 20.9%. International revenue was up 0.9%. Revenue for S&P Investment Services grew by 6.3%. For Financial Services in the third quarter, revenue grew by 9.5%, including a $7.3 million pretax gain on divestitures. Operating profit increased by 6.6%. The operating margin was 39.2%, and reflects the pretax gain on the divestitures and increases in incentive compensation, incremental cost for compliance and substantial staff increases overseas, basically and mainly in India and the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. Our revenue growth was driven by increased refinancing activity, the investors search for yield, a robust bank loan market and recovery in the equity market, which benefited S&P Indices.
Spreads, the excess interest rate over treasury bonds is a key factor in the level of issuance volume. The composite spread on speculative grade bonds hit a two-year low at the end of April at 553 basis points and then began widening, but spreads began tightening in September and as our table shows, that trend has continued into October. At S&P Credit Market Services, the global high yield new issue market took off in the third quarter. After a slight decline in new issuance in July compared to the same period last year, the global high yield markets started climbing in August, and kept on climbing in September. The global high yield market has already produced more new issued dollar volume in nine months this year than it has in any previous single year. Companies are taking advantage of falling yields to refinance debt and repair the their balance sheets, as this S&P report shows, more than 2/3 of the high yield volume in the United States went for refinancing in the third quarter and for the year-to-date. High-yield issuers are finding a receptive market as investors search for yield at a time when cash is producing anemic returns. And as banks continue to deleverage, investment grade issuers are also stepping up their activity in the bond market to lock in low yields.
The composite spread for investment grade bonds widened over the past month when it was 200 basis points. The spread in mid October of 203 basis points is still slightly above the five-year daily moving average of 198 basis points. Global bank loan ratings also soared in the third quarter, although the absolute volume is still on the low end of the historical averages, fundamentals remained strong, liquidity is good in the United States, and only slightly less so in Europe. There is usually a seasonal slowdown in the summer months and in municipal market, but while the dollar volume of public finance issuers declined in the third quarter, deal volume actually increased. It was fueled by refundings, which were up 11% and the taxable Build America Bonds program, the taxable bond program, which was launched last April has been a boon to municipalities. Taxable bond debt year-to-date accounts for 32% of the muni market.
The structured finance market is still struggling to recover. The current residential mortgage-backed securities market cannot compete with the spreads on structured vehicles that benefit from explicit or implicit government support provided to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginny Jamie. Refinancing needs have been the source of securitizations for residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities this year, but re-REMIC activity declined in the third quarter, and the residential mortgage-backed market remains under pressure in the face of continued uncertainty over home prices and a sluggish economic recovery.
We are seeing AAA-rated three-year spreads across major asset-backed asset classes, and this would include auto, credit card receivables, student loans, and we're seeing these spreads continue to tighten. The asset-backed securities market has benefited all year from strong auto and student loan issuance, which helped offset a general slowdown in credit card issuance, new regulatory requirements and higher capital cost of bank securitizations have tempered credit card issuance this year. New issuance in the fourth quarter is off to a solid start for corporate. It appears that high-yield issuers are continuing to find a receptive market, and investment grade issuers are still taking advantage of attractive funding rates. We also expect cash to continue to pour into the leveraged loan market, filling the institutional pipeline. Favorable rates and heavy demands should continue to fuel this market.
The structured finance market will also have to adjust to a number of new measures, resulting from the Dodd-Frank legislation, also the new FDIC Safe Harbor rules and new SEC regulations that impose restrictions on sponsors of securitization and greater regulatory oversight on transactions. Greater disclosure and transparency will benefit investors and after a period of adjustment, S&P expects the use of securitization to be a significant funding tool for many issuers in the years ahead.
At S&P Investment Services, growth at S&P Indices and expansion by Capital IQ were clearly third quarter highlights. Assets under management based on S&P Indices and exchange traded funds set a new record at the end of September, $260.4 billion. That's a 17.9% year-over-year increase and a 12.9% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2010. Growth in spiders and high shares in exchange traded funds were major contributors to the growth.
19 new exchange traded funds links to S&P Indices were launched in the third quarter. That includes nine new Vanguard exchange traded funds based on our core U.S. indices, including the S&P 500. So in the aggregate now, there are 278 exchange traded funds based on S&P Indices. There also was 7.3% growth in the average daily volume for major exchange traded derivatives based on S&P Indices. The daily average in the third quarter was 3,069,000. At the end of each quarterly report, you can expect more new indices from us. This quarter is no exception. You can expect them in various asset classes, including commodities, fixed income and equities. It was also a historic first for S&P Indices in the third quarter. They licensed the Options Clearing Corporation to handle trades of over-the-counter S&P index-based option contracts and to receive royalties. This is the first time S&P has licensed its indices to a clearinghouse for central counter-party clearing.
Capital IQ continued its expansion in global markets, with the acquisition in September of TheMarkets.com. The acquisition positions Capital IQ for significant growth on the buy side. There is only modest overlap between TheMarkets.com's more than 2,000 clients and Capital IQ's 3,300 clients. We expect in the aggregate to add clients, add revenue, create cost synergies and to grow in both domestic and international markets. With this acquisition, Capital IQ now has earnings models, estimates, fixed income, research that are all a part and a key part of the buy side's workflow. This diagram illustrates how the acquisition improves Capital IQ's competitive offering to the buy side, private equity, venture capital, Investor Relations, as well as the business development departments at corporations. Those open circles indicate little or no availability. The acquisition fills in, and this acquisition fills in these circles with a complete investment research and platform for asset managers worldwide based on contributions for more than 1,000 research and estimate contributors.
On the regulatory front, a lot of the uncertainty is now behind us. S&P has filed its application as called for by the European regulations, which took effect on September 7. S&P expects to be registered later this year. S&P received its license in Japan as an approved agency before the October deadline, and we're also discussing new regulatory proposals with Hong Kong, Canada and Taiwan. In the United States, SEC rule making will be required to implement many of the provisions of the new Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to engage with the SEC and market participants as part of the rule-making process.
In anticipation of new regulations, S&P has made significant investments in technology platforms and staffing for quality, criteria, compliance and risk management. We call this our QCCR framework, and again, that's quality, criteria, compliance and risk. And these are four individual groups within S&P that performed these various functions. In 2009, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. This year, spending will increase by about $15 million, mostly in the second half of this year and on a preliminary basis, incremental cost next year could be somewhere in the $12 million to $15 million range, and we're still trying to narrow in on that. Price increases have helped us to mitigate some of these costs, including the incremental expenses for QCCR-related items we expect that price increases will help us again next year.
We also continue to monitor the impact of new regulations on bank lending. Regulators are forcing banks to shrink their balance sheets. It is already apparent that banks are retrenching and sitting out one of the busiest periods in the corporate bond market. With banks expected to keep more capital, it is inevitable that they will support less debt, and reduced bank lending is obviously a plus for the public debt markets.
Our assessment of legal risk facing the corporation is low, and that remains unchanged. Fifteen of our motions to dismiss complaints have not been granted, and five more cases have been withdrawn, that's 20. Last Friday, there was another favorable ruling in the case of Rice versus S&P and Moody's, a federal district court in California dismissed, with prejudice, a complaint concerning plaintiff's investments in Fannie Mae securities. There was some key points in this decision that we're studying. In dismissing the intentional misrepresentation claim, Judge Cormac Carney wrote, and I quote, ""Defendants credit ratings are opinions of the future creditworthiness or value of companies and therefore, are not actionable unless plaintiffs can demonstrate the defendants' representatives who publish credit ratings actually knew that credit ratings were false or did not believe that the credit ratings were true at the time that each credit rating was issued."" The judge also recognize that a negligent misrepresentation claim concerning a professional opinion can only be stated by ""A narrow and circumscribed group of persons to whom or for whom the misrepresentations were made. The rational for limiting liability to a specific group of persons is to protect professionals, who provide information from unlimited and uncertain liability."" In these important ways, this ruling recognizes limitations facing plaintiffs, who seek to assert legal claims concerning S&P's ratings.
In Italy, there was a development earlier this month in the prime lot litigation, which got started in the fall of 2005. On October 1, two court-appointed expert, both accountants, filed a report that was critical of the ratings assigned to prime lot by S&P during the timeframe of 2000 to 2003. The S&P expert disputed the methodology, findings and conclusions of the accountant report, which is a matter of laws not binding in court. The judge who appointed the two accountants to assist her in her determination has scheduled a hearing in early January. We continue to believe that the outcome of this litigation against two subsidiaries of The McGraw-Hill Companies should not have any material adverse effect on our condition.
Let's sum up for Financial Services. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We had expected a 100 basis point decline in the operating margin. We are now expect 150 basis point decline in the operating margin, primarily due to the acquisition of Markets.com.
Okay, with that, let's move over to McGraw-Hill Education operations. In the seasonal most important quarter of the year for Education, we grew both in the elementary-high school market and in the U.S. Higher Education markets, and we did so with an operating margin of 33.9% for the segment. And this includes a 40 basis points from the gain on a divestiture. That still makes this year's third quarter performance by McGraw-Hill Education the best since 2007 on an operating margin of 35.0% was reported. 
For McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter, revenue increased 5.5%. Operating profit, including the $3.8 million pretax gain on the divestiture, grew by 19.9%. The operating margin of 33.9% compares to 29.8% for the same period last year. Control of costs and expenses and improved results in the elementary-high school market and the U.S. Higher Education market contributed to this performance. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group increased by 6.7%. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education professional and international grew by 4.3%. As we had expected, state new adoptions were key to our performance in this year's el-hi [elementary-high] market. We're on track to capture about 30% of this year's state new adoption market at 825 million to 875 million this year, the state new adoption market will grow 65% to 75% over last year. This increased spending is the prime reason why we expect the el-hi market to grow 4% to 6% this year.
According to the most recent AAP, that's the Association of American Publishers' report, sales in the el-hi market were up 8% through August because of a 24.7% increase in state adoption sales. Open territory sales after eight months were down 7.3%. These non-adoption states represented 44.8%, roughly 45% of this year's revenue. Based on the August results, the el-hi market could hit the high end of our 4% to 6% growth forecast if industry sales remained flat with the last four months of 2010. As this marked chart shows, industry sales grew in each of the last four months of 2009, so achieving that level of growth will be challenging. September results for the industry are not yet available, but indications are that overall sales slowed during the month, adding to the challenge. For McGraw-Hill, however, September was another strong month, especially in adoption states.
Reading, literature and math represented the biggest revenue opportunities in this year's state new adoption market. The McGraw-Hill School Education Group did particularly well in the very large K-5 reading market, with strong performances in Texas and California. The school group expects to capture about 45% of the K-5 reading market and approximately 32% of the K-12 reading and literature opportunity. This school group's K-5 Treasures program is the key to its success in reading. In math, the school group expects to win more than 40% of the secondary school market, with programs in Florida, California, Indiana, West Virginia and Oklahoma. But underperformance in Florida's K-5 math adoption will probably hold our overall capture rate in K-12 math to about 28%.
Open territory sales were down in the third quarter for us, as well as for the industry, a reflection of budget pressures in such states as New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. In testing, the third quarter is normally slow and this year, we had the additional impact of the planned phaseout of custom contracts in Florida, California and Arizona. Procedural delays in signing some important contracts were also a factor, but those issues will be settled in the fourth quarter, a seasonally important period in the testing market.
A really fine year is taking shape in the U.S. Higher Education market. For the second year in a row, the U.S. Higher Education market is benefiting from increased enrollments. An important driver is the federal government's huge step up in the student aid area under the new administration, spending on student aid has increased by nearly 50% to $145 billion. We think increased aid is reflected in the growing Higher Education enrollments that we are seeing at the start of the new school year. Preliminary information indicates that fall enrollments at colleges and universities grew by 4% to 5% this year, an increase we had not anticipated at the beginning of 2010. Enrollments in the fall of 2009 grew by 7% to 8%. All of our major product lines produced year-over-year growth in the Higher Education market in the critical third quarter, and there is added impetus from the double-digit growth of digital products and services. Our lineup of homework management, assessment and tutoring products for college and university students is gaining traction and expanding the addressable market.
Through September, registrations for these products have grown to $1.9 million, a 26% year-over-year increase. McGraw-Hill Connect, that's our all digital teaching and learning platform, is our leader in this rapidly growing market, and we continue to strengthen it. That's why we recently acquired Tegrity whose scalable, automated lecture capture service has become a core feature of McGraw-Hill Connect since it was introduced last fall. Lecture capture gives students the ability to review material presented in the classroom any time, anywhere, for replay online or on any mobile device. That is a powerful tool for studying and learning. More than 200 educational institutions already use the Tegrity cloud-based service.
We have also launched McGraw-Hill Create. It is a Google-like search engine that enables instructors to customize quality content for their courses. They can draw in 4,000 McGraw-Hill textbooks, 5,500 articles 11,000 literature, philosophy and humanities readings, and 25,000 business case studies from such providers as the Harvard Business School. Once a customized text has been developed on Create, the instructor can get a digital review copy in less than an hour. Printed review copies will be delivered in only three to five days. Students can purchase McGraw-Hill Create eBooks to the McGraw-Hill eBook store or buy printed copies at the campus bookstore. And through the recently announced partnership with Blackboard, instructors will have access to the full suite of McGraw-Hill Create content through their Blackboard accounts.
If you're looking for a window into our future in digital and international markets, take a look at this next slide. It's a custom site for the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Egypt. It is hosted on McGraw-Hill Education's international Create eBook Store, which is now live around the world. The McGraw-Hill Create eBook store made it possible to deliver 36 titles to this Egyptian institution for students to use in their new semester. The customer selection of 36 titles underscores the scope of McGraw-Hill's global content creation. The list includes titles drawn from U.S. McGraw-Hill Higher Education or U.S. professional catalog, as well as original titles published by our subsidiaries in India and in Europe. Because of the capabilities of McGraw-Hill Create, 30 of the titles will be delivered directly to students using institutionally purchased access codes at the school's request. Six titles will be delivered as eBooks for testing the student experience with the enTourage, that's the Ed.D trademark, it's a new e-reader.
Another site has been established at the Rotterdam School of Business in the Netherlands using McGraw-Hill Create. That micro site will host 29 custom eBooks from our catalog for student purchases. One more observation about using McGraw-Hill Create delivery, is this world, we're not supplying a physical product. That means no printing, no binding cost, no inventory of warehousing cost, no shipping charges, no returns and no used books. Clearly, connecting content and managing digital assets globally is a powerful combination that is creating new opportunities as we shift away from our legacy model to an interactive and digital model.
The same transition is taking place in professional markets. Here, we're seeing an acceleration in the online ordering of hard copies and a huge increase in the sale of eBooks. Since the beginning of the year, our eBook sales through the major eBook retailers to consumers have nearly tripled. Our best-selling eBooks in the third quarter ranged from the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, to the famous Graham and Dodd's work, Security Analysis. We have more than 5,000 professional titles available as eBooks. 
Even with the continued rapid growth of digital products and services, the fourth quarter this year will be challenging. Last year, we had a significant upswing in operating profits based on the surge in the second quarter semester orders in the U.S. Higher Education market, and improved results in the professional and international markets. The bulk of second semester ordering in Higher Education sometimes occurs in December and in other years, it comes in January, complicating the balancing between the fourth quarter forecasting in this market. The U.S. Higher Education market is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% this year. There is pent-up demand in the el-hi market, but budget pressures are continued to constraint school district spending in many regions. The arrival of new federal funds could positive factor, however. The McGraw-Hill school education group sales teams are still working on a number of large basal adoptions in the open territories, as well as some excellent fourth quarter opportunities for intervention products across the country. Federal funding will clearly play a part in some of these purchases, but in other cases, it will be harder to identify because large district orders tend to be paid for through a blend of funding sources, so it's difficult to predict what will materialize.
So with that, let sum up our McGraw-Hill Education revenue. We still expect a low single-digit increase, operating margin, we had been forecasting flat margins. We now expect an improvement of 200 basis points to 14% for 2010.
Okay, let's move over to our review our third segment, and that's the Information & Media segment. Key contributors to this segment's third quarter performance were the continued solid growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television advertising and the effect of the business we have divestiture. In the third quarter, revenue declined by 4.7%, but excluding business week, it actually grew by 5.1%. Operating profit increased by 55.1% or $16.3 million. The operating margin was 20.1%, up from 12.4% for the same period last year.
The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, increased by 3.3%. In volatile energy markets, the demand for Platts data and information products continues to drive strong growth in both the United States and international markets, and incidentally more than 60% of Platts' revenue comes from outside of the United States. Platts is growing rapidly across a number of commodities. It is continuing to expand its coverage of the refined petroleum markets in the United States, Europe and Asia, with new price assessments in gasoline, fuel oil, naptha, naptha, being the raw material for gasoline.
Platts expanded its suite of daily spot price assessments to include alumina, that's a mineral produced from bauxite ore that is used to make aluminum. The new price assessments, the world's first daily price references for alumina address the needs of miners, smelders, refiners and traders for the independent source of open spot prices to better determine valuations for short and long-term contracts. Platts also began producing new price assessments in the India coal market. India's thermal coal imports are changing trade flows radically, and increasing the need for expanded more frequent and transparent price information. These new assessments address the needs of power producers, coal traders and ship brokers for an independent source of India-related open market spot prices, making Platts even more relevant in this growing market.
There was some softness in construction, particularly among smaller regional contractors, who have been hardest hit by the declining activity in this market. Weakness in the global Automotive business offset improvements in the non-auto parts of the market at J.D. Power and Associates. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group increased by 23.5% to $23.6 million. The combination of political advertising and improved local and national time sales accounted for the increase. In this political season, the contest for governor and heated race rates for a Senate seat and issue related advertising in Colorado are attracting significant ad dollars.
Therefore, summing up for Information & Media, there is no change in our revenue guidance. We still expect the revenue decline in the mid-single digits, but mid-single-digit growth excluding BusinessWeek. We now expect the operating margin in the mid to high teens. We Had anticipated an operating margin in the mid-teens, and now we're addressing that upwards a little.
That concludes our review of the operations and therefore, summing up for the corporation. We anticipate earnings per share in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes $0.02 of the onetime gains from divestitures, but includes dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions.
Okay, let's hold it there and with that, let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer, for his results."
21719,114360784,81834,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisi",2061,"Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisitions: the Research and Estimates Business of TheMarkets.com for Capital IQ; Tegrity, which becomes part of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group; and PIPAL Research by CRISIL. The acquisition of Tegrity closed in October and Pipal Research is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
We expect to spend approximately $360 million on these acquisitions and a recent equity investment in Ambow Education, a leading provider of educational and career enhancement services in China. The most significant of these acquisitions, of course, is TheMarkets.com, of diluted earnings per share by $0.01 in the third quarter, and will do so again in the fourth quarter. In 2011, TheMarkets.com acquisition is expected to generate approximately $60 million in revenue and despite an anticipated $15 million in intangible amortization, the acquisition will be both accounting and cash flow accretive in 2011. We also had three divestitures in the third quarter, a small secondary school business in Australia, which generated a $3.8 million pretax gain and two by CRISIL. They are a 7% equity interest in the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange of India. We continue to maintain a 5% ownership, the divestiture of the 7% was required to comply with local regulations regarding foreign ownership rules. And also, CRISIL's remaining 10% interest in Gas Strategies Group, the 90% interest we had sold that back in December of 2008.
The two CRISIL divestitures this year generated $7.3 million in pretax gains. Now because CRISIL is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, part of the gain is deductive for purposes of calculating EPS, and is shown as a component of net income attributable to non-controlling interest. This was $2.3 million, which represents the post-tax portion of the gain attributable to the minority owners of CRISIL. In addition to the acquisitions, we continued to actively repurchased shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $69 million at an average price of $31.14 per share.
Year-to-date, we are purchased 8.7 million shares for $255.8 million, averaging $29.37 per share. 8.4 million shares remained in the 2007 program authorized by the board. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 309.3 million in the third quarter, a 4.4 million decrease versus the previous year due primarily to the full year impact of the second quarter share repurchases. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.9 million for the second quarter, reflecting the full impact of second quarter share repurchases, as well as the weighted impact of third quarter share repurchases. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 308 million.
We continue to be well capitalized with net cash and short-term investments as of September 30 of $158 million. The shift to a net cash position from a net debt position of $53 million at the end of the second quarter is driven primarily by strong free cash flow, partially offset by funding for acquisitions and share purchases. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.356 billion, while gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in senior notes. Our debt is entirely in long term unsecured senior notes, no commercial paper is outstanding.
The outlook for free cash flow continues to improve. Now to calculate free cash flow, we start with our after-tax cash from operations and deduct working, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt. During the third quarter, our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated free cash flow of $552 million. Year-to-date in 2010, we generated free cash flow of $651 million versus $507 million in the same period last year for an increase of $144 million. The improvement is due primarily to stronger operating results and a continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow this year to be clearly in excess of $700 million versus our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million. The improvement is driven by stronger operating results, reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated.  Just as a reminder, free cash flow last year was $770 million.
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we made a $14 million discretionary contribution in the third quarter, and we anticipate making an additional discretionary payment in the fourth quarter, potentially in the range of $50 million, and that is factored into the free cash flow projections.
Now let's look at expenses. As a reminder, I'll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth, excluding 2009 restructuring charges, as well as 2009 and 2010 gains and losses on divestitures.  So let's start with Education. Third quarter adjusted expenses were roughly flat, declining 0.1%. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses declined 1.3%. Contributing to the lower expense levels were two key decisions last year. The first was to combine the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations. The second was the planned phaseout of statewide low-margin custom test contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. A $15 million decline in amortization of prepublication cost also benefited third quarter results. Increases in selling and marketing cost for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings. As Terry has indicated, we now expect margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guidance of flat margins.
For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 13.3% in the third quarter and 12.8% at constant currencies. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses increased 10.1% and 9.3% at constant currencies. The growth expenses in the third quarter and year-to-date was driven by increased salaries and occupancy cost, primarily for international hires and higher incentive compensation.
Third quarter expenses were also impacted by TheMarkets.com acquisition, that resulted in an incremental $5 million in expense. There also was $5.4 million in additional cost related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives. Now taken together, these increased total Financial Services expense by 2.7%. The fourth quarter is expected to show a comparable increase in cost related to our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're still projecting additional full year cost of approximately $15 million, as Terry stated.
One last comment on Financial Services. Third quarter expense growth in the beginning of the year, I indicated that total stock-based compensation for McGraw-Hill was expected to increase roughly $30 million versus 2009, due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off a depressed base. Due to stronger operating results, we now expect an increase of roughly $40 million. The majority of this increase as anticipated was realized in the third quarter due to particularly depressed levels in the third quarter 2009. As a result, Financial Services had a $10.6 million increase in stock-based compensation for the quarter.
As Terry indicated, we now expect Financial Services margins to decline by approximately 150 basis points, which implies expenses will increased roughly 9% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 7% to 8%, and increases largely driven by TheMarkets.com acquisition.
At Information & Media, third quarter and year-to-date adjusted expenses declined 13.1% and 17.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced third quarter revenue by $22 million and expenses by $32 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $10 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $78 million and expenses by $111 million for a positive profit impact of $33 million. And of course, for the fourth quarter, the divestiture of BusinessWeek is expected to reduce revenue by $22 million and expense by $27 million. The positive impact here is $5 million. This will result in full year savings of $38 million.
For 2010, we expect adjusted expenses to decline in the mid-teens versus our previous guidance of the decline in the low teens. Corporate expenses in the third quarter is $44.4 million, a $16.5 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation compared to lower levels in 2009, as well as normal increases due to the stronger operating results. Increased excess vacant space was also a contributor to increased corporate costs.
We are making progress in reducing excess space. We finalized one agreement to sublease some excess space in New York this month and have received several promising inquiries regarding additional space. Because we are subleasing the space at lower rates than what we are currently paying, the accounting rules require us to take a one-time charge for the difference between the present values of the payments we will receive versus the payments we will have to make over the term of the lease. Our new earnings per share guidance exclude this one-time charge, since we are still finalizing accounting for this charge.
Now excluding the charge, we now expect full year 2010 corporate expense to increased $30 million to $35 million versus our previous guidance of an increase of $25 million to $30 million due to additional incentive compensation accruals. Net interest expense was $19.3 million in the third quarter compared to about $18 million in the same period last year and $21 million in the second quarter of 2010. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was roughly $76.9 million. The company's effective tax rate in the third quarter and year-to-date was 36.4%, which is unchanged from 2009. We expect a comparable rate for the full year.
Now let's turn to investments. The publication investments were $39.3 million in the third quarter, $5.4 million lower than last year. Year-to-date, pre-pub investments were $99.3 million, a $30.4 million decrease versus the prior year. For the year, we now expect pre-pub investments of approximately $160 million, and that's versus our previous estimate of the $195 million to $205 million.
Now the reduction in our pre-pub investment estimate is due to several factors. First, the timing of the adoption of Common Core Standards by various states. To date, 36 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards for K-12 math, reading and language arts. Also, we continued to reevaluate several programs to enhance our digital offerings. These actions have caused timing delays for a number of our pre-pub investments. In addition, we continue to realize savings from combining the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Now purchases of prop and equipment were $16.6 million the third quarter, about $1 million higher than last year. And year-to-date purchases were approximately $39 million. We now expect on a full-year basis the expenditures to be in the $70 million to $80 million range versus our previous estimate of $90 million to $100 million. This compares to $68.5 million in 2009.
Now let's take a look at some of non-cash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $112 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decrease versus the third quarter of 2009. For the full year, we now expect $245 million to $250 million versus the previous estimate of $260 million to $265 million. This compares to $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the recent lower level of investments.
Depreciation was $25 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million last year. We now expect full year depreciation to be slightly below last year, which was $113 million. Amortization of intangibles was $9 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $32 million for the first nine months. Reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions, we now expect it to be closer to $50 million for the full year versus our previous estimate of $40 million. Our unearned revenue continues to grow. We ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, up 4.2% for the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, growth was approximately 5%. Financial Services represented 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digits, driven by strong growth in ratings-related information products, S&P Indices and Capital IQ. While still small, unearned revenue at McGraw-Hill Education is showing strong growth due to sales of digital products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry."

So it's a little bit early, but if you look just at the calendar, at or above 2010 is what we're thinking on that one. New issuance, Brian, as you know, coming off of a softer second quarter, we really ramped up, especially the high yield markets. And again, the big number that we watch is the refinancing numbers out through 2014, still it's about $2 trillion in terms of maturities coming due on that part. And of course, there was a lot of refinancing or refundings in the third quarter, a lot of the new issuance that way. We've seen a continued strong corporate market in here. Issuance, a little softer in Europe, but again, one would think that it should be still fairly strong, and we have evidence of that at this point. We'll have to see as we get into November and early December, but so far, it's been pretty good."

As Don mentioned with me this morning is Bob Bahash, he's our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And I'll start by reviewing the third quarter results and our new guidance on earnings for 2010. After our presentations, obviously, we'll go in any direction you would like and answer any questions or take your comments about The McGraw-Hill Companies and our prospects.
Earlier this morning, we reported a 15% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter, earnings per share of $01.23, now that included a $0.02 gain on some divestitures and a $0.01 dilution on the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. Revenue grew by 5.5% in the third quarter, but increased 6.8% if you exclude the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Based on that strong performance in the seasonally most important quarter of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2010. We now anticipate earnings per share this year in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and we expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes the one-time gain of $0.02 from divestitures, but does include dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. There were many contributors to our strong third quarter. We are very pleased to be firing on so many cylinders. This morning, we'll provide the details on how those results were achieved.
Let's begin with the review of the Financial Services segment. The third quarter is normally the slowest each year in the Ratings business, but not this year, when S&P Credit Market Services produced the most revenue in any quarter so far this year. It is also noteworthy that the growth is coming without the benefit of a recovery in the structured finance market and despite a decline in European issuance. Revenue for S&P Credit Market Services in the third quarter increased by 11.1% based on strong performances in domestic markets. Domestic revenue grew about 20.9%. International revenue was up 0.9%. Revenue for S&P Investment Services grew by 6.3%. For Financial Services in the third quarter, revenue grew by 9.5%, including a $7.3 million pretax gain on divestitures. Operating profit increased by 6.6%. The operating margin was 39.2%, and reflects the pretax gain on the divestitures and increases in incentive compensation, incremental cost for compliance and substantial staff increases overseas, basically and mainly in India and the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. Our revenue growth was driven by increased refinancing activity, the investors search for yield, a robust bank loan market and recovery in the equity market, which benefited S&P Indices.
Spreads, the excess interest rate over treasury bonds is a key factor in the level of issuance volume. The composite spread on speculative grade bonds hit a two-year low at the end of April at 553 basis points and then began widening, but spreads began tightening in September and as our table shows, that trend has continued into October. At S&P Credit Market Services, the global high yield new issue market took off in the third quarter. After a slight decline in new issuance in July compared to the same period last year, the global high yield markets started climbing in August, and kept on climbing in September. The global high yield market has already produced more new issued dollar volume in nine months this year than it has in any previous single year. Companies are taking advantage of falling yields to refinance debt and repair the their balance sheets, as this S&P report shows, more than 2/3 of the high yield volume in the United States went for refinancing in the third quarter and for the year-to-date. High-yield issuers are finding a receptive market as investors search for yield at a time when cash is producing anemic returns. And as banks continue to deleverage, investment grade issuers are also stepping up their activity in the bond market to lock in low yields.
The composite spread for investment grade bonds widened over the past month when it was 200 basis points. The spread in mid October of 203 basis points is still slightly above the five-year daily moving average of 198 basis points. Global bank loan ratings also soared in the third quarter, although the absolute volume is still on the low end of the historical averages, fundamentals remained strong, liquidity is good in the United States, and only slightly less so in Europe. There is usually a seasonal slowdown in the summer months and in municipal market, but while the dollar volume of public finance issuers declined in the third quarter, deal volume actually increased. It was fueled by refundings, which were up 11% and the taxable Build America Bonds program, the taxable bond program, which was launched last April has been a boon to municipalities. Taxable bond debt year-to-date accounts for 32% of the muni market.
The structured finance market is still struggling to recover. The current residential mortgage-backed securities market cannot compete with the spreads on structured vehicles that benefit from explicit or implicit government support provided to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginny Jamie. Refinancing needs have been the source of securitizations for residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities this year, but re-REMIC activity declined in the third quarter, and the residential mortgage-backed market remains under pressure in the face of continued uncertainty over home prices and a sluggish economic recovery.
We are seeing AAA-rated three-year spreads across major asset-backed asset classes, and this would include auto, credit card receivables, student loans, and we're seeing these spreads continue to tighten. The asset-backed securities market has benefited all year from strong auto and student loan issuance, which helped offset a general slowdown in credit card issuance, new regulatory requirements and higher capital cost of bank securitizations have tempered credit card issuance this year. New issuance in the fourth quarter is off to a solid start for corporate. It appears that high-yield issuers are continuing to find a receptive market, and investment grade issuers are still taking advantage of attractive funding rates. We also expect cash to continue to pour into the leveraged loan market, filling the institutional pipeline. Favorable rates and heavy demands should continue to fuel this market.
The structured finance market will also have to adjust to a number of new measures, resulting from the Dodd-Frank legislation, also the new FDIC Safe Harbor rules and new SEC regulations that impose restrictions on sponsors of securitization and greater regulatory oversight on transactions. Greater disclosure and transparency will benefit investors and after a period of adjustment, S&P expects the use of securitization to be a significant funding tool for many issuers in the years ahead.
At S&P Investment Services, growth at S&P Indices and expansion by Capital IQ were clearly third quarter highlights. Assets under management based on S&P Indices and exchange traded funds set a new record at the end of September, $260.4 billion. That's a 17.9% year-over-year increase and a 12.9% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2010. Growth in spiders and high shares in exchange traded funds were major contributors to the growth.
19 new exchange traded funds links to S&P Indices were launched in the third quarter. That includes nine new Vanguard exchange traded funds based on our core U.S. indices, including the S&P 500. So in the aggregate now, there are 278 exchange traded funds based on S&P Indices. There also was 7.3% growth in the average daily volume for major exchange traded derivatives based on S&P Indices. The daily average in the third quarter was 3,069,000. At the end of each quarterly report, you can expect more new indices from us. This quarter is no exception. You can expect them in various asset classes, including commodities, fixed income and equities. It was also a historic first for S&P Indices in the third quarter. They licensed the Options Clearing Corporation to handle trades of over-the-counter S&P index-based option contracts and to receive royalties. This is the first time S&P has licensed its indices to a clearinghouse for central counter-party clearing.
Capital IQ continued its expansion in global markets, with the acquisition in September of TheMarkets.com. The acquisition positions Capital IQ for significant growth on the buy side. There is only modest overlap between TheMarkets.com's more than 2,000 clients and Capital IQ's 3,300 clients. We expect in the aggregate to add clients, add revenue, create cost synergies and to grow in both domestic and international markets. With this acquisition, Capital IQ now has earnings models, estimates, fixed income, research that are all a part and a key part of the buy side's workflow. This diagram illustrates how the acquisition improves Capital IQ's competitive offering to the buy side, private equity, venture capital, Investor Relations, as well as the business development departments at corporations. Those open circles indicate little or no availability. The acquisition fills in, and this acquisition fills in these circles with a complete investment research and platform for asset managers worldwide based on contributions for more than 1,000 research and estimate contributors.
On the regulatory front, a lot of the uncertainty is now behind us. S&P has filed its application as called for by the European regulations, which took effect on September 7. S&P expects to be registered later this year. S&P received its license in Japan as an approved agency before the October deadline, and we're also discussing new regulatory proposals with Hong Kong, Canada and Taiwan. In the United States, SEC rule making will be required to implement many of the provisions of the new Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to engage with the SEC and market participants as part of the rule-making process.
In anticipation of new regulations, S&P has made significant investments in technology platforms and staffing for quality, criteria, compliance and risk management. We call this our QCCR framework, and again, that's quality, criteria, compliance and risk. And these are four individual groups within S&P that performed these various functions. In 2009, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. This year, spending will increase by about $15 million, mostly in the second half of this year and on a preliminary basis, incremental cost next year could be somewhere in the $12 million to $15 million range, and we're still trying to narrow in on that. Price increases have helped us to mitigate some of these costs, including the incremental expenses for QCCR-related items we expect that price increases will help us again next year.
We also continue to monitor the impact of new regulations on bank lending. Regulators are forcing banks to shrink their balance sheets. It is already apparent that banks are retrenching and sitting out one of the busiest periods in the corporate bond market. With banks expected to keep more capital, it is inevitable that they will support less debt, and reduced bank lending is obviously a plus for the public debt markets.
Our assessment of legal risk facing the corporation is low, and that remains unchanged. Fifteen of our motions to dismiss complaints have not been granted, and five more cases have been withdrawn, that's 20. Last Friday, there was another favorable ruling in the case of Rice versus S&P and Moody's, a federal district court in California dismissed, with prejudice, a complaint concerning plaintiff's investments in Fannie Mae securities. There was some key points in this decision that we're studying. In dismissing the intentional misrepresentation claim, Judge Cormac Carney wrote, and I quote, ""Defendants credit ratings are opinions of the future creditworthiness or value of companies and therefore, are not actionable unless plaintiffs can demonstrate the defendants' representatives who publish credit ratings actually knew that credit ratings were false or did not believe that the credit ratings were true at the time that each credit rating was issued."" The judge also recognize that a negligent misrepresentation claim concerning a professional opinion can only be stated by ""A narrow and circumscribed group of persons to whom or for whom the misrepresentations were made. The rational for limiting liability to a specific group of persons is to protect professionals, who provide information from unlimited and uncertain liability."" In these important ways, this ruling recognizes limitations facing plaintiffs, who seek to assert legal claims concerning S&P's ratings.
In Italy, there was a development earlier this month in the prime lot litigation, which got started in the fall of 2005. On October 1, two court-appointed expert, both accountants, filed a report that was critical of the ratings assigned to prime lot by S&P during the timeframe of 2000 to 2003. The S&P expert disputed the methodology, findings and conclusions of the accountant report, which is a matter of laws not binding in court. The judge who appointed the two accountants to assist her in her determination has scheduled a hearing in early January. We continue to believe that the outcome of this litigation against two subsidiaries of The McGraw-Hill Companies should not have any material adverse effect on our condition.
Let's sum up for Financial Services. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We had expected a 100 basis point decline in the operating margin. We are now expect 150 basis point decline in the operating margin, primarily due to the acquisition of Markets.com.
Okay, with that, let's move over to McGraw-Hill Education operations. In the seasonal most important quarter of the year for Education, we grew both in the elementary-high school market and in the U.S. Higher Education markets, and we did so with an operating margin of 33.9% for the segment. And this includes a 40 basis points from the gain on a divestiture. That still makes this year's third quarter performance by McGraw-Hill Education the best since 2007 on an operating margin of 35.0% was reported. 
For McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter, revenue increased 5.5%. Operating profit, including the $3.8 million pretax gain on the divestiture, grew by 19.9%. The operating margin of 33.9% compares to 29.8% for the same period last year. Control of costs and expenses and improved results in the elementary-high school market and the U.S. Higher Education market contributed to this performance. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group increased by 6.7%. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education professional and international grew by 4.3%. As we had expected, state new adoptions were key to our performance in this year's el-hi [elementary-high] market. We're on track to capture about 30% of this year's state new adoption market at 825 million to 875 million this year, the state new adoption market will grow 65% to 75% over last year. This increased spending is the prime reason why we expect the el-hi market to grow 4% to 6% this year.
According to the most recent AAP, that's the Association of American Publishers' report, sales in the el-hi market were up 8% through August because of a 24.7% increase in state adoption sales. Open territory sales after eight months were down 7.3%. These non-adoption states represented 44.8%, roughly 45% of this year's revenue. Based on the August results, the el-hi market could hit the high end of our 4% to 6% growth forecast if industry sales remained flat with the last four months of 2010. As this marked chart shows, industry sales grew in each of the last four months of 2009, so achieving that level of growth will be challenging. September results for the industry are not yet available, but indications are that overall sales slowed during the month, adding to the challenge. For McGraw-Hill, however, September was another strong month, especially in adoption states.
Reading, literature and math represented the biggest revenue opportunities in this year's state new adoption market. The McGraw-Hill School Education Group did particularly well in the very large K-5 reading market, with strong performances in Texas and California. The school group expects to capture about 45% of the K-5 reading market and approximately 32% of the K-12 reading and literature opportunity. This school group's K-5 Treasures program is the key to its success in reading. In math, the school group expects to win more than 40% of the secondary school market, with programs in Florida, California, Indiana, West Virginia and Oklahoma. But underperformance in Florida's K-5 math adoption will probably hold our overall capture rate in K-12 math to about 28%.
Open territory sales were down in the third quarter for us, as well as for the industry, a reflection of budget pressures in such states as New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. In testing, the third quarter is normally slow and this year, we had the additional impact of the planned phaseout of custom contracts in Florida, California and Arizona. Procedural delays in signing some important contracts were also a factor, but those issues will be settled in the fourth quarter, a seasonally important period in the testing market.
A really fine year is taking shape in the U.S. Higher Education market. For the second year in a row, the U.S. Higher Education market is benefiting from increased enrollments. An important driver is the federal government's huge step up in the student aid area under the new administration, spending on student aid has increased by nearly 50% to $145 billion. We think increased aid is reflected in the growing Higher Education enrollments that we are seeing at the start of the new school year. Preliminary information indicates that fall enrollments at colleges and universities grew by 4% to 5% this year, an increase we had not anticipated at the beginning of 2010. Enrollments in the fall of 2009 grew by 7% to 8%. All of our major product lines produced year-over-year growth in the Higher Education market in the critical third quarter, and there is added impetus from the double-digit growth of digital products and services. Our lineup of homework management, assessment and tutoring products for college and university students is gaining traction and expanding the addressable market.
Through September, registrations for these products have grown to $1.9 million, a 26% year-over-year increase. McGraw-Hill Connect, that's our all digital teaching and learning platform, is our leader in this rapidly growing market, and we continue to strengthen it. That's why we recently acquired Tegrity whose scalable, automated lecture capture service has become a core feature of McGraw-Hill Connect since it was introduced last fall. Lecture capture gives students the ability to review material presented in the classroom any time, anywhere, for replay online or on any mobile device. That is a powerful tool for studying and learning. More than 200 educational institutions already use the Tegrity cloud-based service.
We have also launched McGraw-Hill Create. It is a Google-like search engine that enables instructors to customize quality content for their courses. They can draw in 4,000 McGraw-Hill textbooks, 5,500 articles 11,000 literature, philosophy and humanities readings, and 25,000 business case studies from such providers as the Harvard Business School. Once a customized text has been developed on Create, the instructor can get a digital review copy in less than an hour. Printed review copies will be delivered in only three to five days. Students can purchase McGraw-Hill Create eBooks to the McGraw-Hill eBook store or buy printed copies at the campus bookstore. And through the recently announced partnership with Blackboard, instructors will have access to the full suite of McGraw-Hill Create content through their Blackboard accounts.
If you're looking for a window into our future in digital and international markets, take a look at this next slide. It's a custom site for the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Egypt. It is hosted on McGraw-Hill Education's international Create eBook Store, which is now live around the world. The McGraw-Hill Create eBook store made it possible to deliver 36 titles to this Egyptian institution for students to use in their new semester. The customer selection of 36 titles underscores the scope of McGraw-Hill's global content creation. The list includes titles drawn from U.S. McGraw-Hill Higher Education or U.S. professional catalog, as well as original titles published by our subsidiaries in India and in Europe. Because of the capabilities of McGraw-Hill Create, 30 of the titles will be delivered directly to students using institutionally purchased access codes at the school's request. Six titles will be delivered as eBooks for testing the student experience with the enTourage, that's the Ed.D trademark, it's a new e-reader.
Another site has been established at the Rotterdam School of Business in the Netherlands using McGraw-Hill Create. That micro site will host 29 custom eBooks from our catalog for student purchases. One more observation about using McGraw-Hill Create delivery, is this world, we're not supplying a physical product. That means no printing, no binding cost, no inventory of warehousing cost, no shipping charges, no returns and no used books. Clearly, connecting content and managing digital assets globally is a powerful combination that is creating new opportunities as we shift away from our legacy model to an interactive and digital model.
The same transition is taking place in professional markets. Here, we're seeing an acceleration in the online ordering of hard copies and a huge increase in the sale of eBooks. Since the beginning of the year, our eBook sales through the major eBook retailers to consumers have nearly tripled. Our best-selling eBooks in the third quarter ranged from the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, to the famous Graham and Dodd's work, Security Analysis. We have more than 5,000 professional titles available as eBooks. 
Even with the continued rapid growth of digital products and services, the fourth quarter this year will be challenging. Last year, we had a significant upswing in operating profits based on the surge in the second quarter semester orders in the U.S. Higher Education market, and improved results in the professional and international markets. The bulk of second semester ordering in Higher Education sometimes occurs in December and in other years, it comes in January, complicating the balancing between the fourth quarter forecasting in this market. The U.S. Higher Education market is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% this year. There is pent-up demand in the el-hi market, but budget pressures are continued to constraint school district spending in many regions. The arrival of new federal funds could positive factor, however. The McGraw-Hill school education group sales teams are still working on a number of large basal adoptions in the open territories, as well as some excellent fourth quarter opportunities for intervention products across the country. Federal funding will clearly play a part in some of these purchases, but in other cases, it will be harder to identify because large district orders tend to be paid for through a blend of funding sources, so it's difficult to predict what will materialize.
So with that, let sum up our McGraw-Hill Education revenue. We still expect a low single-digit increase, operating margin, we had been forecasting flat margins. We now expect an improvement of 200 basis points to 14% for 2010.
Okay, let's move over to our review our third segment, and that's the Information & Media segment. Key contributors to this segment's third quarter performance were the continued solid growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television advertising and the effect of the business we have divestiture. In the third quarter, revenue declined by 4.7%, but excluding business week, it actually grew by 5.1%. Operating profit increased by 55.1% or $16.3 million. The operating margin was 20.1%, up from 12.4% for the same period last year.
The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, increased by 3.3%. In volatile energy markets, the demand for Platts data and information products continues to drive strong growth in both the United States and international markets, and incidentally more than 60% of Platts' revenue comes from outside of the United States. Platts is growing rapidly across a number of commodities. It is continuing to expand its coverage of the refined petroleum markets in the United States, Europe and Asia, with new price assessments in gasoline, fuel oil, naptha, naptha, being the raw material for gasoline.
Platts expanded its suite of daily spot price assessments to include alumina, that's a mineral produced from bauxite ore that is used to make aluminum. The new price assessments, the world's first daily price references for alumina address the needs of miners, smelders, refiners and traders for the independent source of open spot prices to better determine valuations for short and long-term contracts. Platts also began producing new price assessments in the India coal market. India's thermal coal imports are changing trade flows radically, and increasing the need for expanded more frequent and transparent price information. These new assessments address the needs of power producers, coal traders and ship brokers for an independent source of India-related open market spot prices, making Platts even more relevant in this growing market.
There was some softness in construction, particularly among smaller regional contractors, who have been hardest hit by the declining activity in this market. Weakness in the global Automotive business offset improvements in the non-auto parts of the market at J.D. Power and Associates. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group increased by 23.5% to $23.6 million. The combination of political advertising and improved local and national time sales accounted for the increase. In this political season, the contest for governor and heated race rates for a Senate seat and issue related advertising in Colorado are attracting significant ad dollars.
Therefore, summing up for Information & Media, there is no change in our revenue guidance. We still expect the revenue decline in the mid-single digits, but mid-single-digit growth excluding BusinessWeek. We now expect the operating margin in the mid to high teens. We Had anticipated an operating margin in the mid-teens, and now we're addressing that upwards a little.
That concludes our review of the operations and therefore, summing up for the corporation. We anticipate earnings per share in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes $0.02 of the onetime gains from divestitures, but includes dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions.
Okay, let's hold it there and with that, let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer, for his results."
21719,114360784,82037,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisi",2061,"Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisitions: the Research and Estimates Business of TheMarkets.com for Capital IQ; Tegrity, which becomes part of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group; and PIPAL Research by CRISIL. The acquisition of Tegrity closed in October and Pipal Research is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
We expect to spend approximately $360 million on these acquisitions and a recent equity investment in Ambow Education, a leading provider of educational and career enhancement services in China. The most significant of these acquisitions, of course, is TheMarkets.com, of diluted earnings per share by $0.01 in the third quarter, and will do so again in the fourth quarter. In 2011, TheMarkets.com acquisition is expected to generate approximately $60 million in revenue and despite an anticipated $15 million in intangible amortization, the acquisition will be both accounting and cash flow accretive in 2011. We also had three divestitures in the third quarter, a small secondary school business in Australia, which generated a $3.8 million pretax gain and two by CRISIL. They are a 7% equity interest in the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange of India. We continue to maintain a 5% ownership, the divestiture of the 7% was required to comply with local regulations regarding foreign ownership rules. And also, CRISIL's remaining 10% interest in Gas Strategies Group, the 90% interest we had sold that back in December of 2008.
The two CRISIL divestitures this year generated $7.3 million in pretax gains. Now because CRISIL is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, part of the gain is deductive for purposes of calculating EPS, and is shown as a component of net income attributable to non-controlling interest. This was $2.3 million, which represents the post-tax portion of the gain attributable to the minority owners of CRISIL. In addition to the acquisitions, we continued to actively repurchased shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $69 million at an average price of $31.14 per share.
Year-to-date, we are purchased 8.7 million shares for $255.8 million, averaging $29.37 per share. 8.4 million shares remained in the 2007 program authorized by the board. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 309.3 million in the third quarter, a 4.4 million decrease versus the previous year due primarily to the full year impact of the second quarter share repurchases. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.9 million for the second quarter, reflecting the full impact of second quarter share repurchases, as well as the weighted impact of third quarter share repurchases. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 308 million.
We continue to be well capitalized with net cash and short-term investments as of September 30 of $158 million. The shift to a net cash position from a net debt position of $53 million at the end of the second quarter is driven primarily by strong free cash flow, partially offset by funding for acquisitions and share purchases. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.356 billion, while gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in senior notes. Our debt is entirely in long term unsecured senior notes, no commercial paper is outstanding.
The outlook for free cash flow continues to improve. Now to calculate free cash flow, we start with our after-tax cash from operations and deduct working, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt. During the third quarter, our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated free cash flow of $552 million. Year-to-date in 2010, we generated free cash flow of $651 million versus $507 million in the same period last year for an increase of $144 million. The improvement is due primarily to stronger operating results and a continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow this year to be clearly in excess of $700 million versus our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million. The improvement is driven by stronger operating results, reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated.  Just as a reminder, free cash flow last year was $770 million.
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we made a $14 million discretionary contribution in the third quarter, and we anticipate making an additional discretionary payment in the fourth quarter, potentially in the range of $50 million, and that is factored into the free cash flow projections.
Now let's look at expenses. As a reminder, I'll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth, excluding 2009 restructuring charges, as well as 2009 and 2010 gains and losses on divestitures.  So let's start with Education. Third quarter adjusted expenses were roughly flat, declining 0.1%. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses declined 1.3%. Contributing to the lower expense levels were two key decisions last year. The first was to combine the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations. The second was the planned phaseout of statewide low-margin custom test contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. A $15 million decline in amortization of prepublication cost also benefited third quarter results. Increases in selling and marketing cost for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings. As Terry has indicated, we now expect margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guidance of flat margins.
For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 13.3% in the third quarter and 12.8% at constant currencies. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses increased 10.1% and 9.3% at constant currencies. The growth expenses in the third quarter and year-to-date was driven by increased salaries and occupancy cost, primarily for international hires and higher incentive compensation.
Third quarter expenses were also impacted by TheMarkets.com acquisition, that resulted in an incremental $5 million in expense. There also was $5.4 million in additional cost related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives. Now taken together, these increased total Financial Services expense by 2.7%. The fourth quarter is expected to show a comparable increase in cost related to our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're still projecting additional full year cost of approximately $15 million, as Terry stated.
One last comment on Financial Services. Third quarter expense growth in the beginning of the year, I indicated that total stock-based compensation for McGraw-Hill was expected to increase roughly $30 million versus 2009, due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off a depressed base. Due to stronger operating results, we now expect an increase of roughly $40 million. The majority of this increase as anticipated was realized in the third quarter due to particularly depressed levels in the third quarter 2009. As a result, Financial Services had a $10.6 million increase in stock-based compensation for the quarter.
As Terry indicated, we now expect Financial Services margins to decline by approximately 150 basis points, which implies expenses will increased roughly 9% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 7% to 8%, and increases largely driven by TheMarkets.com acquisition.
At Information & Media, third quarter and year-to-date adjusted expenses declined 13.1% and 17.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced third quarter revenue by $22 million and expenses by $32 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $10 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $78 million and expenses by $111 million for a positive profit impact of $33 million. And of course, for the fourth quarter, the divestiture of BusinessWeek is expected to reduce revenue by $22 million and expense by $27 million. The positive impact here is $5 million. This will result in full year savings of $38 million.
For 2010, we expect adjusted expenses to decline in the mid-teens versus our previous guidance of the decline in the low teens. Corporate expenses in the third quarter is $44.4 million, a $16.5 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation compared to lower levels in 2009, as well as normal increases due to the stronger operating results. Increased excess vacant space was also a contributor to increased corporate costs.
We are making progress in reducing excess space. We finalized one agreement to sublease some excess space in New York this month and have received several promising inquiries regarding additional space. Because we are subleasing the space at lower rates than what we are currently paying, the accounting rules require us to take a one-time charge for the difference between the present values of the payments we will receive versus the payments we will have to make over the term of the lease. Our new earnings per share guidance exclude this one-time charge, since we are still finalizing accounting for this charge.
Now excluding the charge, we now expect full year 2010 corporate expense to increased $30 million to $35 million versus our previous guidance of an increase of $25 million to $30 million due to additional incentive compensation accruals. Net interest expense was $19.3 million in the third quarter compared to about $18 million in the same period last year and $21 million in the second quarter of 2010. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was roughly $76.9 million. The company's effective tax rate in the third quarter and year-to-date was 36.4%, which is unchanged from 2009. We expect a comparable rate for the full year.
Now let's turn to investments. The publication investments were $39.3 million in the third quarter, $5.4 million lower than last year. Year-to-date, pre-pub investments were $99.3 million, a $30.4 million decrease versus the prior year. For the year, we now expect pre-pub investments of approximately $160 million, and that's versus our previous estimate of the $195 million to $205 million.
Now the reduction in our pre-pub investment estimate is due to several factors. First, the timing of the adoption of Common Core Standards by various states. To date, 36 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards for K-12 math, reading and language arts. Also, we continued to reevaluate several programs to enhance our digital offerings. These actions have caused timing delays for a number of our pre-pub investments. In addition, we continue to realize savings from combining the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Now purchases of prop and equipment were $16.6 million the third quarter, about $1 million higher than last year. And year-to-date purchases were approximately $39 million. We now expect on a full-year basis the expenditures to be in the $70 million to $80 million range versus our previous estimate of $90 million to $100 million. This compares to $68.5 million in 2009.
Now let's take a look at some of non-cash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $112 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decrease versus the third quarter of 2009. For the full year, we now expect $245 million to $250 million versus the previous estimate of $260 million to $265 million. This compares to $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the recent lower level of investments.
Depreciation was $25 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million last year. We now expect full year depreciation to be slightly below last year, which was $113 million. Amortization of intangibles was $9 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $32 million for the first nine months. Reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions, we now expect it to be closer to $50 million for the full year versus our previous estimate of $40 million. Our unearned revenue continues to grow. We ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, up 4.2% for the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, growth was approximately 5%. Financial Services represented 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digits, driven by strong growth in ratings-related information products, S&P Indices and Capital IQ. While still small, unearned revenue at McGraw-Hill Education is showing strong growth due to sales of digital products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry."

And then second, on the S&P business, you saw the new issuance pick up late in Q3.

And so, if you look at the calendar and just take it from that standpoint, our guesstimate at this point is that we will be at or a little better than 2010 state adoption levels on that one. But we've got to also see what the effect of Common Core Standards are going to be, and if there's going to be changes from that standpoint. So it's a little bit early, but if you look just at the calendar, at or above 2010 is what we're thinking on that one. New issuance, Brian, as you know, coming off of a softer second quarter, we really ramped up, especially the high yield markets. And again, the big number that we watch is the refinancing numbers out through 2014, still it's about $2 trillion in terms of maturities coming due on that part. And of course, there was a lot of refinancing or refundings in the third quarter, a lot of the new issuance that way. We've seen a continued strong corporate market in here. Issuance, a little softer in Europe, but again, one would think that it should be still fairly strong, and we have evidence of that at this point. We'll have to see as we get into November and early December, but so far, it's been pretty good."

As Don mentioned with me this morning is Bob Bahash, he's our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And I'll start by reviewing the third quarter results and our new guidance on earnings for 2010. After our presentations, obviously, we'll go in any direction you would like and answer any questions or take your comments about The McGraw-Hill Companies and our prospects.
Earlier this morning, we reported a 15% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter, earnings per share of $01.23, now that included a $0.02 gain on some divestitures and a $0.01 dilution on the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. Revenue grew by 5.5% in the third quarter, but increased 6.8% if you exclude the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Based on that strong performance in the seasonally most important quarter of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2010. We now anticipate earnings per share this year in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and we expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes the one-time gain of $0.02 from divestitures, but does include dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. There were many contributors to our strong third quarter. We are very pleased to be firing on so many cylinders. This morning, we'll provide the details on how those results were achieved.
Let's begin with the review of the Financial Services segment. The third quarter is normally the slowest each year in the Ratings business, but not this year, when S&P Credit Market Services produced the most revenue in any quarter so far this year. It is also noteworthy that the growth is coming without the benefit of a recovery in the structured finance market and despite a decline in European issuance. Revenue for S&P Credit Market Services in the third quarter increased by 11.1% based on strong performances in domestic markets. Domestic revenue grew about 20.9%. International revenue was up 0.9%. Revenue for S&P Investment Services grew by 6.3%. For Financial Services in the third quarter, revenue grew by 9.5%, including a $7.3 million pretax gain on divestitures. Operating profit increased by 6.6%. The operating margin was 39.2%, and it reflects the pretax gain on the divestitures and increases in incentive compensation, incremental cost for compliance and substantial staff increases overseas, basically and mainly in India and the acquisition  of TheMarkets.com. Our revenue growth was driven by increased refinancing activity, the investors search for yield, a robust bank loan market and recovery in the equity market, which benefited S&P Indices.
Spreads, the excess interest rate over treasury bonds is a key factor in the level of issuance volume. The composite spread on speculative grade bonds hit a two-year low at the end of April at 553 basis points and then began widening, but spreads began tightening in September and as our table shows, that trend has continued into October. At S&P Credit Market Services, the global high yield new issue market took off in the third quarter. After a slight decline in new issuance in July compared to the same period last year, the global high yield markets started climbing in August, and kept on climbing in September. The global high yield market has already produced more new issued dollar volume in nine months this year than it has in any previous single year. Companies are taking advantage of falling yields to refinance debt and repair the their balance sheets, as this S&P report shows, more than 2/3 of the high yield volume in the United States went for refinancing in the third quarter and for the year-to-date. High-yield issuers are finding a receptive market as investors search for yield at a time when cash is producing anemic returns. And as banks continue to deleverage, investment grade issuers are also stepping up their activity in the bond market to lock in low yields.
The composite spread for investment grade bonds widened over the past month when it was 200 basis points. The spread in mid October of 203 basis points is still slightly above the five-year daily moving average of 198 basis points. Global bank loan ratings also soared in the third quarter, although the absolute volume is still on the low end of the historical averages, fundamentals remained strong, liquidity is good in the United States, and only slightly less so in Europe. There is usually a seasonal slowdown in the summer months and in municipal market, but while the dollar volume of public finance issuers declined in the third quarter, deal volume actually increased. It was fueled by refundings, which were up 11% and the taxable Build America Bonds program, the taxable bond program, which was launched last April has been a boon to municipalities. Taxable bond debt year-to-date accounts for 32% of the muni market. 
The structured finance market is still struggling to recover. The current residential mortgage-backed securities market cannot compete with the spreads on structured vehicles that benefit from explicit or implicit government support provided to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginny Jamie. Refinancing needs have been the source of securitizations for residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities this year, but re-REMIC activity declined in the third quarter, and the residential mortgage-backed market remains under pressure in the face of continued uncertainty over home prices and a sluggish economic recovery.
We are seeing AAA-rated three-year spreads across major asset-backed asset classes, and this would include auto, credit card receivables, student loans, and we're seeing these spreads continue to tighten. The asset-backed securities market has benefited all year from strong auto and student loan issuance, which helped offset a general slowdown in credit card issuance, new regulatory requirements and higher capital cost of bank securitizations have tempered credit card issuance this year. New issuance in the fourth quarter is off to a solid start for corporate. It appears that high-yield issuers are continuing to find a receptive market, and investment grade issuers are still taking advantage of attractive funding rates. We also expect cash to continue to pour into the leveraged loan market, filling the institutional pipeline. Favorable rates and heavy demands should continue to fuel this market. 
The structured finance market will also have to adjust to a number of new measures, resulting from the Dodd-Frank legislation, also the new FDIC Safe Harbor rules and new SEC regulations that impose restrictions on sponsors of securitization and greater regulatory oversight on transactions. Greater disclosure and transparency will benefit investors and after a period of adjustment, S&P expects the use of securitization to be a significant funding tool for many issuers in the years ahead.
At S&P Investment Services, growth at S&P Indices and expansion by Capital IQ were clearly third quarter highlights. Assets under management based on S&P Indices and exchange traded funds set a new record at the end of September, $260.4 billion. That's a 17.9% year-over-year increase and a 12.9% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2010. Growth in spiders and high shares in exchange traded funds were major contributors to the growth.
19 new exchange traded funds links to S&P Indices were launched in the third quarter. That includes nine new Vanguard exchange traded funds based on our core U.S. indices, including the S&P 500. So in the aggregate now, there are 278 exchange traded funds based on S&P Indices. There also was 7.3% growth in the average daily volume for major exchange traded derivatives based on S&P Indices. The daily average in the third quarter was 3,069,000. At the end of each quarterly report, you can expect more new indices from us. This quarter is no exception. You can expect them in various asset classes, including commodities, fixed income and equities. It was also a historic first for S&P Indices in the third quarter. They licensed the Options Clearing Corporation to handle trades of over-the-counter S&P index-based option contracts and to receive royalties. This is the first time S&P has licensed its indices to a clearinghouse for central counter-party clearing.
Capital IQ continued its expansion in global markets, with the acquisition in September of TheMarkets.com. The acquisition positions Capital IQ for significant growth on the buy side. There is only modest overlap between TheMarkets.com's more than 2,000 clients and Capital IQ's 3,300 clients. We expect in the aggregate to add clients, and revenue, great cost synergies and to grow in both domestic and international markets. With this acquisition, Capital IQ now has earnings models, estimates, fixed income, research that are all a part and a key part of the buy side's workflow. This diagram illustrates how the acquisition improves Capital IQ's competitive offering to the buy side, private equity, venture capital, Investor Relations, as well as the business development departments at corporations. Those open circles indicate little or no availability. The acquisition fills in, and this acquisition fills in these circles with a complete investment research and analysis platform for asset managers worldwide based on contributions for more than 1,000 research and estimate contributors.
On the regulatory front, a lot of the uncertainty is now behind us. S&P has filed its application as called for by the European regulations, which took effect on September 7. S&P expects to be registered later this year. S&P received its license in Japan as an approved agency before the October deadline, and we're also discussing new regulatory proposals with Hong Kong, Canada and Taiwan. In the United States, SEC rule making will be required to implement many of the provisions of the new Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to engage with the SEC and market participants as part of the rule-making process.
In anticipation of new regulations, S&P has made significant investments in technology platforms and staffing for quality, criteria, compliance and risk management. We call this our QCCR framework, and again, that's quality, criteria, compliance and risk. And these are four individual groups within S&P that performed these various functions. In 2009, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. This year, spending will increase by about $15 million, mostly in the second half of this year and on a preliminary basis, incremental cost next year could be somewhere in the $12 million to $15 million range, and we're still trying to narrow in on that. Price increases have helped us to mitigate some of these costs, including the incremental expenses for QCCR-related items, we expect that price increases will help us again next year.
We also continue to monitor the impact of new regulations on bank lending. Regulators are forcing banks to shrink their balance sheets. It is already apparent that banks are retrenching and ceding out one of the busiest periods in the corporate bond market. With banks expected to keep more capital, it is inevitable that they will support less debt, and reduced bank lending is obviously a plus for the public debt markets.
Our assessment of legal risk facing the corporation is low, and that remains unchanged. 15 of our motions to dismiss complaints have not been granted, and five more cases have been withdrawn, that's 20. Last Friday, there was another favorable ruling in the case of Rice versus S&P and Moody's, a federal district court in California dismissed, with prejudice, a complaint concerning plaintiffs investments in Fannie Mae securities. There was some key points in this decision that we're studying. In dismissing the intentional misrepresentation claim, Judge Cormac Carney wrote, and I quote, ""Defendants credit ratings are opinions of the future creditworthiness or value of companies and therefore, are not actionable unless plaintiffs can demonstrate the defendants' representatives who publish credit ratings actually knew that credit ratings were false or did not believe that the credit ratings were true at the time that each credit rating was issued"". The judge also recognize that a negligent misrepresentation claim concerning a professional opinion can only be stated by ""A narrow and circumscribed group of persons to whom or for whom the misrepresentations were made. The rational for limiting liability to a specific group of persons is to protect professionals, who provide information from unlimited and uncertain liability"". In these important ways, this ruling recognizes limitations facing plaintiffs, who seek to assert legal claims concerning to S&P's ratings.
In Italy, there was a development earlier this month in the prime lot litigation, which got started in the fall of 2005. On October 1, two court-appointed expert, both accountants, filed a report that was critical of the ratings assigned to prime lot by S&P during the timeframe of 2000 to 2003. The S&P expert disputed the methodology, findings and conclusions of the accountant report, which is a matter of laws not binding in court. The judge who appointed the two accountants to assist her in her determination has scheduled a hearing in early January. We continue to believe that the outcome of this litigation against two subsidiaries of The McGraw-Hill Companies should not have any material adverse effect on our condition.
Let's sum up for Financial Services. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We had expected a 100 basis point decline in the operating margin. We are now expect 150 basis point decline in the operating margin, primarily due to the acquisition of TheMarkets.com. 
Okay, with that, let's move over to McGraw-Hill Education operations.  In the seasonally most important quarter of the year for Education, we grew both in the elementary-high school market and in the U.S. Higher Education markets, and we did so with an operating margin of 33.9% for the segment. And this includes a 40 basis points from the gain on a divestiture. That still makes this year's third quarter performance by McGraw-Hill Education the best since 2007 on an operating margin of 35.0% was reported. 
For McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter, revenue increased 5.5%. Operating profit, including the $3.8 million pretax gain on the divestiture, grew by 19.9%. The operating margin of 33.9% compares to 29.8% for the same period last year. Control of costs and expenses and improved results in the elementary-high school market and the U.S. Higher Education market contributed to this performance. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group increased by 6.7%. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education professional and international grew by 4.3%. As we had expected, state new adoptions were key to our performance in this year's el-hi [elementary-high] market. We're on track to capture about 30% of this year's state new adoption market at 825 million to 875 million this year, the state new adoption market will grow 65% to 75% over last year. This increased spending is the prime reason why we expect the el-hi market to grow 4% to 6% this year.
According to the most recent AAP, that's the Association of American Publishers' report, sales in the el-hi market were up 8% through August because of a 24.7% increase in state adoption sales. Open territory sales after eight months were down 7.3%. These non-adoption states represented 44.8%, roughly 45% of this year's revenue. Based on the August results, the el-hi market could hit the high end of our 4% to 6% growth forecast if industry sales remained flat with the last four months of 2010. As this marked chart shows, industry sales grew in each of the last four months of 2009, so achieving that level of growth will be challenging. September results for the industry are not yet available, but indications are that overall sales slowed during the month, adding to the challenge. For McGraw-Hill, however, September was another strong month, especially in adoption states.
Reading, literature and math represented the biggest revenue opportunities in this year's state new adoption market. The McGraw-Hill School Education Group did particularly well in the very large K-5 reading market, with strong performances in Texas and California. The school group expects to capture about 45% of the K-5 reading market and approximately 32% of the K-12 reading and literature opportunity. This school group's K-5 Treasures program is the key to its success in reading. In math, the school group expects to win more than 40% of the secondary school market, with programs in Florida, California, Indiana, West Virginia and Oklahoma. But underperformance in Florida's K-5 math adoption will probably hold our overall capture rate in K-12 math to about 28%.
Open territory sales were down in the third quarter for us, as well as for the industry, a reflection of budget pressures in such states as New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. In testing, the third quarter is normally slow and this year, we had the additional impact of the planned phaseout of custom contracts in Florida, California and Arizona. Procedural delays in signing some important contracts were also a factor, but those issues will be settled in the fourth quarter, a seasonally important period in the testing market. 
A really fine year is taking shape in the U.S. Higher Education market. For the second year in a row, the U.S. Higher Education market is benefiting from increased enrollments. An important driver is the federal government's huge step up in the student aid area under the new administration, spending on student aid has increased by nearly 50% to $145 billion. We think increased aid is reflected in the growing Higher Education enrollments that we are seeing at the start of the new school year. Preliminary information indicates that fall enrollments at colleges and universities grew by 4% to 5% this year, an increase we had not anticipated at the beginning of 2010. Enrollments in the fall of 2009 grew by 7% to 8%. All of our major product lines produced year-over-year growth in the Higher Education market in the critical third quarter, and there is added impetus from the double-digit growth of digital products and services. Our lineup of homework management, assessment and tutoring products for college and university students is gaining traction and expanding the addressable market.
Through September, registrations for these products have grown to $1.9 million, a 26% year-over-year increase. McGraw-Hill Connect, that's our all digital teaching and learning platform, is our leader in this rapidly growing market, and we continue to strengthen it. That's why we recently acquired Tegrity whose scalable, automated lecture capture service has become a core feature of McGraw-Hill Connect since it was introduced last fall. Lecture capture gives students the ability to review material presented in the classroom any time, anywhere, for replay online or on any mobile device. That is a powerful tool for studying and learning. More than 200 educational institutions already use the Tegrity cloud-based service.
We have also launched McGraw-Hill Create. It is a Google-like search engine that enables instructors to customize quality content for their courses. They can draw in 4,000 McGraw-Hill textbooks, 5,500 articles 11,000 literature, philosophy and humanities readings, and 25,000 business case studies from such providers as the Harvard Business School. Once a customized text has been developed on Create, the instructor can get a digital review copy in less than an hour. Printed review copies will be delivered in only three to five days. Students can purchase McGraw-Hill Create eBooks to the McGraw-Hill eBook store or buy printed copies at the campus bookstore. And through the recently announced partnership with Blackboard, instructors will have access to the full suite of McGraw-Hill Create content through their Blackboard accounts.
If you're looking for a window into our future in digital and international markets, take a look at this next slide. It's a custom site for the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Egypt. It is hosted on McGraw-Hill Education's international Create eBook Store, which is now live around the world. The McGraw-Hill Create eBook store made it possible to deliver 36 titles to this Egyptian institution for students to use in their new semester. The customer selection of 36 titles underscores the scope of McGraw-Hill's global content creation. The list includes titles drawn from U.S. McGraw-Hill Higher Education or U.S. professional catalog, as well as original titles published by our subsidiaries in India and in Europe. Because of the capabilities of McGraw-Hill Create, 30 of the titles will be delivered directly to students using institutionally purchased access codes at the school's request. Six titles will be delivered as eBooks for testing the student experience with the enTourage, that's the Ed.D trademark, it's a new e-reader.
Another site has been established at the Rotterdam School of Business in the Netherlands using McGraw-Hill Create. That micro site will host 29 custom eBooks from our catalog for student purchases. One more observation about using McGraw-Hill Create delivery, is this world, we're not supplying a physical product. That means no printing, no binding cost, no inventory of warehousing cost, no shipping charges, no returns and no used books. Clearly, connecting content and managing digital assets globally is a powerful combination that is creating new opportunities as we shift away from our legacy model to an interactive and digital model.
The same transition is taking place in professional markets. Here, we're seeing an acceleration in the online ordering of hard copies and a huge increase in the sale of eBooks. Since the beginning of the year, our eBook sales through the major eBook retailers to consumers have nearly tripled. Our best-selling eBooks in the third quarter ranged from the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, to the famous Graham and Dodd's work, Security Analysis. We have more than 5,000 professional titles available as eBooks. 
Even with the continued rapid growth of digital products and services, the fourth quarter this year will be challenging. Last year, we had a significant upswing in operating profits based on the surge in the second quarter semester orders in the U.S. Higher Education market, and improved results in the professional and international markets. The bulk of second semester ordering in Higher Education sometimes occurs in December and in other years, it comes in January, complicating the balancing between the fourth quarter forecasting in this market. The U.S. Higher Education market is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% this year. There is pent-up demand in the el-hi market, but budget pressures are continued to constraint school district spending in many regions. The arrival of new federal funds could positive factor, however. The McGraw-Hill school education group sales teams are still working on a number of large basal adoptions in the open territories, as well as some excellent fourth quarter opportunities for intervention products across the country. Federal funding will clearly play a part in some of these purchases, but in other cases, it will be harder to identify because large district orders tend to be paid for through a blend of funding sources, so it's difficult to predict what will materialize.
So with that, let sum up our McGraw-Hill Education revenue. We still expect a low single-digit increase, operating margin, we had been forecasting flat margins. We now expect an improvement of 200 basis points to 14% for 2010. 
Okay, let's move over to our review our third segment, and that's the Information & Media segment.  Key contributors to this segment's third quarter performance were the continued solid growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television advertising and the effect of the business we have divestiture. In the third quarter, revenue declined by 4.7%, but excluding business week, it actually grew by 5.1%. Operating profit increased by 55.1% or $16.3 million. The operating margin was 20.1%, up from 12.4% for the same period last year. 
The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, increased by 3.3%. In volatile energy markets, the demand for Platts data and information products continues to drive strong growth in both the United States and international markets, and incidentally more than 60% of Platts' revenue comes from outside of the United States.  Platts is growing rapidly across a number of commodities. It is continuing to expand its coverage of the refined petroleum markets in the United States, Europe and Asia, with new price assessments in gasoline, fuel oil, naptha, naptha, being the raw material for gasoline. 
Platts expanded its suite of daily spot price assessments to include alumina, that's a mineral produced from bauxite ore that is used to make aluminum. The new price assessments, the world's first daily price references for alumina address the needs of miners, smelders, refiners and traders for the independent source of open market spot prices to better determine valuations for short and long-term contracts. Platts also began producing new price assessments in the India coal market. India's thermal coal imports are changing trade flows radically, and increasing the need for expanded more frequent and transparent price information. These new assessments address the needs of power producers, coal traders and ship brokers for an independent source of India-related open market spot prices, making Platts even more relevant in this growing market.
There was some softness in construction, particularly among smaller regional contractors, who have been hardest hit by the declining activity in this market. Weakness in the global Automotive business offset improvements in the non-auto parts of the market at J.D. Power and Associates. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group increased by 23.5% to $23.6 million. The combination of political advertising and improved local and national time sales accounted for the increase. In this political season, the contest for governor and heated race rates for a Senate seat and issue related advertising in Colorado are attracting significant ad dollars.
Therefore, summing up for Information & Media, there is no change in our revenue guidance. We still expect the revenue decline in the mid-single digits, but mid-single-digit growth excluding BusinessWeek. We now expect the operating margin in the mid to high teens. we Had anticipated an operating margin in the mid-teens, and now we're addressing that upwards a little. 
That concludes our review of the operations and therefore, summing up for the corporation. We anticipate earnings per share in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes $0.02 of the onetime gains from divestitures, but includes dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. Okay, let's hold it there and with that, let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer, for his results."
21719,114360784,104024,"The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisi",2063,"Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisitions: the Research and Estimates Business of TheMarkets.com for Capital IQ; Tegrity, which becomes part of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group; and PIPAL Research by CRISIL. The acquisition of Tegrity closed in October and Pipal Research is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
We expect to spend approximately $360 million on these acquisitions and a recent equity investment in Ambow Education, a leading provider of educational and career enhancement services in China. The most significant of these acquisitions, of course, is TheMarkets.com, of diluted earnings per share by $0.01 in the third quarter, and will do so again in the fourth quarter. In 2011, TheMarkets.com acquisition is expected to generate approximately $60 million in revenue and despite an anticipated $15 million in intangible amortization, the acquisition will be both accounting and cash flow accretive in 2011. We also had three divestitures in the third quarter, a small secondary school business in Australia, which generated a $3.8 million pretax gain and two by CRISIL. They are a 7% equity interest in the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange of India. We continue to maintain a 5% ownership, the divestiture of the 7% was required to comply with local regulations regarding foreign ownership rules. And also, CRISIL's remaining 10% interest in Gas Strategies Group, the 90% interest we had sold that back in December of 2008.
The two CRISIL divestitures this year generated $7.3 million in pretax gains. Now because CRISIL is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, part of the gain is deductive for purposes of calculating EPS, and is shown as a component of net income attributable to non-controlling interest. This was $2.3 million, which represents the post-tax portion of the gain attributable to the minority owners of CRISIL. In addition to the acquisitions, we continued to actively repurchased shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $69 million at an average price of $31.14 per share.  
Year-to-date, we are purchased 8.7 million shares for $255.8 million, averaging $29.37 per share. 8.4 million shares remained in the 2007 program authorized by the board.  Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 309.3 million in the third quarter, a 4.4 million decrease versus the previous year due primarily to the full year impact of the second quarter share repurchases. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.9 million for the second quarter, reflecting the full impact of second quarter share repurchases, as well as the weighted impact of third quarter share repurchases. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 308 million.
We continued to be well capitalized with net cash and short-term investments as of September 30 of $158 million. The shift to a net cash position from a net debt position of $53 million at the end of the second quarter is driven primarily by strong free cash flow, partially offset by funding for acquisitions and share purchases. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.356 billion, while gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in senior notes. Our debt is entirely in long term unsecured senior notes, no commercial paper is outstanding.
The outlook for free cash flow continues to improve. Now to calculate free cash flow, we start with our after-tax cash from operations and deduct working, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt. During the third quarter, our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated free cash flow of $552 million. Year-to-date in 2010, we generated free cash flow of $651 million versus $507 million in the same period last year for an increase of $144 million. The improvement is due primarily to stronger operating results and a continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow this year to be clearly in excess of $700 million versus our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million. The improvement is driven by stronger operating results, reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated.  Just as a reminder, free cash flow last year was $770 million. 
Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we made a $14 million discretionary contribution in the third quarter, and we anticipate making an additional discretionary payment in the fourth quarter, potentially in the range of $50 million, and that is factored into the free cash flow projections. 
Now let's look at expenses. As a reminder, I'll
Speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth, excluding 2009 restructuring charges, as well as 2009 and 2010 gains and losses on divestitures.  So let's start with Education. Third quarter adjusted expenses were roughly flat, declining 0.1%. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses declined 1.3%. Contributing to the lower expense levels were two key decisions last year. The first was to combine the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations. The second was the planned phaseout of statewide low-margin custom test contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. A $15 million decline in amortization of prepublication cost also benefited third quarter results. Increases in selling and marketing cost for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings. As Terry has indicated, we now expect margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guidance of flat margins.
For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 13.3% in the third quarter and 12.8% at constant currencies. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses increased 10.1% and 9.3% at constant currencies. The growth in expenses in the third quarter and year-to-date was driven by increased salaries and occupancy cost, primarily for international hires and higher incentive compensation. 
Third quarter expenses were also impacted by TheMarkets.com acquisition, that resulted in an incremental $5 million in expense. There also was $5.4 million in additional cost related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives. Now taken together, these increased total Financial Services expense by 2.7%. The fourth quarter is expected to show a comparable increase in cost related to our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're still projecting additional full year cost of approximately $15 million, as Terry stated.
One last comment on Financial Services. Third quarter expense growth in the beginning of the year, I indicated that total stock-based compensation for McGraw-Hill was expected to increase roughly $30 million versus 2009, due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off a depressed base. Due to stronger operating results, we now expect an increase of roughly $40 million. The majority of this increase as anticipated was realized in the third quarter due to particularly depressed levels in the third quarter 2009. As a result, Financial Services had a $10.6 million increase in stock-based compensation for the quarter.
As Terry indicated , we now expect Financial Services margins to decline by approximately 150 basis points, which implies expenses will increased roughly 9% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 7% to 8%, and increases largely driven by TheMarkets.com acquisition. 
At Information & Media, third quarter and year-to-date adjusted expenses declined 13.1% and 17.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced third quarter revenue by $22 million and expenses by $32 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $10 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $78 million and expenses by $111 million for a positive profit impact of $33 million. And of course, for the fourth quarter, the divestiture of BusinessWeek is expected to reduce revenue by $22 million and expense by $27 million. The positive impact here is $5 million. This will result in full year savings of $38 million. 
For 2010, we expect adjusted expenses to decline in the mid-teens versus our previous guidance of the decline in the low teens. Corporate expenses in the third quarter is $44.4 million, a $16.5 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation compared to lower levels in 2009, as well as normal increases due to the stronger operating results. Increased excess vacant space was also a contributor to increased corporate costs.
We are making progress in reducing excess space. We finalized one agreement to sublease some excess space in New York this month and have received several promising inquiries regarding additional space. Because we are subleasing the space at lower rates than what we are currently paying, the accounting rules require us to take a one-time charge for the difference between the present value of the payments we will receive versus the payments we will have to make over the term of the lease. Our new earnings per share guidance excludes this one-time charge, since we are still finalizing accounting for this charge.
Now excluding the charge, we now expect full year 2010 corporate expense to increased $30 million to $35 million versus our previous guidance of an increase of $25 million to $30 million due to additional incentive compensation accruals. Net interest expense was $19.3 million in the third quarter compared to about $18 million in the same period last year and $21 million in the second quarter of 2010.  We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was roughly $76.9 million. The company's effective tax rate in the third quarter and year-to-date was 36.4%, which is unchanged from 2009. We expect a comparable rate for the full year. 
Now let's turn to investments.  The publication investments were $39.3 million in the third quarter, $5.4 million lower than last year. Year-to-date, pre-pub investments were $99.3 million, a $30.4 million decrease versus the prior year. For the year, we now expect pre-pub investments of approximately $160 million, and that's versus our previous estimate of the $195 million to $205 million. 
Now the reduction in our pre-pub investment estimate is due to several factors. First, the timing of the adoption of Common Core Standards by various states. To date, 36 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards for K-12 math, reading and language arts. Also, we continued to reevaluate several programs to enhance our digital offerings. These actions have caused timing delays for a number of our pre-pub investments. In addition, we continue to realize savings from combining the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.
Now purchases of prop and equipment were $16.6 million the third quarter, about $1 million higher than last year. And year-to-date purchases were approximately $39 million. We now expect on a full-year basis the expenditures to be in the $70 million to $80 million range versus our previous estimate of $90 million to $100 million. This compares to $68.5 million in 2009.
Now let's take a look at some of non-cash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $112 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decrease versus the third quarter of 2009. For the full year, we now expect $245 million to $250 million versus the previous estimate of $260 million to $265 million. This compares to $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the recent lower level of investments. 
Depreciation was $25 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million last year. We now expect full year depreciation to be slightly below last year, which was $113 million. Amortization of intangibles was $9 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $32 million for the first nine months. Reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions, we now expect it to be closer to $50 million for the full year versus our previous estimate of $40 million. Our unearned revenue continues to grow. We ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, up 4.2% for the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, growth was approximately 5%. Financial Services represented 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digits, driven by strong growth in ratings-related information products, S&P Indices and Capital IQ. While still small, unearned revenue at McGraw-Hill Education is showing strong growth due to sales of digital products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry."

And so, if you look at the calendar and just take it from that standpoint, our guesstimate at this point is that we will be at or a little better than 2010 state adoption levels on that one. But we've got to also see what the effect of Common Core Standards are going to be, and if there's going to be changes from that standpoint. So it's a little bit early, but if you look just at the calendar, at or above 2010 is what we're thinking on that one. New issuance, Brian, as you know, coming off of a softer second quarter, we really ramped up, especially the high yield markets. And again, the big number that we watch is the refinancing numbers out through 2014, still it's about $2 trillion in terms of maturities coming due on that part. And of course, there was a lot of refinancing or refundings in the third quarter, a lot of the new issuance that way. We've seen a continued strong corporate market in here. Issuance, a little softer in Europe, but again, one would think that it should be still fairly strong, and we have evidence of that at this point. We'll have to see as we get into November and early December, but so far, it's been pretty good."
