And during the presentation, I'll refer to",2449,"Thanks, Antoine. Good morning, and welcome to ConocoPhillips Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I'll be focusing on the company's results for the quarter using material you can find on the web. And during the presentation, I'll refer to adjusted earnings, which are reconciliation to adjusted earnings can be found in the appendix of our presentation material. Before we get started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Page 2, which is a reminder that I'll be making forward-looking statements as part of the presentation and the Q&A, and that actual results may be materially different.So I'm going to move to Slide 3, which provides a summary of our fourth quarter results and business highlights. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.7 billion or $1.16 per share, generating cash from operations of $5.1 billion. We ended the quarter with debt of $28.7 billion, resulting in debt-to-cap ratio of 31%, down 2% versus last quarter.Total production, including our 20% share of LUKOIL, was 2.26 million BOE [barrel of oil equivalent] per day in the fourth quarter. It was a challenging period for R&M, with an overall loss and net income driven by depressed refining margins, which were particularly low in the U.S. Global refining utilization was only 76%, reflecting economic run important cuts made in this difficult environment, as well as increased turnaround activity. On a cost side, we achieved a normalized full year reduction of 12% or around $1.7 billion pretax for the year. This compares to our original target of $1.4 billion, and I'll provide more detail on the sources of these cost reductions later in the presentation.During the quarter, we recognized non-cash asset impairments of almost $575 million after tax, primarily related to the impairment of our equity stake in Naryanmarneftegaz joint venture in Russia and mature Western Canada and gas properties, as well as miscellaneous impairments in our E&P [Exploration and Production] and R&M [Refining and Marketing] segments. And Naryanmarneftegaz equity accounting rules for impairment testing resulted in write-down this quarter. And while the current producing field, YK [Yuzhno Khylchuyu] has met our expectations, our view of probable resource has declined as a result of additional data and drilling activities around some of the flank areas of the reservoir. In Western Canada, the impaired properties were impacted in varying degrees by a combination of lower prices, royalty rate increases, strengthening of the Canadian relative to the U.S. dollar and operating performance. These Canadian impairments represent a small portion of our total capital employed in that region. Turning now to Slide 4, you can see total adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were up sequentially, but down by about 10% compared to last year. This slide shows changes by segment. Our E&P business increased earnings by more than 20% due primarily to the improvement in oil price, which more than offset lower gas prices. As I mentioned, R&M had a loss for the quarter due to significantly lower realized margins and utilization rates. LUKOIL adjusted earnings were higher than the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting our estimates of fourth quarter 2009 results.Slide 5 shows the progress we've made on reducing controllable costs. We started 2009 with the goal of reducing costs by 10% or $1.4 billion. For the full year, we achieved nearly $2 billion all-in savings. And if you exclude one-time severance accruals, the normalized reduction was around $1.7 billion. Nearly 40% of these savings were related to base operational expenditures, while the remainder resulted from market factors, such as currency movements and lower utility costs. We also saw significant savings in the Equity Affiliate operations, such as CPChem [Chevron Phillips Chemical] and DCP, which are not included in this amount.Slide 6 outlines our cash flow performance. In the fourth quarter, we generated $5.1 billion from cash from operations, with capital spend of $3.1 billion and dividends of $750 million. Total debt was reduced by $1.8 billion.Our 2009 full year cash flow detail is shown on the pie charts on Slide 7. As you can see on the left, we generated $12.5 billion in cash from operations. Asset sales, including the disposition of our interest in Keystone pipeline, along with other changes, provided $1.1 billion of additional cash. The uses of cash are provided on the right-hand of the slide and show our 2009 capital program of $12 billion, which was slightly below plan due to the timing of expenditures on major projects. Our dividends were $2.8 billion, which included the quarterly increase we announced in October. As a result, total debt increased $1.2 billion for the year.Slide 8 shows the history of our debt-to-cap ratio over the last several quarters versus our target of 20% to 25%. As you can see, while we're currently above our goal, we've made progress at reducing debt to cap this year. And as we go forward, we expect the proceeds from our two-year $10 billion asset-disposal program and cash flow from operations to move us back within our targeted range.Now I'd like to take a couple of minutes to review our segment performance, starting with total company production for the fourth quarter you can find on Slide 9. Overall E&P production was down 2% or 39,000 BOE a day versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Market factors decreased production by 16,000 BOE a day, reflecting reduced gas production in North America, driven by economic conditions, as well as price-related reductions and international OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] curtailments. As we discussed in our third quarter conference call, voluntary gas curtailments began in late August and continued into the fourth quarter. And during the fourth quarter, total curtailment was around 145 million cubic feet per day.Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see the changes to the portfolio reduced production by 12,000 BOE per day, primarily reflecting the sale of our Netherlands assets and expropriation of our interests in Ecuador. These declines were partially offset by a benefit from improved volumes due to the absence of hurricane impacts in 2009. In the operations category, we saw a significant benefit from new production, but was not able to offset normal field decline. Although the fourth quarter was down compared to last year, our full year production was up around 3% to 1.85 million BOE per day versus the 1.79 in 2008, as shown on Slide 10. Excluding market-related improvements of 17,000 BOE per day, we are up over 2%. This was driven by nearly 140,000 BOE per day of production from new major projects and oil sands expansions. We had a strong operational year and had lower impacts from external events, such as hurricanes. So now turning to Slide 11, you can see total E&P adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, up from $1.4 billion last year. The main drivers of the improvement were higher oil prices and lower operating costs, which more than offset lower gas prices, sales volumes and other costs.You can see on the right-hand side of the table, at the bottom of the slide, our realized oil and NGL [natural gas liquids] prices went up by 36% compared to last year, while global realized gas prices decreased by about 25%. Although North America gas prices were challenged for the majority of the year, our fourth quarter performance in Lower 48 benefited from somewhat better gas prices and continued cost-reduction programs. The chart shows a breakdown of the major variances. In total, prices and other factors, such as production taxes, increased earnings by $500 million. Lower sales volumes decreased our earnings by about $160 million. This decrease reflects lower gas sales due in part to voluntary reductions, which were partially offset by higher liquid sales. Operating costs were improved by a little less than $100 million after tax. Unlike previous quarters, when market factors comprised the majority of savings, cost reductions this quarter relate to underlying operations, as market factors worked against us.The other bar primarily reflects foreign currency loss compared to a gain last year. And we also had higher DD&A [depreciation, depletion and amortization] expense this quarter due to project start-ups and some specific field dismantlement accruals. The R&M adjusted earnings variance is shown on slide 12. R&M lost money during the quarter, driven by low global refining margins and compressed crude differentials. As shown on the table at the bottom of the slide, U.S.-adjusted earnings fell by nearly $700 million, due in large part to nearly 60% decline in integrated margins. Although the U.S. refining 3:2:1 crack spread was virtually unchanged versus the fourth quarter of 2008, our realized margins decreased significantly. And this was caused by several key factors. First, light-heavy and sweet-sour crude differentials were significantly lower this quarter compared to last year. Our U.S. refineries are configured to run around 55% advantage crudes, such as WTS [West Texas Sour], Canadian Sour and South American heavies. On these advantage crude, every dollar decrease and differential creates between $15 million and $20 million decrease in quarterly earnings. And compared to last year's quarter, the Maya differentials decreased by nearly $7 a barrel. We also saw negative impacts from the decrease in dieselite spreads. Although the market 3:2:1 crack spread was flat, dieselite margins decreased by over $11 a barrel, while gasoline spreads increased. Because our production and configuration is more biased toward diesel with an average yield in the mid- to high-30% range, we were adversely impacted by the dieselite spread.The third source of year-over-year earnings decline not reflected in the 3:2:1 market crack is the impact of higher crude prices on secondary product margins. We sell certain refined products on a fixed-price basis, which makes their margins vulnerable to crude costs moving quickly higher.On the international side, the variance is more straightforward. The table shows that international earnings fell by 70%, and that's generally consistent with the international refining 3:1:2 spread decrease. In total, global realized margins reduced earnings by more than $800 million as shown on the graph. Utilization rates and sales volumes were also down, caused primarily by economically driven run cuts. Lower operating costs did help adjusted earnings by about $50 million despite the higher turnaround activity. And all other impacts, such as currency movements, decreased adjusted earnings by about $30 million.I'll now move to Slide 13, which shows the variances for all of the segments. In Midstream, we experienced higher results due to higher NGL prices. Compared to last year, index price for DCP were up around 40%. And our share of CPChem results were $60 million higher due to improved specialties, aromatics and styrenics margins and lower controllable costs, partly offset by lower olefins polyolefin margins. Earnings from our Emerging Businesses segment decreased primarily due to lower spark spreads in international power. LUKOIL earnings were $388 million for the quarter, compared to an adjusted value of zero for the fourth quarter of 2008. Corporate expenses were in-line at $311 million after tax for the quarter, compared to $354 million of adjusted expenses last year. This decrease is due to the absence of foreign currency losses and lower staff costs, partially offset by higher net interest expense. So that completes my review of our fourth quarter results. I'll wrap up with some summary comments on Slide 14.We performed well in 2009, despite difficult global economic conditions that severely impacted the energy industry. In 2009, we initially expected our E&P production to be flat versus 2008. Excluding market factors, we delivered slightly more than 2% growth, driven by improvements in operating efficiency and lack of any external events, such as hurricanes. Looking at 2010, we expect to return to the more normalized production we achieved in 2008, in large part to having a full year impact of reduced North America drilling, as well as lower production growth from new projects.While we do have a good portfolio of major projects, such as QG3, Canadian Oil, Jasmine, Gumusut and others, they will contribute growth as these developments are continued. But we do plan to reduce our capital spending in some of our more mature assets, which are significant contributors to near-term production. We're intentionally reducing our spending levels in support of our stated effort to improve our return on capital employed, and increase our per-barrel cash flow and earnings in our upstream business.In addition to delivering production results, improving safety performance and having a good environmental stewardship year, we took steps to reduce our cost structure as we're capturing market opportunities and driving reductions in our underlying business. While we can't predict how market factors, such as currency and utilities, will impact us in 2010, we are committed to holding on to the operational savings we achieved this year from procurement initiatives, controllable cost reductions and portfolio changes.In 2009, we also began to see results from our commitment to exploration, with discoveries in the Browse Basin of Australia and Lower Tertiary trend in the Gulf of Mexico. We also added several prospects in some exciting new areas. And spending on exploration will remain relatively flat in order to strengthen our portfolio for future organic reserve replacement.Late in the year, we announced plans to enhance returns and strengthen our financial position. Consistent with these objectives, we announced our 2010 capital budget of $11.2 billion and initiated our asset disposition plans. We've started the sales process for our same crude interest, and received quite a bit of interest on this asset. And we've identified other targets, and are very confident we'll reach our $10 billion target over the next two years. Finally, we're taking appropriate steps to manage our downstream business in the face of prolonged margin pressure. We do not expect the magnitude of losses to continue in this business, given the specific actions we're taking. Our strategy is constant and starts with operating excellence. We must run safely and reliably. Next, we focus on controlling our costs, and we have a good track record in this area. In addition to running well and keeping costs in check, we focus on optimizing the plants and capturing the highest margin available on any given day. This not only includes making economic run reductions, as we did in the fourth quarter, but also changing operations in response to market movements. Lastly, we have adjusted our capital plans for this business with the objective of ensuring that it's cash positive. You can see this in the deferral of the upgrade project at Wilhelmshaven and the reduction of discretionary capital. Through all these steps, we feel confident in our ability to manage through this challenging environment. So Antoine, that concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'll open the call for your questions."

As far as LUKOIL, again, I can't really say anything, but repeat what Jim had said, which was we've got a really good relationship with LUKOIL and Russian authorities.

I am joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO, and this morning we will be discussing the Company's first quarter results and status on the strategic initiatives we shared at our March 24th analyst day.
A summary of key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. As in the past, you can find the presentation materials on the IR section of the ConocoPhillips website. In an addition to the presentation material, we plan to use our website to provide information that was part of our quarterly interim update prior to discontinuing its issuance earlier this year.
Please refer to our Safe Harbor statement in the appendix of this presentation on slide 17. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and Q&A. Our actual results may differ materially from what we present, and also in the appendix that are non-GAAP reconciliations footnoted throughout the presentation for your reference.
Moving to slide two, summary of our results and highlights for the quarter. You will see adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $2.2 billion or $1.47 a share, which excludes the charges of $110 million for ending our participation in the Yanbu and Shah projects. Cash from operations were $3 billion.
Our company's capital efficiency increased as annualized cash return on capital invested improved to 21%. Our E&P production, excluding LUKOIL was 1.83 million BOE per day, and in spite of the challenging downstream environment, the competitiveness of our refineries allowed us to run at 88%.
I'm going to now turn to slide three. Total earnings for our company were $2.098 billion, up $1.3 billion compared to last year. The majority of our earnings were generated by our Exploration and Production business. Our E&P segment improved by $1.132 billion, primarily due to the increase in crude prices. Compared to the first quarter of last year, R&M income fell $209 million; weaker refining and marketing margins more than offset lower operating costs.
Our equity earnings for LUKOIL investment were up $379 million compared to the first quarter of 2009. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter we had charges of $110 million for exiting the Shah and Yanbu projects. So adjusting for that, you can see this quarter's earnings were $2.208 billion. Total company controllable costs were lower by about $40 million year-on-year and $110 million sequentially if you eliminate the impact of foreign exchange and higher utility and fuel costs.
Moving to slide four, total company cash flow. You can see in the first quarter, we generated $3 billion in cash from operations. This included a $979 million negative impact from an increase in working capital. This increase in working capital is driven by the growth in seasonal operational inventory levels and in support of our commercial business consistent with what we've done in the past.
We expect a substantial portion of this inventory to be worked off by year-end. Our capital program totaled $2.480 billion for the quarter, in line with our 2010 budget of $11.2 billion. And while debt-to-cap ratio remained flat, our absolute debt level increased slightly due to the increase in working capital I mentioned earlier.
We paid $744 million in dividends, compared to $696 million paid in the first quarter of 2009. Our first quarter 2010 cash position ended at $855 million. Now let's review our total company production for the first quarter on slide five. As expected first quarter 2010, E&P production was 1.83 million BOE per day, down 5% or 97,000 BOE per day from the first quarter of 2009.
Compared to last quarter, E&P production was virtually flat. Looking at the sources behind the year-over-year decline, 29,000 BOE per day can be attributed to market factors including production and sharing contracts in Indonesia and royalty impacts in Canada. Portfolio changes mainly due to the expropriation of our assets in Ecuador decreased production by about 9,000 BOE per day and higher planned maintenance, primarily in Australia, decreased our production by 3,000 BOE per day.
The remaining decrease of 56,000 BOE per day was due to normal field decline, primarily in the UK, lower 48, and Alaska, mitigated by new production form Phase 2 of our Bohai Bay project in China and our Foster Creek, Christina Lake SAGD developments in Canada. Production from FCCL Oil properties increased nearly 50% on a net after-royalty basis in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period of 2009.
The Foster Creek project achieved payout for royalty purposes in the first quarter. It's the industry's largest SAGD project to reach payout today, and is leading the way in implementing innovative technologies that lower operating costs and reduced our impact on the environment. In the Bakken Shale, we spud three wells during March bringing our total 2010 well count to six.
Three of those wells were placed on production in March with each having initial flow rates of approximately 2,000 BOE per day. As we gain experience in this area, drilling productivity continues to improve which we hope to replicate as we increase investments in this region. In the Eagle Ford play we continue to have - we currently have three rigs drilling and have completed the drilling phase of four horizontal wells this year.
The first of these wells were placed on production in late March and slowed at an initial rate of 3.8 million cubic feet of gas and 1,200 barrels a day of condensates. This well and related industry results reinforce the potential of our 240,000 net acre position in the liquid rich core of this play.
Now turning to page six; unadjusted E&P earnings for the first quarter were $1.832 billion, up from $700 million last year. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed $1.5 billion of increased earnings. The increase was partially offset by $104 million due to the impact of lower sales volumes, and operating costs were $23 million higher mainly due to the adverse effects of foreign exchange of about $50 million.
Excluding the impact of FX, operating costs were down around $25 million to $30 million from a year ago. The $219 million in other includes $83 million in costs associated with the Shah Project exit; increased DD&A due to foreign exchange impacts, and increased export taxes related to our equity affiliates. As stated, when excluding the $83 million charge for the exit of Shah, adjusted earnings are $1.915 billion.
You can see the realized prices table at the bottom of slide six. On the right hand side, you could see realized oil and NGL prices reflect a 78% increase compared to last year, and global gas prices increased by approximately 11%. Both U.S. and international earnings improved significantly from the prior year and the lower 48 business unit had solid earnings this year, compared to a loss a year ago.
Although North American natural gas prices remained challenged, our financial performance in the lower 48 benefited from liquids, which represent more than a third of its production. Moving on to slide seven, our unit metrics for E&P, you can see our E&P income per BOE was nearly three times higher in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the increase in realized prices.
And although we currently lag the largest competitors in our industry on an income per BOE basis, we expect to close this gap as we allocate more of our capital to liquids production. Our E&P cash contribution per BOE has been consistently above average compared to our peer group for more than a year. And if prices continue to increase, we expect to outperform our peers on a cash flow per barrel basis due to our large OECD-focused portfolio.
The R&M segment discussion begins on slide eight. Market conditions for R&M were challenging during the quarter and much weaker than the first quarter of 2009. However, we did benefit from wider light-heavy crude differentials, better margins on the production of feedstocks used by the chemical industry, and improved clean product yields.
We were able to increase our U.S. refinery utilization to 88% this quarter from 80% a year ago, and 83% sequentially. The year-over-year earnings variance was driven primarily by lower global refining and marketing margins. Over 85% of the $213 million reduction in income is related to refining margins.
In the U.S. distillate margins have dropped about 40% while internationally distillate margins have fallen 30%. Lower global volumes impacted earnings by $24 million. These volumes were primarily caused by our Wilhelmshaven refinery, which was shut down for the entire first quarter, as well as planned turnaround activity at both our joint venture refineries, MiRO in Germany, and the Melaka refinery in Malaysia.
The $88 million improvement in operating costs was due primarily to lower turnaround activity and other operating costs. We remain focused on items we can control including cost management and optimizing our operations. 11 of our 17 refineries are ranked in the top tier of the Solomon operating cost peer ranking, and this creates competitive cost advantages.
$60 million in other was caused by foreign exchange impacts and includes a $25 million impairment resulting from our decision not to participate in the Yanbu refinery project. Adjusted earnings for R&M were $21 million for the quarter. A table at the bottom of the slide provides U.S. and international earnings as well as realized margins.
Now let's move to slide nine, which shows year-over-year variances for other segments. Results in our midstream segment were $77 million, $46 million lower this quarter compared to a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to an $88 million gain on shares issued by a subsidiary of DCP Midstream in the first quarter of 2009 partially offset by improved margins due to higher NGL prices this quarter.
Our 50% share of CPChem generated $110 million this quarter, $87 million higher than the first quarter of 2009 due to higher ethylene and benzene margins. Finally, LUKOIL earnings were improved $379 million, compared to the same quarter last year probably as a result of the restatement due to lagged reporting.
As we disclosed on our analyst day beginning in January of 2010, we changed the method we used to determine our equity share of LUKOIL's earnings. Under this new method, the Company records our equity share of LUKOIL's actual earnings on a one quarter lag basis rather than using an earnings estimate for the current quarter. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change.
Corporate expenses were $310 million after tax for the quarter, compared to $259 million last year. The increase was primarily due to increased interest expense and foreign currency losses. Turning to page 10, our return on capital employed. Cash return on capital invested has improved each quarter, since the beginning of 2009. This has been primarily driven by better earnings and cash flows resulting from higher commodity prices.
So, that completes my review of the first quarter 2010 earnings. What I would like to do now is turn to an outlook comments on slide 11 before asking Jim to give us a few of his comments and then opening the phone for Q&A. So, first I would like to provide some guidance on operating expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. We will begin with E&P.
Over the next couple of quarters, production is expected to be lower. Areas that will contribute to the decrease include North American natural gas, Western North Slope, and Prudhoe Bay due to seasonal maintenance and normal decline. We also have some planned shutdowns being conducted in Norway with Ekofisk and Eldfisk being down between 22 days and 26 days.
In the UK, Britannia and J-Block will be down between 10 days and 20 days, and in Australia Bayu-Undan and the Darwin LNG facility will be down close to a month. As we said last quarter and during the analyst meeting, we are targeting 2010 production levels to be flat with 2008 normalizing for the impact of asset dispositions.
New production is expected to partially offset these declines, and will come from our ramp-up of Canadian oil sands, Bohai Bay, Australia, North America liquids, and Qatargas 3. Regarding refining, we expect increases in utilization rates, especially internationally due to the restart of our Wilhelmshaven refinery and the completion of turnarounds at both MiRO and Melaka.
In the United States capacity is expected to improve given our expectations for higher refining margins. And as for the remainder of the year, we expect average quarterly turnaround costs of about $125 million pretax in line with previously provided guidance. We continue to take steps to control costs while ensuring the safety of our employees, integrity of our assets, and conducting planned maintenance at all our refineries.
In 2009, we exceeded our cost reduction expectation target of 1.4 by reducing costs almost $2 billion, and in 2010 we plan to achieve our cost savings of $400 million. At our March 24th analyst day, we provided details regarding our plans to enhance returns and outlined our asset disposition program.
We recently announced an agreement to sell our Syncrude interest to Sinopec for $4.650 billion pretax. The 2009 production and reserves associated with our interest in Syncrude was 23,000 BOE per day, and almost 250 million BOE in reserves. Our expectation for the after-tax proceeds are in excess of $4 billion. This is an early estimate, could possibly change on the completion of the final transaction.
The government approval process is underway in both Canada and China, and we anticipate closing in the third quarter. Data rooms for our North America asset disposition programs will be open in the next couple of months. We've selected our financial advisors and expect closing for these packages to start in the second half of 2010.
The buyer for our Conoco Flying J travel centers has been selected. We will estimate after-tax proceeds to be approximately $350 million. We are still waiting for the Federal Trade Commission's approval, and hope to close mid-year. We've engaged Citibank as the advisor of our interest in the REX Pipeline.
We've 25 percentages in REX Pipeline, and marketing efforts are expected to begin in the second quarter with closing of a potential transaction expected by year-end 2010. We remain confident that we will reach our $10 billion target for asset dispositions during 2011. Regarding the increase in shareholder distributions, in March we announced a quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share, 10% increase over the previous rate.
The dividend is payable at June 1st to shareholders of record on May 24th, and we started selling LUKOIL shares this month in small, open market transactions and commenced purchasing ConocoPhillips shares simultaneously. These amounts and the amount of LUKOIL shares sold, and the amount of ConocoPhillips bought will be disclosed in the upcoming 10-Q.
As stated at the analyst meeting, we expect to complete the sale of our half of LUKOIL equity during 2011. Moving to exploration, 2009 was a good year with discoveries of Browse Basin and the Gulf of Mexico lower tertiary trend as well as entries into several new areas. While we are constraining capital in some parts of our business, spending in exploration has remained fairly consistent, which should strength our portfolio for future organic reserve replacement over time.
In April, drilling and logging operations were completed on our Laurentian Basin wildcat, and the well was subsequently plugged and abandoned. The cost of the well incurred through March 31st are included in our first quarter financial results as dry hole expense. A significant amount of data was collected and is being analyzed, and no decision has been made regarding any potential future activities in this area.
Kronos in the Browse Basin of Northwest coast of Australia is still drilling toward its planned target depth. Given the extensive coring, testing, and analysis that's planned for this well, we are unlikely to have significant updates regarding the overall prospect for several weeks. In general, most of ConocoPhillips significant exploration wells will begin during the second half of this year. Some will reach their objectives in the fourth quarter while others will roll into 2011.
For example, in the Gulf of Mexico the Chevron-operated Coronado prospect will spud early in the third quarter, potentially conclude before year-end. As mentioned at the analyst meeting, we expect that a Tiber appraisal well could also spud prior to the year-end. In the Caspian current plans are to spud the Rockmore well in the third quarter, and achieve TD by year-end, and we expect Nursultan to follow sometime in the second half of 2011.
As for our Poland Shale play, we expect to spud our initial wells in the second quarter. And in China Coalbed methane, we continue to drill and analyze cost and the reservoir performance with the results interpreted near the end of 2010 or early 2011. With regard to Eagle Ford, we are aggressively pursuing exploration and development opportunities based on the promising results we've encountered to date.
Our APLNG project is moving forward as planned. APLNG reserves and resources are considered the best in the region and our upstream is making progress daily. Our target is to secure sales agreements to support two 4.5 million metric tonne per annum trains.
So, that concludes my comments. Now I will ask to Jim for a few closing statements before we open the call for your questions.

Thank you, and appreciate all those who are participating in our conference call this morning. Thought it might be of help to spend a few moments to talk about some of the steps we are taking to create shareholder value, and I refer to our March analyst meeting in New York when you heard us, heard me indicate that the opportunities for profitable investments for the large, international, integrated majors has changed pretty dramatically in the last several years.
Resource access is an issue, as is fiscal take in commercial terms. The question for our company is how do we create value for our shareholders in this type of environment given the assets, the resources, and the opportunities we already have in our existing portfolio.
Our approach is not just to get bigger in upstream volumes, but to ensure that we have better than cost of capital returns and not do projects that are at just cost to capital or have limited upside potential. We think the way to create shareholder value for our company is for us to convert our extensive resources into proven reserves, and to do this at competitive metrics.
And while we will grow the absolute volumes in the latter period of our five and ten year period of time of strategic plans, we are stressing to annually increase the per share metrics of reserves and production as we go through this period of time. Creating value means more and more focus on improving the returns of the portfolio, strengthening the balance sheet with significant increases in distributions to our shareholders in the form of annual increases in dividends and share repurchases, and we are executing on this plan, and we've seen support from our shareholders and the financial community.
As Clayton said, we have reached agreement to sell our 9% in Syncrude and that transaction, along with the others that we have told the marketplace that we intend to sell, will go a long way toward meeting our $10 billion disposition objective. There were very difficult decisions for our company regarding participation in the Yambu and Shah project, but we believe the decisions that we made were consistent with the execution of our plan.
Clayton also said we've commenced sale of a portion of our LUKOIL shares, and simultaneously we have started the purchase of ConocoPhillips shares. We are doing this in rather modest amounts and doing this in an appropriate way. Capital spending is being constrained to doing our highest return projects while not deferring some of the other projects that we may be doing at a later point in time when we can improve the metrics associated with those opportunities.
We expect to accomplish our debt and balance sheet objectives really by the end this year, so things are going quite well in that regard. So those are the comments I would like to make, Clayton, and I think probably it is time now we open this up for questions from those participating in our conference call.

So you have talked about - you just mentioned debt and equity reduction as clearly being priorities and it seems like the equity reduction component, share repurchases have already commenced.
So could you talk about how you plan to segment the two? Is debt reduction necessarily more important than equity reduction, or how are you guys thinking about that part of the plan?

First, what I would like to say is yes, the cash generation looked quite positive. We are quite pleased with the slow development of the economy around the world, and that could be helpful to our businesses. And we are executing on our plan. With respect to our investment opportunities, I would say that there is likelihood that our capital program would be more than $11 billion, but may be closer to around $12 billion.
We want to do our very best project so we might see a little bit of expansion in our capital spending this year, but may be in the neighborhood of about $1 billion. When we talk about our debt reduction that will come primarily through some cash flow from operations, but also asset dispositions. We see the debt, taking it down into the low $20 billion levels.
It could be like at somewhere between $21 billion, $23 billion, somewhere in there. Debt and the cost of the debt is certainly very manageable. The debt ratios will be coming down closer to our 20% so somewhere in the low 20s. We think we've done all we need to do on debt reduction, don't need to do any more than that.
It doesn't have to go to $20 billion, but in the low 20 somewhere.

Our view is that the way we really need we will be looking at is collaboration. How can we work together? Not necessarily changing ownership or anything like that, but how can we collaborate to more efficiently execute our capital spending in the projects because many of us are doing these at the same time as you are aware? We can do this with respect to how we are gathering pipelines from the upstream part, how we can be working in terms of the liquefaction facilities, shipping, all of that.
But particularly at Gladstone how do we build the liquefaction facilities. And so we've had discussions with the other participants, other projects, and it's difficult, but on the other hand we know that this makes a lot of sense for all of us. It doesn't - so as to execute well with respect to capital spending and schedule. We know that Queensland and the federal government want to see collaboration and so we are very open to it.
It's difficult to do, but I think you are going to see collaboration, and we are quite willing to do this in a way that creates value for everyone, and it's not just the participants of the project, but also for the government as well. They also know that it has impact with respect to availability of labor and the contractor, so it's important to do this well, and so we are very open to collaboration.

And that's good to see in the marketplace, but I think it is good to see that the market is recovering some returns in the downstream, and we would expect that to occur with the strength in the economy.
Some rationalization of smaller, less sophisticated refineries will give us opportunities to move on our portfolio possibly a little sooner than what we said in our March analyst meeting. So that remains to be seen, but it's encouraging to see what's taking place, and then I think the last was doing on our $500 million cost reduction program that was outlined in the March analyst meeting.

Potentially that could be more, it could be a little less but we're really thinking about $10 billion. What is good about the 9% sale of Syncrude is, yes, we're quite pleased with the price but if you look at the metrics of assumptions going forward of oil prices and discount rates you already get to that number.
What is our objective? Our objective is to define the assets that aren't that strategic to our company that we can sell at a very favorable price that is tax efficient and to the extent we do that well, then we minimize the amount of assets that we need to sell and we can retain it in the portfolio and quite frankly, what we're trying to do is get the maximum for whatever we sell to minimize the impact in terms of our E&P portfolio. And obviously oil assets are more of interest than our natural gas assets.
And so to the extent that we do each asset disposition well, that takes off the pressure with respect to reaching the $10 billion program of what we ultimately need to be selling. But on the other hand, if you look back over the last several years, we haven't done too much in the way of dispositions and if you look at the size of our company and portfolio, we should be pruning and doing a couple billion dollars of asset dispositions every year by saying what no longer is that strategic, maybe a little bit more mature, that is more valuable to someone else. If its tax efficient, then we could sell it and redeploy the funds to upgrade the portfolio is something we should be doing every year.

I'm joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning, we'll be discussing the company's first quarter results and status on the strategic initiatives we shared at our March 24 Analyst Day.
The summary of key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. As in the past, you can find the presentation materials on the IR section on the ConocoPhillips website. And in addition to the presentation material, we plan to use our website to provide information that was part of our quarterly interim update prior to discontinuing its issuance earlier this year.
Please refer to our Safe Harbor statement in the Appendix of this presentation on Slide 17. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and Q&A. Our actual results may differ materially from what we present. And also in the Appendix are non-GAAP reconciliations footnoted throughout the presentation for your reference.
Moving to Slide 2, the summary of our results and highlights for the quarter. You'll see adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $2.2 billion or $1.47 a share, which excludes the charges of $110 million for ending our participation in the Yanbu and Shah projects. 
Cash from operations were $3 billion. Our company's capital efficiency increased, as annualized cash return on capital invested improved at 21%. Our E&P production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.83 million BOE per day. And in spite of the challenging downstream environment, the competitiveness of our refineries allowed us to run at 88%.
I'm going to now turn to Slide 3. Total earnings for our company were $2,098,000,000, up $1.3 billion compared to last year. The majority of our earnings were generated by our Exploration and Production business. Our E&P segment improved by $1,132,000,000, primarily due to the increase in crude prices. Compared to the first quarter of last year, R&M income fell $209 million. Weaker Refining and Marketing margins more than offset lower operating costs. Our equity earnings for LUKOIL Investment were up $379 million compared to the first quarter of 2009.
And as I mentioned earlier, this quarter, we had charges of $110 million for exiting the Shah and Yanbu projects. So adjusting for that, you can see this quarter's earnings were $2,208,000,000. Total company controllable costs were lower by about $40 million year-on-year and $110 million sequentially, and that's if you eliminate the impact of foreign exchange and higher utility and fuel costs.
Moving to Slide 4, total company cash flow. You can see in the first quarter, we generated $3 billion in cash from operations. This included a $979 million negative impact from an increase in working capital. This increase in working capital was driven by the growth and seasonal operational inventory levels and in support of our commercial business, consistent with what we've done in the past. We expect a substantial portion of this inventory to be worked off by year end.
Our capital program totaled $2,480,000,000 for the quarter, in line with our 2010 budget of $11.2 billion. And while debt-to-ratio remained flat, our absolute debt level increased slightly due to the increase in working capital I mentioned earlier. We paid $744 million in dividends compared to $696 million paid in the first quarter of 2009. Our first quarter 2010 cash position ended at $855 million.
Now let's review our total company production for the first quarter on Slide 5. As expected, the first quarter 2010 E&P production was 1.83 million BOE per day, down 5% or 97,000 BOE per day from the first quarter of 2009. Compared to last quarter, E&P production was virtually flat. 
Looking at the sources behind the year-over-year decline, 29,000 BOE per day can be attributed to market factors, including production sharing contracts in Indonesia and royalty impacts in Canada; portfolio changes, mainly due to the expropriation of our assets in Ecuador, decreased production by about 9,000 BOE per day; and higher planned maintenance, primarily in Australia, decreased our production by 3,000 BOE per day. The remaining decrease of 56,000 BOE per day was due to normal field decline, primarily in the U.K., Lower 48 and Alaska, mitigated by new production from Phase 2 of our Bohai Bay project in China and our Foster Creek and Christina Lake SAGD developments in Canada.
Production from FCCL oil properties increased nearly 50% on a net after-royalty basis in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009. The Foster Creek project achieved payout for royalty purposes in the first quarter. It's the industry's largest SAGD project to reach a payout today and is leading the way in implementing innovative technologies that lower operating costs and reduce our impact on the environment. 
In the Bakken shale, we spud three wells during March, bringing our total 2010 well count to six. Three of those wells were placed on production in March, with each having initial flow rates of approximately 2,000 BOE per day. As we gain experience in this area, drilling productivity continues to improve, which we hope to replicate as we increase investments in this region.
In the Eagle Ford play, we currently have three rigs drilling and have completed the drilling phase of four horizontal wells this year. The first of these wells were placed on production in late March and flowed at an initial rate of 3.8 million cubic feet of gas and 1,200 barrels a day of condensate. And this well and related industry results reinforced the potential of our 240,000 net acre position in the liquid-rich core of this play. 
Now turning to Page 6. Unadjusted E&P earnings for the first quarter were $1,832,000,000, up from $700 million last year. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed $1.5 billion of increased earnings. The increase was partially offset by $104 million due to the impact of lower sales volumes. And operating costs were $23 million higher, mainly due to the adverse effects of foreign exchange of about $50 million. Excluding the impact of FX, operating costs were down around $25 million to $30 million from a year ago.
The $219 million in other includes $83 million in costs associated with the Shah project exit, increased DD&A due to foreign exchange impacts and increase in export taxes related to our equity affiliates. As stated, when excluding the $83 million charge for the exit of Shah, adjusted earnings are $1,915,000,000. You can see the realized prices table at the bottom of Slide 6. On the right-hand side, you can see realized oil and NGL prices reflect the 78% increase compared to last year, and global gas prices increased by approximately 11%.
Both U.S. and international earnings improved significantly from the prior year and the Lower 48 business unit had solid earnings this year compared to a loss a year ago. Although North America natural gas prices remain challenged, our financial performance in the Lower 48 benefited from liquids, which represent more than a third of its production. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our unit metrics for E&P. You can see our E&P income per BOE was nearly three times higher in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the increase in realized prices. And although we currently lag the largest competitors in our industry on an income-per-BOE basis, we expect to close this gap as we allocate more of our capital to liquids production. Our E&P cash contribution per BOE has been consistently above average compared to our peer group for more than a year. And if prices continue to increase, we expect to outperform our peers on a cash flow per barrel basis due to our large OECD-focused portfolio.
The R&M segment discussion begins on Slide 8. Market conditions for R&M were challenging during the quarter and much weaker than the first quarter of 2009. However, we did benefit from wider light-heavy crude differentials, better margins on the production of feedstocks used by the chemical industry and improved clean product yields. 
We were able to increase our U.S. refinery utilization to 88% this quarter from 80% a year ago and 83% sequentially. The year-over-year earnings variance was driven primarily by lower global Refining and Marketing margins. Over 85% of the $213 million reduction in income is related to refining margins. In the U.S., distillate margins have dropped about 40% while internationally, distillate margins have fallen 30%.
Lower global volumes impacted earnings by $24 million. These volumes were primarily caused by Wilhelmshaven Refinery, which was shut down for the entire first quarter, as well as planned turnaround activity at both our joint venture refineries, MiRO in Germany and the Melaka Refinery in Malaysia. The $88 million improvement in operating costs was due primarily to lower turnaround activity and other operating costs. 
We remain focused on items we can control, including cost management and optimizing our operations. 11 of our 17 refineries are ranked in the top tier of the Solomon Operating Cost Peer Ranking, and this creates competitive cost advantages. $60 million in other was caused by foreign exchange impacts and includes a $25 million impairment resulting from our decision not to participate in the Yanbu refinery project. Adjusted earnings for R&M were $21 million for the quarter. Tables at the bottom of the slide provides U.S. and international earnings, as well as realized margins. 
Now let's move to Slide 9, which shows year-over-year variances for other segments.
Results in our Midstream segment were $77 million, $46 million lower this quarter compared to a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to an $88 million gain on shares issued by a subsidiary of DCP Midstream in the first quarter of 2009, partially offset by improved margins due to higher NGL prices this quarter. Our 50% share of CPChem generated $110 million this quarter, $87 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, due to higher ethylene and benzene margins. Finally, LUKOIL earnings were improved $379 million compared to the same quarter last year, partly as a result of the restatement due to lag reporting. 
As we disclosed on our Analyst Day, beginning in January of 2010, we've changed the method we use to determine our equity share of LUKOIL's earnings. Under this new method, the company records our equity share of LUKOIL's actual earnings on a one-quarter lag basis rather than using earnings estimate for the current quarter. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. 
Corporate expenses were $310 million after tax for the quarter compared to $259 million last year. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense and foreign currency losses. 
Turning to Page 10. Our return on capital employed and cash return on capital invested have improved each quarter since the beginning of 2009. This has been primarily driven by better earnings and cash flows resulting from higher commodity prices. So that completes my review of the first quarter 2010 earnings. What I'd like to do now is turn to an outlook comments on Slide 11 before asking Jim to give us a few of his comments, and then opening the phone for Q&A.
So first, I'd like to provide some guidance on operating expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. We'll begin with E&P. Over the next couple of quarters, production is expected to be lower. Areas that will contribute to the decreasing include North America natural gas, Western North Slope and Prudhoe Bay, due to seasonal maintenance and normal decline. We also have some planned shutdowns being conducted in Norway, with Ekofisk and Eldfisk being down between 22 and 26 days. In the U.K., Britannia and J-Block will be down between 10 and 20 days. And in Australia, Bayu-Undan and the Darwin LNG facility will be down close to a month.
As we said last quarter and during the Analyst Meeting, we're targeting 2010 production levels to be flat with 2008, normalizing for the impact of asset dispositions. New production is expected to partially offset these declines and will come from our ramp up of Canadian Oil Sands, Bohai Bay, Australia and North America liquids and Qatargas 3. 
Regarding refining, we expect increases in utilization rates, especially internationally, due to the restart of our Wilhelmshaven Refinery and the completion of turnarounds at both MiRO and Melaka. In the United States, capacity is expected to improve, given our expectations for higher refining margins. And as for the remainder of the year, we expect average quarterly turnaround costs of about $125 million pretax in line with previously-provided guidance.
We continue to take steps to control costs while ensuring the safety of our employees, integrity of our assets and conducting planned maintenance at all of our refineries. In 2009, we exceeded our cost reduction expectation target of 1.4 by reducing cost almost $2 billion. And in 2010, we plan to achieve our cost savings of $400 million.
At our March 24 Analyst Day, we provided details regarding our plans to enhance returns and outlined our asset disposition program. We recently announced an agreement to sell our Syncrude interest to Sinopec for $4,650,000,000 pretax. The 2009 production and reserves associated with our interest in Syncrude was 23,000 BOE per day and almost 250 million BOE in reserves. Our expectation for the after-tax proceeds are in excess of $4 billion. This is an early estimate and could possibly change on the completion of the final transaction.
The government approval process is underway in both Canada and China, and we anticipate closing in the third quarter. Data rooms for our North America asset disposition programs will be opened in the next couple of months. We've selected our financial adviser and expect closing for these packages to start in the second half of 2010. 
The buyer for our Conoco Flying J travel centers has been selected. We estimate after-tax proceeds to be approximately $350 million. We're still waiting for the Federal Trade Commission's approval and hope to close midyear. We've engaged with Citibank as the advisor of our interest in the REX pipeline. We have 25% interest in REX pipeline, and marketing efforts are expected to begin in the second quarter, with closing of the potential transaction expected by year-end 2010. 
We remained confident that we'll reach our $10 billion target for asset dispositions during 2011. Regarding the increase in shareholder distributions, in March, we announced a quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share, 10% increase over the previous rate. The dividend is payable June 1 to shareholders of record on May 24. And we started selling LUKOIL shares this month in small open-market transactions and commits purchasing ConocoPhillips shares simultaneously. These amounts and the amount of LUKOIL shares sold and the ConocoPhillips bought will be disclosed in the upcoming 10-Q. As stated at the Analyst meeting, we expect to complete the sale of our half of LUKOIL equity during 2011.
Moving to exploration, 2009 was a good year with discoveries at Browse Basin and the Gulf of Mexico Lower Tertiary Trend, as well as entries in the several new areas. While we are constraining capital in some parts of our business, spending in exploration has remained fairly consistent, which should strengthen our portfolio for future organic reserve replacement over time. 
In April, drilling and logging operations were completed on our Laurentian basin wildcat and a well that's subsequently plugged and abandoned. The cost of the well incurred through March 31 are included in our first quarter financial results as dry hole expense. A significant amount of data was collected and is being analyzed, and no decision has been made regarding any potential future activities in this area.
Kronos in the Browse Basin off Northwest Coast of Australia is still drilling toward its planned target depth. Given the extensive coring, testing and analysis that's planned for this well, we're unlikely to have significant updates regarding the overall prospect for several weeks. In general, most of ConocoPhillips significant exploration wells will begin during the second half of this year. Some will reach their objectives in the fourth quarter, while others will roll into 2011. 
For example, in the Gulf of Mexico, the Chevron-operated Coronado prospect will spud early in the third quarter, potentially conclude before year end. As mentioned at the Analyst Meeting, we expect that the Tiber appraisal well could also spud prior to year end. In the Caspian, current plans are to spud the Rockmore well in the third quarter and achieve TD by year end. And we expect Nursultan to follow sometime in the second half of 2011.
As for our Poland shale play, we expect to spud our initial well in the second quarter. And in China, coalbed methane, we continue to drill and analyze cost and the reservoir performance, with the results interpreted near the end of 2010 or early 2011. With regard to Eagle Ford, we are aggressively pursuing exploration and development opportunities based on the promising results we've encountered to date. 
Our APLNG project is moving forward as planned. APLNG reserves and resources are considered the best in the region and our upstream is making progress daily. Our target is to secure sales agreements to support two 4.5 million metric ton per annum trains. So that concludes my comments. And now I'll ask for Jim for a few closing statements before we open the call for your questions."

Clayton, thank you, and I appreciate all those who are participating in our conference call this morning. I thought it might be of help to spend a few moments to talk about some of the steps we're taking to create shareholder value. I'll refer to our March Analyst Meeting in New York. 
When you heard us, heard me, indicate that the opportunities set for profitable investments for the large international integrated majors has changed pretty dramatically in the last several years. As you know, resource access is an issue as is fiscal take in commercial terms. The question for our company is how do we create value for our shareholders in this type of environment, given the assets, the resources and the opportunities we already have in our existing portfolio? Our approach is not just to get bigger in upstream volumes, but to ensure that we have better than cost of capital returns and not do projects that are at this cost of capital or have limited upside potential.
And we think the way to create shareholder value for our company is for us to convert our extensive resources into proven reserves and to do this in competitive metrics. And while we will grow the absolute volumes in the latter period of our five- and 10-year period of time of strategic plans, we are stressing to annually increase the per share metrics of reserves and production as we go through this period of time. 
Creating value means more and more focus on improving the returns of the portfolio, strengthening the balance sheet, with significant increases in distributions to our shareholders in the form of annual increases in dividends and share repurchases. And we are executing on this plan, and we've seen support from our shareholders and the financial community. As Clayton said, we have reached agreement to sell our 9% in Syncrude. And that transaction, along with the others that we have totaled the market price that we intend to sell, will go a long way toward meeting our $10 billion disposition objective.
There was very difficult decisions for our company regarding participation in the Yanbu and Shah project what we believe the decisions that we made were consistent with the execution of our plan. Clayton also said, we have commenced sale of a portion of our LUKOIL shares. And simultaneously, we have started the purchase of ConocoPhillips shares. We're doing this in a rather modest amounts and doing this in an appropriate way. 
Capital spending is being constrained to doing our highest return projects while deferring some of the other projects that we maybe doing at a later point in time when we can improve the metrics associated with those opportunities. We expect to accomplish our debt and balance sheet objectives really by the end of this year. So things are going quite well in that regard. 
So those are the comments I would like to make. Clayton and I think it's probably the time now we open this up for questions from those participating in our conference call. Clayton?"

And so you talked about, you just mentioned debt and equity reduction is clearly being priorities. And it seems like the equity reduction component, share repurchases have already commenced. And so could you talk about how you plan to segment the two? Is debt reduction necessary more important than equity reduction? Or how you guys thinking about that more as a plan?"

We're quite pleased with the slow development of the economy around the world, and that can be helpful to our businesses. And we're executing on our plan. With respect to our investment opportunities, I would say that there's a likelihood that our capital program would be more than $11 billion, maybe closer to around $12 billion. We want to do our very best projects. So we might see a little bit of expansion in our capital spending this year, but maybe in the neighborhood of about $1 billion. When we talk about our debt reduction, that will come primarily through some cash flow from operations, but also asset dispositions. We see the debt taking it down, and to the whole $20 billion levels could be like somewhere between $21 billion, $23 billion, somewhere in there. That across the debt [ph] is certainly very manageable, debt ratios will be coming down closer toward 20%, so somewhere in the low-20s. We think we've done all we need to do on debt reduction, don't need to do anymore than that. It doesn't have to go to $20 billion, but below $20 billion, somewhere. So with the cash coming along, developing quite nicely and funding the capital opportunities in the company, we'd see annual increases in dividends. So we've already increased the dividend this year. So the additional cash flow will go towards share repurchase. That's really what the plans are."

And you just say, for market purposes, let's say that's around $5 billion. So as we sell our LUKOIL shares to the marketplace and we buy ConocoPhillips shares, there's $5 billion there. But Doug Terreson asked, he said, ""Well, it looks like there's going to be more free cash flow after you fund your capital spending program and your dividends, and you already get that deduction going towards share repurchase."" And for illustrative purposes, using consensus numbers, when we had our March analyst meeting, it showed that there's a neighborhood of about $12 billion and we said about $6 billion each year for share repurchase. That's kind of the plan. To the extent how that materializes a little bit more, a little bit less is going to depend upon not so much will meet our debt objectives and annual increases and dividends. It's going to be, ""Does the marketplace develop the commodity prices like we would expect?"" And so the flywheel then would be share repurchase."

What's good about the 9% stake in Syncrude is, yes, we are quite pleased with the price, but as you work the metrics of assumptions going forward oil prices and discount rates, you get to that number. What is our objective? Our objective is to find the assets that aren't that strategic to our company that we can sell at a very favorable price that's tax efficient. And to the extent we do that oil, then we'd minimize the amount of assets that we need to sell and we can retain it in the portfolio. And quite frankly, what we're trying to do is get the maximum for whatever we sell to minimize the impact in terms of our E&P portfolio. And obviously, oil assets are more of interest than our natural gas assets. And so to the extent that we do each asset disposition oil that takes off the pressure with respect to reaching the $10 billion program of what we ultimately need to be selling. But on the other hand, if you look back over the last several years, we haven't done too much in the way of dispositions. And if you look at the size of our company and portfolio, we should be pruning and doing a couple of billion dollars for asset dispositions every year by saying, ""What no longer is that strategic, maybe a little bit more mature, that is more valuable to someone else."" It's tax efficient, then we could sell it. And redeploy the funds to upgrade the portfolio is something that we should be doing every year."

I'm joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning, we'll be discussing the company's first quarter results and status on the strategic initiatives we shared at our March 24 Analyst Day.
The summary of key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. As in the past, you can find the presentation materials on the IR section on the ConocoPhillips website. And in addition to the presentation material, we plan to use our website to provide information that was part of our quarterly interim update prior to discontinuing its issuance earlier this year.
Please refer to our Safe Harbor statement in the Appendix of this presentation on Slide 17. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and Q&A. Our actual results may differ materially from what we present. And also in the Appendix are non-GAAP reconciliations footnoted throughout the presentation for your reference.
Moving to Slide 2, the summary of our results and highlights for the quarter. You'll see adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $2.2 billion or $1.47 a share, which excludes the charges of $110 million for ending our participation in the Yanbu and Shah projects. 
Cash from operations were $3 billion. Our company's capital efficiency increased, as annualized cash return on capital invested improved at 21%. Our E&P production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.83 million BOE per day. And in spite of the challenging downstream environment, the competitiveness of our refineries allowed us to run at 88%.
I'm going to now turn to Slide 3. Total earnings for our company were $2,098,000,000, up $1.3 billion compared to last year. The majority of our earnings were generated by our Exploration and Production business. Our E&P segment improved by $1,132,000,000, primarily due to the increase in crude prices. Compared to the first quarter of last year, R&M income fell $209 million. Weaker Refining and Marketing margins more than offset lower operating costs. Our equity earnings for LUKOIL Investment were up $379 million compared to the first quarter of 2009.
And as I mentioned earlier, this quarter, we had charges of $110 million for exiting the Shah and Yanbu projects. So adjusting for that, you can see this quarter's earnings were $2,208,000,000. Total company controllable costs were lower by about $40 million year-on-year and $110 million sequentially, and that's if you eliminate the impact of foreign exchange and higher utility and fuel costs.
Moving to Slide 4, total company cash flow. You can see in the first quarter, we generated $3 billion in cash from operations. This included a $979 million negative impact from an increase in working capital. This increase in working capital was driven by the growth and seasonal operational inventory levels and in support of our commercial business, consistent with what we've done in the past. We expect a substantial portion of this inventory to be worked off by year end.
Our capital program totaled $2,480,000,000 for the quarter, in line with our 2010 budget of $11.2 billion. And while debt-to-ratio remained flat, our absolute debt level increased slightly due to the increase in working capital I mentioned earlier. We paid $744 million in dividends compared to $696 million paid in the first quarter of 2009. Our first quarter 2010 cash position ended at $855 million.
Now let's review our total company production for the first quarter on Slide 5. As expected, the first quarter 2010 E&P production was 1.83 million BOE per day, down 5% or 97,000 BOE per day from the first quarter of 2009. Compared to last quarter, E&P production was virtually flat. 
Looking at the sources behind the year-over-year decline, 29,000 BOE per day can be attributed to market factors, including production sharing contracts in Indonesia and royalty impacts in Canada; portfolio changes, mainly due to the expropriation of our assets in Ecuador, decreased production by about 9,000 BOE per day; and higher planned maintenance, primarily in Australia, decreased our production by 3,000 BOE per day. The remaining decrease of 56,000 BOE per day was due to normal field decline, primarily in the U.K., Lower 48 and Alaska, mitigated by new production from Phase 2 of our Bohai Bay project in China and our Foster Creek and Christina Lake SAGD developments in Canada.
Production from FCCL oil properties increased nearly 50% on a net after-royalty basis in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009. The Foster Creek project achieved payout for royalty purposes in the first quarter. It's the industry's largest SAGD project to reach a payout today and is leading the way in implementing innovative technologies that lower operating costs and reduce our impact on the environment. 
In the Bakken shale, we spud three wells during March, bringing our total 2010 well count to six. Three of those wells were placed on production in March, with each having initial flow rates of approximately 2,000 BOE per day. As we gain experience in this area, drilling productivity continues to improve, which we hope to replicate as we increase investments in this region.
In the Eagle Ford play, we currently have three rigs drilling and have completed the drilling phase of four horizontal wells this year. The first of these wells were placed on production in late March and flowed at an initial rate of 3.8 million cubic feet of gas and 1,200 barrels a day of condensate. And this well and related industry results reinforced the potential of our 240,000 net acre position in the liquid-rich core of this play. 
Now turning to Page 6. Unadjusted E&P earnings for the first quarter were $1,832,000,000, up from $700 million last year. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed $1.5 billion of increased earnings. The increase was partially offset by $104 million due to the impact of lower sales volumes. And operating costs were $23 million higher, mainly due to the adverse effects of foreign exchange of about $50 million. Excluding the impact of FX, operating costs were down around $25 million to $30 million from a year ago.
The $219 million in other includes $83 million in costs associated with the Shah project exit, increased DD&A due to foreign exchange impacts and increase in export taxes related to our equity affiliates. As stated, when excluding the $83 million charge for the exit of Shah, adjusted earnings are $1,915,000,000. You can see the realized prices table at the bottom of Slide 6. On the right-hand side, you can see realized oil and NGL prices reflect the 78% increase compared to last year, and global gas prices increased by approximately 11%.
Both U.S. and international earnings improved significantly from the prior year and the Lower 48 business unit had solid earnings this year compared to a loss a year ago. Although North America natural gas prices remain challenged, our financial performance in the Lower 48 benefited from liquids, which represent more than a third of its production. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our unit metrics for E&P. You can see our E&P income per BOE was nearly three times higher in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the increase in realized prices. And although we currently lag the largest competitors in our industry on an income-per-BOE basis, we expect to close this gap as we allocate more of our capital to liquids production. Our E&P cash contribution per BOE has been consistently above average compared to our peer group for more than a year. And if prices continue to increase, we expect to outperform our peers on a cash flow per barrel basis due to our large OECD-focused portfolio.
The R&M segment discussion begins on Slide 8. Market conditions for R&M were challenging during the quarter and much weaker than the first quarter of 2009. However, we did benefit from wider light-heavy crude differentials, better margins on the production of feedstocks used by the chemical industry and improved clean product yields. 
We were able to increase our U.S. refinery utilization to 88% this quarter from 80% a year ago and 83% sequentially. The year-over-year earnings variance was driven primarily by lower global Refining and Marketing margins. Over 85% of the $213 million reduction in income is related to refining margins. In the U.S., distillate margins have dropped about 40% while internationally, distillate margins have fallen 30%.
Lower global volumes impacted earnings by $24 million. These volumes were primarily caused by Wilhelmshaven Refinery, which was shut down for the entire first quarter, as well as planned turnaround activity at both our joint venture refineries, MiRO in Germany and the Melaka Refinery in Malaysia. The $88 million improvement in operating costs was due primarily to lower turnaround activity and other operating costs. 
We remain focused on items we can control, including cost management and optimizing our operations. 11 of our 17 refineries are ranked in the top tier of the Solomon Operating Cost Peer Ranking, and this creates competitive cost advantages. $60 million in other was caused by foreign exchange impacts and includes a $25 million impairment resulting from our decision not to participate in the Yanbu refinery project. Adjusted earnings for R&M were $21 million for the quarter. Tables at the bottom of the slide provides U.S. and international earnings, as well as realized margins. 
Now let's move to Slide 9, which shows year-over-year variances for other segments.
Results in our Midstream segment were $77 million, $46 million lower this quarter compared to a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to an $88 million gain on shares issued by a subsidiary of DCP Midstream in the first quarter of 2009, partially offset by improved margins due to higher NGL prices this quarter. Our 50% share of CPChem generated $110 million this quarter, $87 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, due to higher ethylene and benzene margins. Finally, LUKOIL earnings were improved $379 million compared to the same quarter last year, partly as a result of the restatement due to lag reporting. 
As we disclosed on our Analyst Day, beginning in January of 2010, we've changed the method we use to determine our equity share of LUKOIL's earnings. Under this new method, the company records our equity share of LUKOIL's actual earnings on a one-quarter lag basis rather than using earnings estimate for the current quarter. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. 
Corporate expenses were $310 million after tax for the quarter compared to $259 million last year. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense and foreign currency losses. 
Turning to Page 10. Our return on capital employed and cash return on capital invested have improved each quarter since the beginning of 2009. This has been primarily driven by better earnings and cash flows resulting from higher commodity prices. So that completes my review of the first quarter 2010 earnings. What I'd like to do now is turn to an outlook comments on Slide 11 before asking Jim to give us a few of his comments, and then opening the phone for Q&A.
So first, I'd like to provide some guidance on operating expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. We'll begin with E&P. Over the next couple of quarters, production is expected to be lower. Areas that will contribute to the decreasing include North America natural gas, Western North Slope and Prudhoe Bay, due to seasonal maintenance and normal decline. We also have some planned shutdowns being conducted in Norway, with Ekofisk and Eldfisk being down between 22 and 26 days. In the U.K., Britannia and J-Block will be down between 10 and 20 days. And in Australia, Bayu-Undan and the Darwin LNG facility will be down close to a month.
As we said last quarter and during the Analyst Meeting, we're targeting 2010 production levels to be flat with 2008, normalizing for the impact of asset dispositions. New production is expected to partially offset these declines and will come from our ramp up of Canadian Oil Sands, Bohai Bay, Australia and North America liquids and Qatargas 3. 
Regarding refining, we expect increases in utilization rates, especially internationally, due to the restart of our Wilhelmshaven Refinery and the completion of turnarounds at both MiRO and Melaka. In the United States, capacity is expected to improve, given our expectations for higher refining margins. And as for the remainder of the year, we expect average quarterly turnaround costs of about $125 million pretax in line with previously-provided guidance.
We continue to take steps to control costs while ensuring the safety of our employees, integrity of our assets and conducting planned maintenance at all of our refineries. In 2009, we exceeded our cost reduction expectation target of 1.4 by reducing cost almost $2 billion. And in 2010, we plan to achieve our cost savings of $400 million.
At our March 24 Analyst Day, we provided details regarding our plans to enhance returns and outlined our asset disposition program. We recently announced an agreement to sell our Syncrude interest to Sinopec for $4,650,000,000 pretax. The 2009 production and reserves associated with our interest in Syncrude was 23,000 BOE per day and almost 250 million BOE in reserves. Our expectation for the after-tax proceeds are in excess of $4 billion. This is an early estimate and could possibly change on the completion of the final transaction.
The government approval process is underway in both Canada and China, and we anticipate closing in the third quarter. Data rooms for our North America asset disposition programs will be opened in the next couple of months. We've selected our financial adviser and expect closing for these packages to start in the second half of 2010. 
The buyer for our Conoco Flying J travel centers has been selected. We estimate after-tax proceeds to be approximately $350 million. We're still waiting for the Federal Trade Commission's approval and hope to close midyear. We've engaged with Citibank as the advisor of our interest in the REX pipeline. We have 25% interest in REX pipeline, and marketing efforts are expected to begin in the second quarter, with closing of the potential transaction expected by year-end 2010. 
We remained confident that we'll reach our $10 billion target for asset dispositions during 2011. Regarding the increase in shareholder distributions, in March, we announced a quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share, 10% increase over the previous rate. The dividend is payable June 1 to shareholders of record on May 24. And we started selling LUKOIL shares this month in small open-market transactions and commits purchasing ConocoPhillips shares simultaneously. These amounts and the amount of LUKOIL shares sold and the ConocoPhillips bought will be disclosed in the upcoming 10-Q. As stated at the Analyst meeting, we expect to complete the sale of our half of LUKOIL equity during 2011.
Moving to exploration, 2009 was a good year with discoveries at Browse Basin and the Gulf of Mexico Lower Tertiary Trend, as well as entries in the several new areas. While we are constraining capital in some parts of our business, spending in exploration has remained fairly consistent, which should strengthen our portfolio for future organic reserve replacement over time. 
In April, drilling and logging operations were completed on our Laurentian basin wildcat and a well that's subsequently plugged and abandoned. The cost of the well incurred through March 31 are included in our first quarter financial results as dry hole expense. A significant amount of data was collected and is being analyzed, and no decision has been made regarding any potential future activities in this area.
Kronos in the Browse Basin off Northwest Coast of Australia is still drilling toward its planned target depth. Given the extensive coring, testing and analysis that's planned for this well, we're unlikely to have significant updates regarding the overall prospect for several weeks. In general, most of ConocoPhillips significant exploration wells will begin during the second half of this year. Some will reach their objectives in the fourth quarter, while others will roll into 2011. 
For example, in the Gulf of Mexico, the Chevron-operated Coronado prospect will spud early in the third quarter, potentially conclude before year end. As mentioned at the Analyst Meeting, we expect that the Tiber appraisal well could also spud prior to year end. In the Caspian, current plans are to spud the Rockmore well in the third quarter and achieve TD by year end. And we expect Nursultan to follow sometime in the second half of 2011.
As for our Poland shale play, we expect to spud our initial well in the second quarter. And in China, coalbed methane, we continue to drill and analyze cost and the reservoir performance, with the results interpreted near the end of 2010 or early 2011. With regard to Eagle Ford, we are aggressively pursuing exploration and development opportunities based on the promising results we've encountered to date. 
Our APLNG project is moving forward as planned. APLNG reserves and resources are considered the best in the region and our upstream is making progress daily. Our target is to secure sales agreements to support two 4.5 million metric ton per annum trains. So that concludes my comments. And now I'll ask for Jim for a few closing statements before we open the call for your questions."

Clayton, thank you, and I appreciate all those who are participating in our conference call this morning. I thought it might be of help to spend a few moments to talk about some of the steps we're taking to create shareholder value. I'll refer to our March Analyst Meeting in New York. 
When you heard us, heard me, indicate that the opportunities set for profitable investments for the large international integrated majors has changed pretty dramatically in the last several years. As you know, resource access is an issue as is fiscal take in commercial terms. The question for our company is how do we create value for our shareholders in this type of environment, given the assets, the resources and the opportunities we already have in our existing portfolio? Our approach is not just to get bigger in upstream volumes, but to ensure that we have better than cost of capital returns and not do projects that are at this cost of capital or have limited upside potential.
And we think the way to create shareholder value for our company is for us to convert our extensive resources into proven reserves and to do this in competitive metrics. And while we will grow the absolute volumes in the latter period of our five- and 10-year period of time of strategic plans, we are stressing to annually increase the per share metrics of reserves and production as we go through this period of time. 
Creating value means more and more focus on improving the returns of the portfolio, strengthening the balance sheet, with significant increases in distributions to our shareholders in the form of annual increases in dividends and share repurchases. And we are executing on this plan, and we've seen support from our shareholders and the financial community. As Clayton said, we have reached agreement to sell our 9% in Syncrude. And that transaction, along with the others that we have totaled the market price that we intend to sell, will go a long way toward meeting our $10 billion disposition objective.
There was very difficult decisions for our company regarding participation in the Yanbu and Shah project what we believe the decisions that we made were consistent with the execution of our plan. Clayton also said, we have commenced sale of a portion of our LUKOIL shares. And simultaneously, we have started the purchase of ConocoPhillips shares. We're doing this in a rather modest amounts and doing this in an appropriate way. 
Capital spending is being constrained to doing our highest return projects while deferring some of the other projects that we maybe doing at a later point in time when we can improve the metrics associated with those opportunities. We expect to accomplish our debt and balance sheet objectives really by the end of this year. So things are going quite well in that regard. 
So those are the comments I would like to make. Clayton and I think it's probably the time now we open this up for questions from those participating in our conference call. Clayton?"

We want to do our very best projects. So we might see a little bit of expansion in our capital spending this year, but maybe in the neighborhood of about $1 billion. When we talk about our debt reduction, that will come primarily through some cash flow from operations, but also asset dispositions. We see the debt taking it down, and to the whole $20 billion levels could be like somewhere between $21 billion, $23 billion, somewhere in there. That across the debt [ph] is certainly very manageable, debt ratios will be coming down closer toward 20%, so somewhere in the low-20s. We think we've done all we need to do on debt reduction, don't need to do anymore than that. It doesn't have to go to $20 billion, but below $20 billion, somewhere. So with the cash coming along, developing quite nicely and funding the capital opportunities in the company, we'd see annual increases in dividends. So we've already increased the dividend this year. So the additional cash flow will go towards share repurchase. That's really what the plans are."

Not necessarily change in ownership or anything like that, but how can we collaborate to more efficiently execute our capital spending and the projects as many of us are doing these at the same time as you're aware. We can do this with respect to how we are gathering pipelines from the upstream part, how we can be working in terms of the liquefaction facilities, shipping all of that. But particularly at Gladstone, how do we build the liquefaction facilities. And so we've had discussions with  the other participants, other projects, and it's difficult.

We know that Queensland and the Federal government want to see a collaboration, and so we're very open to it. It's difficult to do, but I think you're going to see collaboration. And we're quite willing to do this in a way that creates value for everyone. It's not just the participants in the project but also for the government as well.

And really, the decisions for the companies to participate in the open season for the two competing projects will be made by our company as we go through the next several months.

But I think it is good to see that the market is recovering some returns in the downstream. And we would expect that to occur with the strength in the economy.

And to the extent we do that oil, then we'd minimize the amount of assets that we need to sell and we can retain it in the portfolio. And quite frankly, what we're trying to do is get the maximum for whatever we sell to minimize the impact in terms of our E&P portfolio. And obviously, oil assets are more of interest than our natural gas assets. And so to the extent that we do each asset disposition oil that takes off the pressure with respect to reaching the $10 billion program of what we ultimately need to be selling. But on the other hand, if you look back over the last several years, we haven't done too much in the way of dispositions.

I'm joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning, we'll be discussing the company's first quarter results and status on the strategic initiatives we shared at our March 24 Analyst Day.
The summary of key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. As in the past, you can find the presentation materials on the IR section on the ConocoPhillips website. And in addition to the presentation material, we plan to use our website to provide information that was part of our quarterly interim update prior to discontinuing its issuance earlier this year.
Please refer to our Safe Harbor statement in the Appendix of this presentation on Slide 17. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and Q&A. Our actual results may differ materially from what we present. And also in the Appendix are non-GAAP reconciliations footnoted throughout the presentation for your reference.
Moving to Slide 2, the summary of our results and highlights for the quarter. You'll see adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $2.2 billion or $1.47 a share, which excludes the charges of $110 million for ending our participation in the Yanbu and Shah projects. 
Cash from operations were $3 billion. Our company's capital efficiency increased, as annualized cash return on capital invested improved at 21%. Our E&P production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.83 million BOE per day. And in spite of the challenging downstream environment, the competitiveness of our refineries allowed us to run at 88%.
I'm going to now turn to Slide 3. Total earnings for our company were $2,098,000,000, up $1.3 billion compared to last year. The majority of our earnings were generated by our Exploration and Production business. Our E&P segment improved by $1,132,000,000, primarily due to the increase in crude prices. Compared to the first quarter of last year, R&M income fell $209 million. Weaker Refining and Marketing margins more than offset lower operating costs. Our equity earnings for LUKOIL Investment were up $379 million compared to the first quarter of 2009.
And as I mentioned earlier, this quarter, we had charges of $110 million for exiting the Shah and Yanbu projects. So adjusting for that, you can see this quarter's earnings were $2,208,000,000. Total company controllable costs were lower by about $40 million year-on-year and $110 million sequentially, and that's if you eliminate the impact of foreign exchange and higher utility and fuel costs.
Moving to Slide 4, total company cash flow. You can see in the first quarter, we generated $3 billion in cash from operations. This included a $979 million negative impact from an increase in working capital. This increase in working capital was driven by the growth and seasonal operational inventory levels and in support of our commercial business, consistent with what we've done in the past. We expect a substantial portion of this inventory to be worked off by year end.
Our capital program totaled $2,480,000,000 for the quarter, in line with our 2010 budget of $11.2 billion. And while debt-to-ratio remained flat, our absolute debt level increased slightly due to the increase in working capital I mentioned earlier. We paid $744 million in dividends compared to $696 million paid in the first quarter of 2009. Our first quarter 2010 cash position ended at $855 million.
Now let's review our total company production for the first quarter on Slide 5. As expected, the first quarter 2010 E&P production was 1.83 million BOE per day, down 5% or 97,000 BOE per day from the first quarter of 2009. Compared to last quarter, E&P production was virtually flat. 
Looking at the sources behind the year-over-year decline, 29,000 BOE per day can be attributed to market factors, including production sharing contracts in Indonesia and royalty impacts in Canada; portfolio changes, mainly due to the expropriation of our assets in Ecuador, decreased production by about 9,000 BOE per day; and higher planned maintenance, primarily in Australia, decreased our production by 3,000 BOE per day. The remaining decrease of 56,000 BOE per day was due to normal field decline, primarily in the U.K., Lower 48 and Alaska, mitigated by new production from Phase 2 of our Bohai Bay project in China and our Foster Creek and Christina Lake SAGD developments in Canada.
Production from FCCL oil properties increased nearly 50% on a net after-royalty basis in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009. The Foster Creek project achieved payout for royalty purposes in the first quarter. It's the industry's largest SAGD project to reach a payout today and is leading the way in implementing innovative technologies that lower operating costs and reduce our impact on the environment. 
In the Bakken shale, we spud three wells during March, bringing our total 2010 well count to six. Three of those wells were placed on production in March, with each having initial flow rates of approximately 2,000 BOE per day. As we gain experience in this area, drilling productivity continues to improve, which we hope to replicate as we increase investments in this region.
In the Eagle Ford play, we currently have three rigs drilling and have completed the drilling phase of four horizontal wells this year. The first of these wells were placed on production in late March and flowed at an initial rate of 3.8 million cubic feet of gas and 1,200 barrels a day of condensate. And this well and related industry results reinforced the potential of our 240,000 net acre position in the liquid-rich core of this play. 
Now turning to Page 6. Unadjusted E&P earnings for the first quarter were $1,832,000,000, up from $700 million last year. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed $1.5 billion of increased earnings. The increase was partially offset by $104 million due to the impact of lower sales volumes. And operating costs were $23 million higher, mainly due to the adverse effects of foreign exchange of about $50 million. Excluding the impact of FX, operating costs were down around $25 million to $30 million from a year ago.
The $219 million in other includes $83 million in costs associated with the Shah project exit, increased DD&A due to foreign exchange impacts and increase in export taxes related to our equity affiliates. As stated, when excluding the $83 million charge for the exit of Shah, adjusted earnings are $1,915,000,000. You can see the realized prices table at the bottom of Slide 6. On the right-hand side, you can see realized oil and NGL prices reflect the 78% increase compared to last year, and global gas prices increased by approximately 11%.
Both U.S. and international earnings improved significantly from the prior year and the Lower 48 business unit had solid earnings this year compared to a loss a year ago. Although North America natural gas prices remain challenged, our financial performance in the Lower 48 benefited from liquids, which represent more than a third of its production. 
Moving on to Slide 7, our unit metrics for E&P. You can see our E&P income per BOE was nearly three times higher in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the increase in realized prices. And although we currently lag the largest competitors in our industry on an income-per-BOE basis, we expect to close this gap as we allocate more of our capital to liquids production. Our E&P cash contribution per BOE has been consistently above average compared to our peer group for more than a year. And if prices continue to increase, we expect to outperform our peers on a cash flow per barrel basis due to our large OECD-focused portfolio.
The R&M segment discussion begins on Slide 8. Market conditions for R&M were challenging during the quarter and much weaker than the first quarter of 2009. However, we did benefit from wider light-heavy crude differentials, better margins on the production of feedstocks used by the chemical industry and improved clean product yields. 
We were able to increase our U.S. refinery utilization to 88% this quarter from 80% a year ago and 83% sequentially. The year-over-year earnings variance was driven primarily by lower global Refining and Marketing margins. Over 85% of the $213 million reduction in income is related to refining margins. In the U.S., distillate margins have dropped about 40% while internationally, distillate margins have fallen 30%.
Lower global volumes impacted earnings by $24 million. These volumes were primarily caused by Wilhelmshaven Refinery, which was shut down for the entire first quarter, as well as planned turnaround activity at both our joint venture refineries, MiRO in Germany and the Melaka Refinery in Malaysia. The $88 million improvement in operating costs was due primarily to lower turnaround activity and other operating costs. 
We remain focused on items we can control, including cost management and optimizing our operations. 11 of our 17 refineries are ranked in the top tier of the Solomon Operating Cost Peer Ranking, and this creates competitive cost advantages. $60 million in other was caused by foreign exchange impacts and includes a $25 million impairment resulting from our decision not to participate in the Yanbu refinery project. Adjusted earnings for R&M were $21 million for the quarter. Tables at the bottom of the slide provides U.S. and international earnings, as well as realized margins. 
Now let's move to Slide 9, which shows year-over-year variances for other segments.
Results in our Midstream segment were $77 million, $46 million lower this quarter compared to a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to an $88 million gain on shares issued by a subsidiary of DCP Midstream in the first quarter of 2009, partially offset by improved margins due to higher NGL prices this quarter. Our 50% share of CPChem generated $110 million this quarter, $87 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, due to higher ethylene and benzene margins. Finally, LUKOIL earnings were improved $379 million compared to the same quarter last year, partly as a result of the restatement due to lag reporting. 
As we disclosed on our Analyst Day, beginning in January of 2010, we've changed the method we use to determine our equity share of LUKOIL's earnings. Under this new method, the company records our equity share of LUKOIL's actual earnings on a one-quarter lag basis rather than using earnings estimate for the current quarter. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. 
Corporate expenses were $310 million after tax for the quarter compared to $259 million last year. The increase is primarily due to increased interest expense and foreign currency losses. 
Turning to Page 10. Our return on capital employed and cash return on capital invested have improved each quarter since the beginning of 2009. This has been primarily driven by better earnings and cash flows resulting from higher commodity prices. 
So that completes my review of the first quarter 2010 earnings. What I'd like to do now is turn to an outlook comments on Slide 11 before asking Jim to give us a few of his comments, and then opening the phone for Q&A.
So first, I'd like to provide some guidance on operating expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. We'll begin with E&P. Over the next couple of quarters, production is expected to be lower. Areas that will contribute to the decreasing include North America natural gas, Western North Slope and Prudhoe Bay due to seasonal maintenance and normal decline. We also have some planned shutdowns being conducted in Norway, with Ekofisk and Eldfisk being down between 22 and 26 days. In the U.K., Britannia and J-Block will be down between 10 and 20 days. And in Australia, Bayu-Undan and the Darwin LNG facility will be down close to a month.
As we said last quarter and during the Analyst Meeting, we're targeting 2010 production levels to be flat with 2008, normalizing for the impact of asset dispositions. New production is expected to partially offset these declines and will come from our ramp up of Canadian Oil Sands, Bohai Bay, Australia, North America liquids and Qatargas 3. 
Regarding refining, we expect increases in utilization rates, especially internationally, due to the restart of our Wilhelmshaven Refinery and the completion of turnarounds at both MiRO and Melaka. In the United States, capacity is expected to improve, given our expectations for higher refining margins. And as for the remainder of the year, we expect average quarterly turnaround costs of about $125 million pretax in line with previously provided guidance.
We continue to take steps to control costs while ensuring the safety of our employees, integrity of our assets and conducting planned maintenance at all of our refineries. In 2009, we exceeded our cost reduction expectation target of 1.4 by reducing cost almost $2 billion. And in 2010, we plan to achieve our cost savings of $400 million.
At our March 24 Analyst Day, we provided details regarding our plans to enhance returns and outlined our asset disposition program. We recently announced an agreement to sell our Syncrude interest to Sinopec for $4,650,000,000 pretax. The 2009 production and reserves associated with our interest in Syncrude was 23,000 BOE per day and almost 250 million BOE in reserves. Our expectation for the after-tax proceeds are in excess of $4 billion. This is an early estimate and could possibly change on the completion of the final transaction.
The government approval process is underway in both Canada and China, and we anticipate closing in the third quarter. Data rooms for our North America asset disposition programs will be opened in the next couple of months. We've selected our financial advisers and expect closing for these packages to start in the second half of 2010. 
The buyer for our Conoco Flying J travel centers has been selected. We estimate after-tax proceeds to be approximately $350 million. We're still waiting for the Federal Trade Commission's approval and hope to close midyear. We've engaged Citibank as the advisor of our interest in the REX pipeline. We have 25% interest in REX pipeline, and marketing efforts are expected to begin in the second quarter, with closing of the potential transaction expected by year end 2010. 
We remained confident that we'll reach our $10 billion target for asset dispositions during 2011. Regarding the increase in shareholder distributions, in March, we announced a quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share, 10% increase over the previous rate. The dividend's payable June 1 to shareholders of record on May 24. And we started selling LUKOIL shares this month in small open-market transactions and commence purchasing ConocoPhillips shares simultaneously. These amounts and the amount of LUKOIL shares sold and the ConocoPhillips bought will be disclosed in the upcoming 10-Q. As stated at the Analyst meeting, we expect to complete the sale of our half of LUKOIL equity during 2011.
Moving to exploration, 2009 was a good year with discoveries at Browse Basin and the Gulf of Mexico Lower Tertiary Trend, as well as entries into several new areas.While we are constraining capital in some parts of our business, spending in exploration has remained fairly consistent, which should strengthen our portfolio for future organic reserve replacement over time. 
In April, drilling and logging operations were completed on our Laurentian basin wildcat and a well that's subsequently plugged and abandoned. The cost of the well incurred through March 31 are included in our first quarter financial results as dry hole expense. A significant amount of data was collected and is being analyzed, and no decision has been made regarding any potential future activities in this area.
Kronos in the Browse Basin off Northwest Coast of Australia is still drilling toward its planned target depth. Given the extensive coring, testing and analysis that's planned for this well, we're unlikely to have significant updates regarding the overall prospect for several weeks. In general, most of ConocoPhillips significant exploration wells will begin during the second half of this year. Some will reach their objectives in the fourth quarter, while others will roll into 2011. 
For example, in the Gulf of Mexico, the Chevron-operated Coronado prospect will spud early in the third quarter, potentially conclude before year end. As mentioned at the Analyst Meeting, we expect that the Tiber appraisal well could also spud prior to year end. In the Caspian, current plans are to spud the Rockmore well in the third quarter and achieve TD by year end. And we expect Nursultan to follow sometime in the second half of 2011.
As for our Poland shale play, we expect to spud our initial well in the second quarter. And in China, coalbed methane, we continue to drill and analyze cost and the reservoir performance, with the results interpreted near the end of 2010 or early 2011. With regard to Eagle Ford, we are aggressively pursuing exploration and development opportunities based on the promising results we've encountered to date. 
Our APLNG project is moving forward as planned. APLNG reserves and resources are considered the best in the region and our upstream is making progress daily. Our target is to secure sales agreements to support two 4.5 million metric ton per annum trains. So that concludes my comments. And now I'll ask for Jim for a few closing statements before we open the call for your questions."

Clayton, thank you, and I appreciate all those who are participating in our conference call this morning. I thought it might be of help to spend a few moments to talk about some of the steps we're taking to create shareholder value. I'll refer to our March Analyst Meeting in New York. 
When you heard us, heard me indicate that the opportunities set for profitable investments for the large international integrated majors has changed pretty dramatically in the last several years. As you know, resource access is an issue as is fiscal take in commercial terms. The question for our company is how do we create value for our shareholders in this type of environment given the assets, the resources and the opportunities we already have in our existing portfolio? Our approach is not just to get bigger in upstream volumes, but to ensure that we have better than cost of capital returns and not do projects that are at this cost of capital or have limited upside potential.
And we think the way to create shareholder value for our company is for us to convert our extensive resources into proven reserves and to do this in competitive metrics. And while we will grow the absolute volumes in the latter period of our five- and 10-year period of time of strategic plans, we are stressing to annually increase the per share metrics of reserves and production as we go through this period of time. 
Creating value means more and more focus on improving the returns of the portfolio, strengthening the balance sheet, with significant increases in distributions to our shareholders in the form of annual increases in dividends and share repurchases. And we are executing on this plan, and we've seen support from our shareholders and the financial community. As Clayton said, we have reached agreement to sell our 9% in Syncrude. And that transaction, along with the others that we have totaled the market price that we intend to sell, will go a long way toward meeting our $10 billion disposition objective.
There was very difficult decisions for our company regarding participation in the Yanbu and Shah project what we believe the decisions that we made were consistent with the execution of our plan. Clayton also said, we have commenced sale of a portion of our LUKOIL shares. And simultaneously, we have started the purchase of ConocoPhillips shares. We're doing this in a rather modest amounts and doing this in an appropriate way. 
Capital spending is being constrained to doing our highest return projects while deferring some of the other projects that we maybe doing at a later point in time when we can improve the metrics associated with those opportunities. We expect to accomplish our debt and balance sheet objectives really by the end of this year. So things are going quite well in that regard. 
So those are the comments I would like to make. Clayton and I think it's probably the time now we open this up for questions from those participating in our conference call. Clayton?"

And so you talked about, you just mentioned debt and equity reduction is clearly being priorities. And it seems like the equity reduction component, share repurchases have already commenced. And so could you talk about how you plan to segment the two? Is debt reduction necessary more important than equity reduction? Or how you guys thinking about that more as a plan?"

We're quite pleased with the slow development of the economy around the world, and that can be helpful to our businesses. And we're executing on our plan. With respect to our investment opportunities, I would say that there's a likelihood that our capital program would be more than $11 billion, maybe closer to around $12 billion. We want to do our very best projects. So we might see a little bit of expansion in our capital spending this year, but maybe in the neighborhood of about $1 billion. When we talk about our debt reduction, that will come primarily through some cash flow from operations, but also asset dispositions. We see the debt taking it down, and to the whole $20 billion levels could be like somewhere between $21 billion, $23 billion, somewhere in there. That across the debt [ph] is certainly very manageable, debt ratios will be coming down closer toward 20%, so somewhere in the low-20s. We think we've done all we need to do on debt reduction, don't need to do anymore than that. It doesn't have to go to $20 billion, but below $20 billion, somewhere. So with the cash coming along, developing quite nicely and funding the capital opportunities in the company, we'd see annual increases in dividends. So we've already increased the dividend this year. So the additional cash flow will go towards share repurchase. That's really what the plans are."

The three or four projects in Queensland will obviously -- they're different kinds of projects in terms of participation by the many different companies. Our view is that the way we really need to be looking at is collaboration. How can we work together? Not necessarily change in ownership or anything like that, but how can we collaborate to more efficiently execute our capital spending and the projects as many of us are doing these at the same time as you're aware. We can do this with respect to how we are gathering pipelines from the upstream part, how we can be working in terms of the liquefaction facilities, shipping all of that. But particularly at Gladstone, how do we build the liquefaction facilities. And so we've had discussions with  the other participants, other projects, and it's difficult. But on the other hand, we know that this makes a lot of sense for all of us so as to execute well with respect to capital spending and schedule. We know that Queensland and the Federal government want to see a collaboration, and so we're very open to it. It's difficult to do, but I think you're going to see collaboration. And we're quite willing to do this in a way that creates value for everyone. It's not just the participants in the project but also for the government as well. And they also know that it has impact with respect to availability of labor and the contractors. So it's important to do this well, and so we're very open to collaboration."

As you know, Mark, people can say cost of capital, technically, if you look at cost of debt whenever is in single digits, then you can look at what you must provide and have provided to your shareholders and you get into double digits, so that's what is the cost to capital. Very different kinds of projects have different risks associated with them. And even though the numbers maybe work -- one works a little bit higher than the other, they have a different risk/reward profile. So I think it's really, for many different reasons not appropriate for us to get too involved into how we analyze the projects and which one might have been ahead of the other. The important thing is, is that we work this very, very hard for several years with both ADNOC and with Saudi Aramco. We did this always with the best of intentions. And we just felt that given the direction of our company, it's important for us, these decisions are consistent with emphasizing our returns over growth."

What's good about the 9% stake in Syncrude is, yes, we are quite pleased with the price, but as you work the metrics of assumptions going forward oil prices and discount rates, you get to that number. What is our objective? Our objective is to find the assets that aren't that strategic to our company that we can sell at a very favorable price that's tax efficient. And to the extent we do that oil, then we'd minimize the amount of assets that we need to sell and we can retain it in the portfolio. And quite frankly, what we're trying to do is get the maximum for whatever we sell to minimize the impact in terms of our E&P portfolio. And obviously, oil assets are more of interest than our natural gas assets. And so to the extent that we do each asset disposition oil that takes off the pressure with respect to reaching the $10 billion program of what we ultimately need to be selling. But on the other hand, if you look back over the last several years, we haven't done too much in the way of dispositions. And if you look at the size of our company and portfolio, we should be pruning and doing a couple of billion dollars for asset dispositions every year by saying, ""What no longer is that strategic, maybe a little bit more mature, that is more valuable to someone else.""

Joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning, we’ll be discussing the company's second quarter results and also provide an update on the status of our returns enhancement plans that we had announced earlier this year. The summary of key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. 
As in the past, you'll find our presentation materials on the IR section of the ConocoPhillips website, but before we get started, I'd like you to refer to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2 of the presentation. It’s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the Q&A, and actual results may differ materially from what is presented today. Factors that could cause these actual results to differ are included in our filings with the SEC. 
Please move to Slide 3, which is a summary of our key second quarter results and highlights. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $2.5 billion or $1.67 per share. Cash from operations was $3.5 billion. Capital efficiency increased as annualized cash returns on capital invested improved to 22%. Our E&P production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.73 million BOE per day. 
The competitiveness of our refineries allowed us to achieve U.S. refinery utilization rate of 96%, and excluding Wilhelmshaven, the international rate would have been 88%. We completed $5.8 billion in asset sales, primarily the Syncrude and CFJ asset. And debt was reduced by $2.7 billion in the second quarter, with an additional $2.7 billion reduction planned next month. 
Turning to Slide 4, you can see that total adjusted earnings for the company were $2.5 billion, up $1.5 billion compared to last year. The majority of these earnings were generated by our E&P and R&M businesses. Our E&P segment improved by almost $750 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by lower volumes. And compared to the second quarter of last year, R&M adjusted earnings increased by over $700 million, mainly due to improved global Refining and Marketing margins. The amount in the Other column reflects an increase in corporate costs, partially offset by improvements in Chemicals and Midstream earnings. 
Moving to Slide 5, total cash flow. We generated $3.5 billion in cash from operations and $5.8 billion in cash proceeds from asset sales, primarily from Syncrude and CFJ sales. We repaid $2.7 billion in debt, funded a capital program of $2.2 billion, paid approximately $800 million in dividends and repurchased $390 million of ConocoPhillips common stock. At the end of the quarter, we had a cash balance of $4.1 billion, $2.7 billion of which will be used to pay down debt in the third quarter. 
Now let's review our upstream production for the second quarter on Slide 6. You can see that production was 1.73 million BOE per day, down 7% from the second quarter of last year. Looking at the chart, you can see that 23,000 BOE per day of the reduction is attributable to market factors, including PSE impacts due to higher prices. And moving to the right, roughly 12,000 BOE a day stems from the expropriation of our assets in Ecuador and asset sales in Canada and the Lower 48. 
We produced 50,000 BOE per day less this quarter compared to previous year's quarter from planned maintenance in Norway, Australia and the Lower 48. In Norway, this reflects our routine three-year or once every three-year turnaround in the Greater Ekofisk and Eldfisk area and that had an impact of about 35,000 BOE per day. 
What happened in Australia, we had a full field shutdown at the Bayu-Undan field and the Darwin LNG plant and that impacted production 23,000 BOE per day. The remainder of the planned downtime was 7,000 BOE per day coming from the Lower 48. The 54,000 BOE per day bar shown above operations is largely normal field decline offset by new production. The majority of the decline came from 87,000 BOE per day in North America, and the remaining 38,000 BOE per day came from Norway and the U.K. Offsetting that, we had 75,000 BOE per day of new production from China, Canada and Indonesia. 
So now I'd like to turn to Slide 7, E&P adjusted earnings, which were $1.5 billion, up about $740 million from the second quarter of 2009. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed about $1 billion to the increase in earnings. This increase was partially offset by $321 million decrease from lower sales volumes, primarily from the planned and unplanned downtime that I just mentioned. 
We have a positive $50 million in Other. Is largely comprised of lower dry-hole cost, foreign currency effects and lower DD&A. And looking at the table at the bottom of the slide, you can see that both U.S. and international earnings improved significantly from the prior year. Oil and natural gas realizations are up significantly. 
Moving to Slide 8, our unit metrics for the E&P segment. You can see that E&P income per BOE was nearly double that of a year ago, and this primarily reflects the increase in realized prices that I mentioned earlier. Comparing this quarter's E&P results to the first quarter of 2010, we saw earnings impacted by lower natural gas prices, the volume and cost impacts of planned and unplanned maintenance activity, fewer over-lift volumes and foreign currency movements. E&P earnings were impacted by several items, such as the estimated $70 million in lost earnings from LNG sales volumes during our scheduled maintenance in Australia, a sequential earnings reduction from unfavorable foreign exchange movements of negative $64 million, and in our Russian affiliate, earnings were reduced by $17 million, a result of higher export taxes. 
In addition, the impact of crude sales volumes versus production reduced earnings by about $20 million for this period versus the previous quarter. Our E&P cash contribution per BOE is competitive among our peer group and our largely OECD-focused portfolio provides greater exposure to price movements in the future. 
Moving to Slide 9, market conditions for Refining and Marketing were much stronger this quarter. R&M's adjusted earnings improved over $700 million versus a year ago. Realized refining margins improved more than $550 million, primarily driven by stronger distillate fracs. In the U.S, distillate market cracks almost doubled while internationally, they improved by about 50%. In addition, we made nearly $100 million from our premium coke production at Humber and Lake Charles refineries. Additional contributors to the improved refining margins were $41 million from our increased margins was attributable to our Chemical industry feedstock such as cyclohexane, propylene, tylene, xylene and benzene. And marketing margins were better by about $150 million compared to this quarter last year. $42 million improvement related to volumes is primarily driven by our U.S. refining capacity utilization increasing from 93% to 96% as well as an increase in our marketing volumes of unbranded fuels. 
The $101 million of negative variants in Other is almost entirely FX-related. It reflects unfavorable foreign exchange impacts this quarter compared to the favorable ones we received in the same quarter of 2009. And this quarter's foreign exchange impacts were largely due to the dollar strengthening compared to the weakening in the same period. The table at the bottom of the slide provides U.S. and International earnings as well as realized margins. 
So let's move now to Slide 10, which shows the year-over-year variances for our other segments. Results in our Midstream segment were $30 million higher this quarter compared to a year ago, mostly due to higher NGL prices. Our 50% share of CPChem generated $138 million during the quarter. This is $71 million higher than the second quarter of 2009 and due to higher ethylene, polyethylene and benzene margins. In fact, looking at equity earnings for the Chemicals segment, this is our second best quarter since CPChem was formed. LUKOIL adjusted earnings were improved by $187 million compared with the same quarter last year. The increased earnings was mostly driven by higher average realized prices partially offset by higher taxes. Adjusted corporate expenses were $365 million after tax for the quarter compared to $157 million last year. The majority of this variance was a $150 million impact related to foreign exchange, and the remainder was higher interest expense related to the absence of tax settlements and higher effective tax rates of about $20 million and $15 million, respectively. We’re increasing our full year estimate for corporate expenses from the estimated $1.2 billion to approximately $1.4 billion for the full year 2010. This increase is primarily due to the FX losses I just mentioned of about $90 million for the year and approximately $150 million for the Mako payment costs to retire the debt that I’d mentioned earlier. 
Turning to Slide 11, our debt-to-cap ratio. As stated before, we paid down $2.7 billion of debt this quarter, resulted in balancing debt of $26.3 billion at the end of the quarter for a reported debt-to-cap ratio of 28%. Debt is down some $4 billion versus the same time last year. We also ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion due largely to the timing of the receipt of the Syncrude proceeds in late June. 
Netting out our cash position, debt-to-cap is at 25%, the top end of our stated debt-to-cap ratio, but down from the peak of 34% at this time last year. Cash on hand will be used to pay down additional debt during the balance of the year, and towards that end, we’ve called $2.7 billion of debt, which will be settled in the third quarter. Another $500 million in maturity is expected to be called in the fourth. 
All in, we expect that year end debt level around $23 billion and cash balances around $2 billion. So let's move to Slide 12, our ROCE and cash returns on capital invested. 
You can see that on the charts on Slide 12, we've shown steady improvement in our returns. This has been driven by better earnings and cash flows while maintaining capital discipline. Year-over-year, our ROCE improved by 6%, and although price was a large component of improved ROCE, constrained capital spending, paying down debt and investing in higher-returning businesses also contributed to this improvement. And this is in line with our previous guidance around expectations that 2/3 of the improvement comes from prices and 1/3 comes from our disciplined approach to capital. 
As a result of our recent Wilhelmshaven decision, we expect capital employed in the R&M segment to fall. We ended the quarter with capital employed in R&M of $23.4 billion, versus $23.6 billion last year, and for the full year 2010, we expect to spend approximately 90% of our capital in E&P, consistent with our plans of investing in higher-returning business segments. 
So that completes our review of our second quarter of 2010, and I'll wrap up with some operational and project returns and plan status on Slide 13 before asking Jim to make a few comments before we go into Q&A. 
Looking at Slide 13, I guess the place to start is, just to be consistent with previous production guidance, we expect 2010 E&P production to be close to 2008 production levels with approximately 1.8 million BOE after adjusting for the impact of asset dispositions and PSC impacts related to higher prices. New production from our ramp-up of Canadian Oil Sands, Bohai Bay, Indonesia , Qatargas 3 will partially offset production declines in North America, Alaska and the North Sea assets. Asset dispositions of Syncrude and other parts of our E&P portfolio are expected to have annual impact of about 20,000 a day during 2010. And we expect PSC impacts will reduce production by about 10,000 BOE per day. 
Regarding refining, during the third quarter, we expect a slight decrease in total utilization rates in the current quarter and expect to see U.S. refining capacity rates to be in the low 90% range. We expect R&M pretax turnaround expenses to be slightly less than previously guided, $500 million for the year. 
Controllable costs are expected to be lower in 2010 compared to 2009, as we continue to take steps to control costs while ensuring the safety of our employees, the integrity of our assets and conducting planned maintenance at our refineries. 
The most important elements of our company is culture, our safety, maintaining an asset integrity and environmental stewardship. We recently completed a 35-day shutdown in our Bayu-Undan field and Darwin LNG facilities. This shutdown involved over 1,400 employees and contractors and was executed as planned with no major incidents or environmental impacts. We are on track to deliver our cost reduction targets of about $350 million from E&P and about $200 million reduction in cost in Refining and Marketing. 
Moving to our Exploration Program Activity. In the Caspian, the Rak More well should spud in the third quarter and achieve TD by year end, and we expect the Nursultan to follow sometime the second half of 2011. We’re currently drilling the Megaladon wildcat in the North Sea. We’ve got a 30% working interest. It’s high-temperature high-pressure well. Drilling’s progressing according to plans and TD is expected late in the third quarter. And we expect to participate in two additional wildcat wells during the year. One, in the deepwater Norwegian Atlantic area with Shell, the Gulf Newton well. It's a deepwater Jurassic target. And one in the Arafura Sea, which is expected in the second half of this year in offshore Indonesia, where we have 25% working interest in partner with Total. As for our Polish shale and Chinese coal bed methane plays, we don't have any new material information. We completed the first Polish well earlier this quarter. But it was more of a data well and we're evaluating the data we’re gotten from it. We continue to look at the Polish opportunities and Chinese opportunities favorably. We’re seeing good return and production growth opportunities in our oil sands areas, both Foster Creek, Christina Lake, as well as Surmont. We've accelerated our FCCL development program and expect average production this year of between 55 and 60 MBOE this year, and we expect the compound annual growth rate over the next five years to be somewhere between 15% and 20% with mid-teens returns or higher on a full cycle basis. 
We're also increasing investment and the pace of drilling activity in the Lower 48, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian plays. At Eagle Ford, we've been encouraged by our recent well results, continue to look for ways to optimize our operations. Year-to-date, we've drilled 13 and completed seven wells at Eagle Ford and are optimistic about this deal’s potential to support future production and returns growth. We’ve got six rigs drilling in the area, plan to have as many as 12 by year end, in current production of about 7,000 BOE per day. Our APLNG project is targeting FID by the end of 2010. We're encouraged by the withdrawal of the Australian government's recent proposal to enact new resource super profits tax, which would have had an adverse impact on all coal seam to LNG projects. We remain concerned about other possible increases in Australian taxation, such as the newly proposed extension of the petroleum resource rent tax to onshore oil and gas projects and are working to mitigate this exposure. We believe there is sufficient LNG demand to support our project and other projects in the region and look forward to providing further updates on our marketing activities later this year. 
At our 2010 Analyst Meeting, we detailed our plans to enhance returns and strengthen our financial position. From 2010 to 2013, we expect to grow our production per share by approximately 3% per year on a compound annual growth rate basis, and we're on target to deliver this. Another part of the plan was to sell $10 billion in assets over the next two years. We've made significant progress with the completion of the sale of Syncrude, our CFJ interest and other miscellaneous assets. The data rooms for North America asset disposition packages have been open since June, and we've seen significant amounts of interest from potential buyers. Our expectation is to receive bids during this quarter and begin closing on our E&P North America asset sometime in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
We've engaged an adviser for the sale of our 25% interest in the REX pipeline, and marketing efforts are progressing. Total cash proceeds year-to-date are in excess of $5.8 billion, and we expect to reach between $7 billion and $8 billion for asset dispositions, excluding LUKOIL by the end of the year. 
In addition, we continue to take steps to rebalance our portfolio and enhance our returns by reducing the proportion of capital employed in our downstream business, demonstrated by our cancellation of Wilhelmshaven refinery project upgrade and the announcements made earlier this year about other major potential projects. So that concludes my prepared remarks, and before we take your questions, I'd like to ask Jim for a few of his comments before we open the call."
296527,108920711,70038,"ConocoPhillips, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Okay, Clayton, and appreciate everyone participating calling in on this conference call. I think I would provide a little information regarding our announcement on our plans to sell all of our ownership interest in LUKOIL. Previously, we indicated that we",898,"Okay, Clayton, and appreciate everyone participating calling in on this conference call. I think I would provide a little information regarding our announcement on our plans to sell all of our ownership interest in LUKOIL. Previously, we indicated that we were going to sell half of our interest. As you know, we own 20% of LUKOIL, and we were thinking of selling down to 10%, but the announcement today is to over the time period of remainder of 2010 through 2011 to sell all of our interest in LUKOIL. So let's talk about this for a moment. 
It was a strategic relationship with LUKOIL. The objective certainly for ConocoPhillips was to participate in opportunities, both particularly upstream and to some extent downstream within Russia, within LUKOIL. LUKOIL's interest was to do that both in Russia but outside with ConocoPhillips as well. It's been a good experience, good relationship, highest respect for LUKOIL, and everything that we've experienced so far from LUKOIL and with the Russian authorities has essentially been what we would have expected. The development of opportunities within Russia has not come as quickly as we would have thought for our company, as well as for others in the industry. 
If we look at our ownership in LUKOIL, essentially the strategic reason for coming to the decision of selling all of our interest over the next 18 months is that we have good financial returns, but our cash returns are essentially the dividends. So we book our share for equity and accounting 20% of LUKOIL's results, but our cash return is essentially about $200 million a year and so we look at the opportunities within Russia. We look at the opportunities that we have elsewhere around the world within our portfolio of the company, along with our emphasis on improving our portfolio returns, our cash returns and distributions to our shareholders, we came to the conclusion that we felt that we could better redeploy those funds primarily through share repurchase, but our emphasis on metrics, the metrics of returns, the metrics of reserves and production per barrel, our earnings in cash, particularly cash returns per share. So if we look at where we have invested in LUKOIL, the shares were purchased over a number of years ago for a total cash outlay of $7.5 billion. Over these years, we have received $1 billion in cash dividends. And earlier, about a month or two ago, we sold 6.7 million shares for $400 million. We had a price of about $58 a share. So we currently have an ownership interest at this point in time of 19.2%. And that book value is $6.7 billion. So we invested $7.5 billion in cash, received $1 billion. I know it's not net present value, but from a cash point of view, we have $6.5 billion invested. 
Now we announced that we're going to sell this two different classifications of LUKOIL shares. I'll just say the Russian shares and the shares outside of Russia. They have a similar characteristic. So what we have done is we have just announced that we're selling the Russian shares 7.6% to LUKOIL, that it represents 64.6 million shares or about 40% of our shareholding interest. The share price we've announced is $53.25. That results in we receive those proceeds pretax August, I believe it’s 16th, of a little bit more than $3.4 billion. We expect after-tax gain of about $300 million, cash taxes of about $500,000,000 and the transaction, as I said, closes in about August 16. And then what we have in mind is looking at selling the remaining shares and open market shares essentially in London or that exchange or to LUKOIL. Sell the remaining shares and if you look at current prices, that would have a value pretax of about the proceeds of $5.5 billion. For that block the remaining amount of shares’ financial after-tax gain at those prices would be $1.3 billion cash taxes. A little more efficient than [indiscernible 33:10] $100 million. LUKOIL does have an option for our shareholders agreement. It’s a pretty extensive agreement when we entered several years ago. Option for 60 days, it starts today, to purchase all the remaining shares or the shares that they would like, to write a first offer at $56 per share. So if you look at our LUKOIL state, it's been in our investment in LUKOIL and in Russia. It's been a good experience. It's a great relationship. The after-tax proceeds from the stock sales that I went through will be somewhere about $8.7 billion, maybe a little bit more, cumulative dividends a little bit more than a $1 billion, so if you look at it, I know it’s not net present value, the cash out of what we sell and our dividends will be about just a little less than $10 billion. And we invested $7.5 billion. 
Most of the cash that comes from the proceeds from the disposition of the LUKOIL shares will be directed towards share repurchase. The cash that comes after tax from asset dispositions, a great deal of that will be directed towards getting our debt down, as Clayton said, towards $23 billion and we essentially are getting very close to achieving that at this point in time. So those are my opening comments. I wanted to talk about LUKOIL. So we’ll open up for questions, Clayton."

I think you’re fairly clearly saying it's all going to be rotated into buyback. Would you expect that to be done over what period of time? Would you expect to do any further buyback this year assuming that you get down to your debt level target? And then how would you see 2011 playing out as well in terms of your aspirations for further asset sales seeing as you're getting towards the kind of $10 billion level fairly quickly that you originally talked about? Would you consider increasing the asset sale program given that you had success so far in obtaining good prices and would again we expect that to be directly into buyback?"
296527,108920711,70038,"ConocoPhillips, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Okay. Well, you've asked quite a number of questions, essentially what are our basic plans with capital structure and allocation of cash.

Well, you've asked quite a number of questions, essentially what are our basic plans with capital structure and allocation of cash. And so as Clayton said, we look at our debt balance, and we're pretty satisfied at about $23 billion. Although it could go down a little bit more, maybe $1 billion, but we think around $23 billion, $22 billion fits for us in terms of our debt objectives. We'll see the debt ratio at the end of the year, net debt at, say, 25% moving down because we essentially don't pay out all of our earnings in the form of dividends. And the other thing is, is we don't particularly have a hoard of maturing debt coming immediately in the next short period of time. And so we don't feel that we should be paying a premium to reduce debt that's pretty tax efficient. So for guidance, I think you should be looking at us saying as we look at the end of 2010 and going into 2011, we're pretty comfortable with debt at $22 billion and $23 billion. The other thing we've said is that we like to have annual dividend increases. Well, we increased our dividend late 2008 and we had a 10% increase early part of 2010. So you look forward to 2011, why, if we follow through on the plans, you can look at some dividend increase. And look at our capital spending. Capital spending for this year is going to be in the neighborhood of $11 billion to $12 billion. That's what we would expect it will be, $11 billion to $12 billion. And so if we look out to the next year in 2011, where we’ve said we haven't finalized plans or that, but with the things that we are doing in the company probably our capital spend might be in the neighborhood of $12 billion or $13 billion because we have a lot of projects that we are working on. Another thing that we’ll probably do as we look at the end of this year, we'll probably carry cash balances in the neighborhood of, for guidance purposes, let's say $2 billion. The reason we do that is because there may become opportunities for us to participate whether it's deepwater Gulf of Mexico or shale gas, coal bed methane opportunities in the Lower 48 or other places of the world. And so we look at that and we say, well, we just want to have cash available in an order and magnitude of about $2 billion because we think the things we might do might be a couple hundred million dollars, half a billion dollars, something like that. In terms of the deepwater gulf of Mexico, we look at it, and we say well, it's way too early to determine what are the opportunities because we don't know what we have a moratorium on, we don't know what the rules, regulations, risk/reward, liability situation is so it’s really way premature to get into something like that so the guidance we’re really giving you is we’re saying well, we carry $2 billion in cash, we get debt down to $22 billion, $23 billion, don't have to take it down anymore, we raise the divided next year and so then when we look at it and we say, okay, given how we sell our shares while we sell our shares of LUKOIL we'll start really buying our shares probably for the middle of August in an even pace and we like the idea of just kind of averaging this over time. So on the basis of what we did, is we sell LUKOIL shares, we buy our own shares and then we have to take a look at what the market gives us in terms of cash flow from commodity prices and crack spreads. So hopefully, I’ve tried to give you our basic approach to what we're doing for the rest of 2010 and 2011."

It's employment and then employment leads to investment, and employment leads to returns, and taxes are paid to states and to the federal government. So for every reason, we really believe that we can put the industry back to work, that's important. The other thing is as we look at our company, we obviously as I said earlier, we’ve got to know what the risk/rewards we need to go with the rules and regulations are and that's hopefully it’s going to get sorted out here more quickly than we've seen so far. For our company, for the past several years, we’ve looked before the Deepwater Horizon incident, we felt that we wanted to have – we were underrepresented in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We want to have more of a position. So we in the last several license rounds, we've been picking up acreage pretty aggressively. And then we've been trying to farm in, and we’ve tried to do that. So now, we find with the Deepwater Horizon incident that we find ourselves while we don't think necessarily we’re advantaged, but we don't think we're disadvantaged. And so we look at a company like ourselves and we say we have the capability, the technology, the experience, we can do this. So we want to be opportunistic, and we feel we are the right kind of company to do this. So if smaller companies don't want to continue to participate and we see the risk/reward and the rules and regulations okay, we’d like to do more in the Gulf of Mexico, but we're not going to do this until we know what the rules are and what the risk/rewards are going to be."

I think it's certainly the business environment. If we look back five or six years ago, what took place with the very deep worldwide recession, the financial crisis in the latter part of 2008, access issues. As I said earlier, the development of opportunities not just within Russia, but outside of Russia and some of the reason for why we put the strategic relationship together was to do more things together in Russia and outside. And that really hasn't materialized quite like we thought. Not because of lack of interest or intent, but the business environment’s quite different than it was. And so we have a pretty complex shareholders agreement. And so we initially outlined and disclosed we were going to sell half of our interest, 10%, but we were also during that time period working on the 20%, essentially selling all of our interest and that takes time. And we just felt we wanted to get going so that's why we announced the 10%. There's not really a change. There has been a pretty consistent approach and it’s taken time and that's really my response on that. The other second question you said is, well, we’ve built ConocoPhillips over last 10 years and there's been a great deal of M&A activities from mergers to acquisitions, ventures, whatever. Things like what we did within Canada with the refining side now with Synovis. And when we look at our portfolio objectives going forward, I really think that the world really has changed. And we’ve said this in our meetings with the financial community, the Analyst meeting, M&A opportunities, you look at them, they're feeling far between. You're very expensive and you have to really question do you create value for the shareholder? Our emphasis is on how do we improve all of our metrics. Return on capital, foreign cash return on capital, work per share metrics and reserves and then, by the way, when we sell ultimately our 20% interest in LUKOIL, our metrics production per share, reserve per share, cash per share all of that, when you look at the ConocoPhillips, E&P segment, they all improved somewhere in the order of magnitude of like 10%. So we have as we’ve said, we’ve got 40 billion plus of resources. We've got plenty of resources. Yes, you never have enough. You keep working for it. We want to improve and get more exploration success, but we can create a lot of value if we, as we said, convert these resources, 1 billion BOE a year into proven reserves, and do this well, we’re going to create a lot of value for shareholders, and we don't compromise the balance sheet and we don’t put a share stock up. And that's really a plan."

We do have some that are on the higher side of that where we’ve got gas being produced. I guess our best well is around close to six MCF a day and oil is 1,600 BOE per day. So you’ve got an MMcf per day of close to 16. But I would say on an MCF or a BOE per day, on a BOE per day basis, we're seeing something around 2 at Eagle Ford. I think, and that's the information I have on Eagle Ford, right? As I mentioned on Poland, the well that we've finished there was more of a data collection well. We got some logs and things to look at, and we don't have anything to disclose on that this year, and I don't have anything in front of me on Bakken other than to say that within the total Wilson Basin area that we’re producing somewhere around 30,000 barrels a day. This is an area that's interesting to us. We’ve ramped up our capital spend from about, from somewhere around $200 million to close to $500 million. This would also be an area you would expect us to increase capital spending into 2011 and 2012. As you look at places where sources of growth for ConocoPhillips, I would say, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and then as you look up into Horn River or the Mahtne [ph 51:22], or into Poland or China, those are probably longer in terms of the amount of time it takes to wrap up production, you’re probably looking at beyond the 2011 time frame.

That's what they need to be used for and more of a collective mutual insurance by the industry, in the sense you pay in than to be a vehicle by which the government collects money from the industry and uses it for other things other than it's intended purpose.

We actually show absolute costs being flat to lower in our segment. So if there's an increase, the increase would come from, I guess, smaller production or not adjusting for foreign exchange. But we don't show an increase in -- we don't see an increase in our prevented operating cost."

So I think it’s a progression of watching what's taking place in the world and what the risk/reward situation is, but I think the emphasis would be going from 3 million barrels a day down toward 2.2 with time and then even further looking out into the future you have to ask yourself what you think of this business and potentially even growing less than that."

The first is probably when we started the year. The impact on production from asset dispositions is probably a little less than we might have thought on the average for the year. We're getting good value for what we sell, but when we sell it, we're selling it, it’s taking us a little longer than we thought to make sure we get good value. So from a production impact this year, it's probably less than you might have thought. The other bit is the analyst meeting back, I think it was March, we said that just assume that when we're done and we complete $10 billion asset dispositions, we're going to go from something like the 1.8 million BOE a day to something down like, say, maybe 1.7. A little bit more, little bit less than that, but just for guidance purposes, think 1.7. And then we've been saying that for the next several years given our portfolio, that production will go down maybe 1% a year. Actually this is an excellent growth on everything, goes down 1% a year for two or three years, then it starts coming up in absolute terms. And it comes up in absolute terms because we bring on some of these new large projects, and then they go for a very long period of time. Like the oil sands in Canada, they just go for 30, 40 years. So what we've been doing is per share metrics as we buy our shares in, we’re going to see these per share metrics production’s going up even when absolute level production goes down 1% a year. It’s going up by 3%+ and then as we continue, say over a period of time, we keep buying our shares in, but we increase the absolute level then the per share metrics really get levered up quite a big higher more than that. That’s the plan."

Joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning, we’ll be discussing the company's second quarter results and also provide an update on the status of our returns enhancement plans that we had announced earlier this year. The summary of key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. 
As in the past, you'll find our presentation materials on the IR section of the ConocoPhillips website, but before we get started, I'd like you to refer to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2 of the presentation. It’s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the Q&A, and actual results may differ materially from what is presented today. Factors that could cause these actual results to differ are included in our filings with the SEC. 
Please move to Slide 3, which is a summary of our key second quarter results and highlights. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $2.5 billion or $1.67 per share. Cash from operations was $3.5 billion. Capital efficiency increased as annualized cash returns on capital invested improved to 22%. Our E&P production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.73 million BOE per day. 
The competitiveness of our refineries allowed us to achieve U.S. refinery utilization rate of 96%, and excluding Wilhelmshaven, the international rate would have been 88%. We completed $5.8 billion in asset sales, primarily the Syncrude and CFJ asset. And debt was reduced by $2.7 billion in the second quarter, with an additional $2.7 billion reduction planned next month. 
Turning to Slide 4, you can see that total adjusted earnings for the company were $2.5 billion, up $1.5 billion compared to last year. The majority of these earnings were generated by our E&P and R&M businesses. Our E&P segment improved by almost $750 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by lower volumes. And compared to the second quarter of last year, R&M adjusted earnings increased by over $700 million, mainly due to improved global Refining and Marketing margins. The amount in the Other column reflects an increase in corporate costs, partially offset by improvements in Chemicals and Midstream earnings. 
Moving to Slide 5, total cash flow. We generated $3.5 billion in cash from operations and $5.8 billion in cash proceeds from asset sales, primarily from Syncrude and CFJ sales. We repaid $2.7 billion in debt, funded a capital program of $2.2 billion, paid approximately $800 million in dividends and repurchased $390 million of ConocoPhillips common stock. At the end of the quarter, we had a cash balance of $4.1 billion, $2.7 billion of which will be used to pay down debt in the third quarter. 
Now let's review our upstream production for the second quarter on Slide 6. You can see that production was 1.73 million BOE per day, down 7% from the second quarter of last year. Looking at the chart, you can see that 23,000 BOE per day of the reduction is attributable to market factors, including PSE impacts due to higher prices. And moving to the right, roughly 12,000 BOE a day stems from the expropriation of our assets in Ecuador and asset sales in Canada and the Lower 48. 
We produced 50,000 BOE per day less this quarter compared to previous year's quarter from planned maintenance in Norway, Australia and the Lower 48. In Norway, this reflects our routine three-year or once every three-year turnaround in the Greater Ekofisk and Eldfisk area and that had an impact of about 35,000 BOE per day. 
What happened in Australia, we had a full field shutdown at the Bayu-Undan field and the Darwin LNG plant and that impacted production 23,000 BOE per day. The remainder of the planned downtime was 7,000 BOE per day coming from the Lower 48. The 54,000 BOE per day bar shown above operations is largely normal field decline offset by new production. The majority of the decline came from 87,000 BOE per day in North America, and the remaining 38,000 BOE per day came from Norway and the U.K. Offsetting that, we had 75,000 BOE per day of new production from China, Canada and Indonesia. 
So now I'd like to turn to Slide 7, E&P adjusted earnings, which were $1.5 billion, up about $740 million from the second quarter of 2009. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed about $1 billion to the increase in earnings. This increase was partially offset by $321 million decrease from lower sales volumes, primarily from the planned and unplanned downtime that I just mentioned. 
We have a positive $50 million in Other. Is largely comprised of lower dry-hole cost, foreign currency effects and lower DD&A. And looking at the table at the bottom of the slide, you can see that both U.S. and international earnings improved significantly from the prior year. Oil and natural gas realizations are up significantly. 
Moving to Slide 8, our unit metrics for the E&P segment. You can see that E&P income per BOE was nearly double that of a year ago, and this primarily reflects the increase in realized prices that I mentioned earlier. Comparing this quarter's E&P results to the first quarter of 2010, we saw earnings impacted by lower natural gas prices, the volume and cost impacts of planned and unplanned maintenance activity, fewer over-lift volumes and foreign currency movements. E&P earnings were impacted by several items, such as the estimated $70 million in lost earnings from LNG sales volumes during our scheduled maintenance in Australia, a sequential earnings reduction from unfavorable foreign exchange movements of negative $64 million, and in our Russian affiliate, earnings were reduced by $17 million, a result of higher export taxes. 
In addition, the impact of crude sales volumes versus production reduced earnings by about $20 million for this period versus the previous quarter. Our E&P cash contribution per BOE is competitive among our peer group and our largely OECD-focused portfolio provides greater exposure to price movements in the future. 
Moving to Slide 9, market conditions for Refining and Marketing were much stronger this quarter. R&M's adjusted earnings improved over $700 million versus a year ago. Realized refining margins improved more than $550 million, primarily driven by stronger distillate fracs. In the U.S., distillate market cracks almost doubled while internationally, they improved by about 50%. In addition, we made nearly $100 million from our premium coke production at Humber and Lake Charles refineries. Additional contributors to the improved refining margins were $41 million from our increased margins was attributable to our Chemical industry feedstock such as cyclohexane, propylene, tylene, xylene and benzene. And marketing margins were better by about $150 million compared to this quarter last year. $42 million improvement related to volumes is primarily driven by our U.S. refining capacity utilization increasing from 93% to 96% as well as an increase in our marketing volumes of unbranded fuels. 
The $101 million of negative variants in Other is almost entirely FX-related. It reflects unfavorable foreign exchange impacts this quarter compared to the favorable ones we received in the same quarter of 2009. And this quarter's foreign exchange impacts were largely due to the dollar strengthening compared to the weakening in the same period. The table at the bottom of the slide provides U.S. and International earnings as well as realized margins. 
So let's move now to Slide 10, which shows the year-over-year variances for our other segments. Results in our Midstream segment were $30 million higher this quarter compared to a year ago, mostly due to higher NGL prices. Our 50% share of CPChem generated $138 million during the quarter. This is $71 million higher than the second quarter of 2009 and due to higher ethylene, polyethylene and benzene margins. In fact, looking at equity earnings for the Chemicals segment, this is our second best quarter since CPChem was formed. LUKOIL adjusted earnings were improved by $187 million compared with the same quarter last year. The increased earnings was mostly driven by higher average realized prices partially offset by higher taxes. Adjusted corporate expenses were $365 million after tax for the quarter compared to $157 million last year. The majority of this variance was a $150 million impact related to foreign exchange, and the remainder was higher interest expense related to the absence of tax settlements and higher effective tax rates of about $20 million and $15 million, respectively. We’re increasing our full year estimate for corporate expenses from the estimated $1.2 billion to approximately $1.4 billion for the full year 2010. This increase is primarily due to the FX losses I just mentioned of about $90 million for the year and approximately $150 million for the Mako payment costs to retire the debt that I’d mentioned earlier. 
Turning to Slide 11, our debt-to-cap ratio. As stated before, we paid down $2.7 billion of debt this quarter, resulted in balancing debt of $26.3 billion at the end of the quarter for a reported debt-to-cap ratio of 28%. Debt is down some $4 billion versus the same time last year. We also ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion due largely to the timing of the receipt of the Syncrude proceeds in late June. 
Netting out our cash position, debt-to-cap is at 25%, the top end of our stated debt-to-cap ratio, but down from the peak of 34% at this time last year. Cash on hand will be used to pay down additional debt during the balance of the year, and towards that end, we’ve called $2.7 billion of debt, which will be settled in the third quarter. Another $500 million in maturity is expected to be called in the fourth. 
All in, we expect that year end debt level around $23 billion and cash balances around $2 billion. So let's move to Slide 12, our ROCE and cash returns on capital invested. 
You can see that on the charts on Slide 12, we've shown steady improvement in our returns. This has been driven by better earnings and cash flows while maintaining capital discipline. Year-over-year, our ROCE improved by 6%, and although price was a large component of improved ROCE, constrained capital spending, paying down debt and investing in higher-returning businesses also contributed to this improvement. And this is in line with our previous guidance around expectations that 2/3 of the improvement comes from prices and 1/3 comes from our disciplined approach to capital. 
As a result of our recent Wilhelmshaven decision, we expect capital employed in the R&M segment to fall. We ended the quarter with capital employed in R&M of $23.4 billion, versus $23.6 billion last year, and for the full year 2010, we expect to spend approximately 90% of our capital in E&P, consistent with our plans of investing in higher-returning business segments. 
So that completes our review of our second quarter of 2010, and I'll wrap up with some operational and project returns and plan status on Slide 13 before asking Jim to make a few comments before we go into Q&A. 
Looking at Slide 13, I guess the place to start is, just to be consistent with previous production guidance, we expect 2010 E&P production to be close to 2008 production levels with approximately 1.8 million BOE after adjusting for the impact of asset dispositions and PSC impacts related to higher prices. New production from our ramp-up of Canadian Oil Sands, Bohai Bay, Indonesia , Qatargas 3 will partially offset production declines in North America, Alaska and the North Sea assets. Asset dispositions of Syncrude and other parts of our E&P portfolio are expected to have annual impact of about 20,000 a day during 2010. And we expect PSC impacts will reduce production by about 10,000 BOE per day. 
Regarding refining, during the third quarter, we expect a slight decrease in total utilization rates in the current quarter and expect to see U.S. refining capacity rates to be in the low 90% range. We expect R&M pretax turnaround expenses to be slightly less than previously guided, $500 million for the year. 
Controllable costs are expected to be lower in 2010 compared to 2009, as we continue to take steps to control costs while ensuring the safety of our employees, the integrity of our assets and conducting planned maintenance at our refineries. 
The most important elements of our company is culture, our safety, maintaining an asset integrity and environmental stewardship. We recently completed a 35-day shutdown in our Bayu-Undan field and Darwin LNG facilities. This shutdown involved over 1,400 employees and contractors and was executed as planned with no major incidents or environmental impacts. We are on track to deliver our cost reduction targets of about $350 million from E&P and about $200 million reduction in cost in Refining and Marketing. 
Moving to our Exploration Program Activity. In the Caspian, the Rak More well should spud in the third quarter and achieve TD by year end, and we expect the Nursultan to follow sometime the second half of 2011. We’re currently drilling the Megaladon wildcat in the North Sea. We’ve got a 30% working interest. It’s high-temperature high-pressure well. Drilling’s progressing according to plans and TD is expected late in the third quarter. And we expect to participate in two additional wildcat wells during the year. One, in the deepwater Norwegian Atlantic area with Shell, the Gulf Newton well. It's a deepwater Jurassic target. And one in the Arafura Sea, which is expected in the second half of this year in offshore Indonesia, where we have 25% working interest in partner with Total. As for our Polish shale and Chinese coal bed methane plays, we don't have any new material information. We completed the first Polish well earlier this quarter. But it was more of a data well and we're evaluating the data we’re gotten from it. We continue to look at the Polish opportunities and Chinese opportunities favorably. We’re seeing good return and production growth opportunities in our oil sands areas, both Foster Creek, Christina Lake, as well as Surmont. We've accelerated our FCCL development program and expect average production this year of between 55 and 60 MBOE this year, and we expect the compound annual growth rate over the next five years to be somewhere between 15% and 20% with mid-teens returns or higher on a full cycle basis. 
We're also increasing investment and the pace of drilling activity in the Lower 48, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian plays. At Eagle Ford, we've been encouraged by our recent well results, continue to look for ways to optimize our operations. Year-to-date, we've drilled 13 and completed seven wells at Eagle Ford and are optimistic about this deal’s potential to support future production and returns growth. We’ve got six rigs drilling in the area, plan to have as many as 12 by year end, in current production of about 7,000 BOE per day. Our APLNG project is targeting FID by the end of 2010. We're encouraged by the withdrawal of the Australian government's recent proposal to enact new resource super profits tax, which would have had an adverse impact on all coal seam to LNG projects. We remain concerned about other possible increases in Australian taxation, such as the newly proposed extension of the petroleum resource rent tax to onshore oil and gas projects and are working to mitigate this exposure. We believe there is sufficient LNG demand to support our project and other projects in the region and look forward to providing further updates on our marketing activities later this year. 
At our 2010 Analyst Meeting, we detailed our plans to enhance returns and strengthen our financial position. From 2010 to 2013, we expect to grow our production per share by approximately 3% per year on a compound annual growth rate basis, and we're on target to deliver this. Another part of the plan was to sell $10 billion in assets over the next two years. We've made significant progress with the completion of the sale of Syncrude, our CFJ interest and other miscellaneous assets. The data rooms for North America asset disposition packages have been open since June, and we've seen significant amounts of interest from potential buyers. Our expectation is to receive bids during this quarter and begin closing on our E&P North America asset sometime in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
We've engaged an adviser for the sale of our 25% interest in the REX pipeline, and marketing efforts are progressing. Total cash proceeds year-to-date are in excess of $5.8 billion, and we expect to reach between $7 billion and $8 billion for asset dispositions, excluding LUKOIL by the end of the year. 
In addition, we continue to take steps to rebalance our portfolio and enhance our returns by reducing the proportion of capital employed in our downstream business, demonstrated by our cancellation of Wilhelmshaven refinery project upgrade and the announcements made earlier this year about other major potential projects. So that concludes my prepared remarks, and before we take your questions, I'd like to ask Jim for a few of his comments before we open the call."
296527,108920711,72105,"ConocoPhillips, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Okay, Clayton, and appreciate everyone participating calling in on this conference call. I think I would provide a little information regarding our announcement on our plans to sell all of our ownership interest in LUKOIL. Previously, we indicated that we",898,"Okay, Clayton, and appreciate everyone participating calling in on this conference call. I think I would provide a little information regarding our announcement on our plans to sell all of our ownership interest in LUKOIL. Previously, we indicated that we were going to sell half of our interest. As you know, we own 20% of LUKOIL, and we were thinking of selling down to 10%, but the announcement today is to over the time period of remainder of 2010 through 2011 to sell all of our interest in LUKOIL. 
So let's talk about this for a moment. It was a strategic relationship with LUKOIL. The objective certainly for ConocoPhillips was to participate in opportunities, both particularly upstream and to some extent downstream within Russia, within LUKOIL. LUKOIL's interest was to do that both in Russia but outside with ConocoPhillips as well. It's been a good experience, good relationship, highest respect for LUKOIL, and everything that we've experienced so far from LUKOIL and with the Russian authorities has essentially been what we would have expected. The development of opportunities within Russia has not come as quickly as we would have thought for our company as well as for others in the industry. 
If we look at our ownership in LUKOIL, essentially the strategic reason for coming to the decision of selling all of our interest over the next 18 months is that we have good financial returns, but our cash returns are essentially the dividends. So we book our share for equity and accounting 20% of LUKOIL's results, but our cash return is essentially about $200 million a year and so we look at the opportunities within Russia. We look at the opportunities that we have elsewhere around the world within our portfolio of the company, along with our emphasis on improving our portfolio of returns, our cash returns and distributions to our shareholders, we came to the conclusion that we felt that we could better redeploy those funds primarily through share repurchase, but our emphasis on metrics, the metrics of returns, the metrics of reserves and production per barrel, our earnings in cash, particularly the cash returns per share. So if we look at what we have invested in LUKOIL, the shares were purchased over a number of years ago for a total cash outlay of $7.5 billion. Over these years, we have received $1 billion in cash dividends. And earlier, about a month or two ago, we sold 6.7 million shares for $400 million at a price of about $58 a share. So we currently have an ownership interest at this point in time of 19.2%. The net book value is $6.7 billion. So we invested $7.5 billion in cash, received $1 billion. I know it's not net present value, but from a cash point of view, we have $6.5 billion invested. 
Now we announced that we're going to sell two different classifications of LUKOIL shares. I'll just say the Russian shares and the shares outside of Russia. They have a similar characteristic. So what we have done is we have just announced that we're selling the Russian shares 7.6% to LUKOIL, that it represents 64.6 million shares or about 40% of our shareholding interest. The share price we've announced is $53.25. We receive those proceeds pretax August, I believe it’s 16th, of a little bit more than $3.4 billion. We expect after-tax gain of about $300 million, cash taxes of about $0.5 billion and the transaction, as I said, closes in about August 16. And then what we have in mind is looking at selling the remaining shares and open market shares essentially in London or that exchange or to LUKOIL. Sell the remaining shares and if you look at the current prices, that would have a value pretax of about the proceeds of $5.5 billion. For that block, the remaining amount of shares’ financial after-tax gain at those prices would be $1.3 billion cash taxes. A little more efficient than [indiscernible 33:10] $100 million. LUKOIL does have an option for our shareholders agreement. It’s a pretty extensive agreement when we entered several years ago. Option for 60 days, it starts today, to purchase all the remaining shares or the shares that they would like, to write a first offer at $56 a share. So if you look at our LUKOIL state, it's been -- in our investment in LUKOIL and in Russia, it's been a good experience. It's a great relationship. The after-tax proceeds from the stock sales that I went through will be somewhere about $8.7 billion, maybe a little bit more, cumulative dividends a little bit more than a $1 billion, so if you look at it, I know it’s not net present value, the cash out of what we sell and our dividends will be about just a little less than $10 billion. And we invested $7.5 billion. 
Most of the cash that comes from the proceeds from the disposition of the LUKOIL shares will be directed towards share repurchase. The cash that comes after tax from asset dispositions, a great deal of that will be directed towards getting our debt down, as Clayton said, towards $23 billion and we essentially are getting very close to achieving that at this point in time. So those are my opening comments. I wanted to talk about LUKOIL. So we’ll open up for questions, Clayton."

Would you expect to do any further buyback this year assuming that you get down to your debt level target? And then how would you see 2011 playing out as well in terms of your aspirations for further asset sales seeing as you're getting towards the kind of $10 billion level fairly quickly that you originally talked about? Would you consider increasing the asset sale program given that you had success so far in obtaining good prices and would again we expect that to be directly into buyback?"

Well, you've asked quite a number of questions, essentially what are our basic plans with capital structure and allocation of cash.

Well, you've asked quite a number of questions, essentially what are our basic plans with capital structure and allocation of cash. And so as Clayton said, we look at our debt balance, and we're pretty satisfied at about $23 billion. Although it could go down a little bit more, maybe $1 billion, but we think around $23 billion, $22 billion fits for us in terms of our debt objectives. We'll see the debt ratio at the end of the year, net debt at, say, 25% moving down because we essentially don't pay out all of our earnings in the form of dividends. And the other thing is, is we don't particularly have a hoard of maturing debt coming immediately in the next short period of time. And so we don't feel that we should be paying a premium to reduce debt that's pretty tax efficient. So for guidance, I think you should be looking at us saying as we look at the end of 2010 and going into 2011, we're pretty comfortable with debt at $22 billion and $23 billion. The other thing we've said is that we like to have annual dividend increases. Well, we increased our dividend late 2008 and we had a 10% increase early part of 2010. So you look forward to 2011, why, if we follow through on the plans, you can look at some dividend increase. And look at our capital spending. Capital spending for this year is going to be in the neighborhood of $11 billion to $12 billion. That's what we would expect it will be, $11 billion to $12 billion. And so if we look out to the next year in 2011, where we’ve said we haven't finalized plans or that, but with the things that we are doing in the company probably our capital spend might be in the neighborhood of $12 billion or $13 billion because we have a lot of projects that we are working on. Another thing that we’ll probably do as we look at the end of this year, we'll probably carry cash balances in the neighborhood of, for guidance purposes, let's say $2 billion. The reason we do that is because there may become opportunities for us to participate whether it's deepwater Gulf of Mexico or shale gas, coal bed methane opportunities in the Lower 48 or other places of the world. And so we look at that and we say, well, we just want to have cash available in an order and magnitude of about $2 billion because we think the things we might do might be a couple hundred million dollars, half a billion dollars, something like that. In terms of the deepwater gulf of Mexico, we look at it, and we say well, it's way too early to determine what are the opportunities because we don't know what we have a moratorium on, we don't know what the rules, regulations, risk/reward, liability situation is so it’s really way premature to get into something like that so the guidance we’re really giving you is we’re saying well, we carry $2 billion in cash, we get debt down to $22 billion, $23 billion, don't have to take it down anymore, we raise the divided next year and so then when we look at it and we say, okay, given how we sell our shares while we sell our shares of LUKOIL we'll start really buying our shares probably for the middle of August in an even pace and we like the idea of just kind of averaging this over time. So on the basis of what we did, is we sell LUKOIL shares, we buy our own shares and then we have to take a look at what the market gives us in terms of cash flow from commodity prices and crack spreads. So hopefully, I’ve tried to give you our basic approach to what we're doing for the rest of 2010 and 2011."

And the industry is ready to work. We have to do this because if we don't, drilling rigs and people start to leave the Gulf and they leave the Gulf, they don't come back a month or two later. They leave permanently for one or two years. And we look at the Gulf of Mexico, we know the resource are there. We need to develop our indigenous resources. It's employment and then employment leads to investment, and employment leads to returns, and taxes are paid to states and to the federal government. So for every reason, we really believe that we can put the industry back to work, that's important. The other thing is as we look at our company, we obviously as I said earlier, we’ve got to know what the risk/rewards we need to go with the rules and regulations are and that's hopefully it’s going to get sorted out here more quickly than we've seen so far. For our company, for the past several years, we’ve looked before the Deepwater Horizon incident, we felt that we wanted to have – we were underrepresented in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We want to have more of a position. So we in the last several license rounds, we've been picking up acreage pretty aggressively. And then we've been trying to farm in, and we’ve tried to do that. So now, we find with the Deepwater Horizon incident that we find ourselves while we don't think necessarily we’re advantaged, but we don't think we're disadvantaged. And so we look at a company like ourselves and we say we have the capability, the technology, the experience, we can do this. So we want to be opportunistic, and we feel we are the right kind of company to do this. So if smaller companies don't want to continue to participate and we see the risk/reward and the rules and regulations okay, we’d like to do more in the Gulf of Mexico, but we're not going to do this until we know what the rules are and what the risk/rewards are going to be."

I think it's certainly the business environment. If we look back five or six years ago, what took place with the very deep worldwide recession, the financial crisis in the latter part of 2008, access issues. As I said earlier, the development of opportunities not just within Russia, but outside of Russia and some of the reason for why we put the strategic relationship together was to do more things together in Russia and outside. And that really hasn't materialized quite like we thought. Not because of lack of interest or intent, but the business environment’s quite different than it was. And so we have a pretty complex shareholders agreement. And so we initially outlined and disclosed we were going to sell half of our interest, 10%, but we were also during that time period working on the 20%, essentially selling all of our interest and that takes time. And we just felt we wanted to get going so that's why we announced the 10%. There's not really a change. There has been a pretty consistent approach and it’s taken time and that's really my response on that. The other second question you said is, well, we’ve built ConocoPhillips over last 10 years and there's been a great deal of M&A activities from mergers to acquisitions, ventures, whatever. Things like what we did within Canada with the refining side now with Synovis. And when we look at our portfolio objectives going forward, I really think that the world really has changed. And we’ve said this in our meetings with the financial community, the Analyst meeting, M&A opportunities, you look at them, they're feeling far between. You're very expensive and you have to really question do you create value for the shareholder? Our emphasis is on how do we improve all of our metrics. Return on capital, foreign cash return on capital, work per share metrics and reserves and then, by the way, when we sell ultimately our 20% interest in LUKOIL, our metrics production per share, reserve per share, cash per share all of that, when you look at the ConocoPhillips, E&P segment, they all improved somewhere in the order of magnitude of like 10%. So we have as we’ve said, we’ve got 40 billion plus of resources. We've got plenty of resources. Yes, you never have enough. You keep working for it. We want to improve and get more exploration success, but we can create a lot of value if we, as we said, convert these resources, 1 billion BOE a year into proven reserves, and do this well, we’re going to create a lot of value for shareholders, and we don't compromise the balance sheet and we don’t put a share stock up.

This is an area that's interesting to us. We’ve ramped up our capital spend from about, from somewhere around $200 million to close to $500 million. This would also be an area you would expect us to increase capital spending into 2011 and 2012.

I mean, at best, only the very largest companies and it’s a question of whether they would look at the risk/reward of it being acceptable to going forward in Deepwater Gulf of Mexico with unlimited liability. So I can't speak for other companies, but I think the result of that will be that we will just not have the activity, and we will not develop the resources if we have that kind of situation. Cooperative insurance, well the oil spill insurance fund, we have to make sure that whatever we do, if there are changes to it, it's done in a way that those funds, if collected, are really used in the case of a very unfortunate tragic incident. That's what they need to be used for and more of a collective mutual insurance by the industry, in the sense you pay in than to be a vehicle by which the government collects money from the industry and uses it for other things other than its intended purpose. So this are really very, very important things that need to be sorted out and are going to have a direct impact on whether we get the industry back to work and develop the resources that we know we have in the Gulf of Mexico."

Now if you look at the longer-term time period, it may be that there’s even less refining exposure and what is left in terms of refining exposure has got to be only the largest, most sophisticated refineries that have some tie to feed stock, to some kind of venture. Or something like we've done with Synovis. So I think it’s a progression of watching what's taking place in the world and what the risk/reward situation is, but I think the emphasis would be going from 3 million barrels a day down towards 2.2 with time and then even further looking out into the future you have to ask yourself what you think of this business and potentially even growing less than that."

The first is probably when we started the year. The impact on production",351,"Well, probably, we'd say the following about production, but I think Clayton has been talking with the buy and sell side in his normal way of how we present and talk about all this. The first is probably when we started the year. The impact on production from asset dispositions is probably a little less than we might have thought on the average for the year. We're getting good value for what we sell, but when we sell it, we're selling it, it’s taking us a little longer than we thought to make sure we get good value. So from a production impact this year, it's probably less than you might have thought. The other bit is the analyst meeting back, I think it was March, we said that just assume that when we're done and we complete $10 billion asset dispositions, we're going to go from something like the 1.8 million BOE a day to something down like, say, maybe 1.7. A little bit more, little bit less than that, but just for guidance purposes, think 1.7. And then we've been saying that for the next several years given our portfolio, that production will go down maybe 1% a year. Actually, this is an excellent growth on everything, goes down 1% a year for two or three years, then it starts coming up in absolute terms. And it comes up in absolute terms because we bring on some of these new large projects, and then they go for a very long period of time. Like the oil sands in Canada, they just go for 30, 40 years. So what we've been doing is per share metrics as we buy our shares in, we’re going to see these per share metrics production’s going up even when absolute level production goes down 1% a year. It’s going up by 3%+ and then as we continue, say over a period of time, we keep buying our shares in, but we increase the absolute level then the per share metrics really get levered up quite a big higher more than that. That’s the plan."

And thanks everybody, on the line for your interest in ConocoPhillips in our third quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning we'll be discussing third quarter results and also provide an update on the status of our strategic initiatives.
A summary of our key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And as in the past, you'll find our presentation materials on the IR section of the ConocoPhillips website. 
Before we get started, I'd like you to look at the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and Q&A. Actual results may differ materially from what's presented today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included in our filings with the SEC.
Moving to Slide 3, a summary of our key third quarter results and highlights. You can see that earnings for the third quarter, adjusted for special items, were $2.2 billion or $1.50 per share, up 56% from this quarter a year ago. Cash from operations was $4.3 billion. Cash returns on capital employed was 20%. Upstream production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.72 million BOE per day. Our refineries ran at relatively high-capacity utilization. R&M's adjusted earnings topped $1 billion through the first nine months of the year. We completed $6.3 billion of dispositions, including $6 billion of LUKOIL share sales. Debt was reduced by $2.7 billion during the quarter, and we ended with an $8 billion cash balance.
So turning to Slide 4. Total company adjusted earnings were $2.2 billion, up over $800 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Both E&P and R&M improved earnings year-over-year. Our E&P segment improved $559 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Compared to the third quarter of last year, R&M adjusted earnings increased $174 million, mainly due to improved U.S. refining margins. The $149 million improvement in other reflects a reduction in corporate costs, as well as earnings improvements in our Midstream and Chemicals ventures. September 2010 year-to-date adjusted controllable costs were approximately $400 million lower compared with the same period in 2009. The improvement is evenly split between E&P and R&M segments. Total controllable costs, unadjusted for market factors and asset sales for the first nine months of 2010, were $9.6 billion compared to $9.4 billion during the same period in 2009.
Moving to Slide 5, cash flow sources and uses. You can see that we generated $10.6 billion in cash during the quarter. $4.3 billion came from operations, and $6.3 billion in cash proceeds and dispositions, primary the LUKOIL stock sales. We repaid $2.7 billion of debt, funded $2.5 billion in capital, repurchased almost $900 million of ConocoPhillips common stock and paid over $800 million in dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had a cash balance of close to $8 billion, the majority of which we expect to use to repurchase ConocoPhillips shares.
Now let's review our Upstream production on Slide 6. Third quarter production was 1.72 million BOE per day, down 4% or 74,000 BOE per day from the third quarter of last year. You can see from the chart that 14,000 per day of the reduction was due to market factors, including PSC impacts due to higher prices and royalty impacts at Foster Creek and Christina Lake. FCCL production continues to grow, however, higher royalty take caused a negative impact on reported production. Late in the quarter, we initiated production curtailments of approximately 180 Mcf equivalent or 30,000 BOE a day in response to continuing low gas prices in Western Canada and parts of the U.S. 27,000 barrels a day of production was lost due to asset sales of Syncrude and Lower 48 production. Maintenance activity was about the same as last year.
The decrease in operations is mainly due to normal fuel decline, offset by new production. The majority of our decline came from North America, with almost 90,000 BOE per day and in the North sea, which had almost 40,000 BOE per day of lower production. Almost 75,000 barrels a day of new production from China, our SAGD operations in Canada, Australia and other locations partially offset this decline. Unplanned downtime was about the same as last year. And we'll talk more about the 2010 and 2011 production expectations later during the outlook portion of today's conference call.
Turning to Slide 7. You can E&P's adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up almost 60% from the same quarter a year ago. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed more than $600 million of the increase in earnings. The earnings improvement was partially offset by $207 million decrease from lower sales volumes, primarily coming from normal fuel decline. The positive $149 million in other is largely comprised of lower dry hole costs and DD&A, partially offset by increased impairments and lower contributions from equity companies in Russia and Canada. Year-to-date 2010, E&P adjusted controllable costs improved by about $200 million compared with the first nine months of 2009. And looking at the table at the bottom of the slide, you can see that both the U.S. and international adjusted earnings improved significantly compared to last year.
Let's go to Slide 8, E&P unit metrics. You can see that our metrics were significantly better than a year ago, reflecting the improvement in realized oil and gas prices. Third quarter E&P income increased $3.78 per BOE or 66% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the second quarter of this year, income and cash per BOE were slightly better, in spite of realized oil prices being down about 2%, and this is due to LNG, bitumen and U.S. natural gas prices all sequentially improving. As our OECD-focused portfolio shifts more towards oil sands, LNG, lower freight [ph] liquids production, we expect to see additional improvements in our income and cash flow per BOE metrics over time.
Turning to R&M on Slide 9. You can see that Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings improved 185% over the same quarter last year. Downstream market conditions were stronger as global crack spreads improved 15%, and helped increase earnings by about $100 million. However, this quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by about $75 million due to inventory impacts and how we valued inventory. And we expect to recover this loss in the fourth quarter. 
Year-over-year, we saw, a decrease in R&M earnings of $18 million from lower volumes, which were primarily driven by the sale of Conoco Flying J Truck Stops. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization was slightly lower compared to the same period last year, and our international refining capacity rate was 60% during the quarter compared to 81% for the same period last year. This decrease in international reflects the shutdown of the Wilhelmshaven refinery. Excluding the impact of Wilhelmshaven, R&M ran at 93% of capacity and clean product yield improved almost 83%.
Compared to the third quarter of last year, operating costs increased $22 million due to higher utilities and turnaround costs, which were partially offset by foreign exchange and asset sale benefits. However, through the end of the third quarter, controllable costs adjusted for market factors and asset sales were down around $200 million compared to the first nine months of last year. Lower effective tax rates and foreign exchange benefits made up the majority included in the $114 million bar, labeled other. Sequentially, our Downstream business was negatively impacted by lower earnings of more than $50 million from our Premium Coke and Chemical Feedstock business, and $70 million from lower contributions from marketing.
Now let's move to Slide 10, which shows year-over-year variances for other segments. Adjusted corporate expenses were $162 million for the quarter compared to $286 million a year ago. These results exclude a $114 million Mako premium for early debt retirement. The $124 million sequential decline in corporate is primarily due to lower interest expense and higher foreign exchange gains. Foreign exchange gains were driven by U.S. dollar weakening against the Canadian dollar and British pound. Results in our DCP Midstream segment were $15 million higher this quarter compared to a year ago, mostly due to higher NGL prices. Sequentially, NGL prices were down $1.45 a barrel, but it recovered as a percentage of crude oil. 
Our 50% stake of CPChem generated $132 million. This represents almost $30 million more than the third quarter of last year, and was due to higher ethylene and polyethylene prices and margins. These higher margins were partially offset by higher utility and turnaround costs. During the quarter, ConocoPhillips received a $220 million distribution from CPChem.
The LUKOIL segment generated $436 million in adjusted earnings for the quarter, and it's based on LUKOIL's second quarter reported earnings. We will discontinue equity accounting of the LUKOIL segment at the end of the third quarter and no longer report LUKOIL reported proved reserves or production.
Turning to Slide 11, which provides more detail on the impact of the LUKOIL share sales. You can see that the chart shows undiscounted cash increase generated by our investment in LUKOIL stock. The green bars represent proceeds coming from dividends and the sale of stock. The first two provide the amount of after-tax proceeds from the dividends and shares sold through the end of the third quarter. The third bar estimates the amount of after-tax proceeds we would generate if the sale of the remaining shares was done at the closing price on October 21, 2010. Together, these proceeds total about $10 billion. The original acquisition cost of $170 million or 20% of LUKOIL shares amounted to $7.5 billion, leaving a cash increase of about $2.5 billion. As mentioned, we'll discontinue the use of equity accounting for the LUKOIL segment after this quarter and report earlier realized gains on future share sales as we reduce our ownership interest, which was 4.6% and 39.2 million shares as of yesterday.
Looking at the impact of this decision on earnings per share and cash flow basis, if we assume an estimated proceeds of a $9 billion from our sale of the entire interest in LUKOIL were use to repurchase ConocoPhillips stock at $60 a share and we assume no equity earnings for LUKOIL were recorded , we estimate the net reduction on adjusted EPS to be about $0.16 per share this quarter or about 10%. 
Looking back over the last three years, a reduction in adjusted EPS would also have been about 10% on average. On a cash flow basis, the decision to sell LUKOIL and buy ConocoPhillips stock is accretive. This is due to the difference in dividend yield, as dividends received from LUKOIL, which were the only source of cash flow from the segment, we're less than the ConocoPhillips dividend saved from those shares purchased. Looking more narrowly at cash from operations on a per-share basis, on the average over the last three years, cash flow per share would have been about 10% higher.
Moving to Slide 12, our capital structure. These graphs provide the last several quarters and two years history of equity and debt levels. During the first nine months of 2010, we reduced debt by more than $5 billion, bringing our debt level below $24 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of about $8 billion due largely to the sale of LUKOIL shares combined with the cash we had on hand at the end of the second quarter. And considering this cash position, our growth in equity net the cap rate would be around 18%. Majority of current cash position is expected to be used for the repurchase of ConocoPhillips stock. And while our debt-to-cap level is above our target of 20%, we don't plan to significantly reduce debt further over the next year or two.
Let's move to Slide 13, which provides some history on distributions to shareholders. Since the formation of ConocoPhillips in 2002, we've grown dividends per share by 13.5% per year through the eight consecutive years of annual dividend increases. In addition to those dividend payments, we purchased $16.1 billion of stock during 2006 to 2008 time frame, and expect to purchase another $10 billion of ConocoPhillips stock in 2010 and 2011. These share repurchases have been divided by the fully diluted share count and are shown on the graph above on a per-share basis as the blue bars. Share repurchases have ramped up over the last couple of months. And through October 26, we've repurchased about 37 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. The average fully diluted share count during the third quarter was 1.493 billion. We believe this increase in shareholder distribution is an approach that differentiates us from most of our peers. We expect that the share repurchase will allow us to improve returns on capital while growing production on a per-share basis.
Moving to Slide 14, which provides capital efficiency metrics. Our ROCE and cash returns have improved during the year, driven by earnings and cash flow growth while constraining capital employed expansion. Compared to this quarter last year, returns are higher. However, third quarter results were sequentially lower. And this decline was due to primarily to the third quarter adjusted earnings being about 10% lower than the second quarter, as well as some expansion in capital employed. We ended the third quarter with about $93.5 billion of capital employed, of which $24 billion is in R&M and $57 billion was in E&P. 2009 average capital employed was $87.5 billion. The $6 billion increase in third quarter capital employed came from currency translation effects and growth in retained earnings. The increase is partially offset by debt reduction and share repurchase.
If we had repurchased about another $1.5 billion of additional shares, our ROCE for the quarter would have been closer to 11%. As execution of our capital allocation plans shift our spending toward E&P and our asset dispositions result in better margins per BOE, we expect to see our returns on capital employed expand further. That completes the review of the third quarter 2010 results. I'll wrap up with some forward-looking comments before asking Jim to make a few remarks and then open the line for questions.
Consistent with the previous full year 2010 production guidance, we expect production to be flat with 2008 or about $1.8 million BOE per day, before dispositions and market factors. We anticipate fourth quarter E&P production to be close to that what it was in the third quarter. And during the fourth quarter, the production impact from asset dispositions will be between 40,000 and 50,000 barrels per day, natural gas production curtailment of 20,000 to 30,000 BOE per day, while price and PSC effects are expected to reduce production by 10,000 to 20,000 BOE per day. We expect 2011 production to be 2% lower than 2010 before considering the impact of 2011 E&P dispositions, so around 1.7 million BOE per day. We'll give you more information about our 2011 production targets, sources of production growth and regional plans early next year.
In our R&M business, we expect fourth quarter turnaround activity to increase significantly, with pretax expenses to be around $200 million and total pretax expense for the year of around $450 million. Fourth quarter utilization rates should be almost 80%, and capacity utilization in the U.S. would be around 85%. And the international utilization rate is expected to be in the low 60% range, which includes the impact of Wilhelmshaven. Regarding controllable costs, we are on track to deliver our cost reduction targets of about $350 million from E&P and $200 million from refining and marketing.
For full year 2010, we expect unadjusted corporate expense to be approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital program for 2010 is expected to be between $10 billion and $11 billion, down from earlier guidance and from 2009 levels. This is due to permitting delays and slow pace of development, primarily in Asia-Pacific, North Sea and North America. 2011 capital program is expected to increase to around $13 billion, with the ramp-up of Lower 48 shale activity and the APLNG project being key drivers of the increase over 2010 spending levels. We'll provide you with more information on our 2011 capital program in December and give you more detail at our March 23 Analyst Meeting in New York.
Moving to exploration. We expect 2010 exploration expense of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We completed Wildcat in the North Sea, which was determined to be a dry hole. Our 30% interest in the well resulted in a $6 million after-tax charge. In the Caspian, the Rak More well spud in the third quarter, and we may be able to provide some well results on our January earnings conference call. In the Arafura Sea, we expect to spud our first well in the fourth quarter and the second well in 2011. We have 51% interest in those wells. Additionally, the 20% owned Dalsnuten Wildcat that spud in the third quarter, we expect it to TD late in 2010. And we will begin the next appraisal phase on Poseidon Offshore Browse basin in Australia during the first half of 2011. Several development options are being discussed, and the final determination regarding development is dependent upon the upcoming appraisal wells. 
We continue to increase the pace of drilling activity in the liquid-rich shale plays at the Eagle Ford, Bakken, North Barnett and Cardium. At Eagle Ford, we had eight rigs drilling at the end of the quarter, nine are drilling currently, and 11 are expected by the end of October. Additionally, we have secured two dedicated frac cruise for 2010, and expect to increase that number to three early next year. We've drilled a total of 33 wells in the Eagle Ford shale, completed 20, and are seeing production of roughly 8,000 BOE per day from the 14 wells that we brought online to date. 
In the liquids-rich Cardium area at Western Canada, we'll be drilling nine operated wells and participating in six non-operated wells during the fourth quarter. These wells are almost all oil-producing with some associated gas. Also in Canada, we continue to see good return and production growth opportunities in our SAGD areas: Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Surmont. We expect production of around 60,000 BOE per day this year from these projects, with a compound annual growth rate over the next five years estimated between 10% and 15%. 
In Australia, APLNG is engaged with several potential LNG buyers in support of moving to FID, but we're not in a position to discuss information regarding specific market discussion at this time. However, we plan to have an announcement regarding the sale of two trains of LNG before year end. Our plans to sell $10 billion in assets by the end of 2011 are on track. And so far this year, we've closed transactions with proceeds of $5.6 billion and expect proceeds of roughly $7 billion by year end. We may sell more than $10 billion in assets during 2010 and 2011.
The assets being sold in 2010 have a production of approximately 55,000 BOE per day. Most of the Lower 48 and Western Canadian E&P assets will be closed in the fourth quarter and will generate about $1.5 billion in proceeds. We expect the 2010 full year average production impact of asset dispositions to be roughly 20,000 BOE per day, with a reduction of reserves of about 310 million BOE. Assets which may be sold as part of the 2011 program include our Wilhelmshaven refinery, additional Lower 48 and Western Canada E&P assets and other international assets in both Upstream and Downstream businesses. The REX pipeline is outside the 2011 scope. 
As we did this year, we intend to provide you with production, reserve and earnings impacts resulting from our asset sales program during the first quarter of 2011. Our guidance of spending $10 billion on share repurchase over 10,000 on '10 and 10,000 in '11 remains unchanged. Our current Board of Directors authorization is for $5 billion. So that concludes my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over now to Jim Mulva for his comments before we open the call for questions. Jim?"

We're doing really quite well on not on",581,"Okay, Clayton, thank you. I think you covered most of the points, so just maybe confirm a few points. First, from an operating point of view, we've operated quite well all of this year and through the third quarter. We're doing really quite well on not only the operations but the cost constraint. We're maintaining our facilities certainly, but we're doing well in cost constraint, and as a result of good commitment by our employees and the help of our contractors. 
In terms of the portfolio restructuring, we're right on track, no change in strategy, quite covered the asset dispositions. I think there to see opportunity as we go through 2011. And we'll update you what time. We could be doing more than somewhat more than $10 billion of asset sales. We're on track on the restructuring where we want to move E&P up towards more as a portion of our portfolio and refining and marketing from 25% with time closer to 15%. 
Capital guidance, we're probably going to spend closer to $10 billion this year, with expectations of capital spending closer to or above $13 billion this next year. Clayton indicated LUKOIL dispositions, we still have about 4.6% ownership. At LUKOIL share prices we are currently experiencing, we continue to sell our shares. So I think if these market levels continue, you'll see us dispose of all of our interest in LUKOIL far more quickly than when the guidance of which would be the end of 2011. We continue to buy ConocoPhillips shares in the marketplace. And as the slide indicates, guidance shows that we would spend may be closer to about $4 billion in 2010 for purchase of ConocoPhillips shares, with about $6 billion this next year. The board has approved $5 billion program, but we've indicated the proceeds from the LUKOIL disposition would go essentially towards share repurchase. 
In terms of debt reduction, our debt is in the neighborhood of $23.5 billion. We don't have any required maturities left this year. The debt is quite efficient. In this next year, we have some required maturities which might be in the neighborhood of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. We'll certainly retire those. But we have no real compelling economic reason to accelerate and buy more of our debt. So we're quite satisfied with the debt. It will come down over the next several years with required maturities, but still, longer term, I think we question going much below $20 billion in debt because we have a strong balance sheet across is quite acceptable.
In terms of the utilization of our free cash flow, as I just said, we don't feel any compelling reason to bring the debt down more quickly than where it is right now other than required maturities. We feel we have the cash flow to support the capital program that we've outlined. We like the discipline of increasing our dividends. Of course, it's subject to board approval. But in the past several years, we've been raising our dividends early in each of the years. And then that we'll probably operate with a cash balance of about $2 billion for opportunities and liquidity purposes. So to the extent that we sell more assets and that we have good cash flow, after we fund capital program and dividends, it would be available for additional share repurchase.

The changes for executives that are retiring has nothing to do with health or performance issues. The objective is very clear and very simple: to put in place the future management team. And out of that group of individuals will come my replacement and this will be down over the next couple of years, and then that table continue on. I'm 64 1/2 years old, so we don't have a mandatory retirement age. But you can expect from this group will come my replacement just over the next several years. We want to make sure that putting this group together that have a lot of operating expertise. We wanted also to bring, develop our own senior management within the company, but we wanted to augment it with others from the outside with experience both Upstream and Downstream. That can give us also fresh set of eyes to help us with respect to as we restructure and execute, implement the portfolio changes, become a more Upstream and less Downstream.

We can do that on $13 billion, $14 billion, $15 billion a year of capital and still raise our dividends, 5% to 10%.

We do that by having fewer shares outstanding, more capital discipline and ultimately replacing our reserves and growing our production in absolute terms, but even more so on a per-metric, per-unit share.

And at the same time, the company has a new exploration program that's gearing up also. And so my question in regards to the conversion process on these reserves, meaning, what is your level of confidence that the team can execute such a large plan of commercial conversion for these reserves over that period of time? And on the exploration front, where are you most optimistic when you think about how the profile might be supported over the longer term?"

And I'll ask Clayton, I'd like to share with you what our breakevens when I get done answering your question. But conversion of the oil sands is a pretty significant part of our conversion and reserve replacement over the next five years. We feel really good about that. And then the oil, we've really -- our portfolio, I don't think it's well understood in the marketplace. Our portfolio, what we have in Eagle Ford and the Bakken and the oil play of Barnett and other areas that we have, we're really getting more and more encouraged all the time that's why we're increasing our spend by about $1 billion or more in 2011. So we feel really good about that. Obviously, we got to deliver what we say we're got to do at APLNG, but we really feel that project is coming together, and that's pretty important, LNG projects in the future. And then we're having discovery success in Alaska, like Poseidon, but it's a little bit longer term. So LNG projects, what we are doing in the Lower 48, oil sands, and then we are going to go forward with the redevelopment of Ekofisk field and Eldfisk, we pretty certain about adding reserves there. So those are some of the big areas. Now on the exploration front, we've got Rock More, Moray well. And we've got more opportunities, more features to drill in the Caspian. We're looking for more acreage in Turkmenistan. We're looking for more acreage essentially in other place in the world. But we also think we're uniquely positioned as a company, exploration-wise and maybe at BD wise for larger companies and smaller companies in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. We don't know what the rules and regulations are going to be. We don't know for sure what the risk/reward is going to be. But that's why we said in prior responses to questions that we've reserved a couple of billion dollars that we feel that we could go into some discovered resources and participate as an opportunity for all of these reasons. We really believe pretty strongly, and we'll update everyone in the March Analyst Meeting of the conversion process, the reserve replacement and doing that competitively finding and development costs. We feel pretty good about this over the next five years, and we'll share that with everyone. Now Clayton, maybe would you in our March Meeting, but would you go through just, I think, the breakevens on what we have for Foster Creek, Christina Lake as well as Surmont, it gives you a better feel. We've got the resources here, but why we're committing the money and why we feel we can grow production 15% compounded over the next number of years for a long period of time."

And thanks, everybody, on the line for your interest in ConocoPhillips in our third quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning we'll be discussing third quarter results and also provide an update on the status of our strategic initiatives.
A summary of our key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And as in the past, you'll find our presentation materials on the IR section of the ConocoPhillips website. 
Before we get started, I'd like you to look at the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and Q&A. Actual results may differ materially from what's presented today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included in our filings with the SEC.
Moving to Slide 3, a summary of our key third quarter results and highlights. You can see that earnings for the third quarter, adjusted for special items, were $2.2 billion or $1.50 per share, up 56% from this quarter a year ago. Cash from operations was $4.3 billion. Cash returns on capital employed was 20%. Upstream production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.72 million BOE per day. Our refineries ran at relatively high-capacity utilization. R&M's adjusted earnings topped $1 billion through the first nine months of the year. We completed $6.3 billion of dispositions, including $6 billion of LUKOIL share sales. Debt was reduced by $2.7 billion during the quarter, and we ended with an $8 billion cash balance.
So turning to Slide 4. Total company adjusted earnings were $2.2 billion, up over $800 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Both E&P and R&M improved earnings year-over-year. Our E&P segment improved $559 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Compared to the third quarter of last year, R&M adjusted earnings increased $174 million, mainly due to improved U.S. refining margins. The $149 million improvement in other reflects a reduction in corporate costs, as well as earnings improvements in our Midstream and Chemicals ventures. September 2010 year-to-date adjusted controllable costs were approximately $400 million lower compared with the same period in 2009. The improvement is evenly split between E&P and R&M segments. Total controllable costs, unadjusted for market factors and asset sales for the first nine months of 2010, were $9.6 billion compared to $9.4 billion during the same period in 2009.
Moving to Slide 5, cash flow sources and uses. You can see that we generated $10.6 billion in cash during the quarter. $4.3 billion came from operations, and $6.3 billion in cash proceeds and dispositions, primary the LUKOIL stock sales. We repaid $2.7 billion of debt, funded $2.5 billion in capital, repurchased almost $900 million of ConocoPhillips common stock and paid over $800 million in dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had a cash balance of close to $8 billion, the majority of which we expect to use to repurchase ConocoPhillips shares.
Now let's review our Upstream production on Slide 6. Third quarter production was 1.72 million BOE per day, down 4% or 74,000 BOE per day from the third quarter of last year. You can see from the chart that 14,000 per day of the reduction was due to market factors, including PSC impacts due to higher prices and royalty impacts at Foster Creek and Christina Lake. FCCL production continues to grow, however, higher royalty take caused a negative impact on reported production. Late in the quarter, we initiated production curtailments of approximately 180 Mcf equivalent or 30,000 BOE a day in response to continuing low gas prices in Western Canada and parts of the U.S. 27,000 barrels a day of production was lost due to asset sales of Syncrude and Lower 48 production. Maintenance activity was about the same as last year.
The decrease in operations is mainly due to normal fuel decline, offset by new production. The majority of our decline came from North America, with almost 90,000 BOE per day and in the North Sea, which had almost 40,000 BOE per day of lower production. Almost 75,000 barrels a day of new production from China, our SAGD operations in Canada, Australia and other locations partially offset this decline. Unplanned downtime was about the same as last year. And we'll talk more about the 2010 and 2011 production expectations later during the outlook portion of today's conference call.
Turning to Slide 7. You can see E&P's adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up almost 60% from the same quarter a year ago. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed more than $600 million of the increase in earnings. The earnings improvement was partially offset by $207 million decrease from lower sales volumes, primarily coming from normal fuel decline. The positive $149 million in other is largely comprised of lower dry hole costs and DD&A, partially offset by increased impairments and lower contributions from equity companies in Russia and Canada. Year-to-date 2010, E&P adjusted controllable costs improved by about $200 million compared with the first nine months of 2009. And looking at the table at the bottom of the slide, you can see that both the U.S. and international adjusted earnings improved significantly compared to last year.
Let's go to Slide 8, E&P unit metrics. You can see that our metrics were significantly better than a year ago, reflecting the improvement in realized oil and gas prices. Third quarter E&P income increased $3.78 per BOE or 66% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the second quarter of this year, income and cash per BOE were slightly better, in spite of realized oil prices being down about 2%, and this is due to LNG, bitumen and U.S. natural gas prices all sequentially improving. As our OECD-focused portfolio shifts more towards oil sands, LNG, Lower 48’s liquids production, we expect to see additional improvements in our income and cash flow per BOE metrics over time.
Turning to R&M on Slide 9. You can see that Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings improved 185% over the same quarter last year. Downstream market conditions were stronger as global crack spreads improved 15%, and helped increase earnings by about $100 million. However, this quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by about $75 million due to inventory impacts and how we valued inventory. And we expect to recover this loss in the fourth quarter. 
Year-over-year, we saw, a decrease in R&M earnings of $18 million from lower volumes, which were primarily driven by the sale of Conoco Flying J Truck Stops. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization was slightly lower compared to the same period last year, and our international refining capacity rate was 60% during the quarter compared to 81% for the same period last year. This decrease in international reflects the shutdown of the Wilhelmshaven refinery. Excluding the impact of Wilhelmshaven, R&M ran at 93% of capacity and clean product yield improved almost 83%.
Compared to the third quarter of last year, operating costs increased $22 million due to higher utilities and turnaround costs, which were partially offset by foreign exchange and asset sale benefits. However, through the end of the third quarter, controllable costs adjusted for market factors and asset sales were down around $200 million compared to the first nine months of last year. Lower effective tax rates and foreign exchange benefits made up the majority included in the $114 million bar labeled other. Sequentially, our Downstream business was negatively impacted by lower earnings of more than $50 million from our Premium Coke and Chemical Feedstock business, and $70 million from lower contributions from marketing.
Now let's move to Slide 10, which shows year-over-year variances for other segments. Adjusted corporate expenses were $162 million for the quarter compared to $286 million a year ago. These results exclude a $114 million Mako premium for early debt retirement. The $124 million sequential decline in corporate is primarily due to lower interest expense and higher foreign exchange gains. Foreign exchange gains were driven by U.S. dollar weakening against the Canadian dollar and British pound. Results in our DCP Midstream segment were $15 million higher this quarter compared to a year ago, mostly due to higher NGL prices. Sequentially, NGL prices were down $1.45 a barrel, but it recovered as a percentage of crude oil. 
Our 50% stake of CPChem generated $132 million. This represents almost $30 million more than the third quarter of last year, and was due to higher ethylene and polyethylene prices and margins. These higher margins were partially offset by higher utility and turnaround costs. During the quarter, ConocoPhillips received a $220 million distribution from CPChem.
The LUKOIL segment generated $436 million in adjusted earnings for the quarter, and it's based on LUKOIL's second quarter reported earnings. We will discontinue equity accounting of the LUKOIL segment at the end of the third quarter and no longer report LUKOIL reported proved reserves or production.
Turning to Slide 11, which provides more detail on the impact of the LUKOIL share sales. You can see that the chart shows undiscounted cash increase generated by our investment in LUKOIL stock. The green bars represent proceeds coming from dividends and the sale of stock. The first two provide the amount of after-tax proceeds from the dividends and shares sold through the end of the third quarter. The third bar estimates the amount of after-tax proceeds we would generate if the sale of the remaining shares was done at the closing price on October 21, 2010. Together, these proceeds total about $10 billion. The original acquisition cost of $170 million or 20% of LUKOIL shares amounted to $7.5 billion, leaving a cash increase of about $2.5 billion. As mentioned, we'll discontinue the use of equity accounting for the LUKOIL segment after this quarter and report earlier realized gains on future share sales as we reduce our ownership interest, which was 4.6% and 39.2 million shares as of yesterday.
Looking at the impact of this decision on earnings per share and cash flow basis, if we assume estimated proceeds of a $9 billion from our sale of the entire interest in LUKOIL were used to repurchase ConocoPhillips stock at $60 a share and we assume no equity earnings for LUKOIL were recorded, we estimate the net reduction on adjusted EPS to be about $0.16 per share this quarter or about 10%. 
Looking back over the last three years, a reduction in adjusted EPS would also have been about 10% on average. On a cash flow basis, the decision to sell LUKOIL and buy ConocoPhillips stock is accretive. This is due to the difference in dividend yield, as dividends received from LUKOIL, which were the only source of cash flow from the segment, we're less than the ConocoPhillips dividend saved from those shares purchased. Looking more narrowly at cash from operations on a per-share basis, on the average over the last three years, cash flow per share would have been about 10% higher.
Moving to Slide 12, our capital structure. These graphs provide the last several quarters and two years history of equity and debt levels. During the first nine months of 2010, we reduced debt by more than $5 billion, bringing our debt level below $24 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of about $8 billion due largely to the sale of LUKOIL shares combined with the cash we had on hand at the end of the second quarter. And considering this cash position, our growth in equity net the cap rate would be around 18%. Majority of current cash position is expected to be used for the repurchase of ConocoPhillips stock. And while our debt-to-cap level is above our target of 20%, we don't plan to significantly reduce debt further over the next year or two.
Let's move to Slide 13, which provides some history on distributions to shareholders. Since the formation of ConocoPhillips in 2002, we've grown dividends per share by 13.5% per year through the eight consecutive years of annual dividend increases. In addition to those dividend payments, we purchased $16.1 billion of stock during 2006 to 2008 time frame, and expect to purchase another $10 billion of ConocoPhillips stock in 2010 and 2011. These share repurchases have been divided by the fully diluted share count and are shown on the graph above on a per-share basis as the blue bars. Share repurchases have ramped up over the last couple of months. And through October 26, we've repurchased about 37 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. The average fully diluted share count during the third quarter was 1.493 billion. We believe this increase in shareholder distribution is an approach that differentiates us from most of our peers. We expect that the share repurchase will allow us to improve returns on capital while growing production on a per-share basis.
Moving to Slide 14, which provides capital efficiency metrics. Our ROCE and cash returns have improved during the year, driven by earnings and cash flow growth while constraining capital employed expansion. Compared to this quarter last year, returns are higher. However, third quarter results were sequentially lower. And this decline was due to primarily to the third quarter adjusted earnings being about 10% lower than the second quarter, as well as some expansion in capital employed. We ended the third quarter with about $93.5 billion of capital employed, of which $24 billion is in R&M and $57 billion was in E&P. 2009 average capital employed was $87.5 billion. The $6 billion increase in third quarter capital employed came from currency translation effects and growth in retained earnings. The increase is partially offset by debt reduction and share repurchase.
If we had repurchased about another $1.5 billion of additional shares, our ROCE for the quarter would have been closer to 11%. As execution of our capital allocation plans shift our spending toward E&P and our asset dispositions result in better margins per BOE, we expect to see our returns on capital employed expand further. That completes the review of the third quarter 2010 results. I'll wrap up with some forward-looking comments before asking Jim to make a few remarks and then open the line for questions.
Consistent with the previous full year 2010 production guidance, we expect production to be flat with 2008 or about $1.8 million BOE per day, before dispositions and market factors. We anticipate fourth quarter E&P production to be close to about what it was in the third quarter. And during the fourth quarter, the production impact from asset dispositions will be between 40,000 and 50,000 barrels per day, natural gas production curtailment of 20,000 to 30,000 BOE per day, while price and PSC effects are expected to reduce production by 10,000 to 20,000 BOE per day. We expect 2011 production to be 2% lower than 2010 before considering the impact of 2011 E&P dispositions, so around 1.7 million BOE per day. We'll give you more information about our 2011 production targets, sources of production growth and regional plans early next year.
In our R&M business, we expect fourth quarter turnaround activity to increase significantly, with pretax expenses to be around $200 million and total pretax expense for the year of around $450 million. Fourth quarter utilization rates should be almost 80%, and capacity utilization in the U.S. would be around 85%. And the international utilization rate is expected to be in the low 60% range, which includes the impact of Wilhelmshaven. Regarding controllable costs, we are on track to deliver our cost reduction targets of about $350 million from E&P and $200 million from refining and marketing.
For full year 2010, we expect unadjusted corporate expense to be approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital program for 2010 is expected to be between $10 billion and $11 billion, down from earlier guidance and from 2009 levels. This is due to permitting delays and slow pace of development, primarily in Asia-Pacific, North Sea and North America. 2011 capital program is expected to increase to around $13 billion, with the ramp-up of Lower 48 shale activity and the APLNG project being key drivers of the increase over 2010 spending levels. We'll provide you with more information on our 2011 capital program in December and give you more detail at our March 23 Analyst Meeting in New York.
Moving to exploration. We expect 2010 exploration expense of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We completed Wildcat in the North Sea, which was determined to be a dry hole. Our 30% interest in the well resulted in a $6 million after-tax charge. In the Caspian, the Rak More well spud in the third quarter, and we may be able to provide some well results on our January earnings conference call. In the Arafura Sea, we expect to spud our first well in the fourth quarter and the second well in 2011. We have 51% interest in those wells. Additionally, the 20% owned Dalsnuten Wildcat that spud in the third quarter, we expect it to TD late in 2010. And we will begin the next appraisal phase on Poseidon Offshore Browse basin in Australia during the first half of 2011. Several development options are being discussed, and the final determination regarding development is dependent upon the upcoming appraisal wells. 
We continue to increase the pace of drilling activity in the liquid-rich shale plays at the Eagle Ford, Bakken, North Barnett and Cardium. At Eagle Ford, we had eight rigs drilling at the end of the quarter, nine are drilling currently, and 11 are expected by the end of October. Additionally, we have secured two dedicated frac crews for 2010, and expect to increase that number to three early next year. We've drilled a total of 33 wells in the Eagle Ford shale, completed 20, and are seeing production of roughly 8,000 BOE per day from the 14 wells that we brought online to date. 
In the liquids-rich Cardium area at Western Canada, we'll be drilling nine operated wells and participating in six non-operated wells during the fourth quarter. These wells are almost all oil-producing with some associated gas. Also in Canada, we continue to see good return and production growth opportunities in our SAGD areas: Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Surmont. We expect production of around 60,000 BOE per day this year from these projects, with a compound annual growth rate over the next five years estimated between 10% and 15%. 
In Australia, APLNG is engaged with several potential LNG buyers in support of moving to FID, but we're not in a position to discuss information regarding specific market discussion at this time. However, we plan to have an announcement regarding the sale of two trains of LNG before year end. Our plans to sell $10 billion in assets by the end of 2011 are on track. And so far this year, we've closed transactions with proceeds of $5.6 billion and expect proceeds of roughly $7 billion by year end. We may sell more than $10 billion in assets during 2010 and 2011.
The assets being sold in 2010 have a production of approximately 55,000 BOE per day. Most of the Lower 48 and Western Canadian E&P assets will be closed in the fourth quarter and will generate about $1.5 billion in proceeds. We expect the 2010 full year average production impact of asset dispositions to be roughly 20,000 BOE per day, with a reduction of reserves of about 310 million BOE. Assets which may be sold as part of the 2011 program include our Wilhelmshaven refinery, additional Lower 48 and Western Canada E&P assets and other international assets in both Upstream and Downstream businesses. The REX pipeline is outside the 2011 scope. 
As we did this year, we intend to provide you with production, reserve and earnings impacts resulting from our asset sales program during the first quarter of 2011. Our guidance of spending $10 billion on share repurchase over 10,000 on '10 and 10,000 in '11 remains unchanged. Our current Board of Directors authorization is for $5 billion. So that concludes my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over now to Jim Mulva for his comments before we open the call for questions. Jim?"

We're doing really quite well on",583,"Okay, Clayton, thank you. I think you covered most of the points, so I’ll just maybe confirm a few points. First, from an operating point of view, we've operated quite well all of this year and through the third quarter. We're doing really quite well on not only the operations but the cost constraint. We're maintaining our facilities certainly, but we're doing well in cost constraint, and as a result of good commitment by our employees and the help of our contractors. 
In terms of the portfolio restructuring, we're right on track, no change in strategy, Clayton covered the asset dispositions. I think there’s the opportunity as we go through 2011, and we'll update you what time, to be doing more than -- somewhat more than $10 billion of asset sales. We're on track on the restructuring where we want to move E&P up towards more as a portion of our portfolio and refining and marketing from 25% with time closer to 15%. 
Capital guidance, we're probably going to spend closer to $10 billion this year, with expectations of capital spending closer to or above $13 billion this next year. Clayton indicated LUKOIL dispositions, we still have about 4.6% ownership. At LUKOIL share prices we are currently experiencing, we continue to sell our shares. So I think if these market levels continue, you'll see us dispose of all of our interest in LUKOIL far more quickly than we had in the guidance of which would be the end of 2011. We continue to buy ConocoPhillips shares in the marketplace. And as the slide indicates, guidance shows that we would spend may be closer to about $4 billion in 2010 for purchase of ConocoPhillips shares, with about $6 billion this next year. The board has approved $5 billion program, but we've indicated the proceeds from the LUKOIL disposition would go essentially towards share repurchase. 
In terms of debt reduction, our debt is in the neighborhood of $23.5 billion. We don't have any required maturities left this year. The debt is quite efficient. In this next year, we have some required maturities which might be in the neighborhood of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. We'll certainly retire those. But we have no real compelling economic reason to accelerate and buy more of our debt. So we're quite satisfied with the debt. It will come down over the next several years with required maturities, but still, longer term, I think we question going much below $20 billion in debt because we have a strong balance sheet the cost is quite acceptable.
In terms of the utilization of our free cash flow, as I just said, we don't feel any compelling reason to bring the debt down more quickly than where it is right now other than required maturities. We feel we have the cash flow to support the capital program that we've outlined. We like the discipline of increasing our dividends. Of course, it's subject to board approval. But in the past several years, we've been raising our dividends early in each of the years. And then we'll probably operate with a cash balance of about $2 billion for opportunities and liquidity purposes. So to the extent that we sell more assets and that we have good cash flow, after we fund capital program and dividends, it would be available for additional share repurchase. So I think, Clayton, that covers what I'd like to do. I think we should open it up for questions now."

We can do that on $13 billion, $14 billion, $15 billion a year of capital and still raise our dividends, 5% to 10%. And so if you believe there will be a somewhat better oil price, which I think we believe with time there will be and are somewhat better natural gas price, not $3.50 per MCF, but maybe closer to $5 an MCF, then we think even at the levels of $60-plus distributions to our shareholders in the form of additional share repurchase gives us the best opportunity to be raising the share price on a normalized basis going forward with whatever assumptions you have for commodity prices. We do that by having fewer shares outstanding, more capital discipline and ultimately replacing our reserves and growing our production in absolute terms, but even more so on a per-metric, per-unit share.

And then the oil, we've really -- our portfolio, I don't think it's well understood in the marketplace. Our portfolio, what we have in Eagle Ford and the Bakken and the oil play of Barnett and other areas that we have, we're really getting more and more encouraged all the time that's why we're increasing our spend by about $1 billion or more in 2011. So we feel really good about that. Obviously, we got to deliver what we say we're going to do with APLNG, but we really feel that project is coming together, and that's pretty important, LNG projects in the future. And then we're having discovery success in Alaska, like Poseidon, but it's a little bit longer term. So LNG projects, what we are doing in the Lower 48, oil sands, and then we are going to go forward with the redevelopment of Ekofisk field and Eldfisk, we pretty certain about adding reserves there. So those are some of the big areas. Now on the exploration front, we've got Rak More, Moray well. And we've got more opportunities, more features to drill in the Caspian. We're looking for more acreage in Turkmenistan. We're looking for more acreage essentially in other plays in the world. But we also think we're uniquely positioned as a company, exploration-wise and maybe at BD wise for larger companies and smaller companies in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. We don't know what the rules and regulations are going to be. We don't know for sure what the risk/reward is going to be. But that's why we said in prior responses to questions that we've reserved a couple of billion dollars that we feel that we could go into some discovered resources and participate as an opportunity.

And thanks everybody, on the line for your interest in ConocoPhillips in our third quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO.

And thanks everybody, on the line for your interest in ConocoPhillips in our third quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO. And this morning we'll be discussing third quarter results and also provide an update on the status of our strategic initiatives.
 A summary of our key financial and operating results for the quarter will be provided, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And as in the past, you'll find our presentation materials on the IR section of the ConocoPhillips website.
 Before we get started, I'd like you to look at the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and Q&A. Actual results may differ materially from what's presented today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included in our filings with the SEC.
 Moving to Slide 3, a summary of our key third quarter results and highlights. You can see that earnings for the third quarter, adjusted for special items, were $2.2 billion or $1.50 per share, up 56% from this quarter a year ago. Cash from operations was $4.3 billion. Cash returns on capital employed was 20%. Upstream production, excluding LUKOIL, was 1.72 million BOE per day. Our refineries ran at relatively high-capacity utilization. R&M's adjusted earnings topped $1 billion through the first nine months of the year. We completed $6.3 billion of dispositions, including $6 billion of LUKOIL share sales. Debt was reduced by $2.7 billion during the quarter, and we ended with an $8 billion cash balance.
 So turning to Slide 4. Total company adjusted earnings were $2.2 billion, up over $800 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Both E&P and R&M improved earnings year-over-year. Our E&P segment improved $559 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Compared to the third quarter of last year, R&M adjusted earnings increased $174 million, mainly due to improved U.S. refining margins. The $149 million improvement in other reflects a reduction in corporate costs, as well as earnings improvements in our Midstream and Chemicals ventures. September 2010 year-to-date adjusted controllable costs were approximately $400 million lower compared with the same period in 2009. The improvement is evenly split between E&P and R&M segments. Total controllable costs, unadjusted for market factors and asset sales for the first nine months of 2010, were $9.6 billion compared to $9.4 billion during the same period in 2009.
 Moving to Slide 5, cash flow sources and uses. You can see that we generated $10.6 billion in cash during the quarter. $4.3 billion came from operations, and $6.3 billion in cash proceeds and dispositions, primary the LUKOIL stock sales. We repaid $2.7 billion of debt, funded $2.5 billion in capital, repurchased almost $900 million of ConocoPhillips common stock and paid over $800 million in dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had a cash balance of close to $8 billion, the majority of which we expect to use to repurchase ConocoPhillips shares.
 Now let's review our Upstream production on Slide 6. Third quarter production was 1.72 million BOE per day, down 4% or 74,000 BOE per day from the third quarter of last year. You can see from the chart that 14,000 per day of the reduction was due to market factors, including PSC impacts due to higher prices and royalty impacts at Foster Creek and Christina Lake. FCCL production continues to grow, however, higher royalty take caused a negative impact on reported production. Late in the quarter, we initiated production curtailments of approximately 180 Mcf equivalent or 30,000 BOE a day in response to continuing low gas prices in Western Canada and parts of the U.S. 27,000 barrels a day of production was lost due to asset sales of Syncrude and Lower 48 production. Maintenance activity was about the same as last year.
 The decrease in operations is mainly due to normal fuel decline, offset by new production. The majority of our decline came from North America, with almost 90,000 BOE per day and in the North sea, which had almost 40,000 BOE per day of lower production. Almost 75,000 barrels a day of new production from China, our SAGD operations in Canada, Australia and other locations partially offset this decline. Unplanned downtime was about the same as last year. And we'll talk more about the 2010 and 2011 production expectations later during the outlook portion of today's conference call.
 Turning to Slide 7. You can E&P's adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up almost 60% from the same quarter a year ago. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed more than $600 million of the increase in earnings. The earnings improvement was partially offset by $207 million decrease from lower sales volumes, primarily coming from normal fuel decline. The positive $149 million in other is largely comprised of lower dry hole costs and DD&A, partially offset by increased impairments and lower contributions from equity companies in Russia and Canada. Year-to-date 2010, E&P adjusted controllable costs improved by about $200 million compared with the first nine months of 2009. And looking at the table at the bottom of the slide, you can see that both the U.S. and international adjusted earnings improved significantly compared to last year.
 Let's go to Slide 8, E&P unit metrics. You can see that our metrics were significantly better than a year ago, reflecting the improvement in realized oil and gas prices. Third quarter E&P income increased $3.78 per BOE or 66% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the second quarter of this year, income and cash per BOE were slightly better, in spite of realized oil prices being down about 2%, and this is due to LNG, bitumen and U.S. natural gas prices all sequentially improving. As our OECD-focused portfolio shifts more towards oil sands, LNG, lower freight [ph] liquids production, we expect to see additional improvements in our income and cash flow per BOE metrics over time.
 Turning to R&M on Slide 9. You can see that Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings improved 185% over the same quarter last year. Downstream market conditions were stronger as global crack spreads improved 15%, and helped increase earnings by about $100 million. However, this quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by about $75 million due to inventory impacts and how we valued inventory. And we expect to recover this loss in the fourth quarter.
 Year-over-year, we saw, a decrease in R&M earnings of $18 million from lower volumes, which were primarily driven by the sale of Conoco Flying J Truck Stops. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization was slightly lower compared to the same period last year, and our international refining capacity rate was 60% during the quarter compared to 81% for the same period last year. This decrease in international reflects the shutdown of the Wilhelmshaven refinery. Excluding the impact of Wilhelmshaven, R&M ran at 93% of capacity and clean product yield improved almost 83%.
 Compared to the third quarter of last year, operating costs increased $22 million due to higher utilities and turnaround costs, which were partially offset by foreign exchange and asset sale benefits. However, through the end of the third quarter, controllable costs adjusted for market factors and asset sales were down around $200 million compared to the first nine months of last year. Lower effective tax rates and foreign exchange benefits made up the majority included in the $114 million bar, labeled other. Sequentially, our Downstream business was negatively impacted by lower earnings of more than $50 million from our Premium Coke and Chemical Feedstock business, and $70 million from lower contributions from marketing.
 Now let's move to Slide 10, which shows year-over-year variances for other segments. Adjusted corporate expenses were $162 million for the quarter compared to $286 million a year ago. These results exclude a $114 million Mako premium for early debt retirement. The $124 million sequential decline in corporate is primarily due to lower interest expense and higher foreign exchange gains. Foreign exchange gains were driven by U.S. dollar weakening against the Canadian dollar and British pound. Results in our DCP Midstream segment were $15 million higher this quarter compared to a year ago, mostly due to higher NGL prices. Sequentially, NGL prices were down $1.45 a barrel, but it recovered as a percentage of crude oil.
 Our 50% stake of CPChem generated $132 million. This represents almost $30 million more than the third quarter of last year, and was due to higher ethylene and polyethylene prices and margins. These higher margins were partially offset by higher utility and turnaround costs. During the quarter, ConocoPhillips received a $220 million distribution from CPChem.
 The LUKOIL segment generated $436 million in adjusted earnings for the quarter, and it's based on LUKOIL's second quarter reported earnings. We will discontinue equity accounting of the LUKOIL segment at the end of the third quarter and no longer report LUKOIL reported proved reserves or production.
 Turning to Slide 11, which provides more detail on the impact of the LUKOIL share sales. You can see that the chart shows undiscounted cash increase generated by our investment in LUKOIL stock. The green bars represent proceeds coming from dividends and the sale of stock. The first two provide the amount of after-tax proceeds from the dividends and shares sold through the end of the third quarter. The third bar estimates the amount of after-tax proceeds we would generate if the sale of the remaining shares was done at the closing price on October 21, 2010. Together, these proceeds total about $10 billion. The original acquisition cost of $170 million or 20% of LUKOIL shares amounted to $7.5 billion, leaving a cash increase of about $2.5 billion. As mentioned, we'll discontinue the use of equity accounting for the LUKOIL segment after this quarter and report earlier realized gains on future share sales as we reduce our ownership interest, which was 4.6% and 39.2 million shares as of yesterday.
 Looking at the impact of this decision on earnings per share and cash flow basis, if we assume an estimated proceeds of a $9 billion from our sale of the entire interest in LUKOIL were use to repurchase ConocoPhillips stock at $60 a share and we assume no equity earnings for LUKOIL were recorded , we estimate the net reduction on adjusted EPS to be about $0.16 per share this quarter or about 10%.
 Looking back over the last three years, a reduction in adjusted EPS would also have been about 10% on average. On a cash flow basis, the decision to sell LUKOIL and buy ConocoPhillips stock is accretive. This is due to the difference in dividend yield, as dividends received from LUKOIL, which were the only source of cash flow from the segment, we're less than the ConocoPhillips dividend saved from those shares purchased. Looking more narrowly at cash from operations on a per-share basis, on the average over the last three years, cash flow per share would have been about 10% higher.
 Moving to Slide 12, our capital structure. These graphs provide the last several quarters and two years history of equity and debt levels. During the first nine months of 2010, we reduced debt by more than $5 billion, bringing our debt level below $24 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of about $8 billion due largely to the sale of LUKOIL shares combined with the cash we had on hand at the end of the second quarter. And considering this cash position, our growth in equity net the cap rate would be around 18%. Majority of current cash position is expected to be used for the repurchase of ConocoPhillips stock. And while our debt-to-cap level is above our target of 20%, we don't plan to significantly reduce debt further over the next year or two.
 Let's move to Slide 13, which provides some history on distributions to shareholders. Since the formation of ConocoPhillips in 2002, we've grown dividends per share by 13.5% per year through the eight consecutive years of annual dividend increases. In addition to those dividend payments, we purchased $16.1 billion of stock during 2006 to 2008 time frame, and expect to purchase another $10 billion of ConocoPhillips stock in 2010 and 2011. These share repurchases have been divided by the fully diluted share count and are shown on the graph above on a per-share basis as the blue bars. Share repurchases have ramped up over the last couple of months. And through October 26, we've repurchased about 37 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. The average fully diluted share count during the third quarter was 1.493 billion. We believe this increase in shareholder distribution is an approach that differentiates us from most of our peers. We expect that the share repurchase will allow us to improve returns on capital while growing production on a per-share basis.
 Moving to Slide 14, which provides capital efficiency metrics. Our ROCE and cash returns have improved during the year, driven by earnings and cash flow growth while constraining capital employed expansion. Compared to this quarter last year, returns are higher. However, third quarter results were sequentially lower. And this decline was due to primarily to the third quarter adjusted earnings being about 10% lower than the second quarter, as well as some expansion in capital employed. We ended the third quarter with about $93.5 billion of capital employed, of which $24 billion is in R&M and $57 billion was in E&P. 2009 average capital employed was $87.5 billion. The $6 billion increase in third quarter capital employed came from currency translation effects and growth in retained earnings. The increase is partially offset by debt reduction and share repurchase.
 If we had repurchased about another $1.5 billion of additional shares, our ROCE for the quarter would have been closer to 11%. As execution of our capital allocation plans shift our spending toward E&P and our asset dispositions result in better margins per BOE, we expect to see our returns on capital employed expand further. That completes the review of the third quarter 2010 results. I'll wrap up with some forward-looking comments before asking Jim to make a few remarks and then open the line for questions.
 Consistent with the previous full year 2010 production guidance, we expect production to be flat with 2008 or about $1.8 million BOE per day, before dispositions and market factors. We anticipate fourth quarter E&P production to be close to that what it was in the third quarter. And during the fourth quarter, the production impact from asset dispositions will be between 40,000 and 50,000 barrels per day, natural gas production curtailment of 20,000 to 30,000 BOE per day, while price and PSC effects are expected to reduce production by 10,000 to 20,000 BOE per day. We expect 2011 production to be 2% lower than 2010 before considering the impact of 2011 E&P dispositions, so around 1.7 million BOE per day. We'll give you more information about our 2011 production targets, sources of production growth and regional plans early next year.
 In our R&M business, we expect fourth quarter turnaround activity to increase significantly, with pretax expenses to be around $200 million and total pretax expense for the year of around $450 million. Fourth quarter utilization rates should be almost 80%, and capacity utilization in the U.S. would be around 85%. And the international utilization rate is expected to be in the low 60% range, which includes the impact of Wilhelmshaven. Regarding controllable costs, we are on track to deliver our cost reduction targets of about $350 million from E&P and $200 million from refining and marketing.
 For full year 2010, we expect unadjusted corporate expense to be approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital program for 2010 is expected to be between $10 billion and $11 billion, down from earlier guidance and from 2009 levels. This is due to permitting delays and slow pace of development, primarily in Asia-Pacific, North Sea and North America. 2011 capital program is expected to increase to around $13 billion, with the ramp-up of Lower 48 shale activity and the APLNG project being key drivers of the increase over 2010 spending levels. We'll provide you with more information on our 2011 capital program in December and give you more detail at our March 23 Analyst Meeting in New York.
 Moving to exploration. We expect 2010 exploration expense of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We completed Wildcat in the North Sea, which was determined to be a dry hole. Our 30% interest in the well resulted in a $6 million after-tax charge. In the Caspian, the Rak More well spud in the third quarter, and we may be able to provide some well results on our January earnings conference call. In the Arafura Sea, we expect to spud our first well in the fourth quarter and the second well in 2011. We have 51% interest in those wells. Additionally, the 20% owned Dalsnuten Wildcat that spud in the third quarter, we expect it to TD late in 2010. And we will begin the next appraisal phase on Poseidon Offshore Browse basin in Australia during the first half of 2011. Several development options are being discussed, and the final determination regarding development is dependent upon the upcoming appraisal wells.
 We continue to increase the pace of drilling activity in the liquid-rich shale plays at the Eagle Ford, Bakken, North Barnett and Cardium. At Eagle Ford, we had eight rigs drilling at the end of the quarter, nine are drilling currently, and 11 are expected by the end of October. Additionally, we have secured two dedicated frac cruise for 2010, and expect to increase that number to three early next year. We've drilled a total of 33 wells in the Eagle Ford shale, completed 20, and are seeing production of roughly 8,000 BOE per day from the 14 wells that we brought online to date.
 In the liquids-rich Cardium area at Western Canada, we'll be drilling nine operated wells and participating in six non-operated wells during the fourth quarter. These wells are almost all oil-producing with some associated gas. Also in Canada, we continue to see good return and production growth opportunities in our SAGD areas: Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Surmont. We expect production of around 60,000 BOE per day this year from these projects, with a compound annual growth rate over the next five years estimated between 10% and 15%.
 In Australia, APLNG is engaged with several potential LNG buyers in support of moving to FID, but we're not in a position to discuss information regarding specific market discussion at this time. However, we plan to have an announcement regarding the sale of two trains of LNG before year end. Our plans to sell $10 billion in assets by the end of 2011 are on track. And so far this year, we've closed transactions with proceeds of $5.6 billion and expect proceeds of roughly $7 billion by year end. We may sell more than $10 billion in assets during 2010 and 2011.
 The assets being sold in 2010 have a production of approximately 55,000 BOE per day. Most of the Lower 48 and Western Canadian E&P assets will be closed in the fourth quarter and will generate about $1.5 billion in proceeds. We expect the 2010 full year average production impact of asset dispositions to be roughly 20,000 BOE per day, with a reduction of reserves of about 310 million BOE. Assets which may be sold as part of the 2011 program include our Wilhelmshaven refinery, additional Lower 48 and Western Canada E&P assets and other international assets in both Upstream and Downstream businesses. The REX pipeline is outside the 2011 scope.
 As we did this year, we intend to provide you with production, reserve and earnings impacts resulting from our asset sales program during the first quarter of 2011. Our guidance of spending $10 billion on share repurchase over 10,000 on '10 and 10,000 in '11 remains unchanged. Our current Board of Directors authorization is for $5 billion. So that concludes my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over now to Jim Mulva for his comments before we open the call for questions. Jim?

First, from an operating point of view, we've operated quite well all of this year and through the third quarter. We're doing really quite well on not only the operations but the cost constraint. We're maintaining our facilities certainly, but we're doing well in cost constraint, and as a result of good commitment by our employees and the help of our contractors.
 In terms of the portfolio restructuring, we're right on track, no change in strategy, quite covered the asset dispositions. I think there to see opportunity as we go through 2011. And we'll update you what time. We could be doing more than somewhat more than $10 billion of asset sales. We're on track on the restructuring where we want to move E&P up towards more as a portion of our portfolio and refining and marketing from 25% with time closer to 15%.
 Capital guidance, we're probably going to spend closer to $10 billion this year, with expectations of capital spending closer to or above $13 billion this next year. Clayton indicated LUKOIL dispositions, we still have about 4.6% ownership. At LUKOIL share prices we are currently experiencing, we continue to sell our shares. So I think if these market levels continue, you'll see us dispose of all of our interest in LUKOIL far more quickly than when the guidance of which would be the end of 2011. We continue to buy ConocoPhillips shares in the marketplace. And as the slide indicates, guidance shows that we would spend may be closer to about $4 billion in 2010 for purchase of ConocoPhillips shares, with about $6 billion this next year. The board has approved $5 billion program, but we've indicated the proceeds from the LUKOIL disposition would go essentially towards share repurchase.
 In terms of debt reduction, our debt is in the neighborhood of $23.5 billion. We don't have any required maturities left this year. The debt is quite efficient. In this next year, we have some required maturities which might be in the neighborhood of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. We'll certainly retire those. But we have no real compelling economic reason to accelerate and buy more of our debt. So we're quite satisfied with the debt. It will come down over the next several years with required maturities, but still, longer term, I think we question going much below $20 billion in debt because we have a strong balance sheet across is quite acceptable.
 In terms of the utilization of our free cash flow, as I just said, we don't feel any compelling reason to bring the debt down more quickly than where it is right now other than required maturities. We feel we have the cash flow to support the capital program that we've outlined. We like the discipline of increasing our dividends. Of course, it's subject to board approval. But in the past several years, we've been raising our dividends early in each of the years. And then that we'll probably operate with a cash balance of about $2 billion for opportunities and liquidity purposes. So to the extent that we sell more assets and that we have good cash flow, after we fund capital program and dividends, it would be available for additional share repurchase. So I think Clayton that covers what I'd like to do. I think we should open it up for questions now.

So the question is on the refining side of the business and the aggressiveness to reduce our exposure restructuring wise.

We did indicate about a year ago that we felt that the environment for transactions and restructuring would be more amenable to be in the 2012 time period. But I think you make a good point that we're starting to see that there is maybe a little more interest and opportunities for restructuring more quickly than waiting until 2012 and 2013. So we are working pretty hard. We want to make sure that whatever we do, we're doing it in a way that's not really destroying value for the shareholder.

The changes for executives that are retiring has nothing to do with health or performance issues. The objective is very clear and very simple: to put in place the future management team. And out of that group of individuals will come my replacement and this will be down over the next couple of years, and then that table continue on.

So what's left then as we have a lot of cash that's available not for making a large acquisition, that's available for additional share repurchase above the $10 billion number. It's not that we're trying to signal in any way that it's available to make a significant acquisition. No, we're not changing our strategy, it's more available for distributions to the shareholders.

And with the announcement of the strategy of what we've been doing with the company this past year, we'll continue going forward in 2011 and subsequent time periods. Management is never happy with the share price being what it is today. But if we look at what we're trying to do is it really increases and normalized earnings and cash flow per share given our asset base and our opportunities. We feel that we can, over the next number of years, be spending $13 billion, $14 billion a year, and we can convert our resources and replace our reserves, and then ultimately in the 2014, 2015 time period, drew our absolute level of production. We can do that on $13 billion, $14 billion, $15 billion a year of capital and still raise our dividends, 5% to 10%. And so if you believe there will be a somewhat better oil price, which I think we believe with time there will be and are somewhat better natural gas price, not $3.50 per MCF, but maybe closer to $5 an MCF, then we think even at the levels of $60-plus distributions to our shareholders in the form of additional share repurchase gives us the best opportunity to be raising the share price on a normalized basis going forward with whatever assumptions you have for commodity prices. We do that by having fewer shares outstanding, more capital discipline and ultimately replacing our reserves and growing our production in absolute terms, but even more so on a per-metric, per-unit share. And so we feel that we continue to look at it, but we think there's an opportunity for quite a bit more share repurchase.

But conversion of the oil sands is a pretty significant part of our conversion and reserve replacement over the next five years. We feel really good about that. And then the oil, we've really -- our portfolio, I don't think it's well understood in the marketplace. Our portfolio, what we have in Eagle Ford and the Bakken and the oil play of Barnett and other areas that we have, we're really getting more and more encouraged all the time that's why we're increasing our spend by about $1 billion or more in 2011. So we feel really good about that. Obviously, we got to deliver what we say we're got to do at APLNG, but we really feel that project is coming together, and that's pretty important, LNG projects in the future. And then we're having discovery success in Alaska, like Poseidon, but it's a little bit longer term. So LNG projects, what we are doing in the Lower 48, oil sands, and then we are going to go forward with the redevelopment of Ekofisk field and Eldfisk, we pretty certain about adding reserves there. So those are some of the big areas. Now on the exploration front, we've got Rock More, Moray well. And we've got more opportunities, more features to drill in the Caspian. We're looking for more acreage in Turkmenistan. We're looking for more acreage essentially in other place in the world. But we also think we're uniquely positioned as a company, exploration-wise and maybe at BD wise for larger companies and smaller companies in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. We don't know what the rules and regulations are going to be. We don't know for sure what the risk/reward is going to be. But that's why we said in prior responses to questions that we've reserved a couple of billion dollars that we feel that we could go into some discovered resources and participate as an opportunity for all of these reasons. We really believe pretty strongly, and we'll update everyone in the March Analyst Meeting of the conversion process, the reserve replacement and doing that competitively finding and development costs.

First, we believe from a political process, let's not create winners and losers and get any into things that are heavily subsidized or the only way they work is you need to have continuation of governmental incentives. But we have quite an opportunity, so it's prior question [ph]. We have so much to do in our traditional Oil and Gas business or the E&P. We're going to allocate all of our money essentially towards that. And about $1 billion, $1.5 billion in the Downstream, primarily for maintenance capital and some payout opportunities. But then you'll see us ramping up more, our spend for technology and research. A lot of that goes towards more on the business side. But also just to the things you're talking about, we think it makes a lot more sense to be spending money in understanding and making some technology breakthroughs than to start spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in businesses that are questionable value creators for the shareholder and dependent upon subsidies from the government. So we're going to study and work this, but we're going to do it primarily through ramping up money that we're spending on research and technology.
