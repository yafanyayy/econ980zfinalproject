Thanks for getting on the call.As normal, we'll start with a general business update and talk a little bit about the fourth quarter and year-end results and then go into a Q&A session. On the call this morning with me, are Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Spence, our Chief Operating Officer.This morning, as you know, we released our fourth quarter and year-end results. And for the fourth quarter we reported earnings of $0.40 a share on a GAAP basis, compared with earnings of $0.74 a share a year ago. Our 2009 full-year GAAP results were $1.08, compared to $2.47 per share in 2008. We're very pleased to report that our 2009 earnings from ongoing operations based on a very strong fourth quarter were $1.95 per share, well-ahead of our forecast for the year. In the fourth quarter, earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share versus $0.46 a year ago.Our strong performance in some pretty difficult times, I think, speaks well of our assets and our overall model and about our dedication of our employees to help us work our way through a pretty tough year in the economy. We're able to outperform a very challenging business plan for the year, and we had very solid operating performance and some higher wholesale energy margins.We implemented a cost-reduction initiative early in the year, and that was an important contributor to our strong results for 2009. On the operating front, we set annual electricity generation records at some of our power plants in Pennsylvania and Montana. Some of these 2009 accomplishments will drive longer-term benefits for our shareowners and customers. We successfully transitioned to competition in Pennsylvania this year and we completed a successful regulatory review process in the United Kingdom that sets our electric delivery prices for the next five years.Decisions to move ahead with major hydroelectric expansions in Pennsylvania and Montana were made. And the NRC approved a 20-year renewal of our operating license for the two units at the Susquehanna nuclear plant.Let's move on to 2010. This morning, we as well reaffirmed our 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 a share. The midpoint of our 2010 forecast represents nearly 70% increase over our 2009 earnings from ongoing operations. The main driver of this significant increase of course, is the expected strong growth in energy margins in our Supply business. I'd just like to briefly comment on a couple of public policy issues before we turn the call over to Paul and Bill.As you all are seeing out there in the news, it appears very unlikely that we'll see congressional action regarding CO2 emissions in the near future. We do continue to believe that certainty would be beneficial as the industry moves down the road, but I'm not real optimistic that there will be definitive legislation action anytime soon. Meanwhile, PPL and other utility companies will provide input as the Environmental Protection Agency process moves forward. In Pennsylvania, our rate caps have expired for the customers of PPL Electric Utilities. There's been substantial competitive retail supplier activity in this service area and that benefits not only PPL but it's customers as well. As of this week, more than 288,000 of the company's 1.4 million electric delivery customers have selected an alternate electricity provider. As a result, more than 40% of the electricity being used in electric utility service territory is being supplied by alternate suppliers. So this really reinforces that the competitive marketplace is working well for the customers in Pennsylvania as was intended. Needless to say, we're continuing to provide customers with information about their supply options and on ways they can use their energy more wisely. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Farr."
185508,85173796,48727,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2010",2010-02-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone.

As Jim m",623,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that 2008 earnings from ongoing operations include the operating results of the Gas Delivery business but exclude special items related to its divestiture last year. As Jim mentioned, our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year, primarily driven by higher energy margins on the Supply segment, and higher delivery margins at WPD. Lower earnings in our Pennsylvania Delivery segment were a slight drag on the quarter.  I'll summarize the key earnings drivers by segment for 2009 and then get into our 2010 earnings forecast. Let's start with the Supply segment performance for 2009 on Slide 7.The Supply segment earned $0.88 per share in 2009, a $0.07 increase over 2008 results. Clearly, the single biggest driver of the comparative margins was the $0.20 in trading losses in 2008 that we incurred when the market experienced a dramatic decline in wholesale energy prices and power-market liquidity. Other positive drivers of energy margins for the Supply business segment in 2009 included higher value from our generation portfolio, partially offset by lower net margins from load-following agreements due to lower customer demand, higher operations and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation.Turning to Slide 8, our Pennsylvania Delivery segment earned $0.35 per share in 2009, a $0.09 decline compared to 2008. This decrease was the net result of lower delivery margins, primarily due to milder weather in the weak economy, as well as higher financing cost due to the pre-funding of a portion of PPL Electric Utilities 2009 debt maturity in October of 2008.Turning to Slide 9, our International Delivery segment earned $0.72 per share in 2009, a $0.05 decline compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by less favorable currency exchange rates in 2009 compared with 2008. The FX impact was partially offset by higher delivery margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to inflation and a more favorable customer mix, lower O&M, primarily driven by lower pension expense, lower interest expense on WPD's index-linked bonds and lower U.K. income taxes.Turning to Slide 10. As previously mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 per share. The higher expected earnings are driven by strong growth in energy margins from the generation portfolio and primarily based on hedged power and fuel prices, as well as established capacity prices in PJM for this year. These higher energy margins are expected to be partially offset by lower earnings at WPD, primarily driven by higher income taxes, higher pension expense and higher financing costs, which are in turn expected to be partially offset by higher delivery margins and more favorable currency exchange rates, higher O&M in the Supply segment, higher O&M in the Pennsylvania Delivery business segment, due to increased funding for customer programs, increased vegetation management and expected higher uncollectible expenses, as well as higher depreciation. Factoring in all of these drivers, we expect approximately 77% of our 2010 earnings will come from our Supply segment, International to contribute 15% and the Pennsylvania Delivery segment, 8%.On Slide 11, we've updated our free cash flow before dividend numbers to reflect 2009 actual results, as well as a few minor changes for 2010. The variances to 2009 from the numbers presented during the third quarter call, primarily result from increased earnings, moving the anticipated closing of the sale of the Long Island assets to 2010 and changes in working capital. We do expect the Long Island sale to close very soon. The 2010 forecast for the International segment reflects adjustments to CapEx, resulting from the completion of DPCR5, as well as more current projections of exchange rates.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

Let's turn to Slide 12 and I'm going to start with an update on our Delivery businesses.Last month, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission conducted a binding poll, which indicates their intent to approve the",945,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 12 and I'm going to start with an update on our Delivery businesses.Last month, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission conducted a binding poll, which indicates their intent to approve the PPL Electric Utilities portion of the Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV Transmission Line. A final order from the PUC is expected later this month. We continue to work with the National Park Service to secure the relevant approvals for a small section of an existing line that would be upgraded as part of this project. PJM continues to support the need for this line in the May 2012 in-service date. As Jim mentioned, more than 288,000 PPL Electric Utilities customers have selected an alternate competitive electric supplier for 2010. There are about 27 different retail suppliers providing electricity supply in the PPL EU territories, seven of them are focused on residential customers. We've continued to encourage our customers to shop to take advantage of opportunities, as well as the many options that PPL provides for reducing electric usage. I do want to stress that the effects of customer switching will have no material financial impact on PPL as a result of our 2010 generation hedging strategy.For PPL Electric Utilities, of course, this is just a passthrough of cost and therefore does not affect that business segment at all. Our Supply segment is not materially affected as it sold only 3% of its 2010 expected generation in the load-following type transactions. This of course includes transactions with PPL Electric Utilities.Let me also provide a brief update on the Electric Utilities 2011 to mid-2013 polar procurement process. PPL Electric Utilities recently completed their third solicitation, which covered the 11-month period from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011, and thus far, approximately one-third of the 2011 polar supplies having contracted by Electric Utilities under their PUC-approved procurement plan. One final note on the PPL Electric Utilities side. Retail sales at the utility in the fourth quarter were 2.9% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 on a weather-normalized basis. This decrease was driven by lower industrial sales, which dropped by 9.6% for the quarter. For the full year, retail sales were down 3.1%, driven by lower industrial sales of 11.9%. Even though electric utility sales are down, distribution revenue has not declined significantly because of the rate structure for industrial customers, which is largely based on customer demand charges, rather than kilowatt-hour charges. For 2010, we're expecting 1.7% load recovery compared to 2009.Turning to Slide 13, in our International segment, as Jim mentioned, Ofgem, the U.K. regulator has issued its final proposals for their fifth price control review period. We feel it's fair and produced, a constructive outcome for WPD. The result allows for an average increase in revenues of 6.9% per year plus inflation. The higher revenues are the result of a achieving an approved plan, which forecast a capital spending increase of 31% and operating expense increases of 14%. Additionally, the exceptional performance by WPD has earned us additional revenue of over $240 million with the potential to earn above this under the Ofgem incentive programs. The components of the revenue bonus are outlined for you in this slide.Now moving on to supply, I'm pleased to report that as a direct result of the hard work by our dedicated employees, the Susquehanna nuclear station set a generation record in 2009. The plant safely and reliably generated almost 19.5 million megawatt hours last year and Unit 1 set its own generation record, producing almost 10.5 million megawatt hours. The station also received NRC approval for 20-year operating license extensions for both units. We also set new generation records for our hydro output in Montana and in our Brunner Island station in Pennsylvania. On the hydroelectric front, PPL received FERC approval to expand our Holtwood hydro plant in Pennsylvania. Construction on this 125-megawatt expansion has already begun and we expect to finish the work in the spring of 2013.In Montana, we also have begun construction to expand the Rainbow hydro plant. That expansion and redevelopment will replace several small units with a combined capacity of 37 megawatts with a single 60-megawatt unit. Construction is expected to be completed in 2012.In the fourth quarter, we also completed our final scrubber construction project when we placed the second scrubber at the Brunner Island plant in service. All the scrubbers, including those at the Montour facility, were successfully completed on time, safely and within budget. This was over a five-year, $1.4 billion effort and again, just a great job by our employees. Finally in November, we completed the sales of the majority of our hydro assets in Maine for about $81 million. Moving on to an update of our hedge program on Slide 15, we've updated our hedge positions as of December 31. These levels have not changed substantially from the update we've provided you at the end of the third quarter. We continue to hedge our 2010-through-'12 expected economic generation, primarily through auction collars to protect against downward price movements and allow some upside if market prices recover. This collar approach protects the base-load generation from the volumetric risk associated with load-following contracts as well as the associated price risk. In addition, all of our capacity has been hedged, primarily through selling forward capacity in RPM Auctions.On the fuel cycle, we've contracted for 100% of our uranium needs through 2012 as shown on Slide 16 and for 2010, our wholly-owned plants are fully hedged for coal, with only a small open position at Keystone and Conemaugh. No I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Miller for the Q&A. Jim?"

We had a very solid fourth quarter. We went into the quarter, a little sort from a power perspective, as we saw our prices decline and recognize that we had a natural hedge in the load-following deals that we had. So if power prices would have risen and that would have logically been driven by customer demand, there was a natural offset. So at the front end of the quarter, we got some benefit by being a little bit short in our power book. And then, as we got to the month of December, at the very back end of the quarter, we saw some very good customer demand pick up as a result of the cold weather. And that clearly benefited the load-following deals and that's continued to bid into obviously, January. The cost-reduction initiative that Jim outlined at the very beginning of the year, a whole series of things that we did to try to address cost early, when it looked like, marketing was going to start to come down in a meaningful way for us, got us probably in the $0.12 to $0.13 land for the year. And then I think we handled the demand destruction extremely well, through a whole series of initiatives that the guys took in the various books, the generation book and the marketing book. And then, as well, strong generation performance, really throughout the year, x the loss of a unit at coal strip that we had that ultimately in Q3 and Q4, we did get some insurance recovery on from a business continuity perspective. So I think it was steady performance, Paul, throughout the year. And Capstone again by very strong generation performance and a very strong marketing and trading perspective in the last quarter as well."

Thanks for getting on the call.As normal, we'll start with a general business update and talk a little bit about the fourth quarter and year-end results and then go into a Q&A session. On the call this morning with me, are Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Spence, our Chief Operating Officer.This morning, as you know, we released our fourth quarter and year-end results. And for the fourth quarter we reported earnings of $0.40 a share on a GAAP basis, compared with earnings of $0.74 a share a year ago. Our 2009 full-year GAAP results were $1.08, compared to $2.47 per share in 2008. We're very pleased to report that our 2009 earnings from ongoing operations based on a very strong fourth quarter were $1.95 per share, well-ahead of our forecast for the year. In the fourth quarter, earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share versus $0.46 a year ago.Our strong performance in some pretty difficult times, I think, speaks well of our assets and our overall model and about our dedication of our employees to help us work our way through a pretty tough year in the economy. We're able to outperform a very challenging business plan for the year, and we had very solid operating performance and some higher wholesale energy margins.We implemented a cost-reduction initiative early in the year, and that was an important contributor to our strong results for 2009. On the operating front, we set annual electricity generation records at some of our power plants in Pennsylvania and Montana. Some of these 2009 accomplishments will drive longer-term benefits for our shareowners and customers. We successfully transitioned to competition in Pennsylvania this year and we completed a successful regulatory review process in the United Kingdom that sets our electric delivery prices for the next five years.Decisions to move ahead with major hydroelectric expansions in Pennsylvania and Montana were made. And the NRC approved a 20-year renewal of our operating license for the two units at the Susquehanna nuclear plant.Let's move on to 2010. This morning, we as well reaffirmed our 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 a share. The midpoint of our 2010 forecast represents nearly 70% increase over our 2009 earnings from ongoing operations. The main driver of this significant increase of course, is the expected strong growth in energy margins in our Supply business. I'd just like to briefly comment on a couple of public policy issues before we turn the call over to Paul and Bill.As you all are seeing out there in the news, it appears very unlikely that we'll see congressional action regarding CO2 emissions in the near future. We do continue to believe that certainty would be beneficial as the industry moves down the road, but I'm not real optimistic that there will be definitive legislation action anytime soon. Meanwhile, PPL and other utility companies will provide input as the Environmental Protection Agency process moves forward. In Pennsylvania, our rate caps have expired for the customers of PPL Electric Utilities. There's been substantial competitive retail supplier activity in this service area and that benefits not only PPL but it's customers as well. As of this week, more than 288,000 of the company's 1.4 million electric delivery customers have selected an alternate electricity provider. As a result, more than 40% of the electricity being used in electric utility service territory is being supplied by alternate suppliers. So this really reinforces that the competitive marketplace is working well for the customers in Pennsylvania as was intended. Needless to say, we're continuing to provide customers with information about their supply options and on ways they can use their energy more wisely. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Farr."
185508,85173796,48945,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2010",2010-02-05,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone.

As Jim m",622,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that 2008 earnings from ongoing operations include the operating results of the Gas Delivery business but exclude special items related to its divestiture last year. As Jim mentioned, our fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were higher than last year, primarily driven by higher energy margins in the Supply segment and higher delivery margins at WPD. Lower earnings in our Pennsylvania Delivery segment were a slight drag on the quarter.  I'll summarize the key earnings drivers by segment for 2009 and then get into our 2010 earnings forecast. Let's start with the Supply segment performance for 2009 on Slide 7.The Supply segment earned $0.88 per share in 2009, a $0.07 increase over 2008 results. Clearly, the single biggest driver of the comparative margins was the $0.20 in trading losses in 2008 that we incurred when the market experienced a dramatic decline in wholesale energy prices and power-market liquidity. Other positive drivers of energy margins for the Supply business segment in 2009 included higher value from our generation portfolio, partially offset by lower net margins from load-following agreements due to lower customer demand, higher operations and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation.Turning to Slide 8, our Pennsylvania Delivery segment earned $0.35 per share in 2009, a $0.09 decline compared to 2008. This decrease was the net result of lower delivery margins, primarily due to milder weather in the weak economy, as well as higher financing cost due to the pre-funding of a portion of PPL Electric Utilities 2009 debt maturity in October of 2008.Turning to Slide 9, our International Delivery segment earned $0.72 per share in 2009, a $0.05 decline compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by less favorable currency exchange rates in 2009 compared with 2008. The FX impact was partially offset by higher delivery margins, primarily driven by higher prices due to inflation and a more favorable customer mix, lower O&M, primarily driven by lower pension expense, lower interest expense on WPD's index-linked bonds and lower U.K. income taxes.Turning to Slide 10. As previously mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 per share. The higher expected earnings are driven by strong growth in energy margins from the generation portfolio and primarily based on hedged power and fuel prices, as well as established capacity prices in PJM for this year. These higher energy margins are expected to be partially offset by lower earnings at WPD, primarily driven by higher income taxes, higher pension expense and higher financing costs, which are in turn expected to be partially offset by higher delivery margins and more favorable currency exchange rates, higher O&M in the Supply segment, higher O&M in the Pennsylvania Delivery business segment, due to increased funding for customer programs, increased vegetation management and expected higher uncollectible expenses, as well as higher depreciation. Factoring in all these drivers, we expect approximately 77% of our 2010 earnings will come from our Supply segment, International to contribute 15% and the Pennsylvania Delivery segment, 8%.On Slide 11, we've updated our free cash flow before dividend numbers to reflect 2009 actual results, as well as a few minor changes for 2010. The variances to 2009 from the numbers presented during the third quarter call primarily result from increased earnings, moving the anticipated closing of the sale of the Long Island assets to 2010 and changes in working capital. We do expect the Long Island sale to close very soon. The 2010 forecast for the International segment reflects adjustments to CapEx, resulting from the completion of DPCR5, as well as more current projections of exchange rates.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

Let's turn to Slide 12 and I'm going to start with an update on our Delivery businesses.Last month, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission conducted a binding poll which indicates their intent to approve the P",947,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 12 and I'm going to start with an update on our Delivery businesses.Last month, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission conducted a binding poll which indicates their intent to approve the PPL Electric Utilities portion of the Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV Transmission Line. A final order from the PUC is expected later this month. We continue to work with the National Park Service to secure the relevant approvals for a small section of an existing line that would be upgraded as part of this project. PJM continues to support the need for this line in the May 2012 in-service date. As Jim mentioned, more than 288,000 PPL Electric Utilities customers have selected an alternate competitive electric supplier for 2010. There are about 27 different retail suppliers providing electricity supply in the PPL EU territories, seven of them are focused on residential customers. We've continued to encourage our customers to shop to take advantage of opportunities, as well as the many options that PPL provides for reducing electric usage. I do want to stress that the effects of customer switching will have no material financial impact on PPL as a result of our 2010 generation hedging strategy.For PPL Electric Utilities, of course, this is just a passthrough of cost and therefore does not affect that business segment at all. Our Supply segment is not materially affected as it sold only 3% of its 2010 expected generation in the load-following type transactions. This of course includes transactions with PPL Electric Utilities.Let me also provide a brief update on the Electric Utilities 2011 to mid-2013 polar procurement process. PPL Electric Utilities recently completed their third solicitation, which covered the 11-month period from January 1, 2011, through November 30, 2011, and thus far, approximately one-third of the 2011 polar supplies having contracted by Electric Utilities under their PUC-approved procurement plan. One final note on the PPL Electric Utilities side, retail sales at the utility in the fourth quarter were 2.9% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 on a weather-normalized basis. This decrease was driven by lower industrial sales which dropped by 9.6% for the quarter. For the full year, retail sales were down 3.1%, driven by lower industrial sales of 11.9%. Even though electric utility sales are down, distribution revenue has not declined significantly because of the rate structure for industrial customers, which is largely based on customer demand charges, rather than kilowatt-hour charges. For 2010, we're expecting 1.7% load recovery compared to 2009.Turning to Slide 13, in our International segment, as Jim mentioned, Ofgem, the U.K. Regulator, has issued its final proposals for their fifth price control review period. We feel it was fair and produced a constructive outcome for WPD. The result allows for an average increase in revenues of 6.9% per year plus inflation. The higher revenues are the result of achieving an approved plan, which forecast a capital spending increase of 31% and operating expense increases of 14%. Additionally, the exceptional performance by WPD has earned us additional revenue of over $240 million with the potential to earn above this under the Ofgem incentive programs. The components of the revenue bonus are outlined for you in this slide.Now moving on to supply, I'm pleased to report that as a direct result of the hard work by our dedicated employees, the Susquehanna nuclear station set a generation record in 2009. The plant safely and reliably generated almost 19.5 million megawatt hours last year and Unit 1 set its own generation record, producing almost 10.5 million megawatt hours. The station also received NRC approval for 20-year operating license extensions for both units. We also set new generation records for our hydro output in Montana and in our Brunner Island station in Pennsylvania. On a hydroelectric front, PPL received FERC approval to expand our Holtwood hydro plant in Pennsylvania. Construction on this 125-megawatt expansion has already begun and we expect to finish the work in the spring of 2013.In Montana, we also have begun construction to expand the Rainbow hydro plant. That expansion and redevelopment will replace several small units with a combined capacity of 37 megawatts with a single 60-megawatt unit. Construction is expected to be completed in 2012.In the fourth quarter, we also completed our final scrubber construction project when we placed the second scrubber at the Brunner Island plant in service. All the scrubbers, including those at the Montour facility, were successfully completed on time, safely and within budget. This was over a five-year, $1.4 billion effort and again, just a great job by our employees. Finally in November, we completed the sale of the majority of our hydro assets in Maine for about $81 million. Moving on to an update of our hedge program on Slide 15, we've updated our hedge positions as of December 31. These levels have not changed substantially from the update we've provided you at the end of the third quarter. We continue to hedge our 2010 through '12 expected economic generation, primarily through auction collars to protect against downward price movements and allow some upside if market prices recover. This collared approach protects the base-load generation from the volumetric risk associated with load-following contracts as well as the associated price risk. In addition, all of our capacity has been hedged, primarily through selling forward capacity in RPM Auctions.On the fuel cycle, we've contracted for 100% of our uranium needs through 2012 as shown on Slide 16 and for 2010, our wholly-owned plants are fully hedged for coal, with only a small open position at Keystone and Conemaugh. No I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Miller for the Q&A. Jim?"

And you can see some of the net effect of the degradation that I talked about from the movements in pension and interest expense and the benefit being offset by the revenue. I will say that when you look at the comment that Bill made about the north of 6% average increase over the five years, Inland revenue did shape that so that the upfront impact to the consumer was lower. So that when we look at the shape of the margins, we are much more benefited at the back end of the five-year plan, specifically in '13, '14 than we are at the front end. So that kept down the headline rate to the consumer but allowed the companies to earn over the five years, what we think was a fair return, a fair trade-off for the items that they did change. So I mean, we don't have a forecast out beyond 2010, but I would expect an earnings profile that would grow through the five years off of the 2010 number."

We had a very solid fourth quarter. We went into the quarter a little sort from a power perspective as we saw our prices decline and recognize that we had a natural hedge in the load-following deals that we had. So if power prices would have risen and that would have logically been driven by customer demand, there was a natural offset. So at the front end of the quarter, we got some benefit by being a little bit short in our power book. And then, as we got to the month of December, at the very back end of the quarter, we saw some very good customer demand pick up as a result of the cold weather. And that clearly benefited the load-following deals and that's continued to bid into obviously, January. The cost-reduction initiative that Jim outlined at the very beginning of the year, a whole series of things that we did to try to address cost early, when it looked like, marketing was going to start to come down in a meaningful way for us, got us probably in the $0.12 to $0.13 land for the year. And then I think we handled the demand destruction extremely well, through a whole series of initiatives that the guys took in the various books, the generation book and the marketing book. And then, as well, strong generation performance, really throughout the year, x the loss of a unit at coal strip that we had that ultimately in Q3 and Q4, we did get some insurance recovery on from a business continuity perspective. So I think it was steady performance, Paul, throughout the year and capstoned again by very strong generation performance and a very strong marketing and trading perspective in the last quarter as well."

Thank you, Joe and thanks to all of you for joining us for the second time in a week to hear some more pertinent information about our quarter and other items. We’ll start today’s call of course with our general session and commentary on first quarter and then we’ll get right into questions. And with me today Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, and Bill Spence, our Chief Operating Officer.
This morning, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.66 a share with $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Earnings from ongoing operations for the first quarter were up substantially from a year ago, $0.94 per share this year versus $0.60 per share in 2009. As we fully expected, we did achieve dramatically higher earnings from our supply segment in 2010 following the expiration of a decade-long contract with our electric delivery company in Pennsylvania.
Supply segment earnings from ongoing operations were nearly triple what they were in the first quarter of last year. 2010 supply segment earnings are benefiting from the fact that we locked in wholesale energy crisis that are much higher than the current market crisis. The substantial gains we saw on our supply segment for the quarter were somewhat offset by lower earnings in both our delivery businesses in Pennsylvania and the United Kingdom.
This morning, we also reaffirmed our 2010 forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 per share in earnings from ongoing operations. And our forecast for GAAP earnings for the year reflected special items that were recorded in the first quarter now stand at $2.82 to $3.22 per share.
Although, challenges still persist in our sector, including low energy prices, lower electricity demand and some lingering economic uncertainty, we are well positioned, because we’ve hedged virtually 100% of our expected generation out for the year. And Paul will outline the other major drivers of our 2010 earnings forecast in just a moment.
We continue to expect the performance of our supply business for the year will overcome lower returns from our delivery businesses, which have been pressured by somewhat higher O&M costs.
Just a couple of brief comments on the announcements last week regarding our plans to acquire E.ON US. As I said at the time, the transformational transaction for PPL, the one that creates a stronger, more diversified enterprise that retains the considerable upsides from our high quality supply business from the inevitable improvements in wholesale power prices. So our plan to close this transaction by the end of the year and we’ll keep you informed regarding our progress on that effort.
One more item to highlight before turning the call over to Paul and Bill. In late March, we did file a request with the Pennsylvania PUC for a 2.4% increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities, which would be effective January 1, 2011. So the PUC review process is underway and we expect a decision on a request late this year.
Meanwhile, the transition to a competitive electricity market in the PPL Electric Utilities service area has been very successful. More than 410,000 customers have selected an alternative energy supplier and at this point nearly half of the electricity being used by PPL Electric Utilities customers is being provided by alternatives suppliers.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Paul for more details.

I definitely missed being here last week for the major announcements, but my wife and I had a personal acquisition to complete in China which was successful. I very much look forward to discuss in the Kentucky transaction with you as we work through the approval process and the implementation of the ultimate financing plan for that acquisition.
Let's move to slide five. Earnings from our supply business increased significantly in the first quarter as the polar contract between PPL Electric Utilities and PPL EnergyPlus expired at the end of last year. The supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges we entered into at prices that are higher than current market prices. Partially offsetting the supply segment performance were lower earnings in both our Pennsylvania and International Delivery segments.
I’ll summarize the key segment earnings drivers for the first quarter and then provide an update on our 2010 forecast. Let's start with the supply segment performance on slide six. The supply segment earned $0.64 per share in the first quarter, a $0.42 increase over a year ago. The single biggest driver of the first quarter earnings was the significantly higher realized prices for our eastern baseload generation compared to the price we received under the full requirements contracts with PPL Electric Utilities that expired again at the end of the last year.
First quarter energy margins also benefited from higher baseload generation and partially offsetting these margin drivers were lower net margins from load-following agreements due to lower than expected customer demand, higher O&M expense at our Susquehanna nuclear plant due to the timing of this year’s refueling outage, higher depreciation due to the Brunner Island scrubbers that were placed into service and the absence of a gain recorded in 2009 on the repurchase of a portion of PPL Energy Supply's outstanding debt.
Moving to slide seven, our Pennsylvania Delivery segment earned $0.10 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 declined compared to last year. This decrease was the result of lower delivery margins primarily due to milder weather, modest economic growth and customers' apparent response to the increased cost of energy as well as higher O&M expenses due to increased staffing and expanded vegetation management activity.
Turning to slide eight, our International Delivery segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 decline compared to last year.  The decrease was the result of higher O&M primarily driven by higher pension expense, higher interest expense on index-linked bonds as a result of higher UK inflation and higher UK income taxes. This was partially offset by higher delivery revenue driven by higher prices and a more favorable exchange rate.
Turning to slide nine, as previously mentioned we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 per share. We continue to expect strong earnings growth driven by significantly higher energy margins primarily based on hedge power and fuel prices as well as established capacity prices for our PJM baseload generation. These higher energy margins are expected to be partially offset by higher O&M in the supply segment primarily driven by higher labor costs and increased work at our Susquehanna nuclear station, increased operating expenses at PPL EnergyPlus and higher support group costs.
Higher depreciation as well as lower earnings at WPE, which are primarily driven by higher financing costs, higher income taxes and higher pension expense. Partially offsetting these are higher delivery margins and more favorable currency exchange rates.
Finally we expect higher O&M in the Pennsylvania Delivery segment due to increase funding for customer programs, increased vegetation management costs and higher bad debt expense. Factoring in all these drivers, we expect approximately 74% of our 2010 earnings will come from our supply segment, 17% from International and 9% from Pennsylvania Delivery.
On slide 10, we’ve updated our 2010 free cash flow before dividend numbers from the year end call to reflect a higher level of third party collateral in our supply segment, the construction delay of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, which Bill will discuss in more detail in a moment. And increase funding at our EPD pension plan.
With that I’d like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations.

Last month PPL Electric Utilities completed its fourth polar solicitation for the 2011 to mid 2013 power supply needs. The solicitation was a 14 month full requirements contract for about 17% of the electricity needed from January 2011 to February 2012. PPL EU has now locked in prices from suppliers for more than two/thirds of the electricity that customers are expected to need for the first quarter of next year. While too soon to predict how customers bills could change in 2011, the average price of our purchases thus far for 2011 is about 16% below the current standard offer prices.
As Jim mentioned retail competition has been flourishing in the PPL Electric Utilities territory with over 410,000 customers now shopping. PPL Electric Utilities filed a distribution rate case as Jim also mentioned and I will give you some details of that filing in a minute. Finally regarding the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line, both PPL Electric Utilities and public service electric and gas are working with the National Park Service to obtain any approvals that maybe needed throughout the line to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.
The National Park Service has indicated that its review will be completed in 2012. We anticipate this process will delay the in-service date to late 2013 or early 2014. On the international front, WPD accepted Ofgem’s final proposals for the five-year price control review and new rates became effective April 1.
Let’s turn to slide 12 and take a closer look at the PPL Electric Utilities rate case. PPL EU seeking a $115 million distribution rate increase to recover among other things, investments made in the distribution system over the last three years. The request represents a 2.4% increase in PPL Electric Utilities total revenues. The filing incorporates a 2010 test year and we’re requesting an 11.75% ROE on a rate base of $2.24 billion within equity ratio of 48.4%. The docket number is on the slide, so you can track the case as it progresses.
Now moving on to supply and slide 13. during the first quarter we completed the previously announced sale of our Long Island assets to J-Power. Commercial availability of our generation fleet was excellent in the quarter capturing 98% of the market value available to our generating stations. Helping that figure was the performance of our Susquehanna nuclear plant, which set a record for simultaneous operation of both reactors. The two units operated together for 287 days, the streak ended when we shut down the unit one reactor to begin a planned refueling and maintenance outage.
During the unit one outage we continued our power upgrade work which included installing a modern digital control system for plant equipment as well as replacement of pump turbines that provide water to the reactor vessel. The unit is currently online at approximately 80% power as it goes through a serious of testing procedures following an outage delay of more than a week.
Moving on to an update of our hedging program on slide 14, we’ve updated our hedge positions as of March 31. These hedge levels have increased somewhat since the update we provided you on our fourth quarter earnings call. You will also note that the average hedge price has declined by $1 per megawatt in 2010 and $2 a megawatt hour in 2011 and 2012. The declining prices reflects the impact of lower prices associated with new hedges and an adjustment to our assumption for basis. As a result of the continued weak natural gas price environment, basis between PGA and West Hub and our plants has been weaker than we have previously forecast.
Turning to slide 15, on the fuel side, we’ve contracted for a 100% of our uranium needs through 2012. For 2010, our wholly owned plants are fully hedged for coal, with only a small open position at Keystone & Conemaugh.
Now I’d like to turn the call back to Jim Miller for the Q&A. Jim?

It is clearly large percentage of that rate request comes Trimble County 2 coming online, an already improved baseload generation facility as well as the storm cost recovery that Jim mentioned. With the future test year that was selected, if the decision was not consistent with the economic assumption that are in our base model, we would post acquisition operate the utility accordingly just like we would any other rate jurisdictional assets that we own and operate.
So I clearly wouldn’t want to comment on what any assumption we made around ROEs were. The merits of the case are what they are and they are sitting in front of the commission right now. the commission has shown willingness and the capability clear to act in prior situation, so I think we just as Jim said, follow this through. We don’t own and operate the company today. so what we are at least a bit on the sideline as it relates to the pursuit of the outcome by both those utilities and at the end of day it really doesn’t matter who the owner is, the commission, we would hope, would act in understanding that all those costs are reflected to continue reliable service to customers.

Thank you, Joe and thanks to all of you for joining us for the second time in a week to hear some more pertinent information about our quarter and other items. We’ll start today’s call of course with our general session and commentary on first quarter and then we’ll get right into questions. And with me today Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer, and Bill Spence, our Chief Operating Officer.
This morning, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.66 a share with $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Earnings from ongoing operations for the first quarter were up substantially from a year ago, $0.94 per share this year versus $0.60 per share in 2009. As we fully expected, we did achieve dramatically higher earnings from our supply segment in 2010 following the expiration of a decade-long contract with our electric delivery company in Pennsylvania.
Supply segment earnings from ongoing operations were nearly triple what they were in the first quarter of last year. 2010 supply segment earnings are benefiting from the fact that we locked in wholesale energy crisis that are much higher than the current market crisis. The substantial gains we saw on our supply segment for the quarter were somewhat offset by lower earnings in both our delivery businesses in Pennsylvania and the United Kingdom.
This morning, we also reaffirmed our 2010 forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 per share in earnings from ongoing operations. And our forecast for GAAP earnings for the year reflected special items that were recorded in the first quarter now stand at $2.82 to $3.22 per share.
Although, challenges still persist in our sector, including low energy prices, lower electricity demand and some lingering economic uncertainty, we are well positioned, because we’ve hedged virtually 100% of our expected generation out for the year. And Paul will outline the other major drivers of our 2010 earnings forecast in just a moment.
We continue to expect the performance of our supply business for the year will overcome lower returns from our delivery businesses, which have been pressured by somewhat higher O&M costs.
Just a couple of brief comments on the announcements last week regarding our plans to acquire E.ON US. As I said at the time, the transformational transaction for PPL, the one that creates a stronger, more diversified enterprise that retains the considerable upsides from our high quality supply business from the inevitable improvements in wholesale power prices. So our plan to close this transaction by the end of the year and we’ll keep you informed regarding our progress on that effort.
One more item to highlight before turning the call over to Paul and Bill. In late March, we did file a request with the Pennsylvania PUC for a 2.4% increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities, which would be effective January 1, 2011. So the PUC review process is underway and we expect a decision on a request late this year.
Meanwhile, the transition to a competitive electricity market in the PPL Electric Utilities service area has been very successful. More than 410,000 customers have selected an alternative energy supplier and at this point nearly half of the electricity being used by PPL Electric Utilities customers is being provided by alternatives suppliers.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Paul for more details.

I definitely missed being here last week for the major announcements, but my wife and I had a personal acquisition to complete in China which was successful. I very much look forward to discuss in the Kentucky transaction with you as we work through the approval process and the implementation of the ultimate financing plan for that acquisition.
Let's move to slide five. Earnings from our supply business increased significantly in the first quarter as the polar contract between PPL Electric Utilities and PPL EnergyPlus expired at the end of last year. The supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges we entered into at prices that are higher than current market prices. Partially offsetting the supply segment performance were lower earnings in both our Pennsylvania and International Delivery segments.
I’ll summarize the key segment earnings drivers for the first quarter and then provide an update on our 2010 forecast. Let's start with the supply segment performance on slide six. The supply segment earned $0.64 per share in the first quarter, a $0.42 increase over a year ago. The single biggest driver of the first quarter earnings was the significantly higher realized prices for our eastern baseload generation compared to the price we received under the full requirements contracts with PPL Electric Utilities that expired again at the end of the last year.
First quarter energy margins also benefited from higher baseload generation and partially offsetting these margin drivers were lower net margins from load-following agreements due to lower than expected customer demand, higher O&M expense at our Susquehanna nuclear plant due to the timing of this year’s refueling outage, higher depreciation due to the Brunner Island scrubbers that were placed into service and the absence of a gain recorded in 2009 on the repurchase of a portion of PPL Energy Supply's outstanding debt.
Moving to slide seven, our Pennsylvania Delivery segment earned $0.10 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 declined compared to last year. This decrease was the result of lower delivery margins primarily due to milder weather, modest economic growth and customers' apparent response to the increased cost of energy as well as higher O&M expenses due to increased staffing and expanded vegetation management activity.
Turning to slide eight, our International Delivery segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter, a $0.04 decline compared to last year.  The decrease was the result of higher O&M primarily driven by higher pension expense, higher interest expense on index-linked bonds as a result of higher UK inflation and higher UK income taxes. This was partially offset by higher delivery revenue driven by higher prices and a more favorable exchange rate.
Turning to slide nine, as previously mentioned we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.50 per share. We continue to expect strong earnings growth driven by significantly higher energy margins primarily based on hedge power and fuel prices as well as established capacity prices for our PJM baseload generation. These higher energy margins are expected to be partially offset by higher O&M in the supply segment primarily driven by higher labor costs and increased work at our Susquehanna nuclear station, increased operating expenses at PPL EnergyPlus and higher support group costs.
Higher depreciation as well as lower earnings at WPE, which are primarily driven by higher financing costs, higher income taxes and higher pension expense. Partially offsetting these are higher delivery margins and more favorable currency exchange rates.
Finally we expect higher O&M in the Pennsylvania Delivery segment due to increase funding for customer programs, increased vegetation management costs and higher bad debt expense. Factoring in all these drivers, we expect approximately 74% of our 2010 earnings will come from our supply segment, 17% from International and 9% from Pennsylvania Delivery.
On slide 10, we’ve updated our 2010 free cash flow before dividend numbers from the year end call to reflect a higher level of third party collateral in our supply segment, the construction delay of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, which Bill will discuss in more detail in a moment. And increase funding at our EPD pension plan.
With that I’d like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations.

Last month PPL Electric Utilities completed its fourth polar solicitation for the 2011 to mid 2013 power supply needs. The solicitation was a 14 month full requirements contract for about 17% of the electricity needed from January 2011 to February 2012. PPL EU has now locked in prices from suppliers for more than two/thirds of the electricity that customers are expected to need for the first quarter of next year. While too soon to predict how customers bills could change in 2011, the average price of our purchases thus far for 2011 is about 16% below the current standard offer prices.
As Jim mentioned retail competition has been flourishing in the PPL Electric Utilities territory with over 410,000 customers now shopping. PPL Electric Utilities filed a distribution rate case as Jim also mentioned and I will give you some details of that filing in a minute. Finally regarding the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line, both PPL Electric Utilities and public service electric and gas are working with the National Park Service to obtain any approvals that maybe needed throughout the line to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.
The National Park Service has indicated that its review will be completed in 2012. We anticipate this process will delay the in-service date to late 2013 or early 2014. On the international front, WPD accepted Ofgem’s final proposals for the five-year price control review and new rates became effective April 1.
Let’s turn to slide 12 and take a closer look at the PPL Electric Utilities rate case. PPL EU seeking a $115 million distribution rate increase to recover among other things, investments made in the distribution system over the last three years. The request represents a 2.4% increase in PPL Electric Utilities total revenues. The filing incorporates a 2010 test year and we’re requesting an 11.75% ROE on a rate base of $2.24 billion within equity ratio of 48.4%. The docket number is on the slide, so you can track the case as it progresses.
Now moving on to supply and slide 13. during the first quarter we completed the previously announced sale of our Long Island assets to J-Power. Commercial availability of our generation fleet was excellent in the quarter capturing 98% of the market value available to our generating stations. Helping that figure was the performance of our Susquehanna nuclear plant, which set a record for simultaneous operation of both reactors. The two units operated together for 287 days, the streak ended when we shut down the unit one reactor to begin a planned refueling and maintenance outage.
During the unit one outage we continued our power upgrade work which included installing a modern digital control system for plant equipment as well as replacement of pump turbines that provide water to the reactor vessel. The unit is currently online at approximately 80% power as it goes through a serious of testing procedures following an outage delay of more than a week.
Moving on to an update of our hedging program on slide 14, we’ve updated our hedge positions as of March 31. These hedge levels have increased somewhat since the update we provided you on our fourth quarter earnings call. You will also note that the average hedge price has declined by $1 per megawatt in 2010 and $2 a megawatt hour in 2011 and 2012. The declining prices reflects the impact of lower prices associated with new hedges and an adjustment to our assumption for basis. As a result of the continued weak natural gas price environment, basis between PGA and West Hub and our plants has been weaker than we have previously forecast.
Turning to slide 15, on the fuel side, we’ve contracted for a 100% of our uranium needs through 2012. For 2010, our wholly owned plants are fully hedged for coal, with only a small open position at Keystone & Conemaugh.
Now I’d like to turn the call back to Jim Miller for the Q&A. Jim?

It is clearly large percentage of that rate request comes Trimble County 2 coming online, an already improved baseload generation facility as well as the storm cost recovery that Jim mentioned. With the future test year that was selected, if the decision was not consistent with the economic assumption that are in our base model, we would post acquisition operate the utility accordingly just like we would any other rate jurisdictional assets that we own and operate.
So I clearly wouldn’t want to comment on what any assumption we made around ROEs were. The merits of the case are what they are and they are sitting in front of the commission right now. the commission has shown willingness and the capability clear to act in prior situation, so I think we just as Jim said, follow this through. We don’t own and operate the company today. so what we are at least a bit on the sideline as it relates to the pursuit of the outcome by both those utilities and at the end of day it really doesn’t matter who the owner is, the commission, we would hope, would act in understanding that all those costs are reflected to continue reliable service to customers.

Good morning, everyone. We’ll start today’s call with the general business update and we’ll also, obviously, include a summary of the status of the E.ON U.S. transaction and commentary on our quarterly results, and then we’ll take all your questions.
Joining me on the call are Paul Farr, Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Spence, Chief Operating Officer. This morning we reported quarterly GAAP earnings of $0.22 a share compared with a loss of $0.02 a share in the second quarter of 2009. Earnings from ongoing operations for the second quarter were $0.62 per share this year compared with $0.32 per share in 2009.
For the first six months of the year, our reported earnings were $0.88 per share, $0.26 higher than a year ago. Our earnings from ongoing operations for this period were $1.56 a share, $0.65 higher than last year.
As expected, Energy Supply segment earnings drove the improvement in our financial performance for the second quarter and for the first half of the year. These results and our forecast for the balance of the year put us on target to achieve significantly improved earnings in 2010 compared to our 2009 results.
Before we move on to a discussion of the earnings forecast for 2010, I’ll take a minute to update you on our proposed acquisition of E.ON U.S. As you all know, in late June we successfully completed the equity portion of our financing requirements for the acquisition, raising $3.5 billion in net proceeds through the sale of common stock and equity units. The equity offering was significantly oversubscribed, which we believe validates our strategy and the decision to pursue this acquisition for our shareowners.
Also, we’re on schedule to obtain all the regulatory approvals related to the transaction. These include change in control filings with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, state regulators in Virginia and Tennessee and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In Kentucky, the PSC has scheduled hearings for early September, which is consistent with the timing we had anticipated. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice have granted early termination for both of the notices that were required under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Clearly, we remain on track to close this important transaction later this year.
You also may have read that late last week the Kentucky PSC approved $189 million increase in rates for LG&E and Kentucky Utilities, accepting a settlement agreement to buy most of the intervening parties. The Commission also reiterated its position that the PPL transaction did not preclude a proper analysis of these rate increase requests, which were filed in January, well before the announcement of our proposed acquisition.
We remain confident that this acquisition will increase shareowner value in the long term by growing the size of our regulated businesses, while retaining the upside from competitive market opportunities as energy markets fundamentals improve.
Now, let’s turn to our 2010 earnings forecast. As indicated on this slide, we’ve adjusted our 2010 ongoing earnings per share forecast to reflect the dilution associated with the recent common stock and equity unit issuances.
It’s important to emphasize that the change in the forecast range is based solely on the dilutive effect of the new equity. Factoring in about a half year waiting for the 103.5 million new shares and the interest cost of the equity units, our forecast for 2010 earnings from ongoing operations is now $2.70 to $3.05 per share.
While we don’t provide guidance on a quarterly basis, I’d note that the results we will report for the third and fourth quarters will obviously reflect a 100% weighting of the shares and interest expense for those periods. Our forecast for GAAP earnings for the year reflects special items recorded through the first half of the year and the dilutive effect of the new equity, now, $2.10 to $2.45 per share.
Before turning the call over to Paul and Bill, I’d comment briefly on our request to increase distribution revenues in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is continuing its review of our request for a 2.4% increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities effective January 1, 2011. The public hearings have been held and evidentiary hearings are scheduled for later this month. We anticipate a decision from the PUC sometime in December.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Paul.

Good morning, everyone. Let’s go to slide #five. Earnings from our Supply segment increased significantly in the second quarter as a result of higher realized prices on our Eastern baseload generation.
The Supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges we entered into at prices that are higher than current market prices from 2010. Partially offsetting the Supply segment performance were lower earnings in both our Pennsylvania and International Delivery segments.
I’ll begin the segment review with Supply on slide #six. The Supply segment earned $0.43 per share in the first quarter, a $0.34 increase over last year. As I already mentioned, the single biggest driver of the second quarter earnings was significantly higher realized sales prices for the Eastern baseload generation. The second quarter also benefited from higher West energy margins, primarily due to higher average sales prices.
The second quarter was also impacted by higher O&M due to the timing of outages at our coal-fired power plants partially offset by lower cost due to the timing of the Susquehanna refueling and upgrade outage, higher depreciation due to the Brunner Island scrubbers that were placed in service in 2009 and higher realized earnings on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds as well as lower income taxes.
Moving to slide #seven, our Pennsylvania Delivery segment earned $0.04 per share in the second quarter, a $0.01 decline compared with last year. The decrease was the net result of higher transmission revenue resulting from cost recovery through FERC formula-based rates and higher O&M expenses due to increased staffing and expanded vegetation management activities.
Turning to slide #nine, our International Delivery segment earned $0.15 per share in the second quarter, a $0.03 decline compared to last year. The decrease was the net result of higher delivery revenues driven by higher prices which were effective beginning April 1, 2010 under a Price Control Review 5, higher O&M primarily driven by higher pension expense, higher interest expense on index-linked bonds as a result of recent higher U.K. inflation and interest resulting from the £400 million debt issuance that occurred in March of this year, more favorable exchange rates and positive hedging results and higher income taxes.
On slide #nine we’ve updated our 2010 free cash flow before dividend numbers from the first quarter call. The update includes the return of collateral to third parties of approximately $255 million at our Supply segment.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations.

Let’s turn to slide #10 with an update of our Delivery businesses. Last month, PPL Electric Utilities completed another power [ph] solicitation for 2011 to mid-2013 procurement needs and this latest round of purchases the Company awarded a mix of 70 months and 20-month full-requirement contracts and this is about 11% of the electricity needed for January 1, 2011.
Also in this round, the Company awarded five-year contracts for two 25-megawatt blocks of around-the-clock electricity supply. The Company has now secured approximately 80% of its power supply from a total of 16 companies for the first five months of 2011. Based on the purchases made to-date, PPL Electric Utilities believes its 2011 generation service charge may be 9% to 12% lower than the current default rate.
On the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line both PPL Electric Utilities and PSEG continue to work with the National Park Service to obtain approvals that may be required to route the line through Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.
The National Park Service has indicated that its review will not be completed until 2012. If the review is completed in this timeframe, the in-service dated line will be delayed until at least 2014. The CapEx chart in the appendix to today’s presentation incorporates the revised spending driven by the delayed schedule.
On the international front, the new rates, as Paul mentioned, related to DPCR5 went into effect on April 1.
Now, let’s turn to Slide 11 and take a look at the schedule for the PPL Electric Utilities rate case that Jim mentioned. Rebuttal testimony was submitted by Electric Utilities on the July 27, surrebuttal testimony is due today and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in the week of August the 9th.
The ALJ’s recommended decision is expected by the middle of October and the Commission’s final order is expected by mid December. We’ve also included some additional pertinent rate case information for your reference.
Now moving on to Supply, let’s start with an update on the status of the Susquehanna Unit 1 nuclear plant. Unit 1 safely shut down on July 16 following condenser leak of river water into the turbine basement. This was a non-nuclear incident that did not impact the safety of the public or our employees. The unit returned to service yesterday and continues to ramp up to full operating capacity. The Susquehanna Unit 1 outage is expected to impact 2010 ongoing earnings from operations by about $0.05 to $0.06 per share.
Also, late in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, the Supply segment sold several load-following contracts to provide additional cash to support for the acquisition of E.ON U.S. These full requirement contracts were for delivery for the remainder of 2010 as well as deliveries in 2011 and ‘12.
We sold approximately 1,570 megawatts, which reduced our ongoing load-following exposure and also resulted in $249 million of cash proceeds.
As noted in today’s news release, we received $156 million from these sales completed in the second quarter and we have additional sales in July which will net an additional $93 million. We still expect to earn about $35 million in marketing and trading in 2010 and we are continuing to evaluate the possible sale of non-core generating assets.
Moving on to an update of our hedging program on Slide 13, we’ve updated our hedge positions as of June 30. These hedge levels have not changed significantly since the update we provided on our first quarter earnings call. You will note, however, that the expected average hedged price has declined in the East for 2011 and ‘12.
The decline in prices reflects a further adjustment to our assumption for basis. As you know, we’ve effectively hedged our expected baseload generation output at West Hub, but we are still exposed to basis price differentials between the generator buses of PPL plant and the West Hub.
Results thus far in 2010 indicate the basis differentials for our baseload generation are likely to continue to see pressure as a result of three things; increased transmission work, lack of basis liquidity and continued weakness in natural gas prices.
We see basis averaging negative $1 per megawatt hour in 2010. However, after reflecting the benefit of hedges we have in place, we expect to earn about a positive $1 per megawatt hour basis for 2010. For 2011 and 2012 what we’ve done is eliminated all the basis premium, but we’ll continue to update our expectations as we see market conditions change.
On Slide 14, we’ve updated our fuel hedge positions. During the quarter, we put on additional East coal hedges for ‘11 and ‘12, which substantially increased our hedge positions for these years. While the average commodity hedge price for the coal has changed only modestly, we continue to see rising coal transportation cost in 2011 and ‘12 driven by both base rail charges and associated fuel surcharges.
Now, I’d like to turn the call back to Jim Miller for the Q&A. Jim?

We do have hedges in place that actually are producing value of about $2, so we’re actually going to realize about $1 of premium for 2010.
As we look at ‘11 and ‘12, we’re still seeing a lot of transmission-related work for various transmission projects, plus a fairly low natural gas price compared to the past and both of those things as well as the lack of liquidity in the basis market really caused us to think about adjusting to a zero premium to West Hub for ‘11 and ‘12. But as you know, things are pretty dynamic and as we see things moving back or in our favor, we of course adjusted accordingly.

So, the combination of all three of those components gets us to about a $22 per ton transport. As we look at ‘11, we see that probably rising maybe into about the $24 range for next year. We won’t know exactly because some of these are based on the variables that I mentioned
If you look at our slides in today’s presentation and assume say a $51 ton base price for the commodity itself, the coal itself at the mine amount, plus the $24, you’d be looking at coal prices moving up delivered from about $71 to $74, $75 per ton in 2011. So that’s obviously for the PPL units, the $7.5 million tons that require for our units. In addition to that you have the Keystone, Conemaugh, which is about 1.4 million tons. But I would see their delivered prices being in a similar range.

Selectively, we would still look at that as an opportunity at this point in the market as we evaluated what we did have available that could be sold. It made more a strategic sense to us to move contracts like this, eliminating some future volatility risk as well. If somebody came up with the right number for us, some non-core gen, we clearly still evaluate it, but this really covers for us the remaining gap that we had from a cash perspective.

We have participated in our own territory in acquiring retail, large C&I customers.
The strategy around that is really to provide another hedging tool that we would hope that over a longer period of time would help mitigate some of basis risk that we talked about earlier on the call as well as provide some more certainty around the capacity ancillary revenues that we could get from retail contracts. They also have some positive benefit from a margin cost standpoint as well. Credit facilities could be lowered in that event. So, we don’t have what I would say as huge aspirations to be a big retail player. I think it’s just part of our hedging strategy versus wanting to be a large national retail player.

Ongoing earnings for this period were $2.29 a share compared with $1.43 per share last year.
Before we move on to a discussion of our forecast for 2010, I will provide you a little bit of information on our acquisition of E.ON U.S. On Tuesday, we received FERC Commission approval for the transaction and that was the last regulatory approval necessary for us to close the transaction. So, we currently expect closing will occur on November 1st.
I think this is really a remarkable accomplishment, given that we announced the transaction only six months ago and over that period, we've received approvals from state regulators in Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, the FERC, U.S. Department of Justice, and FTC.
In June, we also successfully completed the equity portion of the financing for the acquisition, raising $3.5 billion in net proceeds through the sale of common stock and equity units. And I might add that during this period, we have been dealing with rate cases, both in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania and I think our - as Bill will point out, our ALJ has rendered a decision in Pennsylvania and we feel the Kentucky rate case was settled very appropriately.
I think the swift regulatory approvals, as well as the oversubscription of the equity offering did reinforce the soundness of our decision to make the acquisition and the value that it's going to create for all PPL stakeholders, and I am proud of our entire team and as well our colleagues in Kentucky from an execution perspective. And also, we've done significant work in the area of integration, getting ready to plug in PPL with LG&E and KU on November 1st when we expect to close. So the integration teams have done a fine job on all sides in this area. The acquisition will immediately prove PPL's business mix by adding two very high-performing regulated utility operations to our portfolio.
So with that, let's turn to our 2010 earnings forecast. This morning, we announced that we are narrowing the range of our 2010 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.80 to $2.95 per share. This reflects the dilution related to our June equity issuances, but it excludes any impact on earnings for the portion of 2010 that we will own and operate the business. The midpoint of the forecast is consistent with our original forecast for 2010 of $3.10 to $3.50 per share and it's only been adjusted for dilution from the acquisition financing.
So importantly, we expect as well to overcome the $0.05 impact of the unplanned Susquehanna outage we discussed in the second quarter call. Our forecast for the GAAP earnings for the year reflected special items recorded through the first nine months of the year and the dilutive effect of the new equity, it's now $1.94 to $2.09 per share.
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul for more detail on the financials. Paul?

Earnings from our su",487,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks on Slide 6 today.
As you can see from the chart, the supply segment clearly drove our financial performance in the quarter and it obviously has year-to-date as well. Earnings from our supply segment increased significantly as a result of higher realized prices for our Eastern baseload gen. Supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges that we entered into at very attractive prices in the past.
I'll begin the segment review of supply in Slide 7. The supply segment earned $0.54 per share in the third quarter, a $0.21 increase over last year. The increase resulted primarily from significantly higher realized sales prices from the Eastern baseload generation. In addition to energy margin, the third quarter was also impacted by higher O&M at our Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the forced outage at Unit 1, which was partially offset by the timing of outages at our coal-fired power plants, depreciation due to some scrubbers that were placed in the service last year, a lower effective tax rate, as well as dilution of $0.17 per share.
Moving to Slide 8, our Pennsylvania delivery segment earned $0.08 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This increase was the net result of higher transmission revenue resulting from cost recovery through FERC formula-based rates, and higher distribution revenue due to warmer weather compared to a year ago, higher O&M expenses due to higher contracting, storm expense, payroll and support group costs, lower income taxes as a result of the favorable U.S. Tax Court decision related to street lighting, and lower interest as a result of lower average debt balances. Finally, dilution in this segment amounted to $0.02 per share.
Turning to Slide 9, our international delivery segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, flat compared to last year. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices, which were effective April 1 of this year under Price Control Review 5, which was partially offset by a less favorable customer mix, higher pension expense, higher interest expense as a result of the 400 million pound debt issuance this March, lower income taxes, and dilution of $0.04 per share.
On Slide 10, we have provided an update to our free cash flow before dividends forecast for 2010. Compared to our projections at the end of the second quarter, our Pennsylvania and international delivery segments have improved by about $40 million each, primarily due to changes in working capital. The biggest change comes in our supply segment, driven primarily by the receipt of third-party collateral postings, a decrease in unbilled revenue, and the $381 million in proceeds from the pending sale of the non-core generating assets to LS Power.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations.

I know that today and tomorrow are very busy for everyone as we all prepare for EEI, so I am going to keep my remarks today very brief.Starting with a request to increase distribution revenues at PPL Electric Uti",325,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning everyone. I know that today and tomorrow are very busy for everyone as we all prepare for EEI, so I am going to keep my remarks today very brief.
Starting with a request to increase distribution revenues at PPL Electric Utilities on October the 15th of Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, ALJ recommended approval of the settlement we had reached with the other parties in the case. That settlement would result in a $77 million increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities. The Commission is expected to make a final decision on the case in December with new rates effective January 1, 2011.
For the supply segment, I'd point you to the appendix to today's presentation for an update on our generation and coal hedge positions. The generation hedge volumes for 2010 and 2011 were virtually unchanged from the update we provided you on the second quarter call. You will note that the average hedge price for 2011 is somewhat lower, reflecting our expectations of where the contracts with collars will settle and updates to the small amount of load-following contracts we have in the hedge portfolio, as well as some rounding.
The coal slide reflects settlement of the collar prices for 2011, also to fixed prices and slightly higher hedge levels in 2012. Regarding basis, our assumptions for baseload generation are unchanged for what we discussed with you on the second quarter call. As a result of our hedges this year, we still expect to earn about $1 per megawatt-hour at positive bases in the East this year and continue to estimate no basis premium to West hub for 2011 or 2012. On the coal transportation front, we continue to forecast coal delivery charges of $24 a ton in 2011.
With that as our very brief operational update, I'll turn the call back over to Jim and I look forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI. Jim?

So obviously, they are going to be settling out at the low end with the significant drop we've seen in power prices of late. It also reflects a small change, because we only have 1% of the portfolio hedged through load-following contracts, but our expectations on those as well.
So that went from $58 to $56 in the East. The West was unchanged. However, if you look at the total expected average price in the East, it actually dropped about 3 - around - sorry, in total to $61, dropped by about $3. That's really reflective of the fact that there is some rounding in there, because obviously if these went down too and the West was virtually unchanged that would only be a $2 change. But due to rounding, it's a $3 change. So hopefully, that helped.

There will be - I said modest amounts of equity and debt needed to support the rate base growth opportunities, which drives future cash flow and earnings, but that will be a reality. The credit protecting mechanism achieved by having for supply, as was just affirmed by S&P yesterday, that credit supporting mechanism comes by having strong utilities with strong ratings and strong growth in the business and that business needs to be funded.
So until supply returns itself to more of a mid-cycle kind of set of numbers where it's generating significantly more cash flow than the business needs which eliminates - probably more than eliminates the need mid-cycle to have to go to the equity markets to fund the utilities' rate base growth, we will have to do some modest access on that basis.

Right now, we have 485,000 customers still shopping and we would expect the bulk of those to continue either with our existing suppliers or to migrate to another supplier.

And clearly, since we put on the contracts that set the price of polar for next year, which went down by about a penny a kilowatt-hour, they've continued to fall.
So I think the headroom is continuing to grow somewhat. So I would expect that shopping would continue to be active in 2011. But there is also the factor that those that would likely want to shop may have already taken the opportunity and those that either are not interested or it's a distraction for them or whatever, probably will continue not to shop.
So, I think there will be some incremental, I guess, bottom line is. But I wouldn't say it's going to double or anything of a significant magnitude as I see it kind of playing out.

Someone asked earlier about demand response. That would tend to potentially push that down.

Again, I know it's a busy time. I just like to reflect on a couple of issues here. It's been a very busy six-month period at PPL and I think with many positive outcomes of working our way through this acquisition and from the standpoint of working with the Kentucky regulator and seeing our way through that process successfully, we have certainly improved - as you see in yesterday's announcement, improved our credit rating as confirmed by S&P.
As Paul mentioned earlier, we feel great about our dividend. Our dividend is secure. We've moved quickly through the process to take all the risks and hopefully, the overhand off of our situation of this acquisition. As we view the acquisition on a going-forward basis, we are seeing a number of positives from the standpoint of potential additional rate base growth that we hadn’t seen prior to this time.
And as Bill mentioned, our unregulated fleet as a result of whatever these environmental rules ultimately shake out to be, we have a principally scrubbed coal fleet. We have the ability to convert some units where economically appropriate to gas and we are not facing a number of - having to shut down a number of units that in the unregulated region could hurt us.
I think that - I feel that as we move forward, our unregulated fleet is still very well positioned to gain from the upside when gas prices do return and power prices do return and we do expect to see, certainly over the next couple of years - not sure where gas will go, but I certainly would expect to see some spark-spread improvement - expansion over the next couple of years, because there is not much of anything being built.

Thanks for being on the call today, and I know it's a busy time for all of us in the sector. I'll start today's call with some commentary on earnings and our 2010 forecast, as well as the status update on the E.ON U.S. transaction. And then after that, we'll take your questions. 
Joining me on the call this morning are Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Spence, Chief Operating Officer. This morning, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.51 a share for the third quarter that's compared with earnings of $0.05 a share in the same period a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations for the third quarter were $0.74 a share this year compared with $0.52 per share in 2009. And for the 9 months of the year, our reported earnings were $1.40 per share compared with $0.67 a year ago. Ongoing earnings for this period were $2.29 a share compared this year compared to with $1.43 last year. 
Before we move on to a discussion of our forecast for 2010, I will provide you a little bit of information on our acquisition of E.ON U.S. On Tuesday, we received FERC commission approval for the transaction, and that was the last regulatory approval necessary for us to close the transaction. So we currently expect closing to occur on November 1. I think this is really a remarkable accomplishment given that we announced the transaction only 6 months ago. And over that period, we received approvals from state regulators in Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, the FERC, U.S. Department of Justice and FTC. In June, we also successfully completed equity portion of the financing for the acquisition, raising $3.5 billion net proceeds of for the sale of common stock and equity units. And I might add that during this period, we've been dealing with rate cases both in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania. As Bill will point out, our ALJ has rendered a decision in Pennsylvania, and we feel the Kentucky rate case was settled very appropriately. I think the swift regulatory approvals, as well as the oversubscription of the equity offering did reinforce the soundness of our decision to make the acquisition and the value that it's going to create for all PPL stakeholders. And I am proud of our entire team and as well our colleagues and Kentucky from an execution perspective. And also, we've done significant work in the area of integration, getting ready to plug-in PPL with LG&E and KU on November 1 when we expect to close, so the integration teams have done a fine job on all sides in this area. The acquisition will immediately prove PPL's business mix by adding 2 very high-performing regulated utility operations to our portfolio. 
So with that, let's turn to our 2010 earnings forecast. This morning, we announced that we're narrowing range for 2010 or going earnings forecast to $2.80 to $2.95 per share. This reflects the dilution related to our June equity issuances, but it excludes any impact on earnings for the portion of 2010 that we will own and operate the business. The midpoint of the forecast is consistent with our original forecast for 2010 of $3.10 to $3.50 per share, and it's only been adjusted for dilution from the acquisition financing. So importantly, we expect, as well as to overcome the $0.05 impact of the unplanned Susquehanna outage we discussed in the second quarter call. Our forecast for GAAP earnings for the year reflected special items recorded for the first 9 months of the year and the dilutive effect of the new equity. It's now $1.94 to $2.09 per share. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul for more detail on the financials. Paul?"

Good morning, everyone out that my prepared remarks on Slide 6 today.

Good morning, everyone out that my prepared remarks on Slide 6 today. As you can see from the chart, the Supply segment clearly drove to our financial performance in the quarter and it obviously has year-to-date as well. Earnings from our Supply segment increased significantly as a result of higher realized prices for our Eastern baseload gen. The Supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges that we entered into at very attractive prices in the past. I'll begin the segment review of Supply at Slide 7. The Supply segment earned $0.54 per share in the third quarter, a $0.21 increase over last year. The increase resulted primarily from significantly higher realized sales prices from the Eastern baseload generation. In addition to energy margin, the third quarter was also impacted by higher O&M Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the forced outage at Unit 1, which was partially offset by the timing of outages at our coal-fired power plants. Higher depreciation due to scrubbers that were placed in the service last year, a lower effective tax rate, as well as dilution of $0.17 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8, our Pennsylvania Delivery segment earned $0.08 per share a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This increase was the net result of higher transmission revenue resulting from cost recovery through FERC formula-based rates and higher distribution revenue due to warmer weather experienced a year ago. Higher O&M expenses due to higher contracting storm expense payroll and support group cost lower income taxes as a result of the favorable U.S. Tax Court decision related to street lighting and lower interest as a result of lower average debt balances. Finally, dilution in this segment amounted to $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 9, our international of every segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, flat compared to last year. This performance was the net result of higher Delivery revenue ID driven by higher prices, which were affect of April 1 of this year price control review 5, which was partially offset by a less favorable customer mix higher pension expense, higher interest expense as a result of the 400 million pound debt issuance this March, lower incomes taxes and dilution of $0.40 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've provided an update to our free cash flow before dividends forecast for 2010. Compared to our projections at the end of the second quarter, our Pennsylvania and International Delivery segment have improved by about $40 million each primarily due to changes in working capital. The biggest change comes in our Supply segment driven primarily by the receipt of third-party collateral postings, a decrease in unbilled revenue and a $381 million in proceeds from the pending sale from the noncore generating assets the U.S. power. With that, I would add to turn the call over to Bill for an update in operations."

Starting with a request increased distribution revenues at PPL Electric Utilities on October 15 of Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, ALJ recommended approval of the sentiment we had reached with the other parties in the case. That settlement would result in a $77 million increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities. The commission is expected to make a final decision on the case in December with new rates effective January 1, 2011. 
For the Supply segment, I'd point you to the appendix to today's presentation for an update on our generation and call hedge positions. This generation hedge volumes for 2010 and 2011 were virtually unchanged from the update we've provided you on the second quarter call. You will note that the average hedge price for 2011 is somewhat lower, reflecting our expectations of where the contracts with callers will settle and updates to the small amount of load following contracts we have in the hedge portfolio, as well as some rounding. 
The coal side of that settlement of the collar prices for 2011 also to fix prices and slightly higher hedge levels in 2012. Regarding basis, our assumptions for baseload generation are unchanged for what we discussed with you on the second quarter call. As a result of our hedges this year, we still expect to earn about $1 per megawatt hour in positive basis in the East this year and continued to estimate no basis premium to West Hub for 2011 or 2012. On the call transportation front, we continue to forecast coal delivery charges of $34 a ton in 2011. With that, it's our very brief operational update, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.

That's really reflective of the fact of some rounding in their obviously, went down to the West is virtually unchanged that would only be $2 change. But due to rounding, it's a $3 change.

One way to look at that and I know questions have come up in the sector around to begin, let me clearly say that we believe absolutely that our dividend is secure. We weren't designing things to get to this may in terms of the dividend basically being able to be fully funded or nearly fully funded by the utility side of the business earnings. That is the case and for that several years are very close to me like I said. It wasn't a goal but it's a reality but depending upon what you want to view the volatility our prospects around supply, the dividend in this area is that year. Those utilities that you just said have significantly rate base growth opportunities, which we can always dial up and down but if a large percent of those, percentage of those earnings are being paid out if you will to support the dividend and cash is fungible, we will need, and I will be modest but we will need to access the appropriate capital markets to fund our growth. There will be a sad modest amount of equity and debt during needed to support the rate base growth opportunities, which drives future cash flow and earnings but that will be a reality. The credit protecting mechanism that we achieved by having for supply was just affirmed by S&P yesterday, that credit supporting mechanism comes by having strong utilities with strong ratings and strong growth in the business and that business needs to be funded. So until supply returns itself to more of a mid-cycle kind of set of numbers, where it's generating significantly more cash flow than the business needs, which eliminates probably more than eliminates the need cycle to go to the equity markets to fund the utilities rate base growth, we will have to do some modest access on that basis.

As Paul mentioned earlier, we feel great about our dividend. Our dividend is secure. We moved quickly to the process to take all the risks, and hopefully, the overhang of our situation as a result of this acquisition. As we view this acquisition on a going-forward basis, we're seeing a number of positives from the standpoint of potential additional rate base growth that we hadn't seen prior to this time. And as Bill mentioned, our unregulated fleet as a result of whatever these environmental rules alternately shake out to be, we have presently scrubbed coal fleet. We have the ability to convert some units that we are economically appropriate to gas, and we're not facing a number of having to shutdown a number of units that in the unregulated region could hurts. I think that I feel as we move forward, our unregulated fleet is still very well-positioned to gain from the upside when gas prices to return and power prices during turn. And we do expect to see certainly over the next couple of years, not sure where gas will go. But I certainly would expect to see some sparks spread improvement expansion over the next couple of years because there's not much anything being built.

Thanks for being on the call today, and I know it's a busy time for all of us in the sector. I'll start today's call with some commentary on earnings and our 2010 forecast, as well as a status update on the E.ON U.S. transaction. And then after that, we'll take your questions. 
Joining me on the call this morning are Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Spence, the Chief Operating Officer. 
This morning, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.51 a share for the third quarter that's compared with earnings of $0.05 a share in the same period a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations for the third quarter were $0.74 a share this year compared with $0.52 per share in 2009. And for the 9 months of the year, our reported earnings were $1.40 per share compared with $0.67 a year ago. Ongoing earnings for this period were $2.29 a share compared this year compared with a $1.43 per share last year. 
Before we move on to a discussion of our forecast for 2010, I will provide you a little bit of information on our acquisition of E.ON U.S. On Tuesday, we received FERC Commission approval for the transaction and that was the last regulatory approval necessary for us to close the transaction. So we currently expect closing will occur on November 1. 
I think this is really a remarkable accomplishment, given that we announced the transaction only 6 months ago. And over that period, we've received approvals from state regulators in Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, the FERC, U.S. Department of Justice and FTC. In June, we also successfully completed the equity portion of the financing for the acquisition, raising $3.5 billion in net proceeds through the sale of common stock and equity units. And I might add that during this period, we've been dealing with rate cases both in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania. And I think our, as Bill will point out, our ALJ has rendered a decision in Pennsylvania and we feel the Kentucky rate case was settled very appropriately. 
I think the swift regulatory approvals, as well as the oversubscription of the equity offering did reinforce the soundness of our decision to make the acquisition and the value that it's going to create for all PPL stakeholders. And I am proud of our entire team and as well our colleagues in Kentucky from an execution perspective. And also, we've done significant work in the area of integration, getting ready to plug-in PPL with LG&E and KU on November 1 when we expect to close, so the integration teams have done a fine job on all sides in this area. The acquisition will immediately improve PPL's business mix by adding 2 very high-performing regulated utility operations to our portfolio. 
So with that, let's turn to our 2010 earnings forecast. This morning, we announced that we're narrowing the range of our 2010 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.80 to $2.95 per share. This reflects the dilution related to our June equity issuances, but it excludes any impact on earnings for the portion of 2010 that we will own and operate the business. The midpoint of the forecast is consistent with our original forecast for 2010 of $3.10 to $3.50 per share, and it's only been adjusted for dilution from the acquisition financing. So importantly, we expect as well to overcome the $0.05 impact of the unplanned Susquehanna outage we discussed in the second quarter call. Our forecast for GAAP earnings for the year reflected special items recorded through the first 9 months of the year and the dilutive effect of the new equity, it's now $1.94 to $2.09 per share.
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul for more detail on the financials. Paul?"

Earnings from our sup",489,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks on Slide 6 today. As you can see from the chart, the supply segment clearly drove our financial performance in the quarter and it obviously has year-to-date as well. Earnings from our supply segment increased significantly as a result of higher realized prices for our Eastern baseload gen. Supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges that we entered into at very attractive prices in the past. 
I'll begin the segment review of supply in Slide 7. The supply segment earned $0.54 per share in the third quarter, a $0.21 increase over last year. The increase resulted primarily from significantly higher realized sales prices from the Eastern baseload generation. In addition to energy margin, the third quarter was also impacted by higher O&M at our Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the forced outage at Unit 1, which was partially offset by the timing of outages at our coal-fired power plants, higher depreciation due to some scrubbers that were placed in the service last year, a lower effective tax rate, as well as dilution of $0.17 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8, our Pennsylvania delivery segment earned $0.08 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This increase was the net result of higher transmission revenue resulting from cost recovery through FERC formula-based rates and higher distribution revenue due to warmer weather compared to a year ago, higher O&M expenses due to higher contracting, storm expense, payroll and support group costs, lower income taxes as a result of the favorable U.S. Tax Court decision related to street lighting, and lower interest as a result of lower average debt balances. Finally, dilution in this segment amounted to $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 9, our international delivery segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, flat compared to last year. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices, which were effective April 1 of this year under Price Control Review 5, which was partially offset by a less favorable customer mix, higher pension expense, higher pension expense, higher interest expense as a result of the GBP 400 million debt issuance this March, lower income taxes, and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've provided an update to our free cash flow before dividends forecast for 2010. Compared to our projections at the end of the second quarter, our Pennsylvania and international delivery segments have improved by about $40 million each, primarily due to changes in working capital. The biggest change comes in our supply segment, driven primarily by the receipt of third-party collateral postings, a decrease in unbilled revenue and the $381 million in proceeds from the pending sale of the non-core generating assets to LS Power. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

I know that today and tomorrow are very busy for everyone as we all prepare for EEI, so I'm going to keep my remarks today very brief. 
Starting with a request to increase distribution revenues at PPL Electric Utilities on October 15 of Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, ALJ recommended approval of the settlement we had reached with the other parties in the case. That settlement would result in a $77 million increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities. The Commission is expected to make a final decision on the case in December with new rates effective January 1, 2011. 
For the supply segment, I'd point you to the appendix to today's presentation for an update on our generation and coal hedge positions. The generation hedge volumes for 2010 and 2011 are virtually unchanged from the update we provided you on the second quarter call. You will note that the average hedge price for 2011 is somewhat lower, reflecting our expectations of where the contracts with collars will settle and updates to the small amount of load-following contracts we have in the hedge portfolio, as well as some rounding. 
The coal side reflects settlement of the collar prices for 2011, also to fixed prices and slightly higher hedge levels in 2012. Regarding basis, our assumptions for baseload generation are unchanged for what we discussed with you on the second quarter call. As a result of our hedges this year, we still expect to earn about $1 per megawatt hour at positive basis in the East this year and continue to estimate no basis premium to West Hub for 2011 or 2012. On the call transportation front, we continue to forecast coal delivery charges of $24 a ton in 2011. 
With that as our very brief operational update, I'll turn the call back over to Jim. And I look forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI. Jim?"

And if you look at the average hedge price in the East, previously I believe it was $58, it's dropped to about $56, reflecting now our expectation as we approach 2011 of where the contracts that have collars in them will settle out. So obviously, they're going to be settling out at the low end with the significant drop we've seen in power prices of late. It also reflects a small change because we only have 1% of the portfolio hedged through load-following contracts, but our expectations on those as well. So that went from $58 to $56 in the East. The West was unchanged. However, if you look at the total expected average price in the East, it actually dropped about around 3 -- or I'm sorry, in total, to $61, dropped by about $3. That's really reflective of the fact that there's some rounding in there. Because obviously, if these went down too and the West was virtually unchanged that would only be a $2 change but due to rounding, it's a $3 change. So hopefully, that helped."

Let me clearly say that we believe absolutely that our dividend is secure. It wasn't -- we weren't designing things to get to this way in terms of the dividend basically being able to be fully funded or nearly fully funded by the utility side of the business earnings. That is the case and for next several years, we're very close to it, like I just said. It wasn't a goal but it's a reality, so depending upon what you want to view as the volatility or prospects around supply, the dividend is very secure. Now those utilities, as you just said, have significant rate base growth opportunity which we can always dial up and down, but if a large percent of those -- percentage of those earnings are being paid out, if you will, to support the dividend and cash is fungible, we will need to -- it'll be modest but we will need to access the appropriate capital markets to fund that growth. There will be like I said modest amounts of equity and debt needed to support the rate base growth opportunities, which drives future cash flow and earnings but that will be a reality. The credit protecting mechanism that we achieved by having for supply, as was just affirmed by S&P yesterday, that credit supporting mechanism comes by having strong utilities with strong ratings and strong growth in the business and that business needs to be funded. So until supply returns itself to more of a mid-cycle kind of set of numbers, where it's generating significantly more cash flow than the business needs, which eliminates probably more than eliminates the need mid-cycle to have to go to the equity markets to fund the utilities' rate base growth, we will have to do some modest access on that basis."

It's been a very busy 6-month period for us at PPL, and I think with many positive outcomes of working our way through this acquisition and from the standpoint of working with the Kentucky regulator and seeing our way through that process successfully, we have certainly improved as you see in yesterday's announcement, improved our credit rating as confirmed by S&P. As Paul mentioned earlier, we feel great about our dividend. Our dividend is secure. We moved quickly to the process to take all the risks and hopefully, the overhang off of our situation as a result of this acquisition. As we view this acquisition on a going-forward basis, we're seeing a number of positives from the standpoint of potential additional rate base growth that we hadn't seen prior to this time. And as Bill mentioned, our unregulated fleet as a result of whatever these environmental rules ultimately shake out to be, we have a principally scrubbed coal fleet. We have the ability to convert some units where economically appropriate to gas and we're not facing a number of -- having to shut down a number of units that in the unregulated region could hurt us. I think that I feel it as we move forward, our unregulated fleet is still very well-positioned to gain from the upside when gas prices to return and power prices during turn. And we do expect to see certainly over the next couple of years, not sure where gas will go. But I certainly would expect to see some sparks spread improvement expansion over the next couple of years because there's not much anything being built.

Thanks for being on the call today, and I know it's a busy time for all of us in the sector. I'll start today's call with some commentary on earnings and our 2010 forecast, as well as a status update on the E.ON U.S. transaction. And then after that, we'll take your questions. 
Joining me on the call this morning are Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Spence, the Chief Operating Officer. 
This morning, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.51 a share for the third quarter that's compared with earnings of $0.05 a share in the same period a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations for the third quarter were $0.74 a share this year compared with $0.52 per share in 2009. And for the 9 months of the year, our reported earnings were $1.40 per share compared with $0.67 a year ago. Ongoing earnings for this period were $2.29 a share this year compared with a $1.43 per share last year. 
Before we move on to a discussion of our forecast for 2010, I will provide you a little bit of information on our acquisition of E.ON U.S. On Tuesday, we received FERC Commission approval for the transaction and that was the last regulatory approval necessary for us to close the transaction. So we currently expect closing will occur on November 1. 
I think this is really a remarkable accomplishment, given that we announced the transaction only 6 months ago. And over that period, we've received approvals from state regulators in Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, the FERC, U.S. Department of Justice and FTC. In June, we also successfully completed the equity portion of the financing for the acquisition, raising $3.5 billion in net proceeds through the sale of common stock and equity units. And I might add that during this period, we've been dealing with rate cases both in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania. And I think our, as Bill will point out, our ALJ has rendered a decision in Pennsylvania and we feel the Kentucky rate case was settled very appropriately. 
I think the swift regulatory approvals, as well as the oversubscription of the equity offering, did reinforce the soundness of our decision to make the acquisition and the value that it's going to create for all PPL stakeholders. And I am proud of our entire team and as well our colleagues in Kentucky from an execution perspective. And also, we've done significant work in the area of integration, getting ready to plug-in PPL with LG&E and KU on November 1 when we expect to close, so the integration teams have done a fine job on all sides in this area. The acquisition will immediately improve PPL's business mix by adding 2 very high-performing regulated utility operations to our portfolio. 
So with that, let's turn to our 2010 earnings forecast. This morning, we announced that we're narrowing the range of our 2010 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.80 to $2.95 per share. This reflects the dilution related to our June equity issuances, but it excludes any impact on earnings for the portion of 2010 that we will own and operate the business. The midpoint of the forecast is consistent with our original forecast for 2010 of $3.10 to $3.50 per share, and it's only been adjusted for dilution from the acquisition financing. So importantly, we expect as well to overcome the $0.05 impact of the unplanned Susquehanna outage we discussed in the second quarter call. Our forecast for GAAP earnings for the year reflected special items recorded through the first 9 months of the year and the dilutive effect of the new equity, it's now $1.94 to $2.09 per share.
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul for more detail on the financials. Paul?"

Earnings from our sup",486,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks on Slide 6 today. As you can see from the chart, the supply segment clearly drove our financial performance in the quarter and it obviously has year-to-date as well. Earnings from our supply segment increased significantly as a result of higher realized prices for our Eastern baseload gen. Supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges that we entered into at very attractive prices in the past. 
I'll begin the segment review of supply in Slide 7. The supply segment earned $0.54 per share in the third quarter, a $0.21 increase over last year. The increase resulted primarily from significantly higher realized sales prices from the Eastern baseload generation. In addition to energy margin, the third quarter was also impacted by higher O&M at our Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the forced outage at Unit 1, which was partially offset by the timing of outages at our coal-fired power plants, higher depreciation due to some scrubbers that were placed in the service last year, a lower effective tax rate, as well as dilution of $0.17 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8, our Pennsylvania delivery segment earned $0.08 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This increase was the net result of higher transmission revenue resulting from cost recovery through FERC formula-based rates and higher distribution revenue due to warmer weather compared to a year ago, higher O&M expenses due to higher contracting, storm expense, payroll and support group costs, lower income taxes as a result of the favorable U.S. Tax Court decision related to street lighting, and lower interest as a result of lower average debt balances. Finally, dilution in this segment amounted to $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 9, our international delivery segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, flat compared to last year. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices, which were effective April 1 of this year under Price Control Review 5, which was partially offset by a less favorable customer mix, higher pension expense, higher interest expense as a result of the GBP 400 million debt issuance this March, lower income taxes, and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've provided an update to our free cash flow before dividends forecast for 2010. Compared to our projections at the end of the second quarter, our Pennsylvania and international delivery segments have improved by about $40 million each, primarily due to changes in working capital. The biggest change comes in our supply segment, driven primarily by the receipt of third-party collateral postings, a decrease in unbilled revenue and the $381 million in proceeds from the pending sale of the non-core generating assets to LS Power. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

I know that today and tomorrow are very busy for everyone as we all prepare for EEI, so I'm going to keep my remarks today very brief. 
Starting with a request to increase distribution revenues at PPL Electric Utilities on October 15 of Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, ALJ recommended approval of the settlement we had reached with the other parties in the case. That settlement would result in a $77 million increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities. The Commission is expected to make a final decision on the case in December with new rates effective January 1, 2011. 
For the supply segment, I'd point you to the appendix to today's presentation for an update on our generation and coal hedge positions. The generation hedge volumes for 2010 and 2011 are virtually unchanged from the update we provided you on the second quarter call. You will note that the average hedge price for 2011 is somewhat lower, reflecting our expectations of where the contracts with collars will settle and updates to the small amount of load-following contracts we have in the hedge portfolio, as well as some rounding. 
The coal side reflects settlement of the collar prices for 2011, also to fixed prices and slightly higher hedge levels in 2012. Regarding basis, our assumptions for baseload generation are unchanged for what we discussed with you on the second quarter call. As a result of our hedges this year, we still expect to earn about $1 per megawatt hour at positive basis in the East this year and continue to estimate no basis premium to West Hub for 2011 or 2012. On the call transportation front, we continue to forecast coal delivery charges of $24 a ton in 2011. 
With that as our very brief operational update, I'll turn the call back over to Jim. And I look forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI. Jim?"

And if you look at the average hedge price in the East, previously I believe it was $58, it's dropped to about $56, reflecting now our expectation as we approach 2011 of where the contracts that have collars in them will settle out. So obviously, they're going to be settling out at the low end with the significant drop we've seen in power prices of late. It also reflects a small change because we only have 1% of the portfolio hedged through load-following contracts, but our expectations on those as well. So that went from $58 to $56 in the East. The West was unchanged. However, if you look at the total expected average price in the East, it actually dropped about around 3 -- or I'm sorry, in total, to $61, dropped by about $3. That's really reflective of the fact that there's some rounding in there. Because obviously, if the East went down too and the West was virtually unchanged that would only be a $2 change but due to rounding, it's a $3 change. So hopefully, that helped."

I think everything that we reviewed in due diligence and through our contacts with our LG&E, KU colleagues, everything is looking good. I think, obviously, from an environmental perspective, with the upcoming legislation that is pending in Washington, we see the rate base, potential rate base growth being much more significant than we had originally anticipated, given this is a vertically integrated regulated utility and principally burning coal. So I think our team, future team in Kentucky is already doing the legwork to brief regulators and state officials as to what this potential environmental regs could cause in a way of increase in the rate base and investment required. So I think all in all, a very positive answer to your question thus far. As it terms, when we talk about benefits, I think we really have been focused on getting this deal to closure and getting all the approvals and settling in a very positive way that the rate cases that we needed settled. Now the work begins to work together as a team and see what benefits we can extract from a combined entity."

Let me clearly say that we believe absolutely that our dividend is secure. It wasn't -- we weren't designing things to get to this way in terms of the dividend basically being able to be fully funded or nearly fully funded by the utility side of the business earnings. That is the case for next several years, we're very close to it, like I just said. It wasn't a goal but it's a reality, so depending upon what you want to view as the volatility or prospects around supply, the dividend is very secure. Now those utilities, as you just said, have significant rate base growth opportunity which we can always dial up and down, but if a large percent of those -- percentage of those earnings are being paid out, if you will, to support the dividend and cash is fungible, we will need to -- it'll be modest but we will need to access the appropriate capital markets to fund that growth. There will be, like I said, modest amounts of equity and debt needed to support the rate base growth opportunities, which drives future cash flow and earnings but that will be a reality. The credit protecting mechanism that we achieved by having for supply, as was just affirmed by S&P yesterday, that credit supporting mechanism comes by having strong utilities with strong ratings and strong growth in the business and that business needs to be funded. So until supply returns itself to more of a mid-cycle kind of set of numbers, where it's generating significantly more cash flow than the business needs, which eliminates -- probably more than eliminates the need mid-cycle to have to go to the equity markets to fund the utilities' rate base growth, we will have to do some modest access on that basis."

So I think the headroom is continuing to grow somewhat. So I would expect that shopping would continue to be active in 2011.

And of course, with our Kentucky assets, they're fully regulated and even they are, many of them are scrubbed and have SCRs.

Again, I know it's a busy time. I just like to reflect on a couple of issues here. It's been a very busy 6-month period for us at PPL, and I think with many positive outcomes of working our way through this acquisition and from the standpoint of working with the Kentucky regulator and seeing our way through that process successfully, we have certainly improved as you see in yesterday's announcement, improved our credit rating as confirmed by S&P. As Paul mentioned earlier, we feel great about our dividend. Our dividend is secure. We moved quickly through the process to take all the risks and hopefully, the overhang off of our situation as a result of this acquisition. As we view this acquisition on a going-forward basis, we're seeing a number of positives from the standpoint of potential additional rate base growth that we hadn't seen prior to this time. And as Bill mentioned, our unregulated fleet as a result of whatever these environmental rules ultimately shake out to be, we have a principally scrubbed coal fleet. We have the ability to convert some units where economically appropriate to gas and we're not facing a number of -- having to shut down a number of units that in the unregulated region could hurt us. I think that I feel it as we move forward, our unregulated fleet is still very well-positioned to gain from the upside when gas prices to return and power prices during turn. And we do expect to see certainly over the next couple of years, not sure where gas will go. But I certainly would expect to see some sparks spread improvement expansion over the next couple of years because there's not much anything being built. 
So with that, I thank you for being on the call, and we look forward to talking to you at the turn of the year. Thank you, operator."

Thanks for being on the call today, and I know it's a busy time for all of us in the sector. I'll start today's call with some commentary on earnings and our 2010 forecast, as well as a status update on the E.ON U.S. transaction. And then after that, we'll take your questions. 
Joining me on the call this morning are Paul Farr, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Spence, the Chief Operating Officer. 
This morning, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.51 a share for the third quarter that's compared with earnings of $0.05 a share in the same period a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations for the third quarter were $0.74 a share this year compared with $0.52 per share in 2009. And for the 9 months of the year, our reported earnings were $1.40 per share compared with $0.67 a year ago. Ongoing earnings for this period were $2.29 a share this year compared with a $1.43 per share last year. 
Before we move on to a discussion of our forecast for 2010, I will provide you a little bit of information on our acquisition of E.ON U.S. On Tuesday, we received FERC Commission approval for the transaction and that was the last regulatory approval necessary for us to close the transaction. So we currently expect closing will occur on November 1. 
I think this is really a remarkable accomplishment, given that we announced the transaction only 6 months ago. And over that period, we've received approvals from state regulators in Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, the FERC, U.S. Department of Justice and FTC. In June, we also successfully completed the equity portion of the financing for the acquisition, raising $3.5 billion in net proceeds through the sale of common stock and equity units. And I might add that during this period, we've been dealing with rate cases both in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania. And I think our, as Bill will point out, our ALJ has rendered a decision in Pennsylvania and we feel the Kentucky rate case was settled very appropriately. 
I think the swift regulatory approvals, as well as the oversubscription of the equity offering, did reinforce the soundness of our decision to make the acquisition and the value that it's going to create for all PPL stakeholders. And I am proud of our entire team and as well our colleagues in Kentucky from an execution perspective. And also, we've done significant work in the area of integration, getting ready to plug-in PPL with LG&E and KU on November 1 when we expect to close, so the integration teams have done a fine job on all sides in this area. The acquisition will immediately improve PPL's business mix by adding 2 very high-performing regulated utility operations to our portfolio. 
So with that, let's turn to our 2010 earnings forecast. This morning, we announced that we're narrowing the range of our 2010 ongoing earnings forecast to $2.80 to $2.95 per share. This reflects the dilution related to our June equity issuances, but it excludes any impact on earnings for the portion of 2010 that we will own and operate the business. The midpoint of the forecast is consistent with our original forecast for 2010 of $3.10 to $3.50 per share, and it's only been adjusted for dilution from the acquisition financing. So importantly, we expect as well to overcome the $0.05 impact of the unplanned Susquehanna outage we discussed in the second quarter call. Our forecast for GAAP earnings for the year reflected special items recorded through the first 9 months of the year and the dilutive effect of the new equity, it's now $1.94 to $2.09 per share.
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul for more detail on the financials. Paul?"

Earnings from our sup",486,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks on Slide 6 today. As you can see from the chart, the supply segment clearly drove our financial performance in the quarter and it obviously has year-to-date as well. Earnings from our supply segment increased significantly as a result of higher realized prices for our Eastern baseload gen. Supply business is clearly benefiting from the hedges that we entered into at very attractive prices in the past. 
I'll begin the segment review of supply in Slide 7. The supply segment earned $0.54 per share in the third quarter, a $0.21 increase over last year. The increase resulted primarily from significantly higher realized sales prices from the Eastern baseload generation. In addition to energy margin, the third quarter was also impacted by higher O&M at our Susquehanna nuclear station as a result of the forced outage at Unit 1, which was partially offset by the timing of outages at our coal-fired power plants, higher depreciation due to some scrubbers that were placed in the service last year, a lower effective tax rate, as well as dilution of $0.17 per share. 
Moving to Slide 8, our Pennsylvania delivery segment earned $0.08 per share in the third quarter, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This increase was the net result of higher transmission revenue resulting from cost recovery through FERC formula-based rates and higher distribution revenue due to warmer weather compared to a year ago, higher O&M expenses due to higher contracting, storm expense, payroll and support group costs, lower income taxes as a result of the favorable U.S. Tax Court decision related to street lighting, and lower interest as a result of lower average debt balances. Finally, dilution in this segment amounted to $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 9, our international delivery segment earned $0.12 per share in the third quarter, flat compared to last year. This performance was the net result of higher delivery revenue, primarily driven by higher prices, which were effective April 1 of this year under Price Control Review 5, which was partially offset by a less favorable customer mix, higher pension expense, higher interest expense as a result of the GBP 400 million debt issuance this March, lower income taxes, and dilution of $0.04 per share. 
On Slide 10, we've provided an update to our free cash flow before dividends forecast for 2010. Compared to our projections at the end of the second quarter, our Pennsylvania and international delivery segments have improved by about $40 million each, primarily due to changes in working capital. The biggest change comes in our supply segment, driven primarily by the receipt of third-party collateral postings, a decrease in unbilled revenue and the $381 million in proceeds from the pending sale of the non-core generating assets to LS Power. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for an update on operations."

I know that today and tomorrow are very busy for everyone as we all prepare for EEI, so I'm going to keep my remarks today very brief. 
Starting with a request to increase distribution revenues at PPL Electric Utilities on October 15 of Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, ALJ recommended approval of the settlement we had reached with the other parties in the case. That settlement would result in a $77 million increase in revenues at PPL Electric Utilities. The Commission is expected to make a final decision on the case in December with new rates effective January 1, 2011. 
For the supply segment, I'd point you to the appendix to today's presentation for an update on our generation and coal hedge positions. The generation hedge volumes for 2010 and 2011 are virtually unchanged from the update we provided you on the second quarter call. You will note that the average hedge price for 2011 is somewhat lower, reflecting our expectations of where the contracts with collars will settle and updates to the small amount of load-following contracts we have in the hedge portfolio, as well as some rounding. 
The coal side reflects settlement of the collar prices for 2011, also to fixed prices and slightly higher hedge levels in 2012. Regarding basis, our assumptions for baseload generation are unchanged for what we discussed with you on the second quarter call. As a result of our hedges this year, we still expect to earn about $1 per megawatt hour at positive basis in the East this year and continue to estimate no basis premium to West Hub for 2011 or 2012. On the call transportation front, we continue to forecast coal delivery charges of $24 a ton in 2011. 
With that as our very brief operational update, I'll turn the call back over to Jim. And I look forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI. Jim?"

And if you look at the average hedge price in the East, previously I believe it was $58, it's dropped to about $56, reflecting now our expectation as we approach 2011 of where the contracts that have collars in them will settle out. So obviously, they're going to be settling out at the low end with the significant drop we've seen in power prices of late. It also reflects a small change because we only have 1% of the portfolio hedged through load-following contracts, but our expectations on those as well. So that went from $58 to $56 in the East. The West was unchanged. However, if you look at the total expected average price in the East, it actually dropped about around 3 -- or I'm sorry, in total, to $61, dropped by about $3. That's really reflective of the fact that there's some rounding in there. Because obviously, if the East went down too and the West was virtually unchanged that would only be a $2 change but due to rounding, it's a $3 change. So hopefully, that helped."

Let me clearly say that we believe absolutely that our dividend is secure. It wasn't -- we weren't designing things to get to this way in terms of the dividend basically being able to be fully funded or nearly fully funded by the utility side of the business earnings. That is the case for next several years, we're very close to it, like I just said. It wasn't a goal but it's a reality, so depending upon what you want to view as the volatility or prospects around supply, the dividend is very secure. Now those utilities, as you just said, have significant rate base growth opportunity which we can always dial up and down, but if a large percent of those -- percentage of those earnings are being paid out, if you will, to support the dividend and cash is fungible, we will need to -- it'll be modest but we will need to access the appropriate capital markets to fund that growth. There will be, like I said, modest amounts of equity and debt needed to support the rate base growth opportunities, which drives future cash flow and earnings but that will be a reality. The credit protecting mechanism that we achieved by having for supply, as was just affirmed by S&P yesterday, that credit supporting mechanism comes by having strong utilities with strong ratings and strong growth in the business and that business needs to be funded. So until supply returns itself to more of a mid-cycle kind of set of numbers, where it's generating significantly more cash flow than the business needs, which eliminates -- probably more than eliminates the need mid-cycle to have to go to the equity markets to fund the utilities' rate base growth, we will have to do some modest access on that basis."

Right now, we have 485,000 customers still shopping and we would expect the bulk of those to continue either with their existing suppliers or to migrate to another supplier.

And clearly, since we put on the contracts that set the price of polar for next year, which went down by about a penny a kilowatt-hour, they've continued to fall. So I think the headroom is continuing to grow somewhat. So I would expect that shopping would continue to be active in 2011. But there's also the factor that those that would likely want to shop may have already taken the opportunity and those that either are not interested or it's a distraction for them or whatever, probably will continue not to shop.

It's been a very busy 6-month period for us at PPL, and I think with many positive outcomes of working our way through this acquisition and from the standpoint of working with the Kentucky regulator and seeing our way through that process successfully, we have certainly improved as you see in yesterday's announcement, improved our credit rating as confirmed by S&P. As Paul mentioned earlier, we feel great about our dividend. Our dividend is secure. We moved quickly through the process to take all the risks and hopefully, the overhang off of our situation as a result of this acquisition. As we view this acquisition on a going-forward basis, we're seeing a number of positives from the standpoint of potential additional rate base growth that we hadn't seen prior to this time. And as Bill mentioned, our unregulated fleet as a result of whatever these environmental rules ultimately shake out to be, we have a principally scrubbed coal fleet. We have the ability to convert some units where economically appropriate to gas and we're not facing a number of -- having to shut down a number of units that in the unregulated region could hurt us. I think that I feel it as we move forward, our unregulated fleet is still very well-positioned to gain from the upside when gas prices to return and power prices during turn. And we do expect to see certainly over the next couple of years, not sure where gas will go. But I certainly would expect to see some sparks spread improvement expansion over the next couple of years because there's not much anything being built. 
So with that, I thank you for being on the call, and we look forward to talking to you at the turn of the year. Thank you, operator."
