We're delighted to be here with you this morning to talk about our results. We will be discussing certain financial measures, not based on generally accepted accounting principles or so-called non-GAAP measures. We reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available at metlife.com on our Investor Relations page. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period, and may have significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments, we will take your questions. Here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management including Bill Mullaney, President of U.S. Business; and Bill Toppeta, President of International.

Before we get into earnings results, I'd like to take a moment to comment on recent developments that we noted in our press release. As we stated, we are in discussions with AIG over the potential acquisition of ALICO. But we have not reached an agreement, and there is no certainty that we will. Beyond that, I have nothing further to say about those discussions. But as I have repeatedly said, MetLife does not need to enter into any M&A transaction to meet our business objectives. And any transaction we undertake would be accretive and financially attractive to our shareholders, would accelerate our strategy. And importantly, we would be confident in our ability to execute and realize the transaction's economic value. In other words, our acquisition criteria have not changed.Now let's get started on our year-end results. During the fourth quarter, MetLife delivered very strong results, growing premiums, fees & other revenues to $9.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year and 10% sequentially. We converted growth into earnings with operating earnings of $793 million, significantly higher than they were a year ago and 10% higher than the third quarter of 2009. We have again demonstrated our strength as we grew our businesses and extended our lead in the marketplace. And we did this while maintaining our discipline in underwriting, pricing and risk management.Now let me share a few highlights from our businesses. In U.S. Business, results for the quarter were very good. Premiums, fees & other revenues of $7.8 billion grew 11% over the prior period, driven by a 32% growth in Retirement Products, 26% in Corporate Benefit Funding and 8% in Insurance Products. Within our Insurance Products segment, we enjoyed growth across all product groups. Individual life delivered solid results, with increased whole,term and universal life sales. Group life grew by nearly 10% and non-medical health grew by almost 5%, due largely to continued organic growth in our Dental business.In Retirement Products, the significant top line growth is due to higher income annuity premiums and fee income on our variable annuities. Total annuity sales were strong again at $4.2 billion, up from the third quarter, and driven mostly by $3.7 billion of variable annuity sales. This performance reflects continued strong sales in our traditional markets including individual distribution, banks and wirehouses, as well as our expanded partnership with Fidelity. We also continued to experience positive net flows and declining lapse rates, which I believe is a strong demonstration of a continuing flight to MetLife.In Corporate Benefit Funding, premium, fees and other revenues were $1 billion for the quarter, up from the prior period due to higher structured settlement premiums. Another area where we have gained market share and increased pension closeout premiums, which were strong in both the U.S. and the U.K. And rounding out the U.S. Business segments, Auto & Home also had another very solid quarter.Turning to International, we achieved double-digit growth across all of our regions. Premiums, fees & other revenues grew 22% over the prior period. Driven by strong growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil, our Latin America region grew its top line 18%. Asia Pacific grew 25% due to higher sales in Korea and China. In Japan, annuity sales continue to be impacted by current market conditions, with an 18% increase in fixed annuity sales and a 35% decline in variable annuity sales. And in our European region, which includes Europe, the Middle East and India, premiums, fees & other revenues increased by 32%, driven by growth in India.With momentum in our International businesses, we will continue to invest where we see growth opportunities. At our Investor Day in December, we talked about MetLife Bank, and how closely the bank ties to our retirement strategy. As you can see, with another solid quarter, the bank achieved almost $300 million in operating earnings for 2009. Clearly, a great result which we have built from two relatively small but important acquisitions. In a few moments, you will hear from Steve about our investment portfolio. But first, I'd like to say that the results are good. And as we projected at Investor Day, our credit losses are much lower this quarter.Looking back at the full year 2009, I'm pleased with our strong and consistent performance, particularly during the period marked by unprecedented economic events. We grew our premiums, fees & other revenues to $34 billion, up 4% over 2008. Our U.S. annuity sales totaled $21 billion, an increase of 10% over 2008. And our book value is recovering, up 37% from year-end 2008. During this time, MetLife has truly distinguished itself by increasing market share and growing our business when others could not. While at the same time, practicing sound risk management and expense control. As we shared with you at Investor Day, we are proud of the success of our operational excellence initiative, surpassing our initial goal one year ahead of schedule and raising the bar relative to both expense management and operational efficiencies going forward. As we move forward to 2010, let me assure you that we will exercise the same discipline that led us through the crisis and allowed us to extend our lead in the marketplace. I believe we are well positioned for future growth. Backed by a strong brand, solid financial position and a talented and dedicated management team, we have the foundation to create an even stronger, more valued and more profitable MetLife. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the fourth quarter was $212 mi",554,"Thanks, Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the fourth quarter was $212 million, which is above plan by $62 million, primarily from strong corporate joint venture in hedge fund returns, partially offset by continued negative real estate fund returns.Let me touch on our investment activity during the quarter. As discussed at Investor Day, we're reducing our cash position in purchasing spread assets as markets have stabilized. During the fourth quarter, we reinvested approximately $1.6 billion of cash in spread assets. Our overall investment yield for spread assets during the quarter, excluding short-term portfolios such as securities lending, was approximately 5.2%.Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continued to decline and were $272 million. Writedowns also continued to decline and were $297 million. These writedowns included $164 million in structured finance securities, $52 million from the strengthening of the mortgage valuation allowance and $16 million of corporate securities. Writedowns also included $49 million of hybrid securities and $16 million of partnerships in equity securities, which were impaired because of the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost.Overall, gross investment losses and impairments for Q4, excluding derivatives, were at the lower end of the post-tax range discussed at Investor Day. Losses from derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting were $810 million. This was primarily attributable to pretax losses of $383 million caused by higher interest rates and $327 million due to an improvement in MetLife's own credit spread and its impact on the valuation of certain insurance liabilities.Gross unrealized losses continued to decline and were $10.8 billion at December 31, down from $11.8 billion at September 30 as spreads declined across all sectors. For example, spreads for BBB-rated corporate bonds in CMBS declined about 60 basis points during the quarter. However, the gross unrealized gain decreased to $8.6 billion due to higher interest rates. As a result, the net unrealized loss increased slightly to $2.2 billion from $1.6 billion at September 30.Finally, I'd like to touch briefly upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the fourth quarter, we had no delinquencies on our U.S. portfolio. And total delinquencies were only $8 million or 2 basis points on the overall portfolio. While we expect that delinquencies may increase in 2010, we view the level of delinquencies as manageable, particularly given our commercial mortgage valuation allowance of approximately $590 million. This allowance represents 1.7% of our portfolio, which we believe would cover a 5.7% default rate.The loan to valuation of our portfolio increased slightly to 68% from 67% based on a rolling four-quarter valuation process, as the pace of value declines slowed. We estimate that market values will decline an additional 5% during 2010. Our average debt service coverage ratio remains strong at 2.2x, and loans above 80% loan to value have an average coverage ratio of 1.5x. Near-term maturities remain manageable with only $2.1 billion maturing in 2010.While we expect that the Real Estate sector will remain challenged, we are confident that our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $0.96 of operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter and $2.87 for the full year 2009, which are above our Investor Day estimates. As I think you will see, our business has performed well in the quarter. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the fourth quarter. Before I get started, I just want to remind you that I will now be speaking to our new U.S. Business, which consists of Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit Funding and Auto & Home. Also, as we had mentioned on last quarter's call and again at Investor Day, MetLife Bank has become more impactful to our financial results. And so with the fourth quarter of 2009, we have started separating the bank within Banking, Corporate & Other in our QFS. And so I will speak to the banks results as well.With that, let's get started. Let's begin with premiums, fees & other revenues. Premiums, fees & other revenues, which totaled $9.3 billion in the fourth quarter, are up 14% from the fourth quarter of last year, which is an excellent result. For the full year, our top line revenues totaled $34 billion, a 4% increase over 2008. Total premiums, fees & other revenues for U.S. Business of $7.8 million reflect an 11% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. The growth in Insurance Products revenues of 8% in the fourth quarter reflects across-the-board strength in group life, individual life and non-medical health. Retirement Products' revenue increase of 32% was driven by fee growth due to positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns and annuities, as well as an increase in income annuity premiums. Revenue growth in Corporate Benefit Funding of 26% was driven by strong structured settlement premiums in the current quarter. International's premiums, fees & other revenues are up 22% over the fourth quarter of 2008 on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across all three international regions. MetLife Bank's fees & other revenues from both forward and reverse mortgage activity increased to $258 million from $94 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 175%.Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were very strong in both group life and individual life with the full year mortality ratios coming in below Investor Day ranges. The group life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.7%, bringing the full year ratio to 90.3% versus our estimated range of 91% to 93%. Our individual mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1%, bringing the full year ratio to 82.5% versus our estimated range of 84% to 86%. As I mentioned on Investor Day, historically, we spoke about group disability morbidity ratios. Now that our Dental business has become just as important as our Disability business in terms of the bottom line at MetLife, for Non-Medical Health, we will discuss a total benefits ratio that includes Dental, Disability and other Non-Medical Health coverages such as long-term care, which we think is a better indicator of morbidity trends across the products in this segment. At 90.2% for the fourth quarter, this total benefits ratio is up from 86.3% in the prior-year quarter, and that was driven by higher Dental claims activity and weaker Disability margins during the recession. Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, while up, remained strong at 92.3% for the fourth quarter. This compares to last year's result of 84.9%. Also included in this combined ratio result is a non-capped prior accident year reserve release of $9 million after tax compared to a $27 million after-tax release in the prior-year period.Moving to investment spreads. As Steve mentioned, investment spreads improved this quarter as we continue to shift funds from cash and government securities to higher-yielding investments. In addition, variable investment income continues to improve. With regard to variable investment income, as Steve explained, we again saw a mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter. Strong returns on corporate joint ventures and hedge funds were partially offset by negative returns in real estate. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax, and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, was $40 million or $0.05 per share above the 2009 quarterly plan.Moving to expenses, our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. But we had some unusual items flowing through expenses this quarter, which drove our reported expenses up. Expenses at MetLife Bank were higher this quarter as compared to the prior year due to the significant growth in that business. And as I have mentioned in previous quarter's, pension and post-retirement benefits costs were also up from the prior year.  This quarter, we incurred $18 million after-tax and operational excellence charges, which consisted mainly of real estate writedowns. We also had certain one-time expenses this quarter that amounted to $44 million after tax. Together, these items amounted to $0.08 per share. All of these expenses appear in Corporate & Other.Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $793 million in operating income or $0.96 per share. If you recall, at Investor Day, we noted that we anticipated a positive impact from annual back unlockings and other adjustments, which we did not yet include in our projected operating earnings range because the amount was not yet final. This ultimately added $0.12 to our operating earnings. Offsetting this is an adjustment made in our International business relating to a change in assumptions for measuring the effects of inflation on inflation index securities in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. This reduced earnings by $0.13 per share. When we normalize for these two items as well as the other factors described earlier, we are still above our Investor Day estimates.With regard to investment gains and losses, in the fourth quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment losses of $557 million, which included derivative losses of $527 million after tax. As Steve mentioned, the derivative losses were primarily attributable to a tightening of MetLife's own credit spread which amounted to $213 million after tax, and a rise in interest rates impacting our interest rate swaps and floors. MetLife uses derivatives to hedge a number of its risks. Changes in the values of these derivatives are in general, offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $193 million after tax in the fourth quarter, and have been declining each quarter in 2010. Now, I'd like to take a moment to talk about cash and capital. For the fourth quarter, preliminary statutory operating earnings are an estimated $730 million. For the full year 2009, we had preliminary statutory operating earnings of approximately $3.3 billion after tax, and preliminary net income of approximately $1.8 billion after tax. Total adjusted statutory capital and surplus at year end is approximately $21 billion.  Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at year end totaled $3.8 billion.During the fourth quarter, the holding company paid our annual common stock dividend amounting to just over $600 million. We also invested $375 million into Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or MLIC, in the form of surplus notes during the quarter. We have not finished our RBC calculations for year-end 2009. But based on our work today, we are estimating that consolidated RBC will end the year at approximately $400 million, significantly above the $355 million to $375 million range provided at Investor Day. The increase was largely driven by better-than-expected results in the NAIC re-rating of our RMBS securities, as well as generally stronger fundamentals.I'd like to point out one thing about our book value. Book value per share, including AOCI, was $37.96 at year end, and that's a little lower than our Investor Day projection. This was almost entirely driven by an overall increase in interest rates during December. The general account, which was essentially a breakeven just before Investor Day, moved to a small unrealized loss at quarter end. By the way, since quarter end, the general account has swung back to an unrealized gain. In summary, our revenue growth remains strong. Our investment performance has improved and our earnings have grown considerably over the course of 2009. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

The financial responsibility fee, I mean, I'm sure Rob will maybe have come at about this, I would like to think that, that number would be zero, given what it's labeled. But I think based on everybody's assumptions regarding how that will be interpreted and implemented, it will have a relatively modest effect on the results. But it frankly all depends on what the details are in terms of do they exclude insurance liabilities? I read something the other day, which said they might exclude repos, which if consistent without would mean you would also exclude securities lending, footings. So if you're really just talking about our debt balances that would be affected by the fee, which I think that's where the argument ultimately goes, it's a really modest number, we're talking a few pennies. But again, I'm not sure why we would pay anything. With regard to the administration's tax proposals, again, the details are really preliminary. I would say with regard to the Colley's proposal [ph] or anything to do with the Iola, those are immaterial to us. And I think in some ways, that obviously help us. With regard to the DRD benefit, our total benefit that we received from the dividends received deduction today is approximately $0.20 annually. So that, I guess, what's potentially at risk. It's not clear to me if the proposal were to assume the assumption the loss of all or a piece of it, that's hard to say. And I think though, kind of the silver lining here may be is that as marginal tax rates go up on individuals, that probably on the margin increases the demand for a lot of our insurance products. And so there may be -- though they're obviously some ways we get penalized in this tax build or maybe with some benefits as well."

You're right there. And there's a lot of different ways to calculate leverage and everybody does a little differently. On a Moody's leverage ratio basis, we are just the under 30%. At that leverage ratio, we're a little under 30%. And so I would say as of now, based on that ratio, our current capacity for more better hybrid financing is nearly zero. Keep in mind one thing though. And this is sort of a conscious decision we made. We, at the beginning of 2009, in the throes of the financial crisis, we said, if we have an ability to go issue debt or raise money, raise cash to deal with whatever problems occur, we're going to do that. Because our debt leverage ratio at the end of 2008 was below 25%, I think, or around 25%. So we consciously issued securities, moved up the leverage ratio and then warehoused that cash on our balance sheet. So that's why we have such a big cash balance at the holding company now. So we let the leverage ratio go up. Well the good news is, happily, we needed almost none of that money. We did put a little dime on the insurance subs that if you're in, as I discussed, but the rest of it is still sitting there. So if you think about it, that's where my debt capacity went. It's now sitting in cash. I already used it and it's now sitting as cash in my holding company."

I would tell you, since you've given me this opportunity, I would say, I kind of want people to understand something about this because I think it sometimes gets lost here. Somebody tell me how this is perceived as a freebie. We had substantial ratings migration in the RMBS sector during 2009. We did get an adjustment from the NAIC re-rating process, but even net of all that, the increase in capital or the capital charge, if you will, from the ratings migration  on the net basis was still over $1 billion.

I do think they understand the point of why this was done and I think depending who talk to inside the rating agencies, they accept the methodology and the fact that given what -- sort of uniquely what's happened to RMBS, sort of the rating agency ratings versus the way they used to match up with the NAIC ratings doesn't really doesn't work any more. That sort of methodology is sort of broken. I think you'll get consensus on that. I do effectively think they will give us credit for it, but they'll look at it closely.

And the reason we did that is in non-medical health, Dental is about 50% of the total premium today. Disability premium is less than 25% of non-medical health and less than 5% of U.S. business overall. And so the Dental business over the last several years, because of the growth that we've gotten, primarily organic growth but also from a small acquisition that we do in 2008, has become a very important part of the U.S. business growth story. In terms of our outlook for Dental going forward, as you know, our Dental face some pressure from an earnings perspective in 2009. We saw utilization spike up, we think directly related to the increase in unemployment. However, that has started to stabilize as we look at the fourth quarter. And we've taken some significant pricing actions both from a renewal perspective, as well as a new business perspective going into 2010. So we expect earnings on that business to begin to rebound. In terms of acquisitions for that business, it's a great business for us as we talked about before, it's been a strong grower. It's got a very high ROE because the capital requirements for Dental were low. The acquisition that we did in 2008, which was small DHMO acquisitions in some key states in the West and the Southwest, not only helped us to grow the acquired business faster, but it gives us entrée into customers that we were not able to quote on before for our traditional PPO business because we didn't have the DHMO capabilities. So if we could do other acquisitions like that, that would help to expand out our DHMO capability as well as our traditional Dental capability in other markets, we would certainly do that."

Much of the discussion going back, if you put it all together over the last several months, one would wonder whether it made any difference, whether you are a bank holding company or not. And so certainly, it wouldn't make any sense to divest something under the theory that, that would somehow insulate from all regulatory reform and then turn around in the end and see that you sold something that had a great deal of value, strategic value and help us to cross sell products and services.

During the first quarter MetLife generated $8.8 billion in premiums in fees and other revenues. That is up 12% over the prior-year period. We grew operating earnings to $834 million. That is up significantly from a year ago and it is up nearly 5% sequentially. 
Book values per share improved noticeably in the quarter as well. Book value including AOCI is up 9% sequentially and book value excluding AOCI is up over 2%. The growth we are seeing on the bottom line demonstrates the discipline we have maintained in our underwriting, pricing, risk management and expense controls. We are also benefiting from the more favorable equity markets as they continue to recover. And, as you know, MetLife emerged from the economic crisis financially strong which positions us very well for the solid first quarter performance you will hear about today. 
Before we do that let me take a moment to comment on our recent agreement to acquire Alico. As I have said before we expect the acquisition of this highly complementary business will be rewarding to our shareholders and will accelerate our growth strategy. While we can’t comment on Alico’s first quarter financial results, let me highlight some integration progress to date. 
There are 30 regional and functional teams comprised of both MetLife and Alico associates dedicated to the integration. We have deployed a rigorous management plan to ensure a seamless transition. In the first few weeks after the announcement our team visited each of Alico’s major locations and met with many employees and approximately 200 senior leaders. We also are designing the optimal enterprise operating model which will fuel the growth of our combined businesses. 
Having said that, let me be clear that although the integration is a high priority we will not be distracted from achieving our 2010 plan and we know the same is true at Alico. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business in order to drive growth and shareholder value. 
Now turning to some highlights from our businesses. In U.S. business premiums, fees and other revenues increased to $7.4 billion, up 11% over the prior year. This strong result reflects top line growth in corporate benefit funding which more than doubled, retirement products which also increased dramatically and insurance products. Operating earnings were strong across all of U.S. business and at $757 million it represents a substantial increase from the $178 million one year ago. 
In our insurance products segment growth in premiums, fees and other revenues was driven primarily by a 6% increase in group life premiums over the first quarter of 2009. Non-medical health revenues were flat. Dental revenues increased but were partially offset by a decline in disability. Individual life premiums, fees and other revenues were also flat over the prior year. However, sales grew 15% driven by increases in whole, term and universal life products. Operating earnings nearly doubled over the prior year period with 92% growth from higher investment income, solid group life underwriting and lower expenses.  
In retirement products, better equity market performance and thus higher fee income contributed to strong top line growth of 27%. Fixed annuity sales of almost $360 million are lower than last year’s record levels due to high demand for MetLife’s fixed annuities at the onset of the financial crisis. Variable annuity sales of over $4 billion are up 9% sequentially and 8% over the prior year. Net flows remain strong. Lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product is contributing to our increased market share. Operating earnings and retirement products were strong at $159 million. 
In corporate benefit funding, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 112% over the first quarter of 2009 driven by higher pension closeout activity primarily in the U.K. Structured settlement premiums also continued to drive the excellent top line in corporate benefit funding. Earnings for this segment were up significantly from the prior year. 
Finally, within U.S. business auto and home results were solid. Top line growth was consistent with expectations and earnings were steady at $72 million. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was very good at 88.8. MetLife Bank delivered another good quarter. The bank generated revenues of $299 million, down from the unusually high levels in the prior period and consistent with overall market activity. Operating earnings remained healthy at $53 million. 
Turning to our international business we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 27% over the prior year and operating earnings grew 15%. In Latin America growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to top line growth of 28%. The Asia Pacific region grew 24% due to higher sales primarily in Hong Kong. In our Europe, Middle East and India region the top line increased by 30% driven by continued growth in India and strong sales in Europe. 
We continue to experience excellent top and bottom line growth internationally which is part of the reason why I am so excited about Alico. We can build upon this and leverage the complementary strengths of both companies to accelerate our growth even further. 
Steve will talk to you about our investments in a moment. I would like to say though I am very pleased with the overall performance of the portfolio which has returned to a net unrealized gain position. We also had a small net realized gain for the quarter which included impairments of $97 million after tax. So our run rate of credit losses is significantly below our projection of $1 billion for 2010. 
Finally, this month MetLife celebrated its 10th anniversary as a publicly traded company. In those 10 years we have become stronger and have significantly accelerated our growth, demonstrated by our consistent delivery of shareholder value. With all that has been accomplished and with what is on the horizon I feel very optimistic about the future. While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, I believe we have the strategy, leadership and momentum to position MetLife as one of the leading insurance companies in the world. 
With that I will turn it over to Steve Kandarian.

185648,99984624,58664,"MetLife, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-30-2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. Overall we continue to see improvement in the markets, rising variable income and lower losses.First, let me start with a comment on",604,"Thanks Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. Overall we continue to see improvement in the markets, rising variable income and lower losses.
First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income for the first quarter was $314 million which is $114 million above the top of the plan range that I gave at investor day. This was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns. While we expect returns to be below this level during the remainder of the year we believe variable income should remain strong. 
Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continued to decline and were $211 million while gross realized gains were $400 million. Write downs also declined and were $149 million. Excluding derivatives we had a net realized investment gain of $40 million this quarter. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $8.5 billion at March 31st, down from $10.8 billion at December 31 as spread declined across most sectors. Overall the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $1.5 billion at quarter end. 
Next I would like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the first quarter delinquent loans increased from $8 million to $162 million. This increase resulted from three loans, one of which is expected to be paid off during the second quarter with a loss of no more than $2 million. The second has been restructured and the third is a high quality property we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As such, we expect limited losses as recoveries on these loans are projected to be significantly above the historical average of 75%. 
As I noted on the last call, we anticipated the delinquencies might increase in 2010 but would be manageable particularly given our commercial mortgage valuation allowance of $624 million. We believe that commercial real estate valuations have bottomed out with an average peak-to-trough decline of about 40%. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio increased slightly in the first quarter to 69% based on a rolling four-quarter valuation process or we estimate to the low to mid 70% range if all properties were revalued today. 
Importantly only 2% of our portfolio have a loan-to-value greater than 80% and a debt service to coverage ratio of less than one times. Furthermore, we have seen pick up in office leasing activities compared to last year and hotel occupancies are also starting to improve. In summary, we remain confident our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market and that loss levels will likely remain low. 
Finally, given the recent headlines I would like to make a brief comment on MetLife’s exposure to Europe’s perimeter regions. As I mentioned in March when we announced our pending Alico transaction, MetLife’s general account has less than $40 million of total sovereign debt exposure to Italy, Ireland, Spain and Greece combined and we have no exposure to Portugal. These are countries in which we do very little business. 
Alico holds approximately $1.3 billion in Greek sovereign debt and their Greek bank holdings are diminimous. Remember, when the transaction closes these assets will transfer at market value to our GAAP financials. On a statutory basis Alico must be delivered with a 400% RBC ratio. While we are closely monitoring the impact of any country’s specific situation, we continue to believe that Alico’s portfolio is of relatively high quality with manageable loss expectations. 
With that I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.

MetLife reported $1.01 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. As Rob mentioned this strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher investment income, improved equity markets and the results of our expense management efforts. This morning I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter. 
Let’s begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues which were $8.8 billion in the first quarter are up 12% from the first quarter of last year and 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.4 billion reflect an 11% increase over the prior year. This includes a 27% increase in retirement products revenue due to increases in fees from positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns. 
Also revenue growth in corporate benefit funding is up over 100% from the prior-year quarter driven by strong structured settlements and U.K. closeout sales. As we have noted before, closeout sales do fluctuate and cannot be expected to occur at the same level each quarter. Internationally revenues are up 27% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis over the prior-year quarter driven by growth in all three regions. 
Turning to our operating margin let’s start with our underwriting results. In U.S. business our mortality results were mixed this quarter. The group life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.5% versus our estimated range of 90-95% which is an excellent result. Our individual life mortality ratio for the quarter was 87.6% which is slightly below our plan. At 91.2% for the quarter the non-medical health total benefits ratio is up from 87.4% in the prior-year quarter. While we continue to see signs of stabilization in dental utilization we did experience higher claims activity. Disability margins are also weaker due to higher incidents and lower claim recoveries. 
Turning to our auto and home business the combined ratio including catastrophes was 94.1% for the first quarter which is up over the prior year’s quarter results of 92.4% due to higher catastrophes and less prior year reserve releases. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 88.8% in the first quarter versus 88.1% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior-accident year reserve release of $5 million after tax was taken in this quarter compared to a $17 million after-tax release in the prior-year period.  
Moving to investment spreads. We saw an improvement in investment spreads this quarter with the improvement in the market and variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $71 million or $0.09 per share above the top of the 2010 quarterly guidance range given at investor day. As Steve explained this was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns. 
Moving to expenses our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Additionally, pension costs have stabilized and are no longer causing a significant impact year-over-year. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 21.7%, a solid result and below the 2010 guidance of 21.8-22.5% given at investor day. This quarter we did incur a $20 million after-tax or $0.02 per share in operational excellence charges and certain other one-time items. 
Turning to our bottom line results we earned $834 million in operating earnings or $1.01 per share. Included in our first quarter results is a one-time tax charge of $75 million or $0.09 per share related to the tax law change for Medicare Part D subsidy embedded in the recently enacted Healthcare reform legislation as well as a $13 million or $0.02 impact due to the expiration of certain business tax incentives for controlled foreign corporations. 
With regard to investment gains and losses, in the first quarter we had after-tax net realized investment gains of $2 million which includes derivative losses of $19 million after-tax. MetLife uses derivatives to hedge a number of risks. Changes in the value of these derivatives are in general offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $97 million after-tax in the first quarter which is a 50% decline from the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 are approximately $580 million and our preliminary statutory net income is $660 million. Finally, cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were $3.8 billion. 
In summary, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our revenue growth is strong. Our investment performance has improved and our earnings continue to grow. 
With that I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.

If they have investment losses they have some cushion to probably solve that problem. My guess is capital infusion will not be necessary.

We both as a company and as an industry leader we are very in touch continuously with people on the hill and people in the agencies and so forth. I will be a little more philosophical about this than you might want but it would be hard to be more specific. Everybody recognizes, and I mean everyone, that closing regulatory gaps to avoid future crisis is an objective. 
If we had all started out with a blank sheet of paper and said let’s identify the challenges and the objectives and from that we will glean language and that language will be efficient, elegant and clear relative to reform one would have envisioned a race horse; something very elegant. In fact, we knew that was not possible a long time ago. So you have realistically given the charged political climate and so forth people have been working on constructing a camel now for some time. If you know anything about camels you can construct one and it may look a little funny and it may not look particularly elegant but it gets you there. 
So we in the industry are working to make sure the Camel gets us where we want to go and it doesn’t spit, bite and kick. So that is sort of the philosophical answer and it is a good one relative to where discussions are. Quite frankly, most everyone in the debate recognizes the business of insurance needs to be protected from unintended consequences on bank regulations and we are pretty optimistic the debate is proceeding pretty nicely actually despite the turmoil we see in the press. We don’t think it is going to have too much adverse effect on the insurance industry. So that is a prognostication. Tune in.

So the idea of a carve out for the insurance companies is probably not going to happen but to carve out around specific insurance activities and how you measure that both on the liability and the asset side most likely will be the result. 
Rather than start out totally clean with some exceptions we will start out with the other end of the spectrum and then back out the business of insurance that needs to be protected. So that is kind of the flavor of what is going on at present.

Secondly, on disability losses or non-medical loss ratio, your disability losses seem like they are picking up, not a lot, but they are picking up as the economy has gotten worse. That is a little different than what the results have been for some of the other disability companies which have shown relatively stable margins. If you could give some detail on whether it is incident rates picking up or the recoveries not being that great? Finally, a numbers question since there were questions on Alico before, what was the RBC of Alico when the deal was announced so we can get an idea of how much they can absorb in terms of losses before having to put in more capital?

We have taken advantage earlier on in terms of some higher spread assets we thought had very good risk/reward tradeoffs. That obviously that has helped our yields here and our spreads.

We have been seeing the disability loss ratio pick up really for a good part of 2009. It is actually down a little bit over where it was in the fourth quarter. It is driven by a few things. The primary thing that is driving the loss ratio is recoveries and getting people back to work. Our level of recoveries is significantly below where we would expect it to be and that is having a big impact on the loss ratio. 
Incidents is up a little bit but it is not a lot. We had anticipated we were going to see this as the economy started to soften. We have been raising prices on the disability business. That is one of the reasons why non-medical health revenue was a little bit depressed because disability sales have been below what we would have expected if we hadn’t been taking the price increases. It is something we have been watching for awhile. We continue to manage it aggressively and we think the numbers will start to improve as the unemployment rate begins to come down.

I think the current number is 2.6% and the idea was it would go to 4% but depending on how your portfolio was performing it could be anywhere from 3-5%. 
Interestingly, since I think our performance of the commercial mortgage portfolio will be at the positive end, it is possible depending on how wide that band ultimately is between 3-5% and how low it dips, the honest truth is even if this passed it might have a very, very modest effect on our RBC ratio. I think if you took the midpoint of the range and said 4% it is I think Moody’s put out a piece which estimated the impact on us would be like 25 RBC points. I actually think we are obviously very close to what goes on in the NAIC and I think we have to wait and see how that initiative lands but I think we feel pretty good that is probably not going to be the final result of the capital requirements for commercial mortgages.

We ended up 2009 with a 432% consolidated RBC ratio. That is the highest RBC ratio this company has ever had frankly by quite a ways. On top  of that we had $3.8 billion of cash. So fast forward a quarter and while we had very good statutory earnings on a stat basis a realized investment gain and the cash position at the holding company hasn’t changed. 
So in many ways I think our capital position is frankly as strong as it has ever been. I don’t think the risk profile of the company has changed on whit frankly. Certainly we feel like we are properly capitalized and we have a very nice capital cushion currently. Now, the rating agencies obviously are concerned about the industry and about asset problems and certain categories especially the real estate business and commercial mortgages. I think we have spent a lot of air time discussing the high quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio, about how differentiated it really is. That is not just us talking. Remember the federal government stress test a year ago right about this time. The 19 large financial institutions of this country we were the only insurance company in that group. Our results of their stress test in our commercial mortgage portfolio is we had the highest performing portfolio. It wasn’t really close. 
We feel we are in very good shape. But I think we are at a point in time I think in the economic cycle where we have gone through a crisis. We have gone through the fire. A lot of people are very nervous. I think as the months tick by and our results are good and the market environment is getting better I think people will feel better. I don’t know the answer is we should be stockpiling more capital but we will continue to monitor it and we will obviously continue to have discussions with the rating agencies to make sure we would like to persuade them of our position. 
So that is my general feeling on capital. With regard to financing for Alico, I think we have said this before. We do need to raise some external capital. We said when we announced this transaction we expected to raise $2 billion of common and that we expected to do that publicly or privately and if we did it publicly we would be in a position to do it sometime this summer. None of that has changed. The only thing that has changed is I think when we made that announcement the stock was at $38 and I think it closed yesterday at $45 and change. 
So obviously we don’t have to sell quite as many shares. We probably wouldn’t have to sell quite as many shares as we originally had modeled. So that is sort of where we stand.

The second thing is we have some inflation linked assets in Latin America and due to some accounting quirks, if you will, that resulted in some more positive net investment income that shows up in that line item. There is an offset though on the liability side so you might see that elsewhere in the financial statements. So bottom line is you wouldn’t necessarily expect that number to trend up given current yields and spreads in the marketplace.

Even as Bill mentioned with your own pension its funding situation is stabilized. Are we starting to see the domestic pension closeout market warm up? Secondly, with respect to the legislative development I guess there is also some chatter out of Washington that we may see some favorable tax treatment change on annuities specifically encouraging people to annuitize. If you could perhaps comment on that? Then with respect to the comments you made earlier with the NAIC change to the commercial mortgage charge is that really all that important? I would assume it is really the rating agencies the charge on commercial mortgages that is ruling the day here. Perhaps you could compare the figures you put up for where the NAIC charge or capital charge may go on mortgages for what you are holding now under the various rating agency models?

We did have a very strong quarter in pension closeouts particularly in the U.K. The U.K. market has changed quite a bit over the last couple of years. A number of the competitors that were very aggressive in terms of pricing closeouts back in 2007 and 2008 have pulled back out of the market. There is still quite a bit of closeout activity and as a result we are writing a fair amount of business and we are writing it at good returns. 
In terms of what is happening in the U.S. I think your observations are right. The market is starting to open up a little bit. I think as the equity markets have recovered and funding status of the pension plans has improved there are more deals to be done. I would say some of the deals that are currently close to being resolved are on the smaller end in terms of size. Having said that there are some bigger deals and there are conversations that have been taking place over a number of months with some larger plan sponsors about potential closeout activity there. So we will see how that ultimately develops.

Everyone is working very hard relative to making sure that tax increases at least are consistent with what the overall focus is. For example, driven by both the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department at the moment there is quite a bit of focus on the need for securing more retirement income. That is work being done by DOL and the Treasury, not driven by the life industry. So one might presume it would be counter to exactly what the focus is to turn around and focus on taxes out of annuities. 
Who knows. That is across almost any kind of business activity in the United States. Everybody is hunkering down and making sure there are not unintended consequences about revenue gathering. I wish I could be more specific but obviously again both we are a company and we as a leader in the industry are very involved in these dialogues.

They said the proposed NAIC change is probably consistent with our base case in terms of losses we expect over the next three years for the industry. But they said the fact that this doesn’t really change our view because obviously we already had a view about investment losses. They did say that in a stress scenario the losses could be significantly larger. I think that is kind of the point. S&P I don’t think they have put out the same sort of piece. I think it is messaging the same thing. They feel in a stress scenario the losses in the commercial sector could be significantly larger and therefore people need to hold even more capital to be able to stress scenario. 
This is sort of about an economic capital, third sigma event or fourth sigma event or whatever you want to call it. A tail event. It is interesting. We obviously build our own economic capital models and I think have done a lot of really good work. One thing we have sort of learned is tail events are very, very hard and the world has also learned over the last few years that tail events are very hard to predict. How much capital or what the losses are likely to be in a tail event are difficult. It is really more art than science. This is maybe if you want to think about it is sort of the dispute we are sort of having with the rating agencies right now. 
It is sort of what capital is really appropriate for a tail event. I don’t know if there is any obvious answer to that. I guess I sort of think a couple of things. One, I don’t think there is any doubt the quality of our commercial portfolio is at one end of the spectrum both in this industry and just in general to that asset class. It is high quality. The way that portfolio was built over many years was not an effort to chase yield. It was an effort to diversify against corporate credit risk. I think anybody who has looked at those properties or understands the mortgage portfolio would readily agree with us it is very high quality and the statistics we get kind of back that up. 
So what may happen to the industry I don’t think is necessarily indicative of what may happen to us. Then I think it becomes a kind of a theoretical debate about what capital levels should be to deal with a stress test environment. That is sort of an interesting risk policy kind of decision. I think we are in a very good spot in terms of how we look at it. That is sort of why we are holding the capital we are today. I know I am giving kind of a long winded rant here but you are right it isn’t just necessarily about what is the immediate RBC impact. It really has more to do with what theoretically should be the ultimate level of capital held against that asset class.

First quarter sales were relatively strong compared to our expectation. As I mentioned in response to an earlier question we took some pretty aggressive pricing actions in both disability and dental. As a result of that we expected sales to be down in the first quarter of 2010 relative to 2009. That actually occurred. You see that I think reflected in the top line of the non-medical health segment but pretty much in line with what we expected. 
From a life insurance perspective pricing has continued to be very aggressive in group life segment particularly at the upper end of the market. We saw that very evidently in the first quarter of this year. We have, as we have talked about all along, been very disciplined about our pricing. Really over the last couple of years. That has had some impact on our sales results so our sales results in group life although in line with our expectations for 01/01 we are down relative to 2009. I think the real testament to the way we run our business is in the mortality ratio. We had one of the strongest mortality ratios we have had in group life in the first quarter which is typically not a great quarter for us. 
We really feel like the strategy we have deployed over the last few years in terms of running that business is the right one and we think that is showing up in our results for this quarter particularly as it relates to the mortality ratio.

Given the macro environment both crediting rates and yields should be going in the same direction. Then you manage to kind of a steady spread. But of course what is happening here is the macro environment didn’t change much in the first quarter and interest rates are still very low so as liabilities get re-priced or crediting rates get adjusted slowly for the whole book because sometimes crediting rates don’t change for as much as a year, that means that in a low environment you are still going to see crediting rates tick down. 
For us the reason yields have gone up isn’t really because the interest rate environment is better. It is really because we are putting money to work. Cash balance has dropped this quarter and we are just getting better investment performance out of our alternative asset classes or through variable investment income.

We grew operating earnings to $834 million, that's up significantly from a year ago, and it's up nearly 5% sequentially.
Book values per share improved noticeably in the quarter as well. Book value, including AOCI [accumulated other comprehensive income], is up 9% sequentially, and book value, excluding AOCI, is up over 2%. The growth we're seeing in the bottom line demonstrates the discipline we have maintained in our underwriting, pricing, risk management and expense control.
We are also benefiting from the more favorable equity markets as they continue to recover. And as you know, MetLife emerged from the economic crisis financially strong, which positions us very well for the solid first quarter performance you will hear about today. 
Before we do that, let me take a moment to comment on our recent agreement to acquire ALICO. As I said before, we expect that the acquisition of this highly complimentary business will be rewarding to our shareholders and will accelerate our growth strategy. While we can't comment on ALICO's first quarter financial results, let me highlight some integration progress to date. 
There are 30 regional and functional teams comprised of both MetLife and ALICO associates dedicated to the integration, and we have deployed a rigorous management plan to ensure a seamless transition. In the first few weeks after the announcement, our team visited each of ALICO's major locations and met with many employees and approximately 200 senior leaders. We also are designing the optimal enterprise operating model which will fuel the growth of our combined businesses. Having said that, let me be clear that although the integration is a high priority, we will not be distracted from achieving our 2010 plan, and we know the same is true at ALICO. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business in order to drive growth and shareholder value.
Now turning to some highlights from our businesses. In U.S. Business, premiums, fees and other revenues increased to $7.4 billion, up 11% over the prior year. This strong result reflects top line growth in Corporate Benefit Funding, which more than doubled; Retirement Products, which also increased dramatically; and Insurance Products. Operating earnings were strong across all of U.S. Business, and at $757 million, represents a substantial increase from the $178 million one year ago.
In our Insurance Products segment, growth in premiums, fees and other revenues was driven primarily by a 6% increase in Group Life premiums over the first quarter of 2009. Non-Medical Health revenues were flat. Dental revenues increased, but was partially offset by a decline in disability. Individual Life premiums, fees and other revenues were also flat over the prior year. However, sales grew 15%, driven by increases in whole, term and universal life products. And operating earnings nearly doubled over the prior-year period, with 92% growth from higher investment income, solid group life underwriting and lower expenses.
In Retirement Products, better equity market performance and thus, higher fee income, contributed to strong top line growth of 27%. Fixed annuity sales of almost $360 million are lower than last year's record levels due to the high demand for MetLife fixed annuities at the onset of the financial crisis. Variable annuity sales of over $4 billion are up 9% sequentially and 8% over the prior year. Net flows remain strong, lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product is contributing to our increased market share. Operating earnings in Retirement Products were strong at $159 million.
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 112% over the first quarter of 2009, driven by higher pension closeout activity, primarily in the U.K. Structured settlement premiums also continued to drive the excellent top line growth in Corporate Benefit Funding. Earnings for this segment were up significantly from the prior year. 
Finally, within U.S. Business, Auto & Home's results were solid. Top line growth was consistent with expectations, and earnings were steady at $72 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was very good at 88.8%. 
MetLife Bank delivered another good quarter. The bank generated revenues of $299 million, down from the unusually high levels in the prior period and consistent with overall market activity. Operating earnings remained healthy at $53 million.
Turning to our International business, we achieved another very strong quarter, with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 27% over the prior year, and operating earnings grew 15%. In Latin America, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to top line growth of 28%. The Asia Pacific region grew 24% due to higher sales, primarily in Hong Kong. In our Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 30%, driven by continued growth in India and strong sales in Europe. 
We continued to experience excellent top and bottom line growth internationally, which is part of the reason why I'm so excited about ALICO. We can build upon this and leverage the complementary strength of both companies to accelerate our growth even further.
Steve will talk to you about our investments in a moment. I'd like to say, though, that I'm very pleased with the overall performance of the portfolio, which has returned to a net unrealized gain position. We also had a small net realized gain for the quarter, which included impairments of $97 million after tax. So our run rate of credit losses is significantly below our projection of $1 billion for 2010. 
Finally, this month, MetLife celebrated its 10th anniversary as a publicly traded company. In those 10 years, we have become stronger and have significantly accelerated our growth, demonstrated by our consistent delivery of shareholder value. With all that has been accomplished and with what is on the horizon, I feel very optimistic about the future. While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, I believe we have the strategy, leadership and momentum to position MetLife as one of the leading insurance companies in the world. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Kandarian."

I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. Overall, we continue to see improvement in the markets, with rising variable income and lower losses. 
First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the first quarter was $314 million, which is $114 million above the top of the plan range that I gave at Investor Day. This was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns. While we expect returns to be below this level during the remainder of the year, we believe variable income should remain strong. 
Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continue to decline and were $211 million, while gross realized gains were $400 million. Write-downs also declined and were $149 million. And excluding derivatives, we had a net realized investment gain of $40 million this quarter.
Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $8.5 billion at March 31, down from $10.8 billion at December 31, and the spreads declined across most sectors.  Overall, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $1.5 billion at quarter end.
Next, I'd like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the first quarter, delinquent loans increased from $8 million to $162 million. This increase resulted from three loans, one of which is expected to be paid off during the second quarter, with a loss of no more than $2 million; the second has been restructured; and the third is a high-quality property that we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As such, we expect limited losses as the recoveries on these loans are projected to be significantly above the historical average of 75%.
As I noted on the last call, we anticipated that delinquencies might increase in 2010, but would be manageable, particularly given our commercial mortgage evaluation allowance of $624 million. We believe that commercial real estate valuations have bottomed out, with an average peak to trough decline of about 40%. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio increased slightly in the first quarter to 69% based on a rolling four-quarter valuation process, or we estimate to the low to mid 70% range if all properties were revalued today. 
Importantly, only 2% of our portfolio has a loan-to-value of greater than 80%, and a debt service coverage ratio of less than 1x.  Furthermore, we have seen a pickup in office leasing activities compared to last year, and hotel occupancies are also starting to improve.  In summary, we remain confident that our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market and that loss levels will likely remain low.
Finally, given the recent headlines, I would like to make a brief comment on MetLife's exposure to Europe's perimeter region. As I mentioned in March when we announced our pending ALICO transaction, MetLife's general account has less than $40 million of total sovereign debt exposure to Italy, Ireland, Spain and Greece combined, and we have no exposure to Portugal. These are countries in which we do very little business. ALICO holds approximately $1.3 billion in Greek sovereign debt, and the Greek bank holdings are de minimis. Remember, when a transaction closes, these assets will transfer at market value to our GAAP financials. And on a statutory basis, ALICO must be delivered with a 400% RBC ratio. While we are closely monitoring the impact of any country's specific situation, we continue to believe that ALICO's portfolio is of relatively high quality, with manageable loss expectations. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $1.01 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. As Rob mentioned, the strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher investment income, improved equity markets and the results of our expense management efforts. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $8.8 billion in the first quarter, are up 12% from the first quarter of last year, and 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.4 billion reflect an 11% increase over the prior year. This includes a 27% increase in Retirement Products revenue due to increases in fees from positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns. Also, revenue growth in Corporate Benefit Funding is up over 100% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong structured settlement and U.K. closeout sales. As we have noted before, closeout sales do fluctuate and cannot be expected to recur at the same level each quarter.
International's revenues are up 27% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis over the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in all three regions.
Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were mixed this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.5% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is an excellent result. And our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 87.6%, which is slightly below our plan. At 91.2% for the quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio is up from 87.4% in the prior-year quarter. While we continue to see signs of stabilization in Dental utilization, we did experience higher claims activity. Disability margins are also weaker due to higher incidence and lower claim recoveries.
Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 94.1% for the first quarter, which is up over the prior year's quarter results of 92.4%. That's due to higher catastrophes and less prior-year reserve releases. This combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.8% in the first quarter versus 88.1% in the prior-year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release [ph] (30:39) of $5 million after tax was taken in this quarter compared to a $17 million after-tax release [ph] (30:46) in the prior-year period.
Moving to investment spreads. We saw an improvement in investment spreads this quarter, with an improvement in the market and variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $71 million or $0.09 per share above the top of the 2010 quarterly guidance range given at Investor Day. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns.
Moving to expenses. Our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Additionally, pension costs have stabilized and are no longer causing a significant impact year-over-year. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 21.7%, a solid result and below the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22.5% given at Investor Day. This quarter, we did incur a $20 million after-tax or $0.02 per share in operational excellence charges and certain other one-time items.
Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $834 million in operating earnings or $1.01 per share. Included in our first quarter results is a one-time tax charge of $75 million or $0.09 per share related to the tax law change from Medicare Part D subsidy embedded in the recently enacted healthcare reform legislation, as well as a $13 million or $0.02 per share impact due to the expiration of certain business tax incentives for controlled foreign corporations.
With regard to investment gains and losses, in the first quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment gains of $2 million, which included derivative losses of $19 million after tax. MetLife used this derivative to hedge a number of risks. Changes in the value of these derivatives are, in general, offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $97 million after tax in the first quarter, which is a 50% decline from the fourth quarter of 2009. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 are approximately $580 million, and our preliminary statutory net income is $660 million. Finally, cash and liquid assets of the holding company at quarter end were $3.8 billion.
In summary, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our revenue growth is strong, our investment performance has improved and our earnings continue to grow. 
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So they're going to have some cushion. And so if there are investment losses between now and when we close -- by the way, our expectation is we're six months away from closing -- if there are going to be investment losses, they have some cushion to probably solve that problem.

I'll be a little more philosophical about this than you might want, but it'd be hard to be more specific. I mean, everybody recognizes, and I mean everyone, that closing regulatory gaps to avoid future crisis is an objective. If we had all started out with a blank sheet of paper and said, let's identify the challenges and the objectives, and from that, we'll glean language and that language will be efficient, elegant and clear relative to reform, one would have envisioned a racehorse, something very elegant. In fact, we knew that, that was not possible a long time ago. So you've got realistically, given the charged political climate and so forth, people have been working on constructing a camel now for some time. And if you know anything about camels, you can construct one and it might look a little funny and it may not be particularly elegant, but it gets you there. So we, in the industry, are working to make sure that the camel gets us where we want to go, and it doesn't spit and bite and kick. And so that's sort philosophical answer, and it's a good one relative to where discussions are, because, quite frankly, most everyone in the debate recognizes that the business of insurance needs to be protected from unintended consequences on bank regulations. And we're pretty optimistic that the debate is proceeding pretty nicely actually, despite the turmoil that we see in the press. And we don't think it's going to have too much adverse effect on the insurance industry. So that's a prognostication, but tune in."

We are collateralized in that activity. The idea of a carve out for the insurance companies is probably not going to happen. But the carve out around specific insurance activities and how you measure that, both on the liability and the asset side, most likely will be the result. And so rather than start out totally clean with some exceptions, we'll start out with the other end of the spectrum and then back out the business of insurance that needs to be protected.

Secondly, on disability losses or non-medical loss ratio, your disability losses seem like they're picking up, not a lot, but they are picking up as the economy's gotten worse. And that's a little different than what the results have been for some of the other disability companies which have shown relatively stable margins. So if you can just give some detail on whether it's incidence rates picking up or the recovery is not being that great.

We've been seeing the Disability loss ratio tick up really for a good part of 2009. It's actually down a little bit over where it was in the fourth quarter. It's driven by a few things. The primary thing that's driving the loss ratio is recoveries and getting people back to work. Our level of recoveries is significantly below where we would expect it to be, and that's having a big impact on the loss ratio. Incidence is up a little bit, but it's not up a lot. And so we had anticipated that we were going to see this as the economy started to soften. We've been raising prices on the Disability business. That's one of the reasons why Nonmedical Health revenue was a little bit depressed because our Disability sales have been below what we would have expected if we hadn't been taking the price increases. So it's something that we've been watching for a while. We continue to manage it aggressively, and we think that the numbers will start to improve as the unemployment rate begins to come down."

I think the current number's 2.6%, and the ideal was that it would go to 4%. But depending on how your portfolio is performing, it could be anywhere from a 3% to 5%. So interestingly, since I think our performance of our commercial mortgage portfolio will be at the positive end, it's possible that -- and depending on how wide that band ultimately is between 3% and 5% and how low it dips, the honest truth is that even if it's passed, it might have a very, very modest effect on our RBC ratio. But I think if we took the midpoint of the range, we said 4%, it's -- I think Moody's put out a piece, which estimated the impact on us would be like 25 RBC points, I actually think we're obviously very close to what goes on in the NAIC. And I think we have to wait and see about how that initiative lands.

We ended up 2009 with a 432% consolidated RBC ratio. That's the highest RBC ratio the company's ever had, frankly, by quite a ways. And on top of that, we had $3.8 billion of cash. And so fast-forward a quarter, while we had very good statutory earnings, on a stat basis, our realized investment gain and the cash position of the holding company hasn't changed. So in many ways, I think our capital position you know frankly is the strongest it's ever been. And I don't think the risk profile of this company has changed one whit frankly. So certainly, we feel like we're properly capitalized and we have a very nice capital cushion currently. Now the rating agencies obviously are concerned about the industry and about asset problems in certain categories especially the real estate business, commercial mortgages, I think we spent a lot of air time discussing the high quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio, about how differentiated it really is. And that's not just us talking. Remember the federal government stress test of a year ago, right about this time? 19 large financial institutions in this country, we were the only insurance company in that group. Our performance or our result of their stress test in our commercial mortgage portfolio is we had the highest performing portfolio and it wasn't really close. So we feel we're in very good shape. But I think that we're at a point in time, as I think of the economic cycle where it's gone through a crisis, we've gone through the fire. A lot of people are very nervous. I think as the months tick by, I think -- and our results are good and market environment is getting better, I think people will feel better. So I don't know. The answer is that we should be stockpiling more capital. But we'll continue to monitor it. And we'll obviously continue to have discussions with the rating agencies to make sure that they -- we'd like to persuade them of our position. So that's my general feeling of our capital. With regard to financing for ALICO, I think we've said this before. We do need to raise some external capital. We've said when we announced this transaction, we expected to raise $2 billion of common. And that we expected to do that publicly or privately, and if we did it publicly, we'd be in a position to do it some time this summer. None of that has changed. And the only thing that has changed is I think when we made that announcement, the stock was at $38. And I think it closed yesterday at $45 unchanged. So obviously we know how to sell quite as many shares. We'll probably would have to sell quite as many shares as we originally modeled. So that's sort of where we stand."

The market is starting to open up a little bit. I think as equity markets have recovered and funding status of pension plans has improved. There are more deals to be done. I would say some of the deals that are currently close to being resolved are on the smaller end in terms of size. Having said that, there are some bigger deals. And there are conversations that have been taking place over a number of months with some larger plan sponsors about potential closeout activity there. So we'll see how that ultimately develops."

And that's work being done by DOL and the Treasury, not driven by the life industry. So one might presume that it would be counter to exactly what the focus is to turn around and focus on taxes out of annuities. But who knows? And that's across almost any kind of the business activity in the United States. Everybody's hunkering down in terms of making sure there are not unintended consequences about revenue gathering.

They sort of said well, the proposed NAIC change is probably consistent with our base case in terms of losses that we expect over the next three years for the industry. But they said the fact that this -- this doesn't really change our view because obviously we already had a view about investor losses. They did say though that in a stress scenario, the losses could be significantly larger. And I think that's kind of a point. Because S&P, though I don't they put out quite the same sort of piece, is I think messaging the same thing. They feel in a stress scenario that the losses in the commercial mortgage sector could be significantly larger and therefore, people need to hold even more capital to deal with a stress scenario. And this is sort of about an economic capital third sigma event or fourth sigma event or whatever you want to call it, a tail event. It's interesting. We obviously build our own economic capital models, and I think have done a lot of really good work. And one thing we've sort of learned is tail events are very, very hard. And as the world has also learned over the last two years, tail events are very hard to predict. And how much capital or what losses are likely to be in a tail event are difficult, and it's really more art than science. And this is maybe, if you want to think about it, sort of the dispute we're sort of having with the rating agencies right now, is sort of what capital is really appropriate for a tail event. And I don't know if there's any obvious answer to that. But I guess I'd sort of think of a couple of things. One, I don't think there's any doubt that the quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio is at one end of the spectrum both in this industry and just generally for that asset class. So you know it is high quality. The way that portfolio was built over many years was not in an effort to change yield. It was an effort to diversify against corporate credit risk. And I think anybody who's looked at those properties or understands the mortgage portfolio would readily agrees with us. It's very high quality, and the statistics we give kind of back that up. So what may happen for the industry, I don't think, is necessarily indicative of what may happen to us. And then I think it becomes kind of a theoretical debate about what capital levels should be to deal with a stress test environment. And that's sort of an interesting risk policy kind of decision. I think we're in a very good spot in terms of how we'd look at it. And so in that sort light, we're holding the capital we are today. So I know I'm kind of long-winded here, but you're right. It really isn't just necessarily about what is the immediate RBC impact. It really has more to do with what theoretically should be the ultimate level of capital held against that asset class."

The first quarter sales were relatively strong compared to our expectation. As I mentioned in a response to an earlier question, we took some pretty aggressive pricing actions in both visibility and dental. And as a result of that, we expected sales to be down in the first quarter of 2010 relative to 2009, and that actually occurred. And you see that, I think, reflected in the top line in the Nonmedical Health segment but pretty much in line with what we expected. From a life insurance perspective, pricing has continued to be very aggressive in the Group Life segment particularly at the upper end of the market. We saw that very evidently in the first quarter of this year. We have, as we've talked about all along, been very disciplined about our pricing. Really over the last couple of years, that has had some impact on our sales results or our sales results in Group Life. Although in line with our expectations for '11, we're down relative to 2009. But I think the real testament to the way that we run our business is in the mortality ratio. And we had one of the strongest mortality ratios that we've had in the Group Life in the first quarter, which is typically not a great quarter for us. So we really feel like the strategy that we've deployed over the last few years in terms of running that business is the right one. And we think that that's showing up in our results for this quarter particularly as it relates to the mortality ratio."

Given a macro environment, both crediting rates and yields should be going in the same direction, and then you manage to kind of a steady spread. But of course what's happening here is the macro environment didn't change much in the first quarter, and interest rates are still very low. And so as liabilities get repriced, if you will, the crediting rates get adjusted slowly for the whole book because sometimes crediting rates don't change for as much as a year. That means that in a low environment, you're still going to see crediting rates tick down. For us, the reason yields have gone up isn't really because the interest rate environment is better. It really is because we're putting more money to work. Cash balances dropped this quarter, and we're also just getting better investment performance out of our alternative asset classes or through variable investment income. But by the way, I would just say that in general, spreads widen but they're only getting back to normal. And if you'd compare them to our guidance that we gave this year, I think they're a little better than guidance in many cases but really only back to normal."

During the first quarter,  MetLife generated $8.8 billion in premiums and fees and other revenues. That's up 12% over the prior-year period. We grew operating earnings to $834 million, that's up significantly from a year ago, and it's up nearly 5% sequentially.
Book values per share improved noticeably in the quarter as well. Book value, including AOCI [accumulated other comprehensive income], is up 9% sequentially, and book value, excluding AOCI, is up over 2%. The growth we're seeing in the bottom line demonstrates the discipline we have maintained in our underwriting, pricing, risk management and expense control.
We're also benefiting from the more favorable equity markets as they continue to recover. And as you know, MetLife emerged from the economic crisis financially strong, which positions us very well for the solid first quarter performance you will hear about today. 
Before we do that, let me take a moment to comment on our recent agreement to acquire ALICO. As I said before, we expect that the acquisition of this highly complementary business will be rewarding to our shareholders and will accelerate our growth strategy. While we can't comment on ALICO's first quarter financial results, let me highlight some integration progress to date. 
There are 30 regional and functional teams comprised of both MetLife and ALICO associates dedicated to the integration, and we have deployed a rigorous management plan to ensure a seamless transition. In the first few weeks after the announcement, our team visited each of ALICO's major locations and met with many employees and approximately 200 senior leaders. We also are designing the optimal enterprise operating model which will fuel the growth of our combined businesses. Having said that, let me be clear that although the integration is a high priority, we will not be distracted from achieving our 2010 plan, and we know the same is true at ALICO. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business in order to drive growth and shareholder value.
Now turning to some highlights from our businesses. In U.S. Business, premiums, fees and other revenues increased to $7.4 billion, up 11% over the prior year. This strong result reflects top line growth in Corporate Benefit Funding, which more than doubled; Retirement Products, which also increased dramatically; and Insurance Products. Operating earnings were strong across all of U.S. Business, and at $757 million, represents a substantial increase from the $178 million one year ago.
In our Insurance Products segment, growth in premiums, fees and other revenues was driven primarily by a 6% increase in Group Life premiums over the first quarter of 2009. Non-Medical Health revenues were flat. Dental revenues increased, but was partially offset by a decline in disability. Individual Life premiums, fees and other revenues were also flat over the prior year. However, sales grew 15%, driven by increases in Whole, Term and Universal Life products. And operating earnings nearly doubled over the prior-year period, with 92% growth from higher investment income, solid group life underwriting and lower expenses.
In Retirement Products, better equity market performance and thus, higher fee income, contributed to strong top line growth of 27%. Fixed annuity sales of almost $360 million are lower than last year's record levels due to the high demand for MetLife fixed annuities at the onset of the financial crisis. Variable annuity sales of over $4 billion are up 9% sequentially and 8% over the prior year. Net flows remain strong, lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product is contributing to our increased market share. Operating earnings in Retirement Products were strong at $159 million.
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 112% over the first quarter of 2009, driven by higher pension closeout activity, primarily in the U.K. Structured settlement premiums also continue to drive the excellent top line growth in Corporate Benefit Funding. Earnings for this segment were up significantly from the prior year. 
Finally, within U.S. Business, Auto & Home's results were solid. Top line growth was consistent with expectations, and earnings were steady at $72 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was very good at 88.8%. 
MetLife Bank delivered another good quarter. The bank generated revenues of $299 million, down from the unusually high levels in the prior period and consistent with overall market activity. Operating earnings remained healthy at $53 million.
Turning to our International business, we achieved another very strong quarter, with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 27% over the prior year, and operating earnings grew 15%. In Latin America, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to top line growth of 28%. The Asia Pacific region grew 24% due to higher sales, primarily in Hong Kong. In our Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 30%, driven by continued growth in India and strong sales in Europe. 
We continue to experience excellent top and bottom line growth internationally, which is part of the reason why I'm so excited about ALICO. We can build upon this and leverage the complementary strength of both companies to accelerate our growth even further.
Steve will talk to you about our investments in a moment. I'd like to say, though, that I'm very pleased with the overall performance of the portfolio, which has returned to a net unrealized gain position. We also had a small net realized gain for the quarter, which included impairments of $97 million after tax. So our run rate of credit losses is significantly below our projection of $1 billion for 2010. 
Finally, this month, MetLife celebrated its 10th anniversary as a publicly traded company. In those 10 years, we have become stronger and have significantly accelerated our growth, demonstrated by our consistent delivery of shareholder value. With all that has been accomplished and with what is on the horizon, I feel very optimistic about the future. While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, I believe we have the strategy, leadership and momentum to position MetLife as one of the leading insurance companies in the world. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Kandarian."

I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. Overall, we continue to see improvement in the markets, with rising variable income and lower losses. 
First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the first quarter was $314 million, which is $114 million above the top of the plan range that I gave at Investor Day. This was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns. While we expect returns to be below this level during the remainder of the year, we believe variable income should remain strong. 
Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continue to decline and were $211 million, while gross realized gains were $400 million. Write-downs also declined and were $149 million. And excluding derivatives, we had a net realized investment gain of $40 million this quarter.
Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $8.5 billion at March 31, down from $10.8 billion at December 31, and the spreads declined across most sectors. Overall, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $1.5 billion at quarter end.
Next, I'd like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the first quarter, delinquent loans increased from $8 million to $162 million. This increase resulted from three loans, one of which is expected to be paid off during the second quarter, with a loss of no more than $2 million; the second has been restructured; and the third is a high-quality property that we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As such, we expect limited losses as the recoveries on these loans are projected to be significantly above the historical average of 75%.
As I noted on the last call, we anticipated that delinquencies might increase in 2010, but would be manageable, particularly given our commercial mortgage evaluation allowance of $624 million. We believe that commercial real estate valuations have bottomed out, with an average peak to trough decline of about 40%. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio increased slightly in the first quarter to 69% based on a rolling four-quarter valuation process, or we estimate to the low to mid 70% range if all properties were revalued today. 
Importantly, only 2% of our portfolio has a loan-to-value of greater than 80%, and a debt service coverage ratio of less than 1x.  Furthermore, we have seen a pickup in office leasing activities compared to last year, and hotel occupancies are also starting to improve.  In summary, we remain confident that our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market and that loss levels will likely remain low.
Finally, given the recent headlines, I would like to make a brief comment on MetLife's exposure to Europe's perimeter region. As I mentioned in March when we announced our pending ALICO transaction, MetLife's general account has less than $40 million of total sovereign debt exposure to Italy, Ireland, Spain and Greece combined, and we have no exposure to Portugal. These are countries in which we do very little business. ALICO holds approximately $1.3 billion in Greek sovereign debt, and the Greek bank holdings are de minimis. Remember, when a transaction closes, these assets will transfer at market value to our GAAP financials. And on a statutory basis, ALICO must be delivered with a 400% RBC ratio. While we are closely monitoring the impact of any country's specific situation, we continue to believe that ALICO's portfolio is of relatively high quality, with manageable loss expectations. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $1.01 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. As Rob mentioned, the strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher investment income, improved equity markets and the results of our expense management efforts. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $8.8 billion in the first quarter, are up 12% from the first quarter of last year, and 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.4 billion reflect an 11% increase over the prior year. This includes a 27% increase in Retirement Products revenue due to increases in fees from positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns. Also, revenue growth in Corporate Benefit Funding is up over 100% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong structured settlement and U.K. closeout sales. As we have noted before, closeout sales do fluctuate and cannot be expected to recur at the same level each quarter.
International's revenues are up 27% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis over the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in all three regions.
Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were mixed this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.5% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is an excellent result. And our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 87.6%, which is slightly below our plan. At 91.2% for the quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio is up from 87.4% in the prior-year quarter. While we continue to see signs of stabilization in Dental utilization, we did experience higher claims activity. Disability margins are also weaker due to higher incidence and lower claim recoveries.
Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 94.1% for the first quarter, which is up over the prior year's quarter results of 92.4%. That's due to higher catastrophes and less prior-year reserve releases. This combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.8% in the first quarter versus 88.1% in the prior-year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $5 million after tax was taken in this quarter compared to a $17 million after-tax release in the prior-year period.
Moving to investment spreads. We saw an improvement in investment spreads this quarter, with an improvement in the market and variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $71 million or $0.09 per share above the top of the 2010 quarterly guidance range given at Investor Day. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns.
Moving to expenses. Our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Additionally, pension costs have stabilized and are no longer causing a significant impact year-over-year. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 21.7%, a solid result and below the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22.5% given at Investor Day. This quarter, we did incur a $20 million after-tax or $0.02 per share in operational excellence charges and certain other one-time items.
Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $834 million in operating earnings or $1.01 per share. Included in our first quarter results is a one-time tax charge of $75 million or $0.09 per share related to the tax law change from Medicare Part D subsidy embedded in the recently enacted healthcare reform legislation, as well as a $13 million or $0.02 per share impact due to the expiration of certain business tax incentives for controlled foreign corporations.
With regard to investment gains and losses, in the first quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment gains of $2 million, which included derivative losses of $19 million after tax. MetLife used this derivative to hedge a number of risks. Changes in the value of these derivatives are, in general, offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $97 million after tax in the first quarter, which is a 50% decline from the fourth quarter of 2009. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 are approximately $580 million, and our preliminary statutory net income is $660 million. Finally, cash and liquid assets of the holding company at quarter end were $3.8 billion.
In summary, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our revenue growth is strong, our investment performance has improved and our earnings continue to grow. 
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So you've got realistically, given the charged political climate and so forth, people have been working on constructing a camel now for some time. And if you know anything about camels, you can construct one and it might look a little funny and it may not be particularly elegant, but it gets you there. So we, in the industry, are working to make sure that the camel gets us where we want to go, and it doesn't spit and bite and kick. And so that's sort philosophical answer, and it's a good one relative to where discussions are, because, quite frankly, most everyone in the debate recognizes that the business of insurance needs to be protected from unintended consequences on bank regulations. And we're pretty optimistic that the debate is proceeding pretty nicely actually, despite the turmoil that we see in the press. And we don't think it's going to have too much adverse effect on the insurance industry. So that's a prognostication, but tune in."

But the carve out around specific insurance activities and how you measure that, both on the liability and the asset side, most likely will be the result. And so rather than start out totally clean with some exceptions, we'll start out with the other end of the spectrum and then back out the business of insurance that needs to be protected.

We've been seeing the Disability loss ratio tick up really for a good part of 2009. It's actually down a little bit over where it was in the fourth quarter. It's driven by a few things. The primary thing that's driving the loss ratio is recoveries and getting people back to work. Our level of recoveries is significantly below where we would expect it to be, and that's having a big impact on the loss ratio. Incidence is up a little bit, but it's not up a lot. And so we had anticipated that we were going to see this as the economy started to soften. We've been raising prices on the Disability business. That's one of the reasons why Non-Medical Health revenue was a little bit depressed because our Disability sales have been below what we would have expected if we hadn't been taking the price increases. So it's something that we've been watching for a while. We continue to manage it aggressively, and we think that the numbers will start to improve as the unemployment rate begins to come down."

So interestingly, since I think our performance of our Commercial Mortgage portfolio will be at the positive end, it's possible that -- and depending on how wide that band ultimately is between 3% and 5% and how low it dips, the honest truth is that even if it's passed, it might have a very, very modest effect on our RBC ratio. But I think if you took the midpoint of the range, which is 4%, it's -- I think Moody's put out a piece, which estimated the impact on us would be like 25 RBC points, I actually think we're obviously very close to what goes on in the NAIC.

We ended up 2009 with a 432% consolidated RBC ratio. That's the highest RBC ratio the company's ever had, frankly, by quite a ways. And on top of that, we had $3.8 billion of cash. And so fast-forward a quarter, while we had very good statutory earnings, on a stat basis, our realized investment gain and the cash position of the holding company hasn't changed. So in many ways, I think our capital position frankly is the strongest it's ever been. And I don't think the risk profile of this company has changed one whit frankly. So certainly, we feel like we're properly capitalized and we have a very nice capital cushion currently. Now the rating agencies obviously are concerned about the industry and about asset problems in certain categories, especially the real estate business, commercial mortgages. I think we spent a lot of air time discussing the high quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio, about how differentiated it really is. And that's not just us talking. Remember the federal government stress test of a year ago, right about this time? The 19 large financial institutions in this country, we were the only insurance company in that group. Our performance or our result of their stress test in our Commercial Mortgage portfolio is we had the highest performing portfolio and it wasn't really close. So we feel we're in very good shape. But I think that we're at a point in time, as I think of the economic cycle where it's gone through a crisis, we've gone through the fire. A lot of people are very nervous. I think as the months tick by, I think -- and our results are good and market environment is getting better, I think people will feel better. So I don't know. The answer is that we should be stockpiling more capital. But we'll continue to monitor it. And we'll obviously continue to have discussions with the rating agencies to make sure that they -- we'd like to persuade them of our position. So that's my general feeling of our capital. With regard to financing for ALICO, I think we've said this before. We do need to raise some external capital. We've said when we announced this transaction, we expected to raise $2 billion of common. And that we expected to do that publicly or privately, and if we did it publicly, we'd be in a position to do it some time this summer. None of that has changed. And the only thing that has changed is I think when we made that announcement, the stock was at $38. And I think it closed yesterday at $45 unchanged. So obviously we know how to sell quite as many shares. We'll probably would have to sell quite as many shares as we originally modeled. So that's sort of where we stand."

Because S&P, though I don't they put out quite the same sort of piece, is I think messaging the same thing. They feel in a stress scenario that the losses in the Commercial Mortgage sector could be significantly larger and therefore, people need to hold even more capital to deal with a stress scenario. And this is sort of about an economic capital third sigma event or fourth sigma event or whatever you want to call it, a tail event. It's interesting. We obviously build our own economic capital models, and I think have done a lot of really good work. And one thing we've sort of learned is tail events are very, very hard. And as the world has also learned over the last two years, tail events are very hard to predict. And how much capital or what losses are likely to be in a tail event are difficult, and it's really more art than science. And this is maybe, if you want to think about it, sort of the dispute we're sort of having with the rating agencies right now, is sort of what capital is really appropriate for a tail event. And I don't know if there's any obvious answer to that. But I guess I'd sort of think of a couple of things. One, I don't think there's any doubt that the quality of our Commercial Mortgage portfolio is at one end of the spectrum both in this industry and just generally for that asset class. So you know it is high quality. The way that portfolio was built over many years was not in an effort to change yield. It was an effort to diversify against corporate credit risk. And I think anybody who's looked at those properties or understands the mortgage portfolio would readily agrees with us. It's very high quality, and the statistics we give kind of back that up. So what may happen for the industry, I don't think, is necessarily indicative of what may happen to us. And then I think it becomes kind of a theoretical debate about what capital levels should be to deal with a stress test environment. And that's sort of an interesting risk policy kind of decision. I think we're in a very good spot in terms of how we'd look at it. And so in that sort light, we're holding the capital we are today. So I know I'm kind of long-winded here, but you're right. It really isn't just necessarily about what is the immediate RBC impact. It really has more to do with what theoretically should be the ultimate level of capital held against that asset class."

For MetLife overall, we have said we have a bright line that we need to be above 350%. And I think that means 350% plus a cushion, and I think the debate is therefore about the size of the cushion.

So 350 plus is what makes sense. 400, I would not expect that need to actually manage ALICO to an RBC of 400. But it's 350 plus a cushion, which might get you close to 400. So clearly, the capital requirements in most of these foreign operations, they are not as tough as they are in the U.S. for instance or what we really think is required in the U.S. So if anything, the bias is the other direction."

The first quarter sales were relatively strong compared to our expectation. As I mentioned in a response to an earlier question, we took some pretty aggressive pricing actions in both visibility and dental. And as a result of that, we expected sales to be down in the first quarter of 2010 relative to 2009, and that actually occurred. And you see that, I think, reflected in the top line in the Nonmedical Health segment but pretty much in line with what we expected. From a life insurance perspective, pricing has continued to be very aggressive in the Group Life segment particularly at the upper end of the market. We saw that very evidently in the first quarter of this year. We have, as we've talked about all along, been very disciplined about our pricing. Really over the last couple of years, that has had some impact on our sales results or our sales results in Group Life. Although in line with our expectations for '11, we're down relative to 2009. But I think the real testament to the way that we run our business is in the mortality ratio. And we had one of the strongest mortality ratios that we've had in the Group Life in the first quarter, which is typically not a great quarter for us. So we really feel like the strategy that we've deployed over the last few years in terms of running that business is the right one. And we think that that's showing up in our results for this quarter particularly as it relates to the mortality ratio."

Given a macro environment, both crediting rates and yields should be going in the same direction, and then you manage to kind of a steady spread. But of course what's happening here is the macro environment didn't change much in the first quarter, and interest rates are still very low. And so as liabilities get repriced, if you will, the crediting rates get adjusted slowly for the whole book because sometimes crediting rates don't change for as much as a year. That means that in a low environment, you're still going to see crediting rates tick down. For us, the reason yields have gone up isn't really because the interest rate environment is better. It really is because we're putting more money to work. Cash balances dropped this quarter, and we're also just getting better investment performance out of our alternative asset classes or through variable investment income. But by the way, I would just say that in general, spreads widen but they're only getting back to normal. And if you'd compare them to our guidance that we gave this year, I think they're a little better than guidance in many cases but really only back to normal."

During the first quarter,  MetLife generated $8.8 billion in premiums and fees and other revenues. That's up 12% over the prior-year period. We grew operating earnings to $834 million, that's up significantly from a year ago, and it's up nearly 5% sequentially.
Book values per share improved noticeably in the quarter as well. Book value, including AOCI [accumulated other comprehensive income], is up 9% sequentially, and book value, excluding AOCI, is up over 2%. The growth we're seeing in the bottom line demonstrates the discipline we have maintained in our underwriting, pricing, risk management and expense control.
We're also benefiting from the more favorable equity markets as they continue to recover. And as you know, MetLife emerged from the economic crisis financially strong, which positions us very well for the solid first quarter performance you will hear about today. 
Before we do that, let me take a moment to comment on our recent agreement to acquire ALICO. As I said before, we expect that the acquisition of this highly complementary business will be rewarding to our shareholders and will accelerate our growth strategy. While we can't comment on ALICO's first quarter financial results, let me highlight some integration progress to date. 
There are 30 regional and functional teams comprised of both MetLife and ALICO associates dedicated to the integration, and we have deployed a rigorous management plan to ensure a seamless transition. In the first few weeks after the announcement, our team visited each of ALICO's major locations and met with many employees and approximately 200 senior leaders. We also are designing the optimal enterprise operating model which will fuel the growth of our combined businesses. Having said that, let me be clear that although the integration is a high priority, we will not be distracted from achieving our 2010 plan, and we know the same is true at ALICO. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business in order to drive growth and shareholder value.
Now turning to some highlights from our businesses. In U.S. Business, premiums, fees and other revenues increased to $7.4 billion, up 11% over the prior year. This strong result reflects top line growth in Corporate Benefit Funding, which more than doubled; Retirement Products, which also increased dramatically; and Insurance Products. Operating earnings were strong across all of U.S. Business, and at $757 million, represents a substantial increase from the $178 million one year ago.
In our Insurance Products segment, growth in premiums, fees and other revenues was driven primarily by a 6% increase in Group Life premiums over the first quarter of 2009. Non-Medical Health revenues were flat. Dental revenues increased, but was partially offset by a decline in disability. Individual Life premiums, fees and other revenues were also flat over the prior year. However, sales grew 15%, driven by increases in Whole, Term and Universal Life products. And operating earnings nearly doubled over the prior-year period, with 92% growth from higher investment income, solid group life underwriting and lower expenses.
In Retirement Products, better equity market performance and thus, higher fee income, contributed to strong top line growth of 27%. Fixed annuity sales of almost $360 million are lower than last year's record levels due to the high demand for MetLife fixed annuities at the onset of the financial crisis. Variable annuity sales of over $4 billion are up 9% sequentially and 8% over the prior year. Net flows remain strong, lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product is contributing to our increased market share. Operating earnings in Retirement Products were strong at $159 million.
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues increased 112% over the first quarter of 2009, driven by higher pension closeout activity, primarily in the U.K. Structured settlement premiums also continue to drive the excellent top line growth in Corporate Benefit Funding. Earnings for this segment were up significantly from the prior year. 
Finally, within U.S. Business, Auto & Home's results were solid. Top line growth was consistent with expectations, and earnings were steady at $72 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was very good at 88.8%. 
MetLife Bank delivered another good quarter. The bank generated revenues of $299 million, down from the unusually high levels in the prior period and consistent with overall market activity. Operating earnings remained healthy at $53 million.
Turning to our International business, we achieved another very strong quarter, with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 27% over the prior year, and operating earnings grew 15%. In Latin America, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to top line growth of 28%. The Asia Pacific region grew 24% due to higher sales, primarily in Hong Kong. In our Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 30%, driven by continued growth in India and strong sales in Europe. 
We continue to experience excellent top and bottom line growth internationally, which is part of the reason why I'm so excited about ALICO. We can build upon this and leverage the complementary strength of both companies to accelerate our growth even further.
Steve will talk to you about our investments in a moment. I'd like to say, though, that I'm very pleased with the overall performance of the portfolio, which has returned to a net unrealized gain position. We also had a small net realized gain for the quarter, which included impairments of $97 million after tax. So our run rate of credit losses is significantly below our projection of $1 billion for 2010. 
Finally, this month, MetLife celebrated its 10th anniversary as a publicly traded company. In those 10 years, we have become stronger and have significantly accelerated our growth, demonstrated by our consistent delivery of shareholder value. With all that has been accomplished and with what is on the horizon, I feel very optimistic about the future. While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, I believe we have the strategy, leadership and momentum to position MetLife as one of the leading insurance companies in the world. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Kandarian."

I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. Overall, we continue to see improvement in the markets, with rising variable income and lower losses. 
First, let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the first quarter was $314 million, which is $114 million above the top of the plan range that I gave at Investor Day. This was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns. While we expect returns to be below this level during the remainder of the year, we believe variable income should remain strong. 
Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses continue to decline and were $211 million, while gross realized gains were $400 million. Write-downs also declined and were $149 million. And excluding derivatives, we had a net realized investment gain of $40 million this quarter.
Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $8.5 billion at March 31, down from $10.8 billion at December 31, and the spreads declined across most sectors. Overall, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $1.5 billion at quarter end.
Next, I'd like to briefly touch upon our commercial mortgage holdings. During the first quarter, delinquent loans increased from $8 million to $162 million. This increase resulted from three loans, one of which is expected to be paid off during the second quarter, with a loss of no more than $2 million; the second has been restructured; and the third is a high-quality property that we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As such, we expect limited losses as the recoveries on these loans are projected to be significantly above the historical average of 75%.
As I noted on the last call, we anticipated that delinquencies might increase in 2010, but would be manageable, particularly given our commercial mortgage evaluation allowance of $624 million. We believe that commercial real estate valuations have bottomed out, with an average peak to trough decline of about 40%. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio increased slightly in the first quarter to 69% based on a rolling four-quarter valuation process, or we estimate to the low to mid 70% range if all properties were revalued today. 
Importantly, only 2% of our portfolio has a loan-to-value of greater than 80%, and a debt service coverage ratio of less than 1x.  Furthermore, we have seen a pickup in office leasing activities compared to last year, and hotel occupancies are also starting to improve.  In summary, we remain confident that our commercial mortgage portfolio will outperform the overall market and that loss levels will likely remain low.
Finally, given the recent headlines, I would like to make a brief comment on MetLife's exposure to Europe's perimeter region. As I mentioned in March when we announced our pending ALICO transaction, MetLife's general account has less than $40 million of total sovereign debt exposure to Italy, Ireland, Spain and Greece combined, and we have no exposure to Portugal. These are countries in which we do very little business. ALICO holds approximately $1.3 billion in Greek sovereign debt, and the Greek bank holdings are de minimis. Remember, when a transaction closes, these assets will transfer at market value to our GAAP financials. And on a statutory basis, ALICO must be delivered with a 400% RBC ratio. While we are closely monitoring the impact of any country's specific situation, we continue to believe that ALICO's portfolio is of relatively high quality, with manageable loss expectations. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $1.01 of operating earnings per share for the first quarter. As Rob mentioned, the strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher investment income, improved equity markets and the results of our expense management efforts. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $8.8 billion in the first quarter, are up 12% from the first quarter of last year, and 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.4 billion reflect an 11% increase over the prior year. This includes a 27% increase in Retirement Products revenue due to increases in fees from positive net flows and higher separate account investment returns. Also, revenue growth in Corporate Benefit Funding is up over 100% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong structured settlement and U.K. closeout sales. As we have noted before, closeout sales do fluctuate and cannot be expected to recur at the same level each quarter.
International's revenues are up 27% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis over the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in all three regions.
Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were mixed this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89.5% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is an excellent result. And our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 87.6%, which is slightly below our plan. At 91.2% for the quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio is up from 87.4% in the prior-year quarter. While we continue to see signs of stabilization in Dental utilization, we did experience higher claims activity. Disability margins are also weaker due to higher incidence and lower claim recoveries.
Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 94.1% for the first quarter, which is up over the prior year's quarter results of 92.4%. That's due to higher catastrophes and less prior-year reserve releases. This combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.8% in the first quarter versus 88.1% in the prior-year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $5 million after tax was taken in this quarter compared to a $17 million after-tax release in the prior-year period.
Moving to investment spreads. We saw an improvement in investment spreads this quarter, with an improvement in the market and variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $71 million or $0.09 per share above the top of the 2010 quarterly guidance range given at Investor Day. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity and hedge fund returns.
Moving to expenses. Our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Additionally, pension costs have stabilized and are no longer causing a significant impact year-over-year. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 21.7%, a solid result and below the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22.5% given at Investor Day. This quarter, we did incur a $20 million after-tax or $0.02 per share in operational excellence charges and certain other one-time items.
Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $834 million in operating earnings or $1.01 per share. Included in our first quarter results is a one-time tax charge of $75 million or $0.09 per share related to the tax law change from Medicare Part D subsidy embedded in the recently enacted healthcare reform legislation, as well as a $13 million or $0.02 per share impact due to the expiration of certain business tax incentives for controlled foreign corporations.
With regard to investment gains and losses, in the first quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment gains of $2 million, which included derivative losses of $19 million after tax. MetLife used this derivative to hedge a number of risks. Changes in the value of these derivatives are, in general, offset on an economic basis across various assets and liabilities. Impairments were $97 million after tax in the first quarter, which is a 50% decline from the fourth quarter of 2009. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first quarter of 2010 are approximately $580 million, and our preliminary statutory net income is $660 million. Finally, cash and liquid assets of the holding company at quarter end were $3.8 billion.
In summary, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our revenue growth is strong, our investment performance has improved and our earnings continue to grow. 
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So they're going to have some cushion. And so if there are investment losses between now and when we close -- by the way, our expectation is we're six months away from closing -- if there are going to be investment losses, they have some cushion to probably solve that problem.

I'll be a little more philosophical about this than you might want, but it'd be hard to be more specific. I mean, everybody recognizes, and I mean everyone, that closing regulatory gaps to avoid future crisis is an objective. If we had all started out with a blank sheet of paper and said, let's identify the challenges and the objectives, and from that, we'll glean language and that language will be efficient, elegant and clear relative to reform, one would have envisioned a racehorse, something very elegant. In fact, we knew that, that was not possible a long time ago. So you've got realistically, given the charged political climate and so forth, people have been working on constructing a camel now for some time. And if you know anything about camels, you can construct one and it might look a little funny and it may not be particularly elegant, but it gets you there. So we, in the industry, are working to make sure that the camel gets us where we want to go, and it doesn't spit and bite and kick. And so that's sort philosophical answer, and it's a good one relative to where discussions are, because, quite frankly, most everyone in the debate recognizes that the business of insurance needs to be protected from unintended consequences on bank regulations. And we're pretty optimistic that the debate is proceeding pretty nicely actually, despite the turmoil that we see in the press. And we don't think it's going to have too much adverse effect on the insurance industry. So that's a prognostication, but tune in."

We are collateralized in that activity. The idea of a carve out for the insurance companies is probably not going to happen. But the carve out around specific insurance activities and how you measure that, both on the liability and the asset side, most likely will be the result. And so rather than start out totally clean with some exceptions, we'll start out with the other end of the spectrum and then back out the business of insurance that needs to be protected. So that's kind of the flavor of what's going on at present."

Secondly, on disability losses or non-medical loss ratio, your disability losses seem like they're picking up, not a lot, but they are picking up as the economy's gotten worse. And that's a little different than what the results have been for some of the other disability companies which have shown relatively stable margins. So if you can just give some detail on whether it's incidence rates picking up or the recovery is not being that great. And finally, just a numbers question, the third question's on ALICO before, what was the RBC of ALICO when the deal was announced? So we could get an idea on how much they could absorb in terms of losses before having to put in more capital."

We've been seeing the Disability loss ratio tick up really for a good part of 2009. It's actually down a little bit over where it was in the fourth quarter. It's driven by a few things. The primary thing that's driving the loss ratio is recoveries and getting people back to work. Our level of recoveries is significantly below where we would expect it to be, and that's having a big impact on the loss ratio. Incidence is up a little bit, but it's not up a lot. And so we had anticipated that we were going to see this as the economy started to soften. We've been raising prices on the Disability business. That's one of the reasons why Non-Medical Health revenue was a little bit depressed because our Disability sales have been below what we would have expected if we hadn't been taking the price increases. So it's something that we've been watching for a while. We continue to manage it aggressively, and we think that the numbers will start to improve as the unemployment rate begins to come down."

And so fast-forward a quarter, while we had very good statutory earnings, on a stat basis, our realized investment gain and the cash position of the holding company hasn't changed. So in many ways, I think our capital position frankly is the strongest it's ever been. And I don't think the risk profile of this company has changed one whit frankly. So certainly, we feel like we're properly capitalized and we have a very nice capital cushion currently. Now the rating agencies obviously are concerned about the industry and about asset problems in certain categories, especially the real estate business, commercial mortgages. I think we spent a lot of air time discussing the high quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio, about how differentiated it really is. And that's not just us talking. Remember the federal government stress test of a year ago, right about this time? The 19 large financial institutions in this country, we were the only insurance company in that group. Our performance or our result of their stress test in our Commercial Mortgage portfolio is we had the highest performing portfolio and it wasn't really close. So we feel we're in very good shape. But I think that we're at a point in time, as I think of the economic cycle where it's gone through a crisis, we've gone through the fire. A lot of people are very nervous. I think as the months tick by, I think -- and our results are good and market environment is getting better, I think people will feel better. So I don't know. The answer is that we should be stockpiling more capital. But we'll continue to monitor it. And we'll obviously continue to have discussions with the rating agencies to make sure that they -- we'd like to persuade them of our position. So that's my general feeling of our capital. With regard to financing for ALICO, I think we've said this before. We do need to raise some external capital. We've said when we announced this transaction, we expected to raise $2 billion of common. And that we expected to do that publicly or privately, and if we did it publicly, we'd be in a position to do it some time this summer. None of that has changed. And the only thing that has changed is I think when we made that announcement, the stock was at $38. And I think it closed yesterday at $45 unchanged. So obviously we know how to sell quite as many shares. We'll probably would have to sell quite as many shares as we originally modeled. So that's sort of where we stand."

The market is starting to open up a little bit. I think as equity markets have recovered and funding status of pension plans has improved. There are more deals to be done. I would say some of the deals that are currently close to being resolved are on the smaller end in terms of size. Having said that, there are some bigger deals. And there are conversations that have been taking place over a number of months with some larger plan sponsors about potential closeout activity there. So we'll see how that ultimately develops."

And so everyone is working very hard relative to making sure that the tax increases. at least are consistent with what the overall focus is. For example, driven by both the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department at the moment, there's quite a bit of focus on the need for securing more retirement income. And that's work being done by DOL and the Treasury, not driven by the life industry. So one might presume that it would be counter to exactly what the focus is to turn around and focus on taxes out of annuities. But who knows? And that's across almost any kind of the business activity in the United States. Everybody's hunkering down in terms of making sure there are not unintended consequences about revenue gathering. So I wish I could be more specific. But obviously, again, both we as a company and we as a leader in the industry are very involved in these dialogues."

They sort of said well, the proposed NAIC change is probably consistent with our base case in terms of losses that we expect over the next three years for the industry. But they said the fact that this -- this doesn't really change our view because obviously we already had a view about investor losses. They did say though that in a stress scenario, the losses could be significantly larger. And I think that's kind of a point. Because S&P, though I don't they put out quite the same sort of piece, is I think messaging the same thing. They feel in a stress scenario that the losses in the Commercial Mortgage sector could be significantly larger and therefore, people need to hold even more capital to deal with a stress scenario. And this is sort of about an economic capital third sigma event or fourth sigma event or whatever you want to call it, a tail event. It's interesting. We obviously build our own economic capital models, and I think have done a lot of really good work. And one thing we've sort of learned is tail events are very, very hard. And as the world has also learned over the last two years, tail events are very hard to predict. And how much capital or what losses are likely to be in a tail event are difficult, and it's really more art than science. And this is maybe, if you want to think about it, sort of the dispute we're sort of having with the rating agencies right now, is sort of what capital is really appropriate for a tail event. And I don't know if there's any obvious answer to that. But I guess I'd sort of think of a couple of things. One, I don't think there's any doubt that the quality of our Commercial Mortgage portfolio is at one end of the spectrum both in this industry and just generally for that asset class. So you know it is high quality. The way that portfolio was built over many years was not in an effort to change yield. It was an effort to diversify against corporate credit risk. And I think anybody who's looked at those properties or understands the mortgage portfolio would readily agrees with us. It's very high quality, and the statistics we give kind of back that up. So what may happen for the industry, I don't think, is necessarily indicative of what may happen to us. And then I think it becomes kind of a theoretical debate about what capital levels should be to deal with a stress test environment. And that's sort of an interesting risk policy kind of decision. I think we're in a very good spot in terms of how we'd look at it. And so in that sort light, we're holding the capital we are today. So I know I'm kind of long-winded here, but you're right. It really isn't just necessarily about what is the immediate RBC impact. It really has more to do with what theoretically should be the ultimate level of capital held against that asset class."

The first quarter sales were relatively strong compared to our expectation. As I mentioned in a response to an earlier question, we took some pretty aggressive pricing actions in both visibility and dental. And as a result of that, we expected sales to be down in the first quarter of 2010 relative to 2009, and that actually occurred. And you see that, I think, reflected in the top line in the Nonmedical Health segment but pretty much in line with what we expected. From a life insurance perspective, pricing has continued to be very aggressive in the Group Life segment particularly at the upper end of the market. We saw that very evidently in the first quarter of this year. We have, as we've talked about all along, been very disciplined about our pricing. Really over the last couple of years, that has had some impact on our sales results or our sales results in Group Life. Although in line with our expectations for '11, we're down relative to 2009. But I think the real testament to the way that we run our business is in the mortality ratio. And we had one of the strongest mortality ratios that we've had in the Group Life in the first quarter, which is typically not a great quarter for us. So we really feel like the strategy that we've deployed over the last few years in terms of running that business is the right one.

Given a macro environment, both crediting rates and yields should be going in the same direction, and then you manage to kind of a steady spread. But of course what's happening here is the macro environment didn't change much in the first quarter, and interest rates are still very low. And so as liabilities get repriced, if you will, the crediting rates get adjusted slowly for the whole book because sometimes crediting rates don't change for as much as a year. That means that in a low environment, you're still going to see crediting rates tick down. For us, the reason yields have gone up isn't really because the interest rate environment is better. It really is because we're putting more money to work. Cash balances dropped this quarter, and we're also just getting better investment performance out of our alternative asset classes or through variable investment income.

For the second quarter of 2010, MetLife has again delivered strong results across the board. Remember last December at Investor Day, we highlighted our commitment to discipline growth, margin improvement and ROE expansion. Well, we delivered on that commitment in the first quarter, and I believe we have done so yet again in the second. Our premiums, fees and other revenues increased 4% over the second quarter of 2009. Operating earnings grew to over $1 billion, up considerably from both the year-ago period and sequentially. I'm also pleased to report that book value increased tremendously, up 48% over the year-ago period and 10% sequentially, driven not only by our Investment performance but also our strong operating earnings. At the same time, our ROE continued to improve and we achieved excellent underwriting results. And importantly, we remain committed to expense discipline and risk management.
Let me share a few highlights, beginning with the U.S. Business results. U.S. Business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.2 billion, up 2% over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter, the top line grew by over 6%. Operating earnings grew by 39%, with significant increases in each of the major business segments, largely driven by strong underwriting results. 
Within the Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 2% over the second quarter of 2009, and operating earnings grew 29%. Group Life premiums grew 4% and operating earnings were up 56% compared with the prior-year period.
Group underwriting results were excellent, with the Group Life mortality ratio at 86.6%. Non-Medical Health revenues were up slightly, reflecting higher Dental revenue, partially offset by lower Disability revenue. Non-Medical Health earnings were up over 40%, with improved interest and underwriting margins driven by strong improvement in Dental. Group Disability incidents remains elevated but consistent with plan, while recoveries are showing signs of improvement. Individual Life premiums, fees and others revenues increased modestly. And we had a 6% increase in operating earnings, again reflecting disciplined underwriting and expense management.
In Retirement Products, the top line grew by 34%, driven by sales and higher fee income, and operating earnings were higher at $238 million. Variable Annuity sales of $4.5 billion were up 11% sequentially and consistent with last year's very high level. Net flows remain strong. Lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product continues to contribute to our strong results.
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues were down, driven by less pension closeout activity, which I mentioned earlier, although structured settlement premiums grew by 9%. Operating earnings grew to $238 million, up 54% from the prior year, due primarily to higher variable Investment income. Rounding out the Domestic businesses, Auto & Home had another very solid quarter, as did MetLife Bank.
Now turning to our International business. We achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 21% over the year-ago period. Operating earnings declined by 8%. Strong earnings in Latin America, driven by business growth and expense management, were offset by lower earnings in Japan due to the challenging equity markets. In Latin America, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 23%. The Asia Pacific region grew 20%, due primarily to higher sales in South Korea and Hong Kong. And in Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 13%, reflecting continued growth in Europe and India.
In a moment, Steve will comment on our Investment results, but I can't help but highlight one component of the portfolio. We continue to experience a low level of Investment losses, including impairments. This is partly due to the continuing strong performance of our Real Estate portfolio, where you should note that loan-to-value values actually decreased during the quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down, and the percentage of delinquent loans also declined. I think you would agree these are all positive trends.
Switching gears. Obviously, the ALICO transaction is attractive to us because of our focus on generating strong consistent earnings growth, expanding ROE and increasing shareholder value. Together, MetLife and ALICO teams are working diligently and have achieved several significant integration planning milestones. So we remain on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
As we told you when we announced the deal, we continue to be impressed by ALICO's people and how well the franchise has been performing. While we cannot comment on ALICO's second quarter financial results, we are pleased with their first quarter performance. And together, we are working on defining how we will further accelerate our growth strategy.
Our Operational Excellence initiative remains on track to deliver the $600 million of annualized expense savings we promised. And it has now been one year since the formation of the U.S. Business organization. The team identified several opportunities to take that business to the next level. Over the past year, we've reaped the benefits of combined sales forces with increased cross-selling opportunities. Secondly, U.S. Business is developing -- deploying Investment dollars across the business in a more efficient way to capitalize on market opportunities. And thirdly, we've identified synergies, giving us the opportunity to reduce overall operating costs. So we're certainly seeing big benefits already from combining the businesses. 
In closing, this is a momentous time for MetLife, one that will propel us into the next phase of our long and successful history. As I reflect on the first half of the year, I'm very pleased with our performance. We've been enjoying strong momentum and looking ahead, we are very enthusiastic about our future as a global company. 
With that, let me turn it over to Steve Kandarian."

First, let me start with a comment on variable Investment income. Pretax variable Investment income for the second quarter was $296 million, which is $96 million above the top of the plan range that I provided on Investor Day. This is primarily driven by strong private equity returns. While we expect variable Investment income to trend lower for the remainder of the year, we believe it’ll still perform within our quarterly range.
Now let me cover Investment gains and losses for the quarter. Gross Investment losses were $253 million. Gross Investment gains were $396 million, and write-downs were $172 million, for a net Investment loss, excluding derivatives, of $29 million. Results were largely in line with the previous quarter. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $7 billion, down from the $10.8 billion at year end. Gross unrealized gains were substantial this quarter at $14.2 billion, as widening spreads were more than offset by declining interest rates. Overall, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $7.3 billion at quarter end.
Next, let me expand upon Rob's comments regarding our Commercial Mortgage portfolio. The loan-to-value of our portfolio improved slightly to 68%, down from 69% last quarter, as valuations have stabilized. Our Commercial Mortgage valuation allowance declined modestly to $621 million. Total delinquent commercial mortgages decreased from $162 million to $137 million. The decrease in delinquencies was driven by the restructuring of one loan, resulting in a $5 million loss. As to the remaining two delinquent loans in the U.S. portfolio, one is expected to be paid off during the third quarter with no loss, and the other is a high-quality property that we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As I have mentioned previously, we expect limited losses on these loans, as our recoveries are projected to be above the historical average of 75%. Although some challenges remain, we believe the commercial real estate market is slowly improving and that our portfolio will continue to maintain low loss levels and outperform the overall market. 
Finally, let me comment on our cash position, which increased from $17.2 billion last quarter to $20.4 billion this quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to higher cash collateral balances we see from our derivative counterparties. As interest rates and equity markets decline, the value of our derivative positions increased, and we took an additional cash collateral. Excluding the impact of cash collateral from our derivative counterparties, our cash position is down $4.1 billion since Investor Day, as we reinvested into higher-yielding assets.
In summary, we continue to see solid results in our portfolio, with a variable income above plan, continued low losses and an improving commercial real estate market. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $1.23 of operating earnings per share for the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, this strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher Investment income, strong underwriting results and the impact of our expense management efforts. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $8.7 billion in the second quarter, were up 4% from the second quarter of last year and up 6% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.2 billion reflect a 2% increase over the prior-year quarter. This includes a 2% increase in Insurance Products revenues, largely driven by an increase in Group Life. Group Life premiums are up 4% from the prior-year quarter, consistent with our Investor Day guidance. Growth was helped in the segment by a change in financial terms and a large retrospectively rated contract, which resulted in less reinsurance ceded [ph] (18:17) in that particular contract. This change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 and was anticipated in the guidance we provided at Investor Day. 
Also, revenue in Retirement Products increased by 34% due to income annuity premium growth, as well as higher separate account fees due to positive net flows and favorable separate account Investment returns in prior quarters. Also revenue in Corporate Benefit Funding was down 17% from the prior-year quarter, driven by lower closeout premiums. Structured settlement premiums remained strong.
International’s revenues were up 21% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant-currency basis over the prior-year quarter driven by growth in Mexico, Korea and Chile.
Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins, let's talk about underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were quite strong this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.6% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is an excellent result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 80.4%. While higher than the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter of 74.9%, the results were quite favorable and well below our plan.
At 87.8% for the second quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio was down from the prior-year and sequential quarters of 88.4% and 91.2% respectively. This favorable result was due largely to improved Dental underwriting results, in which we continue to see more stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue to be below plan, as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations. However, we are seeing some early signs of improvement in recoveries. 
Turning to our Auto & Home business. The combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 95.3% for the second quarter, which was up over the prior-year quarter's result of 93.5% due to higher catastrophes. The combined ratio excluding caps was 85½% in the second quarter versus 88% in the prior-year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $12 million after tax was taken in the current quarter, compared to our $3 million number in the year-ago period.
Moving to Investment spreads. We saw continued strong Investment spreads this quarter, driven in part by variable Investment income results. For the quarter, variable Investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $62 million or $0.07 per share above the top end of the quarterly guidance range given at Investor Day. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity returns.
Moving to the expenses. Our Operational Excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 22.4%, a solid result, and within the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22½% given at Investor Day.
Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $1 billion in operating income or $1.23 per share. Included in our second quarter results was a favorable market impact of $43 million or $0.05 per share, as gains from our hedge program more than offset the impact of lower equity markets and interest rates in both the U.S. and International Businesses. 
With regard to Investment gains and losses, in the second quarter, we had after-tax net realized Investment gains of $767 million, which included derivative gains of $878 million after tax. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread, which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities, can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company. In this quarter, we refined our estimate of expected recovery rates for our insurance subsidiaries within the measurement of own credit as of June 30. This refinement resulted in an after-tax realized Investment loss of $621 million during the quarter.
Impairments were $112 million after tax in the second quarter, modestly higher than the first quarter of 2010. Our preliminary statutory earnings for the second quarter of 2010 are approximately $220 million, and our preliminary statutory net income is $250 million. Statutory operating earnings were significantly impacted by lower equity markets and interest rates in the quarter and do not reflect the benefit of gains from our hedging program. However, statutory total adjusted capital, which is the numerator in our RBC calculation, increased by $1.1 billion.
Turning to our holding company. Cash and liquid assets of the holding company at quarter end were $3.7 billion. 
In summary, MetLife had a very strong second quarter. Our revenue growth was solid. Our Investment performance continued to improve. Our operating margins remain strong, driven by disciplined underwriting and expense management. And our earnings continue to grow. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions."

I always hesitate to say whether $1.11 is a good run rate or not because -- but I'll give you some sense of kind of the pluses and minuses. You're right; underwriting was very strong. And so I think a lot of that is sustainable. Some of it was probably just good fortune. But I also think, by the way, that like the improvements in Dental underwriting margins are very sustainable. In fact, they might get better from here. And the other interesting fact is Disability underwriting margins were roughly flat on a sequential-quarter basis. But there's potential for a lot of improvement there as early -- maybe in the third quarter, maybe not. But the guys who are very close to that business are encouraged by some of the signs they saw in the second quarter. So certainly, there are headwinds or there are things which might not be repeatable in the second quarter results, but there are further opportunities. I would also -- just a couple of other things to keep in mind is I think the expense picture only gets better as Operational Excellence continues to execute. Though probably the drop in equity markets at the end of the second quarter is probably a modest negative, as we think about third quarter fees in the Retirement business. And then finally, I think the low-interest rate environment that we're in, though I don't think it would be a very large impact in terms of our operating EPS, it will probably slice a little bit off of Investment margin in the future quarters. But I think it’ll be very modest. So that's sort of the color on what's sustainable and what might be in the future, and I’d kind of come away from that little dialogue as that kind of $1.11 current run rate is a number that I think you can think about as a reasonable projection going forward. Could it be a little lower? Sure, but not materially."

I just don't think that's a good practice because -- you’ll probably appreciate, the actual RBC projection is a very involved calculation. We don't perform it quarterly. We do estimate our RBC every quarter, so it just strikes me that until you do the real math, you shouldn't put out a number. I think the way to think about this is total adjusted capital, as I said in my prepared remarks, went up $1.1 billion. That's the numerator in the RBC projection, $1.1 billion. Now the denominator changes because the balance sheet’s a little bigger and things have changed a little bit. But $1.1 billion, you think $50 million to $60 million per RBC point, that sort of implies 15 to 20 RBC points in the numerator just in the second quarter, never mind the first quarter, which was another $1 billion increase. So we're clearly building statutory capital versus our RBC at year-end 2009, which was 432%. So we feel very good about our capital levels, and our cash levels with the holding company haven't changed. So I guess I feel that capital position is in good shape."

So there's no one item that’s sort of jumping out where I can say, “This sector is underperforming on the realized losses.” On impairments, it was more in the area of structured financed assets and there was some in CMBS, some in ABS, and that was the main driver for the impairments."

As it relates to the U.K. closeout business, we have lower U.K. closeout sales out sales this quarter than we had in the first quarter. As we talked about in the past, closeout sales are lumpy. And they do vary from quarter to quarter, so I think you're seeing the effect of that. In addition though, I do think the low-interest rate environment, in particular, is having an impact on the closeout market in both the U.S. and the U.K. I think companies that would be thinking about transferring their pension plans to us are moving more slowly here because of the fact that interest rates are so low. And so I think that will continue to provide a challenge in that business until we see some improvement in the interest rate and the longer-term interest rate environment. So I think that's how we're thinking about the U.K. and the U.S. closeout market. In terms of the Fidelity relationship, you didn't hear the sales number because I didn't say what it was. And because it is a relationship that we have with another company, we don't disclose that publicly. But it has become an important part of the overall sales story.

No, we have not received it. And I would comment just generally. Obviously, we strongly disagree with the misleading and incorrect statements, certainly the initial statements coming from the press. Subsequent to that, of course, those with correct knowledge of the situation, including the National Organization of Life Guaranty Association, the NAIC, the ACLI, we and other insurance companies have provided a lot of well-written clarifications. And I would say that certainly most of you on the call have made very clear that you understand how the accounts function. And I think you’ve provided a real public service, quite frankly, for putting together reports that demonstrate very ably your understanding of these. And I think that as more comes to light, that that's the direction things will go. I mean the beneficiaries have full access to their funds. They are in guaranteed minimum interest rates. They exceed what they could in other money market type accounts. Our account holders tell us they love it. It's consumer friendly, on and on. One of the interesting things, as you probably know, in terms of guarantee funds and whatnot, in the course of business, we actually are prohibited from talking about guarantee funds and whatnot in the insurance industry. I think that has to do with moral hazard issues and so forth, which we certainly wouldn't disagree with. By the way, you may recall back in 2008, during the crisis, they clarified the Guaranty Association coverage, which in this instance goes as if it were any kind of life insurance death benefit. And most states in the U.S., all 50 have coverage. Most are at 300,000. A handful, like New York, are at 500,000. None of them are below 250,000. So now I can say that because I'm just commenting on a comment from the guaranty fund association. They came out with a reaffirmation of that just this week. So I think there's nothing better than having good solid clarifying correct information when it comes to financial products. So that's about all I have to say, but I can't say anything about the Attorney General's office."

And I'm not really sure why we saw the impact on our disability business more quickly. As you know, we've been talking about this issue for some time. Some of it may have to do with the mix of business that we have. We have a book of business that focuses on large companies. It's also got a significant percentage of those being financial services companies. And I think when the economy started to turn down, I think those companies acted more quickly in terms of adjusting their workforces. That may have had some impact on how quickly we saw claims coming into our operation. We also have taken some price increases over the last couple of pricing cycles, and I think that has helped us in terms of our overall results for the quarter. But what I would say just to summarize is that the performance of the quarter in disability was moderately encouraging. And I would say as the economy continues to slowly recover, we think that will begin to see a recovery in our disability business as well."

But it'd be enough to mention but not that significant. I think some people have talked about impairments of DAC or goodwill or things like that, and I wouldn't think that, that's likely in this sort of time frame.

But I would give you sort of a general response. You followed us, and I think most of the analysts listening to this call followed us for a long time. We’ve talked about the low interest rate issues and what we do to protect ourselves. And we've said that from time to time well before obviously the current situation. Because this is part of our risk management, we've often talked about a Japan scenario and how we protect ourselves against that risk. And we buy very long interest-rate floors, sometimes with deferred-start mechanisms to push out -- protect ourselves as long as we can. And we have a pretty good portfolio of those. So as interest rates continue down here, those things obviously come into the money and start paying. But honestly, they're increasing in value as we speak. Or obviously, even in the second quarter, we saw an increase in value of those contracts. So this is something we've thought about for a long time and have, I think, prepared ourselves pretty well for and spent the money, frankly, over the last five years to do. So I think that's being smart about risk management, understanding where your real risks are. So I think we're in relatively good shape here."

And I'm not sure we've completely diagnosed why it came about because I think it is sort of unique. You had a pretty substantial drop in both equity and interest rates right at the end of the quarter. And so for most of the quarter, we were a little un-level, and then we had a pretty big drop near the end or in June. And the way GAAP works and when it reflects those sort of macro events, to put it simply, there are sometimes GAAP sort of smooth results with some things like mean reversion formulas and such. And this is one of those occasions where it ended up being a fairly big smoothing. At the same time, our hedging program, which we use to protect against these sort of events, doesn't smooth anything. And so effectively, we became over-hedged at least on an accounting basis, certainly not on an economic risk basis. I think that we feel hedging worked quite well there. And it was meaningful enough that obviously we felt we really had to call it out in the financials and talk about it because it represented roughly a nickel overall for the company of earnings per share. So now the interesting question is – so that’s sort of what happened.  What happens if we get a reversal? It doesn’t magically go the other way, and there’s been a $0.05 adjustment going the other way.  It doesn't work that simply. I do think that these things do balance out over time because, of course, that's the whole point of mean reversion, it's a smoothing mechanism that will spread out the adjustment over a longer period of time as much as, frankly, five years. So that's how the mean reversion works. So it also has to do with the fact that we are very much in the middle of the mean reversion corridor as opposed to being one end or the other which is good to be in the middle. But I think that, that sort of has a smoothing impact. So you could smooth a little bit the other way. But I think, obviously, if the stock market goes up that we would live with a little smoothing. That's okay. Now, with regard to accounting, I’m going to introduce Pete Carlson who is our Chief Accounting Officer.  I remember what he told me yesterday about what was going on, but rather than me just trying to repeat it, maybe I'll let him speak and talk a little bit about what’s going on with these accounting initiatives."

Suneet, I think you referenced the Insurance Contracts Project that’s a joint project between the International Accounting Board and the U.S. board, the FASB. What’s happened, the International Board actually overnight did release an exposure draft. They had a July 30th goal, and they’ve released their exposure draft for this project. That would apply to people under International financial reporting standards which obviously is not what we currently follow. The U.S. board, because there already are existing standards for insurance contracts, we have much more industry specific guidance here in the U.S. actually is on a little bit slower path and is not expected to release an exposure draft for another month or two and actually may not even do it an exposure draft. So the stage of the discussions are much more preliminary on the U.S. side. That being said, the boards have recently in discussions, reached a general consensus between both boards that acquisition costs actually would be considered in cash flow. So there would be some deferral of acquisition cost. And that's been one of the two key issues we’ve been monitoring as an industry."

The key is not whether or not they're going to do that, it's how they do it and the kind of discount rates they use. There was some discussions that they might consider using a risk-free rate. We think that would be a bad idea. We think that the discount rate should really mimic as closely as possible sort of what’s going on with spreads or the mark-to-market of the assets. So you have them. So ergo, if you're a well-matched company, which we think we are and others that, that would minimize the volatility of marking both sides to the balance sheet together. I think they're a lot more aware of that than they used to be. There's this whole interplay between what goes on in AOCI and the movements there and also net income versus operating income. And I think those sort of distinctions, a lot of I think the mark-to-market AOCI, as opposed to obviously including now liabilities is not going to just flow through a real income statement. But looking at operating income and being able to call that out is just only going to get more important as opposed to sort of the mark-to-market in the balance sheet that goes on every quarter. So I’ll probably confuse newspaper reporters, but I think the analyst community will get it.

First of all, the improvement that we saw in the Non-Medical Health benefits ratio this quarter as Bill mentioned in his comments was primarily driven by Dental. We saw the increase in utilization in Dental claims early in 2009 when we took some steps as part of our 2010 pricing both for new business and renewal pricing to adjust our prices to make sure that they reflected the higher cost of claims. And so I think you're starting to see the impact of those pricing changes working into our financial results. And as a result, the loss ratio in Dental has come down and that is the primary driver of Non-Medical Health benefits loss ratio. And that's one of the reasons why we created the new ratio because the Dental business has grown significantly over the past few years relative to the Disability business. So when you think about comparing the benefit ratio today versus the benefit ratio a few years ago, we have seen a change in the mix of the products that are there with Dental becoming much more significant. And that's one of the reasons why we adjusted that ratio in the first place. We still think that we have some opportunities for us to bring that ratio down as I talked about before.  I think the Disability ratios continue to be high, reflecting the downturn in the economy that we are seeing some improvement there. And we haven’t yet seen the full impact of the Dental pricing changes working through into the benefits ratio. So over time, our expectation is that, that ratio will continue to trend down."

And we’re doing better than our budgets and our plans this year. So we’re very good about that. Of course, what we can't control very well is the denominator which is revenues. And, obviously, what kind of made the ratio go up for this quarter is not because expenses went up; it’s because we had lots of close-out sales which are obviously lumpy. And that smoothes over a year period, but in the short run you can have lumpy quarters like the one we just did. So in terms of real expense control, we put out guidance that we raised our operational excellence guidance to $600 million at Investor Day, 2009, last December. And we're going to exceed that number. I mean it's hard for me to say how much. But as you would hope, a number we put out, we would like to beat. So we're doing very well there. And now, of course, you know that after this year, I think we start shifting our focus onto the ALICO acquisition and taking costs out of there. But I don’t know if we’ll have OpEx 2 necessarily, we're going to continuing to drive expense control around here. I think that's not just holding through ALICO, through the rest of the company.

But it seemed to help people in Washington. Let me just give you a little flavor. I mean as I said all along, the bill passes, and now relative to the insurance companies, the work is far from over which is a good thing, because the bill is full of bank language, full of bank processes and so forth. And so the clarifications then work to differentiate the insurance marketplace. And so it’s literally hundreds of rule-making and regulatory projects that are going on. You have an idea; there are 199 separate rule-making initiatives. There are 68 studies underway. There are 355 issues on which lawmakers have given regulators the authority to issue the regulations even if the regulations are not expressly required. And keep in mind that some of the studies are done by agencies that do not even now currently exist, like the Financial Services Oversight Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of work to be done on the details. And because it is so important to us, other people may think that we would relax a little bit. And this is the time that we really have positioned ourselves, both as a company directly and through the ACLI as a resource to all of these rule-making initiatives and wordings and so forth. And so when it comes to things like – and this covers though Volcker rule, it covers derivatives. It covers things like resolution authority fees, taxes, this and the other. We're all very, very focused and very active here at MetLife in Washington. So that's probably the best way to answer that question because it's very difficult to be more clear than that. But we’re not discouraged. We’re not discouraged. We like this kind of slogging through. That’s kind of what we do very well."

For the second quarter of 2010, MetLife has again delivered strong results across the board. Remember last December at Investor Day, we highlighted our commitment to discipline growth, margin improvement and ROE expansion. Well, we delivered on that commitment in the first quarter, and I believe we have done so yet again in the second. Our premiums, fees and other revenues increased 4% over the second quarter of 2009. Operating earnings grew to over $1 billion, up considerably from both the year-ago period and sequentially. I'm also pleased to report that book value increased tremendously, up 48% over the year-ago period and 10% sequentially, driven not only by our Investment performance but also our strong operating earnings. At the same time, our ROE continued to improve and we achieved excellent underwriting results. And importantly, we remain committed to expense discipline and risk management.
Let me share a few highlights, beginning with the U.S. Business results. U.S. Business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.2 billion, up 2% over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter, the top line grew by over 6%. Operating earnings grew by 39%, with significant increases in each of the major business segments, largely driven by strong underwriting results. 
Within the Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 2% over the second quarter of 2009, and operating earnings grew 29%. Group Life premiums grew 4% and operating earnings were up 56% compared with the prior-year period.
Group underwriting results were excellent, with the Group Life mortality ratio at 86.6%. Non-Medical Health revenues were up slightly, reflecting higher Dental revenue, partially offset by lower Disability revenue. Non-Medical Health earnings were up over 40%, with improved interest and underwriting margins driven by strong improvement in Dental. Group Disability incidents remains elevated but consistent with plan, while recoveries are showing signs of improvement. Individual Life premiums, fees and others revenues increased modestly. And we had a 6% increase in operating earnings, again reflecting disciplined underwriting and expense management.
In Retirement Products, the top line grew by 34%, driven by sales and higher fee income, and operating earnings were higher at $238 million. Variable Annuity sales of $4.5 billion were up 11% sequentially and consistent with last year's very high level. Net flows remain strong. Lapse rates continue to decline and the success of our new Fidelity product continues to contribute to our strong results.
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues were down, driven by less pension closeout activity, which I mentioned earlier, although structured settlement premiums grew by 9%. Operating earnings grew to $238 million, up 54% from the prior year, due primarily to higher variable Investment income. Rounding out the Domestic businesses, Auto & Home had another very solid quarter, as did MetLife Bank.
Now turning to our International business. We achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a reported basis, premiums, fees and other revenues grew 21% over the year-ago period. Operating earnings declined by 8%. Strong earnings in Latin America, driven by business growth and expense management, were offset by lower earnings in Japan due to the challenging equity markets. In Latin America, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 23%. The Asia Pacific region grew 20%, due primarily to higher sales in South Korea and Hong Kong. And in Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 13%, reflecting continued growth in Europe and India.
In a moment, Steve will comment on our Investment results, but I can't help but highlight one component of the portfolio. We continue to experience a low level of Investment losses, including impairments. This is partly due to the continuing strong performance of our Real Estate portfolio, where you should note that loan-to-value values actually decreased during the quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down, and the percentage of delinquent loans also declined. I think you would agree these are all positive trends.
Switching gears. Obviously, the ALICO transaction is attractive to us because of our focus on generating strong consistent earnings growth, expanding ROE and increasing shareholder value. Together, MetLife and ALICO teams are working diligently and have achieved several significant integration planning milestones. So we remain on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
As we told you when we announced the deal, we continue to be impressed by ALICO's people and how well the franchise has been performing. While we cannot comment on ALICO's second quarter financial results, we are pleased with their first quarter performance. And together, we are working on defining how we will further accelerate our growth strategy.
Our Operational Excellence initiative remains on track to deliver the $600 million of annualized expense savings we promised. And it has now been one year since the formation of the U.S. Business organization. The team identified several opportunities to take that business to the next level. Over the past year, we've reaped the benefits of combined sales forces with increased cross-selling opportunities. Secondly, U.S. Business is developing -- deploying Investment dollars across the business in a more efficient way to capitalize on market opportunities. And thirdly, we've identified synergies, giving us the opportunity to reduce overall operating costs. So we're certainly seeing big benefits already from combining the businesses. 
In closing, this is a momentous time for MetLife, one that will propel us into the next phase of our long and successful history. As I reflect on the first half of the year, I'm very pleased with our performance. We've been enjoying strong momentum and looking ahead, we are very enthusiastic about our future as a global company. 
With that, let me turn it over to Steve Kandarian."
185648,108527328,71973,"MetLife, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our Investment results for the quarter. First, let me start with a comment on variable Investment income. Pretax variable Investment income for the second quarter was $296 millio",486,"Thanks, Rob. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our Investment results for the quarter. First, let me start with a comment on variable Investment income. Pretax variable Investment income for the second quarter was $296 million, which is $96 million above the top of the plan range that I provided on Investor Day. This is primarily driven by strong private equity returns. While we expect variable Investment income to trend lower for the remainder of the year, we believe it’ll still perform within our quarterly range.
Now let me cover Investment gains and losses for the quarter. Gross Investment losses were $253 million. Gross Investment gains were $396 million, and write-downs were $172 million, for a net Investment loss, excluding derivatives, of $29 million. Results were largely in line with the previous quarter. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $7 billion, down from the $10.8 billion at year end. Gross unrealized gains were substantial this quarter at $14.2 billion, as widening spreads were more than offset by declining interest rates. Overall, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $7.3 billion at quarter end.
Next, let me expand upon Rob's comments regarding our Commercial Mortgage portfolio. The loan-to-value of our portfolio improved slightly to 68%, down from 69% last quarter, as valuations have stabilized. Our Commercial Mortgage valuation allowance declined modestly to $621 million. Total delinquent commercial mortgages decreased from $162 million to $137 million. The decrease in delinquencies was driven by the restructuring of one loan, resulting in a $5 million loss. As to the remaining two delinquent loans in the U.S. portfolio, one is expected to be paid off during the third quarter with no loss, and the other is a high-quality property that we plan to transfer to our real estate equity portfolio. As I have mentioned previously, we expect limited losses on these loans, as our recoveries are projected to be above the historical average of 75%. Although some challenges remain, we believe the commercial real estate market is slowly improving and that our portfolio will continue to maintain low loss levels and outperform the overall market. 
Finally, let me comment on our cash position, which increased from $17.2 billion last quarter to $20.4 billion this quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to higher cash collateral balances received from our derivative counterparties. As interest rates and equity markets decline, the value of our derivative positions increased, and we took an additional cash collateral. Excluding the impact of cash collateral from our derivative counterparties, our cash position is down $4.1 billion since Investor Day, as we reinvested into higher-yielding assets.
In summary, we continue to see solid results in our portfolio, with variable income above plan, continued low losses and an improving commercial real estate market. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $1.23 of operating earnings per share for the second quarter.

MetLife reported $1.23 of operating earnings per share for the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, this strong bottom line result represents solid business growth, higher Investment income, strong underwriting results and the impact of our expense management efforts. This morning, I will walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with premiums, fees and other revenues. Total premiums, fees and other revenues, which were $8.7 billion in the second quarter, were up 4% from the second quarter of last year and up 6% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.2 billion reflect a 2% increase over the prior-year quarter. This includes a 2% increase in Insurance Products revenues, largely driven by an increase in Group Life. Group Life premiums are up 4% from the prior-year quarter, consistent with our Investor Day guidance. Growth was helped in the segment by a change in financial terms and a large retrospectively rated contract, which resulted in less reinsurance seeded [ph] (18:17) in that particular contract. This change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 and was anticipated in the guidance we provided at Investor Day. 
Also, revenue in Retirement Products increased by 34% due to income annuity premium growth as well as higher separate account fees due to positive net flows and favorable separate account Investment returns in prior quarters. Also revenue in Corporate Benefit Funding was down 17% from the prior-year quarter, driven by lower closeout premiums. Structured settlement premiums remained strong.
International’s revenues were up 21% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant-currency basis over the prior-year quarter driven by growth in Mexico, Korea and Chile.
Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins, let's talk about underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were quite strong this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.6% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is an excellent result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 80.4%. While higher than the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter of 74.9%, the results were quite favorable and well below our plan.
At 87.8% for the second quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio was down from both the prior-year and sequential quarters of 88.4% and 91.2% respectively. This favorable result was due largely to improved Dental underwriting results, in which we continue to see more stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue to be below plan, as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations. However, we are seeing some early signs of improvement in recoveries. 
Turning to our Auto & Home business. The combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 95.3% for the second quarter, which was up over the prior-year quarter's result of 93.5% due to higher catastrophes. The combined ratio excluding caps was 85½% in the second quarter versus 88% in the prior-year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $12 million after tax was taken in the current quarter, compared to our $3 million number in the year-ago period.
Moving to Investment spreads. We saw continued strong Investment spreads this quarter, driven in part by variable Investment income results. For the quarter, variable Investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $62 million or $0.07 per share above the top end of the quarterly guidance range given at Investor Day. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity returns.
Moving to the expenses. Our Operational Excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 22.4%, a solid result, and within the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22½% given at Investor Day.
Turning to our bottom line results. We earned $1 billion in operating income or $1.23 per share. Included in our second quarter results was a favorable market impact of $43 million or $0.05 per share, as gains from our hedge program more than offset the impact of lower equity markets and interest rates in both the U.S. and International Businesses. 
With regard to Investment gains and losses, in the second quarter, we had after-tax net realized Investment gains of $767 million, which included derivative gains of $878 million after tax. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and MetLife's own credit spread, which impacts the valuation of certain insurance liabilities, can generate derivative gains or losses. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company. In this quarter, we refined our estimate of expected recovery rates for our insurance subsidiaries within the measurement of own credit as of June 30. This refinement resulted in an after-tax realized Investment loss of $621 million during the quarter.
Impairments were $112 million after tax in the second quarter, modestly higher than the first quarter of 2010. Our preliminary statutory earnings for the second quarter of 2010 are approximately $220 million, and our preliminary statutory net income is $250 million. Statutory operating earnings were significantly impacted by lower equity markets and interest rates in the quarter and do not reflect the benefit of gains from our hedging program. However, statutory total adjusted capital, which is the numerator in our RBC calculation, increased by $1.1 billion.
Turning to our holding company. Cash and liquid assets of the holding company at quarter end were $3.7 billion. 
In summary, MetLife had a very strong second quarter. Our revenue growth was solid. Our Investment performance continued to improve. Our operating margins remain strong, driven by disciplined underwriting and expense management. And our earnings continue to grow. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions."

I always hesitate to say whether $1.11 is a good run rate or not because -- but I'll give you some sense of kind of the pluses and minuses. You're right; underwriting was very strong. And so I think a lot of that is sustainable. Some of it was probably just good fortune. But I also think, by the way, that like the improvements in Dental underwriting margins are very sustainable. In fact, they might get better from here. And the other interesting fact is Disability underwriting margins were roughly flat on a sequential-quarter basis. But there's potential for a lot of improvement there as early -- maybe in the third quarter, maybe not. But the guys who are very close to that business are encouraged by some of the signs they saw in the second quarter. So certainly, there are headwinds or there are things which might not be repeatable in the second quarter results, but there are further opportunities. I would also -- just a couple of other things to keep in mind is I think the expense picture only gets better as Operational Excellence continues to execute. Though probably the drop in equity markets at the end of the second quarter is probably a modest negative, as we think about third quarter fees in the Retirement business. And then finally, I think the low-interest rate environment that we're in, though I don't think it would be a very large impact in terms of our operating EPS, it will probably slice a little bit off of Investment margin in the future quarters. But I think it’ll be very modest. So that's sort of the color on what's sustainable and what might be in the future, and I’d kind of come away from that little dialogue as that kind of $1.11 current run rate is a number that I think you can think about as a reasonable projection going forward. Could it be a little lower? Sure, but not materially."

I just don't think that's a good practice because -- you’ll probably appreciate, the actual RBC projection is a very involved calculation. We don't perform it quarterly. We do estimate our RBC every quarter, so it just strikes me that until you do the real math, you shouldn't put out a number. I think the way to think about this is total adjusted capital, as I said in my prepared remarks, went up $1.1 billion. That's the numerator in the RBC projection, $1.1 billion. Now the denominator changes because the balance sheet’s a little bigger and things have changed a little bit. But $1.1 billion, you think $50 million to $60 million per RBC point, that sort of implies 15 to 20 RBC points in the numerator just in the second quarter, never mind the first quarter, which was another $1 billion increase. So we're clearly building statutory capital versus our RBC at year-end 2009, which was 432%. So we feel good about our capital levels, and our cash levels with the holding company haven't changed. So I guess I feel that capital position is in good shape."

So there's no one item that’s sort of jumping out where I can say, “This sector is underperforming on the realized losses.” On impairments, it was more in the area of structured financed assets and there was some in CMBS, some in ABS, and that was the main driver for the impairments."

And they do vary from quarter to quarter, so I think you're seeing the effect of that. In addition though, I do think the low-interest rate environment, in particular, is having an impact on the closeout market in both the U.S. and the U.K. I think companies that would be thinking about transferring their pension plans to us are moving more slowly here because of the fact that interest rates are so low. And so I think that will continue to provide a challenge in that business until we see some improvement in the interest rate and the longer-term interest rate environment. So I think that's how we're thinking about the U.K. and the U.S. closeout market. In terms of the Fidelity relationship, you didn't hear the sales number because I didn't say what it was.

Subsequent to that, of course, those with correct knowledge of the situation, including the National Organization of Life Guaranty Association, the NAIC, the ACLI, we and other insurance companies have provided a lot of well-written clarifications. And I would say that certainly most of you on the call have made very clear that you understand how the accounts function. And I think you’ve provided a real public service, quite frankly, for putting together reports that demonstrate very ably your understanding of these. And I think that as more comes to light, that that's the direction things will go. I mean the beneficiaries have full access to their funds. They are in guaranteed minimum interest rates. They exceed what they could in other money market type accounts. Our account holders tell us they love it. It's consumer friendly, on and on. One of the interesting things, as you probably know, in terms of guarantee funds and whatnot, in the course of business, we actually are prohibited from talking about guarantee funds and whatnot in the insurance industry. I think that has to do with moral hazard issues and so forth, which we certainly wouldn't disagree with. By the way, you may recall back in 2008, during the crisis, they clarified the Guaranty Association coverage, which in this instance goes as if it were any kind of life insurance death benefit. And most states in the U.S., all 50 have coverage. Most are at 300,000. A handful, like New York, are at 500,000. None of them are below 250,000. So now I can say that because I'm just commenting on a comment from the guaranty fund association. They came out with a reaffirmation of that just this week. So I think there's nothing better than having good solid clarifying correct information when it comes to financial products. So that's about all I have to say, but I can't say anything about the Attorney General's office."

A few other companies have reported an uptick in claims. It seems like there is a business mix issue. But what's the possibility that if the economy stays the way it is that you actually see another uptick in claims over the next few quarters? And then the second question is on interest rates. With rates like 10-year sitting around 3%, could you maybe quantify a little bit on if that 10-year stays at this level for the rest of the year, how much of an impact it would have on your earnings and maybe even if it were to drop another 50 basis points, what sort of sensitivity would you have on your results?"

I'll start off by talking about what we’re seeing in disability. As Bill Wheeler talked about in his opening remarks, we saw modest improvement this quarter in disability results relative to prior quarters. Incidence was down slightly. Recoveries were improved slightly. And so that's brought the loss ratio down a little bit. You commented on what some of our competitors are seeing. I can't really speak for them. And I'm not really sure why we saw the impact on our disability business more quickly. As you know, we've been talking about this issue for some time. Some of it may have to do with the mix of business that we have. We have a book of business that focuses on large companies. It's also got a significant percentage of those being financial services companies. And I think when the economy started to turn down, I think those companies acted more quickly in terms of adjusting their workforces. That may have had some impact on how quickly we saw claims coming into our operation. We also have taken some price increases over the last couple of pricing cycles, and I think that has helped us in terms of our overall results for the quarter. But what I would say just to summarize is that the performance of the quarter in disability was moderately encouraging. And I would say as the economy continues to slowly recover, we think that we'll begin to see a recovery in our disability business as well."

And I guess I would say, the answer is not much in general. By that I mean we would probably see a little lower earnings than otherwise expected in 2011. But it'd be enough to mention but not that significant. I think some people have talked about impairments of DAC or goodwill or things like that, and I wouldn't think that that's likely in this sort of time frame. You also mentioned drop and what would happen if we dropped the 10-year to 2½%. I have to admit I haven't run that scenario. So I can't give you any real precise answer. But I would give you sort of a general response. You followed us, and I think most of the analysts listening to this call followed us for a long time. We’ve talked about the low interest rate issues and what we do to protect ourselves. And we've said that from time to time well before obviously the current situation. Because this is part of our risk management, we've often talked about a Japan scenario and how we protect ourselves against that risk. And we buy very long interest-rate floors, sometimes with deferred-start mechanisms to push out -- protect ourselves as long as we can. And we have a pretty good portfolio of those. So as interest rates continue down here, those things obviously come into the money and start paying. But obviously, they're increasing in value as we speak. Or obviously, even in the second quarter, we saw an increase in value of those contracts. So this is something we've thought about for a long time and have, I think, prepared ourselves pretty well for and spent the money, frankly, over the last five years to do. So I think that's being smart about risk management and understanding where your real risks are. So I think we're in relatively good shape here."

That's question number one. Question number two is, I guess Met's been fairly involved in the FASB-IASB joint accounting project.

And I'm not sure we've completely diagnosed why it came about because I think it is sort of unique. You had a pretty substantial drop in both equity and interest rates right at the end of the quarter. And so for most of the quarter, we were a little un-level, and then we had a pretty big drop near the end or in June. And the way GAAP works and when it reflects those sort of macro events, to put it simply, there are sometimes GAAP sort of smooth results with some things like mean reversion formulas and such. And this is one of those occasions where it ended up being a fairly big smoothing. At the same time, our hedging program, which we use to protect against these sort of events, doesn't smooth anything. And so effectively, we became over-hedged at least on an accounting basis, certainly not on an economic risk basis. I think that we feel hedging worked quite well there. And it was meaningful enough that obviously we felt we really had to call it out in the financials and talk about it because it represented roughly a nickel overall for the company of earnings per share. So now the interesting question is – so that’s sort of what happened.  What happens if we get a reversal? It doesn’t magically go the other way, and there’s been a $0.05 adjustment going the other way.  It doesn't work that simply. I do think that these things do balance out over time because, of course, that's the whole point of mean reversion, it's a smoothing mechanism that will spread out the adjustment over a longer period of time as much as, frankly, five years. So that's how the mean reversion works. So it also has to do with the fact that we are very much in the middle of the mean reversion corridor as opposed to being one end or the other which is good to be in the middle. But I think that, that sort of has a smoothing impact. So you could smooth a little bit the other way. But I think, obviously, if the stock market goes up that we would live with a little smoothing. That's okay. Now, with regard to accounting, I’m going to introduce Pete Carlson who is our Chief Accounting Officer.  I remember what he told me yesterday about what was going on, but rather than me just trying to repeat it, maybe I'll let him speak and talk a little bit about what’s going on with these accounting initiatives."

Suneet, I think you referenced the Insurance Contracts Project that’s a joint project between the International Accounting Board and the U.S. board, the FASB. What’s happened, the International Board actually overnight did release an exposure draft. They had a July 30th goal, and they’ve released their exposure draft for this project. That would apply to people under International financial reporting standards which obviously is not what we currently follow. The U.S. board, because there already are existing standards for insurance contracts, we have much more industry specific guidance here in the U.S. actually is on a little bit slower path and is not expected to release an exposure draft for another month or two and actually may not even do it an exposure draft. So the stage of the discussions are much more preliminary on the U.S. side. That being said, the boards have recently in discussions, reached a general consensus between both boards that acquisition costs actually would be considered in cash flow. So there would be some deferral of acquisition cost. And that's been one of the two key issues we’ve been monitoring as an industry."

I’m pretty sure this IFRS insurance contracts exposure draft is going to include some mark-to-market of liabilities. The key is not whether or not they're going to do that, it's how they do it and the kind of discount rates they use. There was some discussions that they might consider using a risk-free rate. We think that would be a bad idea. We think that the discount rate should really mimic as closely as possible sort of what’s going on with spreads or the mark-to-market of the assets. So you have them. So ergo, if you're a well-matched company, which we think we are and others that, that would minimize the volatility of marking both sides to the balance sheet together. I think they're a lot more aware of that than they used to be. There's this whole interplay between what goes on in AOCI and the movements there and also net income versus operating income. And I think those sort of distinctions, a lot of I think the mark-to-market AOCI, as opposed to obviously including now liabilities is not going to just flow through a real income statement. But looking at operating income and being able to call that out is just only going to get more important as opposed to sort of the mark-to-market in the balance sheet that goes on every quarter. So I’ll probably confuse newspaper reporters, but I think the analyst community will get it. Also, one last thing on this since we’re on this topic is our expectation is this isn't going to be sort of the law of the land until sort of 2013 or '14. And they have pushed this date back a little bit, so we might not be done pushing it back. So this is quite a ways out before this is going to hit us."

First of all, the improvement that we saw in the Non-Medical Health benefits ratio this quarter as Bill mentioned in his comments was primarily driven by Dental. We saw the increase in utilization in Dental claims early in 2009 when we took some steps as part of our 2010 pricing both for new business and renewal pricing to adjust our prices to make sure that they reflected the higher cost of claims. And so I think you're starting to see the impact of those pricing changes working into our financial results. And as a result, the loss ratio in Dental has come down and that is the primary driver of Non-Medical Health benefits loss ratio. And that's one of the reasons why we created the new ratio because the Dental business has grown significantly over the past few years relative to the Disability business. So when you think about comparing the benefit ratio today versus the benefit ratio a few years ago, we have seen a change in the mix of the products that are there with Dental becoming much more significant. And that's one of the reasons why we adjusted that ratio in the first place. We still think that we have some opportunities for us to bring that ratio down as I talked about before.  I think the Disability ratios continue to be high, reflecting the downturn in the economy, though we are seeing some improvement there. And we haven’t yet seen the full impact of the Dental pricing changes working through into the benefits ratio. So over time, our expectation is that, that ratio will continue to trend down."

And obviously, what kind of pop made the ratio go up for this quarter is not because expenses went up; it’s because we had lots of closeout sales, which are obviously lumpy. And that smoothes over a year period, but in the short run, you can have lumpy quarters like the one we just did. So in terms of real expense control, we put out guidance that we raised our operational excellence guidance to $600 million at Investor Day, 2009, last December. And we're going to exceed that number. I mean it's hard for me to say how much. But as you would hope, a number we put out, we would like to beat. So we're doing very well there.

And at least some of the people down in Washington kind of liked it and said it was actually reflective of what it was all about. So whether or not that's helpful for normal people, I don't know. But it seemed to help people in Washington. Let me just give you a little flavor. I mean as I said all along, the bill passes, and now relative to the insurance companies, the work is far from over which is a good thing, because the bill is full of bank language, full of bank processes and so forth. And so the clarifications then work to differentiate the insurance marketplace. And so it’s literally hundreds of rule-making and regulatory projects that are going on. You have an idea; there are 199 separate rule-making initiatives. There are 68 studies underway. There are 355 issues on which lawmakers have given regulators the authority to issue the regulations even if the regulations are not expressly required. And keep in mind that some of the studies are done by agencies that do not even now currently exist, like the Financial Services Oversight Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of work to be done on the details. And because it is so important to us, other people may think that we would relax a little bit. And this is the time that we really have positioned ourselves, both as a company directly and through the ACLI as a resource to all of these rule-making initiatives and wordings and so forth. And so when it comes to things like – and this covers though Volcker rule, it covers derivatives. It covers things like resolution authority fees, taxes, this and the other. We're all very, very focused and very active here at MetLife in Washington. So that's probably the best way to answer that question because it's very difficult to be more clear than that. But we’re not discouraged. We’re not discouraged. We like this kind of slogging through. That’s kind of what we do very well."

The language in the original proposal did not, of course, contemplate nor think about insurance companies. Therefore, the definition of what a proprietary account was, was not clarified.

As you know, we expect to complete the deal very soon, and let me remind you what this will do for MetLife. 
It will be rewarding to our shareholders and will significantly accelerate our strategy by improving our long-term growth in revenues, in earnings and in ROE. It will increase our global presence in both emerging and mature markets, many in which MetLife will have a top five market share, and will give us the opportunity to become the leading life insurance and employee benefits provider in the word.
Now let me share our overall MetLife results for the quarter. MetLife performed well, with continued growth in both our top and bottom lines. We generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $8.6 billion, up 2% over the third quarter of 2009. We increased operating earnings to $878 million, up 22% over the prior year period. I'm also pleased to report that our book value improved considerably, up 24% over the year-ago period and 8% sequentially, driven by our strong operating earnings and our investment performance.
Driving this quarter's growth is our continued focus on the fundamentals: disciplined growth, excellent underwriting, solid expense control and strong investment returns. 
You'll hear more from Steve Kandarian in a moment, but I'd like to say that we continue to be pleased with the investment portfolio performance. Investment losses, including impairments continue to trend lower. This was partly due to our best-in-class real estate portfolio, we're loan to value's improved again this quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down further, and now our delinquencies have fallen back to just two basis points.
Turning to our Domestic business segment results, U.S. Business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion, flat over the prior year period, though up modestly, excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity which, as you know, can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Operating earnings grew by 21%, with significant increases in each of the major segments, largely driven by very strong underwriting results, as well as the benefit of ongoing expense management. 
In our Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues were consistent with the third quarter of 2009 at $5 billion. And operating earnings grew 14%, up in each product line. Group Life premiums grew 2% and operating earnings were up 6% compared with the prior year period. The Group Life mortality ratio was very good at 89% and has remained below Investor Day guidance each quarter this year.
Non-Medical Health revenues were up slightly, reflecting higher dental revenue though partly offset by lower disability revenue. Operating earnings grew by 49%, driven by improved interest and underwriting margins. The Non-Medical Health benefits ratio remained good at 88%, consistent with the second quarter. 
Individual Life premiums, fees and other revenues were down due to unusual items in the year-ago period and flat when normalized. Operating earnings grew by 5%, reflecting solid mortality results. 
In Retirement products, the top line to grew $738 million, up 11% on sales high persistency and higher fee income. Variable annuity sales reached a record of $4.7 billion, up 35% over the third quarter of 2009, driven by momentum in third-party distribution channels. We also are benefiting from additional distribution relationships launched over the past year. Operating earnings increased 42% due to growth in net flows and higher net investment income. 
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues of $618 million were down year-over-year, driven by less pension closeout activity. However, structured settlement premiums grew by 2% over the prior year period and 4%, sequentially. Operating earnings increased 35% over the prior year due primarily to higher investment income. 
Auto & Home had another strong quarter. Net written premiums increased 3% to $780 million. Operating earnings were strong at $81 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was excellent at 88.2%.
MetLife Bank had a record quarter. Total operating revenues for the bank increased 8% to $410 million, driven by higher mortgage servicing revenue and more refinancing activity. Operating earnings grew 26% to $101 million. 
Now turning to our current International business, we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a recorded basis, premiums, fees and other revenues of $1.3 billion grew 16% over the prior year period. Operating earnings increased by 25% to $191 million due to growth in the business and a onetime tax-related benefit. 
In our Latin America region, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 21%. The Asia Pacific region grew 11% due primarily to higher sales in Korea and Hong Kong. And in our Europe Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 7%, reflecting continued growth in Europe and India. 
Earlier this morning, we announced the sale of our Japanese joint venture to our joint venture partner. The agreement we have reached is in the best interest of our shareholders, policyholders and employees. Though we have enjoyed an excellent partnership and much successful joint venture, we cannot leverage our expertise and position in the Japanese market to focus on ALICO in Japan.
As we move forward, we will transition to a global enterprise through refreshed strategies, enhanced operating models, expanded global branding and engaged in a committed management. I look forward to our Investor Day on December 6 when you'll hear more about how we will deliver increased value to our customers and shareholders as the leading global insurance company. 
With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I would like to review some key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me begin with the variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the third quarter was $292 million, which is $92 million above the top of the planned range that I provided on Investor Day. This is primarily driven by strong private equity returns across our global portfolio. We are currently seeing similar private equity funds take advantage of improving market conditions to accelerate realizations, which is leading us to believe that barring any unforeseen market events, variable income should remain strong throughout the rest of the year.
Now let me cover investment portfolio gains and losses. Gross investment losses for the third quarter were $215 million. Gross investment gains were $212 million and write-downs were $98 million for a net investment loss of $101 million. These levels are in line with the past several quarters, and we believe are modest given the current economic environment. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $4.8 billion, down from $10.8 billion at year end. 
For the quarter, gross unrealized gains increased $5.5 billion to $19.7 billion as interest rates and credit spreads declined. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined 46 basis points and spreads for investment grade corporate credit declined approximately 20 basis points. Overall, the fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio was a net unrealized gain position of $14.8 billion at quarter end, a dramatic improvement from a $24.4 billion net unrealized loss just six quarters ago.
As to our commercial mortgage portfolio, as Rob mentioned, the loan-to-value of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 67%, down from 68% last quarter as valuations continued to improve in markets in which we invest. Our commercial mortgage valuation allowance declined by $48 million to $573 million. Approximately $20 million of the decline was a reduction in our FAS 5 general reserve due to improved market conditions. The remaining decline is largely due to the resolution of certain delinquent loans in our U.S. portfolio. Total delinquent commercial mortgage loans decreased to $8 million from $137 million last quarter, with no delinquencies in our U.S. portfolio at the end of the third quarter.
The decrease in delinquencies was driven by one loan being paid off at 98%, and the transfer of a high-quality property to our real estate equity portfolio. I should caution that our delinquency numbers will fluctuate over time as challenges remain in the commercial real estate market. Nevertheless, we believe that we will continue to maintain relatively low loss levels and outperform the overall market. 
Finally, let me comment on our cash position, which increased from $20.4 billion last quarter to $26.1 billion this quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to the cash that we are holding for our ALICO purchase. In addition, cash collateral balances relating to our derivative counterparties increased.
Excluding the impact of these two factors, our cash position remains consistent with second quarter levels and is down approximately $4 billion since Investor Day, as we reinvested into higher-yielding assets. In summary, we believe that our portfolio remains well positioned for the current economic environment. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $0.99 of operating earnings per share per share for the third quarter. This quarter's results include a dilutive impact of $0.08 per share, resulting from the ALICO equity and debt issuance and",1176,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $0.99 of operating earnings per share per share for the third quarter. This quarter's results include a dilutive impact of $0.08 per share, resulting from the ALICO equity and debt issuance and completed in early August. This morning, I'll walk through our financial results and play out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with the top line. Total premiums, fees and other revenues which were $8.6 billion in the third quarter were up 2% from the third quarter of last year, and up 4% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and have been adversely impacted by this low interest rate environment. 
U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion were essentially flat as compared to the prior year quarter. This includes a modest decrease in Insurance Products revenue due to Individual Life's 4% decline. Adjusting for a few unusual items recorded in each of the periods, Individual Life's top line was actually down less than 1%.
Group Life premiums were up 2% from the prior year quarter. As you may recall from my second quarter remarks, growth in Group Life is being helped by a change in the financial terms in a large retrospectively rated contract, which resulted in less reinsurance ceded. As this change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, the benefit to Group Life top line's growth over the prior four quarters will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year. Overall, Group Insurance revenue continues to be impacted by high unemployment and our unwillingness to chase business at below desired margins or returns.
Also, revenue in Retirement Products increased by 11% due to higher separate account fees from positive net flows and favorable separate account investment returns. Also, Group revenue and Corporate Benefit Funding was down 13% from the prior quarter, driven by lower closeout premiums, which I referenced before. Structured settlement premiums remained strong.
Auto & Homes revenues were up by 2%, and MetLife Bank's revenues grew by 11%. International's revenue was up 16% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant-currency basis over the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all three regions and led by Mexico, Korea and Chile. 
Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were favorable this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is a good result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.7%. This quarter's results were higher than the very favorable prior quarter of 80.4%. That said, the ratio was significantly below the prior year quarter, 91.2% and also below our plan. Overall, another good result.
At 88% for the third quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio was up slightly over the sequential quarter of 87.8%, but favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and well within our investor good day guidance range of 86% to 90%. Dental underwriting results continue to see stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue to be below plan, as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations.
Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.6% for the quarter, which was up over the prior year quarter's results of 91.1% due to higher catastrophes in the current quarter. The combined ratio, excluding cats, was 88.2% in the third quarter versus 87.7% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $3 million after-tax was taken in this quarter, and that's compared to a $7 million after-tax release from the prior year period.
Moving to investment spreads. We saw a continued solid investment spreads this quarter, driven in part by strong variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after-tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $56 million or $0.06 per share, above the top of the 2010 guidance range. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. 
Moving to expenses, our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 22.5%, which is a solid result and was in the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22.5% given at Investor Day. 
Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $878 million in operating earnings or $0.99 per share. Included in our third quarter results was an unfavorable market impact of $36 million or $0.04 per share, as the increase of 11% in the S&P 500 this quarter was more than offset by the impact from our variable annuity hedge program. In the second quarter of this year, we had essentially the opposite situation, where a 12% decline in the S&P 500 was more than offset by the results of our hedge program creating a $0.05 favorable market impact in that quarter.
In addition, our total operating taxes of $378 million includes a true-up in our effective tax rate for the year from 27% to 28%, as well as a net tax benefit of several onetime items in the quarter. Overall, the result of various international and domestic tax issues impacted operating earnings by $90 million or $0.02 in the quarter.
With regard to investment gains and losses, in the third quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment losses of $222 million, which includes net investment portfolio losses of $72 million after-tax. Impairments were $64 million after-tax in the third quarter and continued to trend down. In addition, as Rob mentioned, we have sold our Japanese joint venture and announced the sale to our joint venture partner and recorded an impairment, which shows up in realized investment losses. 
With regards to derivatives, we had after-tax losses of $190 million. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. The decline in the relative value of the dollar as well as the tightening of MetLife's own credit spreads, partially offset by declines in interest rates, resulted in the derivative loss for this quarter. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.
Our preliminary statutory earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were approximately $850 million, and our preliminary statutory net income was approximately $800 million which is a good result. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were $9.8 billion. Please keep in mind, this total includes the ALICO financing, which we completed in early August and the total was $6.5 million.
In summary, MetLife had a good third quarter. Our investment performance continue to improve. Our operating margins remain strong by disciplined underwriting and expense management, and our earnings continue to grow.

Now the way we came up with that calculation, most of that $0.20 is from investment spread compression. But we also did factor in at least a preliminary estimate on how our pension costs might change. And obviously, that will get trued up at year end, given where the stock market is and frankly, where the interest rates are on December 31 because that's how the math works on the pension cost. So that was factored in, Nigel. We did not consider impacts to what I would say top line issues, which are obviously a little harder to quantify. And the most obvious impact of that is where our pension closeout sales which are soft now, and I suspect we don't think we're going to get meaningfully better next year until interest rates start to improve. So that's most of the issue. FX is actually having -- you saw a varied strong decline in the value of the dollar versus the yen and the euro this quarter. And the FX impact for international is actually quite modest. I mean, it's a gain but it's less than $0.01. Now with ALICO, that will change and the FX impact will be more pronounced. And so if you think about it, what that really means is ALICO's earnings expressed in dollars are probably going to be stronger, all things considered than we originally estimated because when we announced the deal, we assumed one set of exchange rate and the dollar has weakened since then. So ALICO's earnings impact is going to be better. Now we don't really take the spot rate right now. We look at the, I guess, what we consider to be the forward exchange rate, which where the dollar I think is expected to rally a little bit. So the impact may not be as significant as you might first think. But that will obviously get -- we'll obviously kind of wrap that all up on our guidance for 2011 on Investor Day."

We do see persistency improving in our Variable Annuity business and that shouldn't surprise anybody, frankly, given where interest rates are and where the stock market is. I don't believe that's going to cause us to change our DAC amortization policy or the period of time, just for everybody's benefit. We would amortize variable annuity back over 20 years. And in our fixed annuity DAC, we would amortize I think also over 20 years. But the way that works is there's a rate guarantee in your deferred annuity contract and what we assume is a pretty big -- when the rate guarantee comes off, that DAC model would assume a pretty big shock labs, something like crudely 50%. And so most of the DAC is very -- ammortization would be very front-end loaded. But if people stay, then the rest of it would run out to 20 years. So that's sort of our policy, and I don't really expect that to change."

We're really quite pleased at the way we've been able to exit our JV in Japan, both for us and quite frankly for our JV partner. This of course from our point of view gives us, as I mentioned in my comments, the ability without any distraction to focus 100% on our ALICO business in Japan and that's a good thing. Relative to variable annuity appetite, I think everyone expects from me somewhat of the same comment about variable annuity, and it's the same worldwide as it would be in the United States. And that is we think that there is a terrific need in the savings arena for the type of products and services we can provide, both from the standpoint of the accumulation of assets and the creation of income for Life. We think that's very important. At the same time, we've always said, we do not want to become overly dependent on any one product for our financial health. And I would include variable annuities in that statement, so that the growth opportunities for us worldwide, it varies by country to country. I don't think you would see our growth being driven, for example, 100% by variable annuity sales anywhere. But we do see significant opportunities relative to ALICO. As I've mentioned, our first focus is on bringing home exactly the business that we analyzed and we love so much, the Accident Life Insurance and so forth. In addition to that of course, we bring competencies to the ALICO family that they were in some cases precluded from using because of their sister companies at AIG and so forth. And so, we very excited about it. We love the Variable Annuity business. We're not in love with it, but it is a very attractive product for our customers worldwide."

In terms of the purchase accounting, well again, we did revised purchase accounting when we did the financings in August. Now that we're going to close the deal very soon, we will put out some revised purchase accounting in an SEC filing, I guess later in November. So you'll get to see the math as it currently stands. It's interesting. It's complex, okay? But the punchline is that you will see some changes in the VOBA, in goodwill balances. A little bit more of the purchase place will end up getting pushed to goodwill versus VOBA. That has the effect of probably improving earnings accretion. So directionally, in terms of reported earnings accretion it's probably, there's upward pressure. And so that's all good I think."

The market for VAs continues to be good and I think you saw from our sales results really for the whole year that sales have been pretty strong. And we've been getting sales primarily from the GMIB product, but also from the increasingly from LWG product as well. Given where the current interest rate levels are, the margin on the products that we're selling today are below what I would say our target margins. But I think you've got to think about this business over a cycle. And so earlier in the year, when interest rates were higher, margins are good and we were writing at returns that were higher than what our target returns are. So we think overtime, as interest rates come back, we'll start to see returns improve close to the target. But we're also going to be taking some steps in 2011 to continue to improve the overall margin in the product and the overall level of return. And so we'll be telling you more about that in the coming months. As it relates to disability, obviously, our disability results continue to be challenged in this quarter. We saw higher incidence levels than we've seen in prior quarters. Our recoveries ticked up a little bit but it was very, very modest improvement in recoveries. So as a result, the overall loss ratio in disability was pretty high. It was probably one of the highest that we've had over this past cycle. So there's a number of things that we continue to do from an operational perspective to try and improve our Disability business. We're also taking some pricing actions again with both our New business and our Renewal business for 2011. So we're in the market right now. I would say high single-digit disability price increases as a way for us to bring in more revenue for the product and begin to get the loss ratios and the margins back to target."

And that's really taking some very low valuations of a couple of years ago during the crisis and kind of moving them up on the equity methods. Those two things I think are keys. The third probably is concern by people in the private equity world about their tax rates. So accelerating some profits now before their personal tax rates may go up based upon the tax treatment of carried interest. How much of that will go on into 2011? We're still doing some work on that. I'll have some numbers for you on Investor Day. We'll provide you probably a range again like we did last year. We're finalizing those numbers now so I'm reluctant to kind of give out an estimate before we finish our work."

As you know, we expect to complete the deal very soon, and let me remind you what this will do for MetLife. It will be rewarding to our shareholders and will significantly accelerate our strategy by improving our long-term growth in revenues, in earnings and in ROE. It will increase our global presence in both emerging and mature markets, many in which MetLife will have a top five market share, and will give us the opportunity to become the leading life insurance and employee benefits provider in the word.
Now let me share our overall MetLife results for the quarter. MetLife performed well, with continued growth in both our top and bottom lines. We generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $8.6 billion, up 2% over the third quarter of 2009. We increased operating earnings to $878 million, up 22% over the prior year period. I'm also pleased to report that our book value improved considerably, up 24% over the year-ago period and 8% sequentially, driven by our strong operating earnings and our investment performance.
Driving this quarter's growth is our continued focus on the fundamentals: disciplined growth, excellent underwriting, solid expense control and strong investment returns.
You'll hear more from Steve Kandarian in a moment, but I'd like to say that we continue to be pleased with the investment portfolio performance.  Investment losses, including impairments, continue to trend lower. This was partly due to our best-in-class real estate portfolio, where loan to values improved again this quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down further, and now our delinquencies have fallen back to just two basis points.
Turning to our Domestic business segment results, U.S. Business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion, flat over the prior year period, though up modestly, excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity which, as you know, can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Operating earnings grew by 21%, with significant increases in each of the major segments, largely driven by very strong underwriting results, as well as the benefit of ongoing expense management.
In our Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues were consistent with the third quarter of 2009 at $5 billion. And operating earnings grew 14%, up in each product line. Group Life premiums grew 2% and operating earnings were up 6% compared with the prior year period. The Group Life mortality ratio was very good at 89% and has remained below Investor Day guidance each quarter this year.
Non-Medical Health revenues were up slightly, reflecting higher dental revenue though partly offset by lower disability revenue. Operating earnings grew by 49%, driven by improved interest and underwriting margins. The Non-Medical Health benefits ratio remained good at 88%, consistent with the second quarter.
Individual Life premiums, fees and other revenues were down due to unusual items in the year-ago period and flat when normalized. Operating earnings grew by 5%, reflecting solid mortality results.
In Retirement products, the top line grew to $738 million, up 11% on sales high persistency and higher fee income. Variable annuity sales reached a record of $4.7 billion, up 35% over the third quarter of 2009, driven by momentum in third-party distribution channels. We also are benefiting from additional distribution relationships launched over the past year.  Operating earnings increased 42% due to growth in net flows and higher net investment income.
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues of $618 million were down year-over-year, driven by less pension closeout activity. However, structured settlement premiums grew by 2% over the prior year period and 4%, sequentially. Operating earnings increased 35% over the prior year due primarily to higher investment income.
Auto & Home had another strong quarter. Net written premiums increased 3% to $780 million. Operating earnings were strong at $81 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was excellent at 88.2%.
MetLife Bank had a record quarter. Total operating revenues for the bank increased 8% to $410 million, driven by higher mortgage servicing revenue and more refinancing activity. Operating earnings grew 26% to $101 million.
Now turning to our current International business, we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a recorded basis, premiums, fees and other revenues of $1.3 billion grew 16% over the prior year period. Operating earnings increased by 25% to $191 million due to growth in the business and a onetime tax-related benefit.
In our Latin America region, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 21%. The Asia Pacific region grew 11% due primarily to higher sales in Korea and Hong Kong. And in our Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 7%, reflecting continued growth in Europe and India.
Earlier this morning, we announced the sale of our Japanese joint venture to our joint venture partner. The agreement we have reached is in the best interest of our shareholders, policyholders and employees. Though we have enjoyed an excellent partnership and much success with the joint venture, we can now leverage our expertise and position in the Japanese market to focus on ALICO in Japan.
As we move forward, we will transition to a global enterprise through refreshed strategies, enhanced operating models, expanded global branding and engaged in a committed management. I look forward to our Investor Day on December 6 when you'll hear more about how we will deliver increased value to our customers and shareholders as the leading global insurance company.
With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I would like to review some key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me begin with the variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the third quarter was $292 million, which is $92 million above the top of the planned range that I provided on Investor Day. This is primarily driven by strong private equity returns across our global portfolio. We are currently seeing similar private equity funds take advantage of improving market conditions to accelerate realizations, which is leading us to believe that barring any unforeseen market events, variable income should remain strong throughout the rest of the year.
Now let me cover investment portfolio gains and losses. Gross investment losses for the third quarter were $215 million. Gross investment gains were $212 million and write-downs were $98 million for a net investment loss of $101 million. These levels are in line with the past several quarters, and we believe are modest given the current economic environment. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $4.8 billion, down from $10.8 billion at year end.
For the quarter, gross unrealized gains increased $5.5 billion to $19.7 billion as interest rates and credit spreads declined. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined 46 basis points and spreads for investment grade corporate credit declined approximately 20 basis points. Overall, the fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio was a net unrealized gain position of $14.8 billion at quarter end, a dramatic improvement from a $24.4 billion net unrealized loss just six quarters ago.
As to our commercial mortgage portfolio, as Rob mentioned, the loan-to-value of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 67%, down from 68% last quarter as valuations continued to improve in markets in which we invest. Our commercial mortgage valuation allowance declined by $48 million to $573 million. Approximately $20 million of the decline was a reduction in our FAS 5 general reserve due to improved market conditions. The remaining decline is largely due to the resolution of certain delinquent loans in our U.S. portfolio. Total delinquent commercial mortgage loans decreased to $8 million from $137 million last quarter, with no delinquencies in our U.S. portfolio at the end of the third quarter.
The decrease in delinquencies was driven by one loan being paid off at 98%, and the transfer of a high-quality property to our real estate equity portfolio. I should caution that our delinquency numbers will fluctuate over time as challenges remain in the commercial real estate market. Nevertheless, we believe that we will continue to maintain relatively low loss levels and outperform the overall market.
Finally, let me comment on our cash position, which increased from $20.4 billion last quarter to $26.1 billion this quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to the cash that we are holding for our ALICO purchase. In addition, cash collateral balances relating to our derivative counterparties increased.  Excluding the impact of these two factors, our cash position remains consistent with second quarter levels and is down approximately $4 billion since Investor Day, as we reinvested into higher-yielding assets. In summary, we believe that our portfolio remains well positioned for the current economic environment.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."
185648,113754295,83426,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $0.99 of operating earnings per share per share for the third quarter. This quarter's results include a dilutive impact of $0.08 per share, resulting from the ALICO equity and debt issuance and",1177,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. MetLife reported $0.99 of operating earnings per share per share for the third quarter. This quarter's results include a dilutive impact of $0.08 per share, resulting from the ALICO equity and debt issuance and completed in early August. This morning, I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with the top line. Total premiums, fees and other revenues which were $8.6 billion in the third quarter were up 2% from the third quarter of last year, and up 4% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and have been adversely impacted by this low interest rate environment.
U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion were essentially flat as compared to the prior year quarter. This includes a modest decrease in Insurance Products revenue due to Individual Life's 4% decline. Adjusting for a few unusual items recorded in each of the periods, Individual Life's top line was actually down less than 1%.
Group Life premiums were up 2% from the prior year quarter. As you may recall from my second quarter remarks, growth in Group Life is being helped by a change in the financial terms in a large retrospectively rated contract, which resulted in less reinsurance ceded. As this change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, the benefit to Group Life top line's growth over the prior four quarters will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year. Overall, Group Insurance revenue continues to be impacted by high unemployment and our unwillingness to chase business at below desired margins or returns.
Also, revenue in Retirement Products increased by 11% due to higher separate account fees from positive net flows and favorable separate account investment returns. Also, Group revenue and Corporate Benefit Funding was down 13% from the prior year quarter, driven by the lower closeout premiums, which I referenced before. Structured settlement premiums remained strong.
Auto & Homes revenues were up by 2%, and MetLife Bank's revenues grew by 11%. International's revenue was up 16% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant-currency basis over the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all three regions and led by Mexico, Korea and Chile.
Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were favorable this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is a good result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.7%. This quarter's results were higher than the very favorable prior quarter of 80.4%. That said, the ratio was significantly below the prior year quarter of 91.2% and also below our plan. Overall, another good result.  
At 88% for the third quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio was up slightly over the sequential quarter of 87.8%, but favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and well within our Investor Day guidance range of 86% to 90%. Dental underwriting results continue to see stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue to be below plan, as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations.
Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.6% for the quarter, which was up over the prior year quarter's results of 91.1% due to higher catastrophes in the current quarter. The combined ratio, excluding cats, was 88.2% in the third quarter versus 87.7% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $3 million after-tax was taken in this quarter, and that's compared to a $7 million after-tax release from the prior year period.
Moving to investment spreads. We saw continued solid investment spreads this quarter, driven in part by strong variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after-tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $56 million or $0.06 per share, above the top of the 2010 guidance range. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity returns.
Moving to expenses, our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 22.5%, which is a solid result and was in the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22.5% given at Investor Day.
Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $878 million in operating earnings or $0.99 per share. Included in our third quarter results was an unfavorable market impact of $36 million or $0.04 per share, as the increase of 11% in the S&P 500 this quarter was more than offset by the impact from our variable annuity hedge program. In the second quarter of this year, we had essentially the opposite situation, where a 12% decline in the S&P 500 was more than offset by the results of our hedge program creating a $0.05 favorable market impact in that quarter.
In addition, our total operating taxes of $378 million includes a true-up in our effective tax rate for the year from 27% to 28%, as well as a net tax benefit of several onetime items in the quarter. Overall, the results of various international and domestic tax issues impacted operating earnings by $19 million or $0.02 in the quarter.
With regard to investment gains and losses, in the third quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment losses of $222 million, which includes net investment portfolio losses of $72 million after-tax. Impairments were $64 million after-tax in the third quarter and continued to trend down. In addition, as Rob mentioned, we have sold our Japanese joint venture and announced the sale to our joint venture partner and recorded an impairment, which shows up in realized investment losses.
With regards to derivatives, we had after-tax losses of $190 million. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. The decline in the relative value of the dollar as well as the tightening of MetLife's own credit spread, partially offset by declines in interest rates, resulted in the derivative loss for this quarter. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.
Our preliminary statutory earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were approximately $850 million, and our preliminary statutory net income was approximately $800 million which is a good result. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were $9.8 billion. Please keep in mind, this total includes the ALICO financing, which we completed in early August and the total was $6.5 billion.
In summary, MetLife had a good third quarter. Our investment performance continue to improve. Our operating margins remain strong by disciplined underwriting and expense management, and our earnings continue to grow.

Now the way we came up with that calculation, most of that $0.20 is from investment spread compression. But we also did factor in at least a preliminary estimate on how our pension costs might change. And obviously, that will get trued up at year end, given where the stock market is and frankly, where the interest rates are on December 31 because that's how the math works on the pension cost. So that was factored in, Nigel. We did not consider impacts to what I would say top line issues, which are obviously a little harder to quantify. And the most obvious impact of that is where pension closeout sales, which are soft now, and I suspect we don't think we're going to get meaningfully better next year until interest rates start to improve. So that's most of the issue. FX is actually having -- you saw a very, but strong, decline in the value of the dollar versus the yen and the euro this quarter. And the FX impact for international is actually quite modest. I mean, it's a gain but it's less than $0.01. Now with ALICO, that will change and the FX impact will be more pronounced. And so if you think about it, what that really means is ALICO's earnings expressed in dollars are probably going to be stronger, all things considered than we originally estimated because when we announced the deal, we assumed one set of exchange rates and the dollar has weakened since then. So ALICO's earnings impact is going to be better. Now we don't really take the spot rate right now. We look at the, I guess, what we consider to be the forward exchange rate, which where the dollar I think is expected to rally a little bit. So the impact may not be as significant as you might first think. But that will obviously get -- we'll obviously kind of wrap that all up on our guidance for 2011 on Investor Day."

I don't believe that's going to cause us to change our DAC amortization policy or the period of time. Just for everybody's benefit, we would amortize variable annuity back over 20 years. And in our fixed annuity DAC, we would amortize I think also over 20 years. But the way that works is there's a rate guarantee in your deferred annuity contract and what we assume is a pretty big -- when the rate guarantee comes off, the DAC model would assume a pretty big shock lapse, something like crudely 50%. And so most of the DAC is very -- amortization would be very front-end loaded. But if people stay, then the rest of it would run out to 20 years. So that's sort of our policy, and I don't really expect that to change."

This, of course, from our point of view gives us, as I mentioned in my comments, the ability without any distraction to focus 100% on our ALICO business in Japan and that's a good thing. Relative to variable annuity appetite, I think everyone expects from me somewhat of the same comment about variable annuities, and it's the same worldwide as it would be in the United States. And that is we think that there is a terrific need in the savings arena for the type of products and services we can provide, both from the standpoint of the accumulation of assets and the creation of income for Life. We think that's very important. At the same time, we've always said, we do not want to become overly dependent on any one product for our financial health. And I would include variable annuities in that statement, so that the growth opportunities for us worldwide, it varies by country to country. I don't think you would see our growth being driven, for example, 100% by variable annuity sales anywhere. But we do see significant opportunities relative to ALICO. As I've mentioned, our first focus is on bringing home exactly the business that we analyzed and we love so much, the Accident and Health, Life Insurance and so forth. In addition to that, of course, we bring competencies to the ALICO family that they were in some cases precluded from using because of their sister companies at AIG and so forth. And so we're very excited about it. We love the Variable Annuity business. We're not in love with it, but it is a very, very attractive product for our customers worldwide."

Now that we're hopefully going to close the deal very soon, we will put out some revised purchase accounting in an SEC filing, I guess later in November. So you'll get to see the math as it currently stands. It's interesting. It's complex, okay? But the punchline is that you will see some changes in the VOBA, and goodwill balances. A little bit more of the purchase place will end up getting pushed to goodwill versus VOBA. That has the effect of probably improving earnings accretion.

Given where the current interest rate levels are, the margin on the products that we're selling today are below what I would say are our target margins. But I think you've got to think about this business over a cycle. And so earlier in the year when interest rates were higher, margins were good and we were writing at returns that were higher than what our target returns are. So we think over time, as interest rates come back, we'll start to see returns improve close to the target. But we're also going to be taking some steps in 2011 to continue to improve the overall margin in the product and the overall level of return. And so we'll be telling you more about that in the coming months. As it relates to disability, obviously, our disability results continue to be challenged in this quarter. We saw higher incidence levels than we've seen in prior quarters. Our recoveries ticked up a little bit, but it was very, very modest improvement in recoveries. So as a result, the overall loss ratio in disability was pretty high. It was probably one of the highest that we've had over this past cycle. So there's a number of things that we continue to do from an operational perspective to try and improve our Disability business. We're also taking some pricing actions again with both our New business and our Renewal business for 2011. So we're in the market right now with, I would say, high single-digit disability price increases as a way for us to bring in more revenue for the product and begin to get the loss ratios and the margins back to target."

Can you walk us through to three years from now, four years from now? What would be the incremental impact if the 10-year Treasury stays where it is? You talked about how it's based on spread compression, so I guess it wouldn't be a focus on the 5.17% yield and where that would go. More on spread. But in essence, what would happen to expected earnings three years from now? And would you be getting to your long-term goal of 13% to 15% ROE?"

That's a really serious question, and I think I'd hesitate to give an off-the-cuff answer. I think we'll do our best on Investor Day to really kind of talk through that issue with people if interest rates stay really low for a long time. But I would say a couple of things. One is, these interest rate floors that we have that we're benefiting from today, obviously, and really are quite a good hedge against this problem. Those are going to be -- the very first one of those I think expires in late in late 2014. And most of them, often they go into 2015 and '16. So those are going to help us or be there to help us for a very long time, and that's a good thing. The second question is obviously, it is an earnings drag if things stay that low for a long period of time. And yes, I do think that will make hitting our long-term ROE targets much more challenging. But the other kind of -- a little bit of a subjective wildcard is this, if we really get convinced that interest rates are going to stay low for a long time, will we start managing the business differently. And I think the answer is absolutely. But how do you quantify that in terms of the numbers, I'm not really sure I can really do today. So I think those are two things to keep in mind as we think about this potential issue."

That's allowing firms to either sell their businesses to other PE firms or industry players or do refinancings and dividending out. So those markets I think are driving a lot of that and people are searching for yield right now as yields are so low. So as of now, at least, those markets are quite robust in helping returns. There's also some valuations being done that are showing improvements based upon higher equity pricing across the board. And that's really taking some very low valuations of a couple of years ago during the crisis and kind of moving them up on the equity methods. Those two things I think are keys. The third probably is concern by people in the private equity world about their tax rates, so accelerating some profits now before their personal tax rates may go up based upon the tax treatment of carried interest. How much of that will go on into 2011? We're still doing some work on that. I'll have some numbers for you on Investor Day. We'll provide you probably a range again like we did last year. We're finalizing those numbers now so I'm reluctant to kind of give out an estimate before we finish our work."

As you know, we expect to complete the deal very soon, and let me remind you what this will do for MetLife. It will be rewarding to our shareholders and will significantly accelerate our strategy by improving our long-term growth in revenues, in earnings and in ROE. It will increase our global presence in both emerging and mature markets, many in which MetLife will have a top five market share, and will give us the opportunity to become the leading life insurance and employee benefits provider in the word.
Now let me share our overall MetLife results for the quarter. MetLife performed well, with continued growth in both our top and bottom lines. We generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $8.6 billion, up 2% over the third quarter of 2009. We increased operating earnings to $878 million, up 22% over the prior year period. I'm also pleased to report that our book value improved considerably, up 24% over the year-ago period and 8% sequentially, driven by our strong operating earnings and our investment performance.
Driving this quarter's growth is our continued focus on the fundamentals: disciplined growth, excellent underwriting, solid expense control and strong investment returns.
You'll hear more from Steve Kandarian in a moment, but I'd like to say that we continue to be pleased with the investment portfolio performance.  Investment losses, including impairments, continue to trend lower. This was partly due to our best-in-class real estate portfolio, where loan to values improved again this quarter. Our reserve against future losses came down further, and now our delinquencies have fallen back to just two basis points.
Turning to our Domestic business segment results, U.S. Business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion, flat over the prior year period, though up modestly, excluding the impact of lower pension closeout activity which, as you know, can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Operating earnings grew by 21%, with significant increases in each of the major segments, largely driven by very strong underwriting results, as well as the benefit of ongoing expense management.
In our Insurance Products segment, premiums, fees and other revenues were consistent with the third quarter of 2009 at $5 billion. And operating earnings grew 14%, up in each product line. Group Life premiums grew 2% and operating earnings were up 6% compared with the prior year period. The Group Life mortality ratio was very good at 89% and has remained below Investor Day guidance each quarter this year.
Non-Medical Health revenues were up slightly, reflecting higher dental revenue though partly offset by lower disability revenue. Operating earnings grew by 49%, driven by improved interest and underwriting margins. The Non-Medical Health benefits ratio remained good at 88%, consistent with the second quarter.
Individual Life premiums, fees and other revenues were down due to unusual items in the year-ago period and flat when normalized. Operating earnings grew by 5%, reflecting solid mortality results.
In Retirement products, the top line grew to $738 million, up 11% on sales high persistency and higher fee income. Variable annuity sales reached a record of $4.7 billion, up 35% over the third quarter of 2009, driven by momentum in third-party distribution channels. We also are benefiting from additional distribution relationships launched over the past year.  Operating earnings increased 42% due to growth in net flows and higher net investment income.
In Corporate Benefit Funding, premiums, fees and other revenues of $618 million were down year-over-year, driven by less pension closeout activity. However, structured settlement premiums grew by 2% over the prior year period and 4%, sequentially. Operating earnings increased 35% over the prior year due primarily to higher investment income.
Auto & Home had another strong quarter. Net written premiums increased 3% to $780 million. Operating earnings were strong at $81 million. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was excellent at 88.2%.
MetLife Bank had a record quarter. Total operating revenues for the bank increased 8% to $410 million, driven by higher mortgage servicing revenue and more refinancing activity. Operating earnings grew 26% to $101 million.
Now turning to our current International business, we achieved another very strong quarter with growth across all three regions. On a recorded basis, premiums, fees and other revenues of $1.3 billion grew 16% over the prior year period. Operating earnings increased by 25% to $191 million due to growth in the business and a onetime tax-related benefit.
In our Latin America region, growth in Mexico, Chile and Brazil contributed to its top line growth of 21%. The Asia Pacific region grew 11% due primarily to higher sales in Korea and Hong Kong. And in our Europe, Middle East and India region, the top line increased by 7%, reflecting continued growth in Europe and India.
Earlier this morning, we announced the sale of our Japanese joint venture to our joint venture partner. The agreement we have reached is in the best interest of our shareholders, policyholders and employees. Though we have enjoyed an excellent partnership and much success with the joint venture, we can now leverage our expertise and position in the Japanese market to focus on ALICO in Japan.
As we move forward, we will transition to a global enterprise through refreshed strategies, enhanced operating models, expanded global branding and engaged in a committed management. I look forward to our Investor Day on December 6 when you'll hear more about how we will deliver increased value to our customers and shareholders as the leading global insurance company.
With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I would like to review some key components of our investment results for the quarter. First, let me begin with the variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income for the third quarter was $292 million, which is $92 million above the top of the planned range that I provided on Investor Day. This is primarily driven by strong private equity returns across our global portfolio. We are currently seeing similar private equity funds take advantage of improving market conditions to accelerate realizations, which is leading us to believe that barring any unforeseen market events, variable income should remain strong throughout the rest of the year.
Now let me cover investment portfolio gains and losses. Gross investment losses for the third quarter were $215 million. Gross investment gains were $212 million and write-downs were $98 million for a net investment loss of $101 million. These levels are in line with the past several quarters, and we believe are modest given the current economic environment. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $4.8 billion, down from $10.8 billion at year end.
For the quarter, gross unrealized gains increased $5.5 billion to $19.7 billion as interest rates and credit spreads declined. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined 46 basis points and spreads for investment grade corporate credit declined approximately 20 basis points. Overall, the fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio was a net unrealized gain position of $14.8 billion at quarter end, a dramatic improvement from a $24.4 billion net unrealized loss just six quarters ago.
As to our commercial mortgage portfolio, as Rob mentioned, the loan-to-value of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 67%, down from 68% last quarter as valuations continued to improve in markets in which we invest. Our commercial mortgage valuation allowance declined by $48 million to $573 million. Approximately $20 million of the decline was a reduction in our FAS 5 general reserve due to improved market conditions. The remaining decline is largely due to the resolution of certain delinquent loans in our U.S. portfolio. Total delinquent commercial mortgage loans decreased to $8 million from $137 million last quarter, with no delinquencies in our U.S. portfolio at the end of the third quarter.
The decrease in delinquencies was driven by one loan being paid off at 98%, and the transfer of a high-quality property to our real estate equity portfolio. I should caution that our delinquency numbers will fluctuate over time as challenges remain in the commercial real estate market. Nevertheless, we believe that we will continue to maintain relatively low loss levels and outperform the overall market.
Finally, let me comment on our cash position, which increased from $20.4 billion last quarter to $26.1 billion this quarter. The vast majority of this increase can be attributed to the cash that we are holding for our ALICO purchase. In addition, cash collateral balances relating to our derivative counterparties increased.  Excluding the impact of these two factors, our cash position remains consistent with second quarter levels and is down approximately $4 billion since Investor Day, as we reinvested into higher-yielding assets. In summary, we believe that our portfolio remains well positioned for the current economic environment.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Wheeler."

MetLife reported $0.99 of operating earnings per share per share for the third quarter. This quarter's results include a dilutive impact of $0.08 per share, resulting from the ALICO equity and debt issuance and completed in early August. This morning, I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights, as well as some unusual items which occurred during the quarter.
Let's begin with the top line. Total premiums, fees and other revenues which were $8.6 billion in the third quarter were up 2% from the third quarter of last year, and up 4% when adjusting for closeout sales in both periods. As we have noted before, closeout sales can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and have been adversely impacted by this low interest rate environment.
U.S. Business premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.1 billion were essentially flat as compared to the prior year quarter. This includes a modest decrease in Insurance Products revenue due to Individual Life's 4% decline. Adjusting for a few unusual items recorded in each of the periods, Individual Life's top line was actually down less than 1%.
Group Life premiums were up 2% from the prior year quarter. As you may recall from my second quarter remarks, growth in Group Life is being helped by a change in the financial terms in a large retrospectively rated contract, which resulted in less reinsurance ceded. As this change occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009, the benefit to Group Life top line's growth over the prior four quarters will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year. Overall, Group Insurance revenue continues to be impacted by high unemployment and our unwillingness to chase business at below desired margins or returns.
Also, revenue in Retirement Products increased by 11% due to higher separate account fees from positive net flows and favorable separate account investment returns. Also, Group revenue and Corporate Benefit Funding was down 13% from the prior year quarter, driven by the lower closeout premiums, which I referenced before. Structured settlement premiums remained strong.
Auto & Homes revenues were up by 2%, and MetLife Bank's revenues grew by 11%. International's revenue was up 16% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant-currency basis over the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all three regions and led by Mexico, Korea and Chile.
Operating margins. Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. In U.S. Business, our mortality results were favorable this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 89% versus our estimated range of 90% to 95%, which is a good result. Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 86.7%. This quarter's results were higher than the very favorable prior quarter of 80.4%. That said, the ratio was significantly below the prior year quarter of 91.2% and also below our plan. Overall, another good result.  
At 88% for the third quarter, the Non-Medical Health total benefits ratio was up slightly over the sequential quarter of 87.8%, but favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and well within our Investor Day guidance range of 86% to 90%. Dental underwriting results continue to see stable utilization and favorable pricing trends. Disability margins continue to be below plan, as incidence levels remain elevated and recoveries continue to be below expectations.
Turning to our Auto & Home business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.6% for the quarter, which was up over the prior year quarter's results of 91.1% due to higher catastrophes in the current quarter. The combined ratio, excluding cats, was 88.2% in the third quarter versus 87.7% in the prior year period. A non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve release of $3 million after-tax was taken in this quarter, and that's compared to a $7 million after-tax release from the prior year period.
Moving to investment spreads. We saw continued solid investment spreads this quarter, driven in part by strong variable investment income results. For the quarter, variable investment income after-tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $56 million or $0.06 per share, above the top of the 2010 guidance range. As Steve explained, this was primarily driven by strong private equity returns.
Moving to expenses, our operational excellence initiative continues to prove successful. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 22.5%, which is a solid result and was in the 2010 guidance of 21.8% to 22.5% given at Investor Day.
Turning to our bottom line results, we earned $878 million in operating earnings or $0.99 per share. Included in our third quarter results was an unfavorable market impact of $36 million or $0.04 per share, as the increase of 11% in the S&P 500 this quarter was more than offset by the impact from our variable annuity hedge program. In the second quarter of this year, we had essentially the opposite situation, where a 12% decline in the S&P 500 was more than offset by the results of our hedge program creating a $0.05 favorable market impact in that quarter.
In addition, our total operating taxes of $378 million includes a true-up in our effective tax rate for the year from 27% to 28%, as well as a net tax benefit of several onetime items in the quarter. Overall, the results of various international and domestic tax issues impacted operating earnings by $19 million or $0.02 in the quarter.
With regard to investment gains and losses, in the third quarter, we had after-tax net realized investment losses of $222 million, which includes net investment portfolio losses of $72 million after-tax. Impairments were $64 million after-tax in the third quarter and continued to trend down. In addition, as Rob mentioned, we have sold our Japanese joint venture and announced the sale to our joint venture partner and recorded an impairment, which shows up in realized investment losses.
With regards to derivatives, we had after-tax losses of $190 million. MetLife uses derivatives in connection with its broader portfolio management strategy to hedge a number of risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currencies. The decline in the relative value of the dollar as well as the tightening of MetLife's own credit spread, partially offset by declines in interest rates, resulted in the derivative loss for this quarter. Derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's own credit spread do not have an economic impact on the company.
Our preliminary statutory earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were approximately $850 million, and our preliminary statutory net income was approximately $800 million which is a good result. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company at quarter end were $9.8 billion. Please keep in mind, this total includes the ALICO financing, which we completed in early August and the total was $6.5 billion.
In summary, MetLife had a good third quarter. Our investment performance continue to improve. Our operating margins remain strong by disciplined underwriting and expense management, and our earnings continue to grow.
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Now the way we came up with that calculation, most of that $0.20 is from investment spread compression. But we also did factor in at least a preliminary estimate on how our pension costs might change. And obviously, that will get trued up at year end, given where the stock market is and frankly, where the interest rates are on December 31 because that's how the math works on the pension cost. So that was factored in, Nigel. We did not consider impacts to what I would say top line issues, which are obviously a little harder to quantify. And the most obvious impact of that is where pension closeout sales, which are soft now, and I suspect we don't think we're going to get meaningfully better next year until interest rates start to improve. So that's most of the issue. FX is actually having -- you saw a very, but strong, decline in the value of the dollar versus the yen and the euro this quarter. And the FX impact for international is actually quite modest. I mean, it's a gain but it's less than $0.01. Now with ALICO, that will change and the FX impact will be more pronounced. And so if you think about it, what that really means is ALICO's earnings expressed in dollars are probably going to be stronger, all things considered than we originally estimated because when we announced the deal, we assumed one set of exchange rates and the dollar has weakened since then. So ALICO's earnings impact is going to be better. Now we don't really take the spot rate right now. We look at the, I guess, what we consider to be the forward exchange rate, which where the dollar I think is expected to rally a little bit. So the impact may not be as significant as you might first think. But that will obviously get -- we'll obviously kind of wrap that all up on our guidance for 2011 on Investor Day."

I don't believe that's going to cause us to change our DAC amortization policy or the period of time. Just for everybody's benefit, we would amortize variable annuity back over 20 years. And in our fixed annuity DAC, we would amortize I think also over 20 years. But the way that works is there's a rate guarantee in your deferred annuity contract and what we assume is a pretty big -- when the rate guarantee comes off, the DAC model would assume a pretty big shock lapse, something like crudely 50%. And so most of the DAC is very -- amortization would be very front-end loaded. But if people stay, then the rest of it would run out to 20 years. So that's sort of our policy, and I don't really expect that to change."

We're really quite pleased at the way we've been able to exit our JV in Japan, both for us and quite frankly for our JV partner. This, of course, from our point of view gives us, as I mentioned in my comments, the ability without any distraction to focus 100% on our ALICO business in Japan and that's a good thing. Relative to variable annuity appetite, I think everyone expects from me somewhat of the same comment about variable annuities, and it's the same worldwide as it would be in the United States. And that is we think that there is a terrific need in the savings arena for the type of products and services we can provide, both from the standpoint of the accumulation of assets and the creation of income for Life. We think that's very important. At the same time, we've always said, we do not want to become overly dependent on any one product for our financial health. And I would include variable annuities in that statement, so that the growth opportunities for us worldwide, it varies by country to country. I don't think you would see our growth being driven, for example, 100% by variable annuity sales anywhere. But we do see significant opportunities relative to ALICO. As I've mentioned, our first focus is on bringing home exactly the business that we analyzed and we love so much, the Accident and Health, Life Insurance and so forth. In addition to that, of course, we bring competencies to the ALICO family that they were in some cases precluded from using because of their sister companies at AIG and so forth. And so we're very excited about it. We love the Variable Annuity business. We're not in love with it, but it is a very, very attractive product for our customers worldwide."

Now that we're hopefully going to close the deal very soon, we will put out some revised purchase accounting in an SEC filing, I guess later in November. So you'll get to see the math as it currently stands. It's interesting. It's complex, okay? But the punchline is that you will see some changes in the VOBA, and goodwill balances. A little bit more of the purchase place will end up getting pushed to goodwill versus VOBA. That has the effect of probably improving earnings accretion.

Given where the current interest rate levels are, the margin on the products that we're selling today are below what I would say are our target margins. But I think you've got to think about this business over a cycle. And so earlier in the year when interest rates were higher, margins were good and we were writing at returns that were higher than what our target returns are. So we think over time, as interest rates come back, we'll start to see returns improve close to the target. But we're also going to be taking some steps in 2011 to continue to improve the overall margin in the product and the overall level of return. And so we'll be telling you more about that in the coming months. As it relates to disability, obviously, our disability results continue to be challenged in this quarter. We saw higher incidence levels than we've seen in prior quarters. Our recoveries ticked up a little bit, but it was very, very modest improvement in recoveries. So as a result, the overall loss ratio in disability was pretty high. It was probably one of the highest that we've had over this past cycle. So there's a number of things that we continue to do from an operational perspective to try and improve our Disability business. We're also taking some pricing actions again with both our New business and our Renewal business for 2011. So we're in the market right now with, I would say, high single-digit disability price increases as a way for us to bring in more revenue for the product and begin to get the loss ratios and the margins back to target."

But I think based upon the early results, and it's still a little early in the sales cycle, pricing seems to be moderating a little bit more in this renewal season than it was in a couple of earlier years. And so we think we have a better chance of getting our pricing But what I'll tell you is if we can't, we're not afraid to walk away from business if we don't feel that we can get the right level of margin and begin to get our turns back to the right level."

And so if you collapse them, maybe the most useful way to think about it is let's collapse the two steps and I'll give you sort of the net impact. We'll ultimately have to record an after-tax loss on the sale of this of about $60 million on the sale price of $275 million. Now you'd think well, that's not good. But the $60 million really has more to do with the fact to how we allocated goodwill in the Travelers acquisition five years ago than it has with really the economics of this transaction. We actually expect this transaction to be modestly accretive from an EPS point of view, and we're very pleased with the valuation we received. So there's a little of impairment but that frankly had to do with purchase accounting five years ago than sort of the reality of the situation today."

On the other side, ALICO has very strong relationships with all the banks and the distributors, plus obviously, they have strong independent and captive agency forces in Japan. So it's clear that there is an opportunity there. And as Rob said earlier, I think what this transaction with MSA indeed does for us is it gives us the ability to focus on ALICO in Japan.

That's a really serious question, and I think I'd hesitate to give an off-the-cuff answer. I think we'll do our best on Investor Day to really kind of talk through that issue with people if interest rates stay really low for a long time. But I would say a couple of things. One is, these interest rate floors that we have that we're benefiting from today, obviously, and really are quite a good hedge against this problem. Those are going to be -- the very first one of those I think expires in late in late 2014. And most of them, often they go into 2015 and '16. So those are going to help us or be there to help us for a very long time, and that's a good thing. The second question is obviously, it is an earnings drag if things stay that low for a long period of time. And yes, I do think that will make hitting our long-term ROE targets much more challenging. But the other kind of -- a little bit of a subjective wildcard is this, if we really get convinced that interest rates are going to stay low for a long time, will we start managing the business differently. And I think the answer is absolutely. But how do you quantify that in terms of the numbers, I'm not really sure I can really do today. So I think those are two things to keep in mind as we think about this potential issue."

That's allowing firms to either sell their businesses to other PE firms or industry players or do refinancings and dividending out. So those markets I think are driving a lot of that and people are searching for yield right now as yields are so low. So as of now, at least, those markets are quite robust in helping returns. There's also some valuations being done that are showing improvements based upon higher equity pricing across the board. And that's really taking some very low valuations of a couple of years ago during the crisis and kind of moving them up on the equity methods. Those two things I think are keys. The third probably is concern by people in the private equity world about their tax rates, so accelerating some profits now before their personal tax rates may go up based upon the tax treatment of carried interest. How much of that will go on into 2011? We're still doing some work on that. I'll have some numbers for you on Investor Day. We'll provide you probably a range again like we did last year.
