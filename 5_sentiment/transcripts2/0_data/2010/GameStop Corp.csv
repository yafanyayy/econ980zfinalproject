With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer; Tony Bartel, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; Mike Mauler, our EVP of International; and Rob Lloyd, our Senior V",830,"Good morning, and thank you for attending today's GameStop conference call. With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer; Tony Bartel, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; Mike Mauler, our EVP of International; and Rob Lloyd, our Senior VP of Accounting and acting CFO. As we reported today, January finished strong, and earnings came in at the high end of the range due to better-than-anticipated software sales. As a matter of fact, we gained significant share in both January and February, as our new software grew single digits, compared to double-digit declines for the industry. And we had a record month in February when we sold almost 50% of the new title releases. We attribute this market share increase to the model we have developed which continues to resonate with the value-conscious consumer. Rob will give you more details on the 2009 financial wrap-up.And just as in aside about the industry in 2009, as reported, video game sales declined 9.7% from the prior year. But if you backed at the music genre out of both years, sales were flat with 2008, the highest record software year ever. We expect to see growth in both new and used software in 2010 and it continued gaining market share. Our first quarter should be positive over last year with releases like Final Fantasy XIII, Heavy Rain and many others. Paul will give you more color on this quarter and prognosis for the future.  Based on this release schedule, we forecast earnings growth between 14% and 18% for the year. And Rob will go over the financial details of 2010.Now, I'd like to address some concerns that have been raised while we were in our quiet period. The resignation of our CFO will have no impact on the company. She left for another opportunity. There is nothing wrong with our books or our future outlook. Rob Lloyd has been with us 14 years, and is well-qualified to act in this role.Next, Redbox is testing video game rentals in some markets. Video game rental has always been a channel of distribution in the industry, and I see it as a shift from rental stores to machines if they are successful, and no impact on our sales. There seems to be concern over our used model. The recent promotion we had been giving consumers, an incremental 50% per trade, is in line with other promotions we have done in the past to drive trades post holiday when we were low on inventory. Used USA inventory was down 2% on a per-store basis before we began this offer, And now, it is up. We don't expect it to have a meaningful impact on margin rate in Q1. As an aside, it has worked extremely well, and because of our external marketing of the offer, we are seeing consumers trade with us that never had before. The competition in this used base has diminished with the removal of the trade machines in Best Buy and Wal-Mart, and the closure of Many Game Crazy stores which is part of Hollywood.  And as we discussed last quarter, our margin rates will be impacted by a mix, as less mature company countries ramp up to use gain penetration. Rob will discuss this in more detail.We have been asked why we are continuing to add more stores. First, we see many opportunity to add stores in markets where we have no presence. And albeit some rare circumstances, we open stores to take share from our competitors and not cannibalize our stores. This is translated to a continuous market share growth. And the returns on these stores are fantastic, and they continue to overachieve our financial model. Paul will give you more on this model. Now I'd like to switch and discuss some strategies that we unveiled last fall at the BMO conference. Beginning later this quarter, we'll be testing the marketing of downloadable add-on content and its acquisition right in the retail store. This project has been worked on with our internal IT team and Microsoft. We have great expectations for our ability to drive sales of downloadable add-on content for the industry, and see it as a meaningful way to participate in digital sales. In May, we will be testing a new loyalty program that is designed to increase our share of boxed product sales, increase our knowledge of our customers' purchasing preferences, and allow us to better serve and recommend products to our consumers today and in the future.  And last year, we announced the acquisition of a browser game publisher, Jolt. Beginning this month, you will see marketing in our stores to drive traffic to their game, Legends of Zork. We see this test as another meaningful way we can participate in the growing browser game category, and we'll use key learnings from the test to drive traffic to other publishers' browser games. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a more detailed financial review."

Today I will begin with a recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 year-end results. And then I will provide our initial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2010. Total sales increased 0.9% to $3.52 billion.",1056,"Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Today I will begin with a recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 year-end results. And then I will provide our initial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2010. Total sales increased 0.9% to $3.52 billion. Net earnings were $215.9 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, which was at the high end of the revised guidance of $1.25 to $1.29 per share communicated on January 7. Comparable store sales declined 7.9%. The result of hardware price cuts but better than our revised guidance due to solid sell-through of titles released in January. During the quarter, new software sales increased 5.2% primarily on the strength of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and the strong sales of titles released in January, including Mass Effect 2, Army of Two: The 40th Day, Dark Ciders and MAG. GameStop's fourth quarter new software market share was 140 basis points higher than Q4 2008. Used product sales increased 8.8%, as budget-conscious customers continue to utilize our buy-sell trade model. New hardware sale declined 9.2% during the fourth quarter, largely due to the hardware price cuts as well as shortages on the Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii.Gross margins improved 80 basis points as our product mix shifted from low-margin hardware sales to higher margin new and used software sales. The used software margin rate was flat as margin improvements in the U.S., due to one fewer promotion during the quarter, were offset by lower margin European used sales, which were a greater percentage of the company's total used sales. Looking at select financials for full year 2009, total sales increased 3.1% to $9.08 billion, while comparable store sales decreased 7.9%. Net earnings were $377.3 million, and diluted earnings per share were $2.25, including debt retirement costs of $0.02 per share.Gross margins improved 100 basis points as our product mix shifted from low-margin hardware sales to higher margin used software sales. SG&A expenses on a per store basis increased 150 basis points, driven primarily by deleveraging fixed costs due to the negative same-store sales.Moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2009 with a strong balance sheet having over $905 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 5.8% on a per store basis year-over-year, and in the U.S., our average inventory per store is approximately $20,000 lower than at the start of fiscal 2009. This change is due to inventory management efforts in light of lower-than-expected sales. We have heard concern about a possible buildup in used inventory. In 2009, company used sales increased 18%, while used inventory per store increased only 13%. In addition, there's some concern about the price we pay for our used games. In 2009, GameStop paid an average price of $7.61 for used game, so you can see that they have a very low cost basis.Now regarding cash flow. GameStop delivered net cash flow of $327 million in 2009. As you may recall in January, we announced our $300 million share repurchase program as part of our 2010 capital allocation plan. As of today, GameStop has purchased 12,642,200 shares at an average price of $19.56 or $247 million worth of stock. GameStop is committed to returning excess cash to shareholders going forward, assuming the company continues to generate cash at current levels. 2009 capital expenditures totaled $164 million, a year-over-year decrease of 11%, mainly from opening fewer stores worldwide as we open 388 stores, compared to 674 in 2008. Net net, we ended the year with 98 additional stores in the U.S. and 145 international. 2010 financial outlook. We are confident in our ability to deliver a year of top and bottom line growth. Full year 2010 revenues are projected to grow between 4% and 6%, with comparable store sales ranging from flat to plus 2%. As a reminder, hardware price points are significantly lower than at this time last year. The Wii is priced 20% less and the PS3 is 25% less. This will put significant pressure on our comparable store sales number until we anniversary these price cuts. We expect the U.S. software market to be flat to up 2%. Earnings per share for the full year are projected to range from $2.58 to $2.68, representing an EPS growth rate of 14% to 18%, based on 2009 EPS of $2.27 which excludes the debt retirement costs. Operating margins are expected to improve 10 to 20 basis points as we gained 50 basis points of margin improvements, offset by increases in SG&A expenses to support our strategic initiatives in digital and loyalty. We expect used margin rates for the year to be in a range of 46% to 49%. As the growing, immature European Used business continues to contribute a greater share of our overall sales mix, the company used margin rate will be impacted. Our efforts to roll out best practices internationally in used inventory and margin management will continue through 2010. The 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be between 36% and 37%, depreciation should range from $171 million to $174 million and net interest expense should range from $39 million to $41 million. Our 2010 $217 million capital expenditure budget calls for 400 new store openings, improvements to existing stores in order to improve the customer experience, information systems support, refurbishment upgrades, distribution expansion and digital and loyalty program development and enhancements. We expect to end fiscal 2010 with approximately $900 million in cash, and expect to generate approximately $600 million in cash flow from operations. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, GameStop expects first quarter comparable store sales to range from negative 3% to flat. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.46 to $0.48, a 7% to 12% increase, compared to $0.43, excluding debt retirement costs in the prior-year quarter. This forecasted growth comes on top of last year's record first quarter net earnings of $70 million. Over the first six weeks of the first quarter of 2010, we have been excited by the strength of new releases, including Bioshock 2, Dante's Inferno, Heavy Rain, Final Fantasy XIII and Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as well as the performance of our Used business. We are still being challenged by Wii and PlayStation 3 hardware shortages. Now, I will turn it over to Paul for his comments."

I would like to add some color to our progress in 2009 and discuss the drivers of sales for the first half. On the real estate front, Rob noted that we added 388 stores in 2009 in the United States and internationally. As we have pointed out",905,"Thanks, Rob. I would like to add some color to our progress in 2009 and discuss the drivers of sales for the first half. On the real estate front, Rob noted that we added 388 stores in 2009 in the United States and internationally. As we have pointed out on prior calls, our new store performance continues to be very favorable, with the portfolio well exceeding our internal return targets. Our U.S. returns approached 45% in the first and 95% by the third year of store operation. Based on our continued market share gains, we see that our ability to identify voids in markets allows us to bring the GameStop model to more consumers and gain market share from competitors. We estimate that our 2009 U.S. store openings added significant new product market share. We've analyzed the financial contribution of all our stores built during the last three years, and have found that those stores contributed $0.66 per share in earnings in 2009, making this the best possible investment for our shareholders. The return on invested capital in our entire portfolio continues to be well above our cost of capital. Consumers continue to respond to the GameStop ecosystem, we continue to gain share and our store investments continue to be a productive strategy.As Dan mentioned, we continue to gain share on titles released in January and February, thanks to our unique title launch model. We have expanded our successful go-big strategy to maximize these title launches with integrated customer exclusives, in-store launch events, public relations and media buys. We have also planned compelling offers to drive the use of trade currency and increase our day one market share on these new title launches. Consumers respond to the unparalleled value offered by the buy-sell trade ecosystem, and we continue to be the destination of choice for the new game buyer.We have received some questions on DRM and publisher actions to limit resale value of new titles. Through our years in the Used business, we have learned that the secondhand user is a value-oriented consumer. The average price of a used Xbox game is $20, so we don't believe that a $10 add-on piece of downloadable content is compelling to a used game buyer.  We are encouraging publishers to offer add-on content for new titles at a higher price, and then a lower-price option for used games. In fact, publishers can participate in our used business by offering add-on content for the most popular used titles, creating a win-win situation for publishers, retailers and consumers. GameStop will also assist in expanding the sales of DLC, as we can market and execute the sale right in our stores to the millions of customers coming through our doors.For the rest of the first half, we see a strong title line up. We believe we are well-positioned to drive high share on new title launches, with solid expectations for God of War III, UFC 2010, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Lost Planet 2 among other titles. On the handheld front, we expect a strong launch of the DSi XL.In hardware, we continue to see tightness of supply, but are working with our console manufacturers to accelerate through our supply chain any inventory that becomes available.In terms of the Sony Move motion controller and Microsoft Project Natal, we are optimistic about the opportunity for these devices to transform the gaming experience on these consoles. We have seen the gameplay on both technologies, and are working closely with the manufacturers to make sure GameStop will be the destination for both.  Title development and product availability for both accessories will be critical for their success.Dan mentioned the implementation of strategies outlined at the BMO Conference in November. As a reminder, GameStop began a strategic review close to 18 months ago, and the resulting investments of that process are beginning to arrive at market in 2010. Our customers and associates are excited about a loyalty program that will be unique for video game retailing, browser game promotions and sale of downloadable add-on content in-store. The key point for you to understand about the evolution of our strategy is that it will allow consumers to discover digital gaming through the most powerful element in this business: A knowledgeable, passionate GameStop associate, with unique knowledge of gaming to provide expert advice to the gaming enthusiast.We have demonstrated in the past that the assisted sales marketing environment in our stores leads to high attachment rates for accessories, magazine subscriptions, strategy guides and Xbox Live, PlayStation and Nintendo network point cards. In fact, if you look at our network point cards, digital game downloads, POSA [point of sale activation] and World of Warcraft time cards, we generated $170 million in digital sales in 2009, representing a 55% growth rate over 2008. Digital content will become a seamless add-on sale when it is recommended by your game adviser, and we will eliminate much of the friction that has existed in the digital world. You will also see the arrival of digital kiosks, known as the Interactive Gaming Guide, in over 1,700 stores that will assist our customers and associates in driving digital sales. We will also bring the power of our buy-sell trade model to these digital sales.In closing, I would like to thank all our GameStop associates in 17 countries for their passionate commitment to the video game consumer during 2009. And now, open it up for questions."

We do believe that we will come into stock quicker than the PS3. So we do anticipate that, that should -- those shortages should have made some time before the next couple of months.

In terms of activation codes, in fact we just had a contingency get back from Destination PlayStation. We just arrived last night. Obviously we talked with all of our major publishing partners on this area. And there is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement for GameStop to be selling DLC in their stores. The concern that the publishers have is, they provide great content that like Dan said earlier, their biggest opportunity is to have that discovered. And we believe there's no other way to discover it than to have people who are actively using it, assist customers who want to know about it and sell that in the stores. So there is a lot of excitement about that. The relationship with the platform holders is also very good and we are making great strides in that. We talked about Microsoft. We believe that a Sony decision is imminent, and we will work with that as well. In terms of the percent of gains that offer that, it's relatively small at this point and that in terms of the DLC that has been added on. However, due to the strong online component that is being added to practically every game and given the opportunity that they see ahead of them, what we heard this week is that most publishers are looking to accelerate the percent of games that they developed DLC for. And we're clearly encouraging that trend, as we believe that it's a great augmentation for the gamer."

It's probably the most successful video game loyalty program in existence. If you look at Micromania as we did early on, 86% of their transactions have a Megacarte ID associated with them. Megacarte is not only a loyalty program, it becomes a launch device and a vehicle, it becomes a marketing vehicle, even helps you decide where to put new stores as a real estate vehicle. We believe that the loyalty program at Micromania drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe that we see. So we think it's a very effective program. And that's the base for what we added to our existing loyalty program here at the Edge. How will ours be different? Our program will build heavily on what you see at Micromania today, but it will add some very significant pieces. Our marketing team has done extensive surveys of the kinds of rewards consumers are looking for. If you recall on one of our previous calls or one of our conferences, we talked about the fact that we did an Internet survey and had to shut down the response engine because there was so much interest in the GameStop loyalty program. Ours will have different rewards, it won't be purely a markdown program that gives you discounts once you reach a certain threshold. It will also have unique rewards like tickets to shows and early entrance to a midnight launch, et cetera. So we think that it builds on what we have from Micromania, but it really adds a lot of sophisticated consumer insights to monetize that GameStop consumer.

With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer; Tony Bartel, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; Mike Mauler, our EVP of International; and Rob Lloyd, our Senior V",829,"Good morning, and thank you for attending today's GameStop conference call. With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer; Tony Bartel, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; Mike Mauler, our EVP of International; and Rob Lloyd, our Senior VP of Accounting and acting CFO. As we reported today, January finished strong, and earnings came in at the high end of the range due to better-than-anticipated software sales. As a matter of fact, we gained significant share in both January and February, as our new software grew single digits, compared to double-digit declines for the industry. And we had a record month in February when we sold almost 50% of the new title releases. We attribute this market share increase to the model we have developed which continues to resonate with the value-conscious consumer. Rob will give you more details on the 2009 financial wrap-up.And just as in aside about the industry in 2009, as reported, video game sales declined 9.7% from the prior year. But if you backed at the music genre out of both years, sales were flat with 2008, the highest record software year ever. We expect to see growth in both new and used software in 2010 and it continued gaining market share. Our first quarter should be positive over last year with releases like Final Fantasy XIII, Heavy Rain and many others. Paul will give you more color on this quarter and prognosis for the future.  Based on this release schedule, we forecast earnings growth between 14% and 18% for the year. And Rob will go over the financial details of 2010.Now, I'd like to address some concerns that have been raised while we were in our quiet period. The resignation of our CFO will have no impact on the company. She left for another opportunity. There is nothing wrong with our books or our future outlook. Rob Lloyd has been with us 14 years, and is well-qualified to act in this role.Next, Redbox is testing video game rentals in some markets. Video game rental has always been a channel of distribution in the industry, and I see it as a shift from rental stores to machines if they are successful, and no impact on our sales. There seems to be concern over our used model. The recent promotion we had been giving consumers, an incremental 50% per trade, is in line with other promotions we have done in the past to drive trades post holiday when we were low on inventory. Used USA inventory was down 2% on a per-store basis before we began this offer, And now, it is up. We don't expect it to have a meaningful impact on margin rate in Q1. As an aside, it has worked extremely well, and because of our external marketing of the offer, we are seeing consumers trade with us that never had before. The competition in this used base has diminished with the removal of the trade machines in Best Buy and Wal-Mart, and the closure of many Game Crazy stores which is part of Hollywood. And as we discussed last quarter, our margin rates will be impacted by mix, as less mature company countries ramp up their used game penetration. Rob will discuss this in more detail.We have been asked why we are continuing to add more stores. First, we see many opportunity to add stores in markets where we have no presence. And albeit some rare circumstances, we open stores to take share from our competitors and not cannibalize our stores. This is translated to a continuous market share growth. And the returns on these stores are fantastic, and they continue to overachieve our financial model. Paul will give you more on this model. Now I'd like to switch and discuss some strategies that we unveiled last fall at the BMO conference. Beginning later this quarter, we'll be testing the marketing of downloadable add-on content and its acquisition right in the retail store. This project has been worked on with our internal IT team and Microsoft. We have great expectations for our ability to drive sales of downloadable add-on content for the industry, and see it as a meaningful way to participate in digital sales. In May, we will be testing a new loyalty program that is designed to increase our share of boxed product sales, increase our knowledge of our customers' purchasing preferences, and allow us to better serve and recommend products to our consumers today and in the future. And last year, we announced the acquisition of a browser game publisher, Jolt. Beginning this month, you will see marketing in our stores to drive traffic to their game, Legends of Zork. We see this test as another meaningful way we can participate in the growing browser game category, and we'll use key learnings from the test to drive traffic to other publishers' browser games. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a more detailed financial review."

And then I will provide our initial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2010. Total sales increased 0.9% to $3.52 billion. Net earnings were $215.9 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, which was at the high end of the revised guidance of $1.25 to $1.29 per share communicated on January 7. Comparable store sales declined 7.9%. The result of hardware price cuts but better than our revised guidance due to solid sell-through of titles released in January. During the quarter, new software sales increased 5.2% primarily on the strength of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and the strong sales of titles released in January, including Mass Effect 2, Army of Two: The 40th Day, Darksiders and MAG. GameStop's fourth quarter new software market share was 140 basis points higher than Q4 2008. Used product sales increased 8.8%, as budget-conscious customers continue to utilize our buy-sell trade model. New hardware sales declined 9.2% during the fourth quarter, largely due to the hardware price cuts as well as shortages on the Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii.Gross margins improved 80 basis points as our product mix shifted from low-margin hardware sales to higher margin new and used software sales. The used software margin rate was flat as margin improvements in the U.S., due to one fewer promotion during the quarter, were offset by lower margin European used sales, which were a greater percentage of the company's total used sales. Looking at select financials for full year 2009, total sales increased 3.1% to $9.08 billion, while comparable store sales decreased 7.9%. Net earnings were $377.3 million, and diluted earnings per share were $2.25, including debt retirement costs of $0.03 per share.Gross margins improved 100 basis points as our product mix shifted from low-margin hardware sales to higher margin used software sales. SG&A expenses on a per store basis increased 150 basis points, driven primarily by deleveraging fixed costs due to the negative same-store sales.Moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2009 with a strong balance sheet having over $905 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 5.8% on a per store basis year-over-year, and in the U.S., our average inventory per store is approximately $20,000 lower than at the start of fiscal 2009. This change is due to inventory management efforts in light of lower-than-expected sales. We have heard concern about a possible buildup in used inventory. In 2009, company used sales increased 18%, while used inventory per store increased only 13%. In addition, there's some concern about the price we pay for our used games. In 2009, GameStop paid an average price of $7.61 for used game, so you can see that they have a very low cost basis.Now regarding cash flow. GameStop delivered net cash flow of $327 million in 2009. As you may recall in January, we announced our $300 million share repurchase program as part of our 2010 capital allocation plan. As of today, GameStop has purchased 12,642,200 shares at an average price of $19.56 or $247 million worth of stock. GameStop is committed to returning excess cash to shareholders going forward, assuming the company continues to generate cash at current levels. 2009 capital expenditures totaled $164 million, a year-over-year decrease of 11%, mainly from opening fewer stores worldwide as we open 388 stores, compared to 674 in 2008. Net net, we ended the year with 98 additional stores in the U.S. and 145 internationally. 2010 financial outlook. We are confident in our ability to deliver a year of top and bottom line growth. Full year 2010 revenues are projected to grow between 4% and 6%, with comparable store sales ranging from flat to plus 2%. As a reminder, hardware price points are significantly lower than at this time last year. The Wii is priced 20% less and the PS3 is 25% less. This will put significant pressure on our comparable store sales number until we anniversary these price cuts. We expect the U.S. software market to be flat to up 2%. Earnings per share for the full year are projected to range from $2.58 to $2.68, representing an EPS growth rate of 14% to 18%, based on 2009 EPS of $2.27, which excludes the debt retirement costs. Operating margins are expected to improve 10 to 20 basis points as we gained 50 basis points of margin improvements, offset by increases in SG&A expenses to support our strategic initiatives in digital and loyalty. We expect used margin rates for the year to be in a range of 46% to 49%. As the growing, immature European Used business continues to contribute a greater share of our overall sales mix, the company used margin rate will be impacted. Our efforts to roll out best practices internationally in used inventory and margin management will continue through 2010. The 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be between 36% and 37%, depreciation should range from $171 million to $174 million and net interest expense should range from $39 million to $41 million. Our 2010 $217 million capital expenditure budget calls for 400 new store openings, improvements to existing stores in order to improve the customer experience, information systems support, refurbishment upgrades, distribution expansion and digital and loyalty program development and enhancements. We expect to end fiscal 2010 with approximately $900 million in cash, and expect to generate approximately $600 million in cash flow from operations. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, GameStop expects first quarter comparable store sales to range from negative 3% to flat. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.46 to $0.48, a 7% to 12% increase, compared to $0.43, excluding debt retirement costs in the prior-year quarter. This forecasted growth comes on top of last year's record first quarter net earnings of $70 million. Over the first six weeks of the first quarter of 2010, we have been excited by the strength of new releases, including Bioshock 2, Dante's Inferno, Heavy Rain, Final Fantasy XIII and Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as well as the performance of our Used business. We are still being challenged by Wii and PlayStation 3 hardware shortages. Now, I will turn it over to Paul for his comments."

On the real estate front, Rob noted that we added 388 stores in 2009 in the United States and internationally. As we have pointed",907,"Thanks, Rob. I would now like to add some color to our progress in 2009 and discuss the drivers of sales for the first half. On the real estate front, Rob noted that we added 388 stores in 2009 in the United States and internationally. As we have pointed out on prior calls, our new store performance continues to be very favorable, with the portfolio well exceeding our internal return targets. Our U.S. returns approached 45% in the first year and 95% by the third year of store operation. Based on our continued market share gains, we see that our ability to identify voids in markets allows us to bring the GameStop model to more consumers and gain market share from competitors. We estimate that our 2009 U.S. store openings added significant new product market share. We've analyzed the financial contribution of all our stores built during the last three years, and have found that those stores contributed $0.66 per share in earnings in 2009, making this the best possible investment for our shareholders. The return on invested capital in our entire portfolio continues to be well above our cost of capital. Consumers continue to respond to the GameStop ecosystem, we continue to gain share and our store investments continue to be a productive strategy.As Dan mentioned, we continue to gain share on titles released in January and February, thanks to our unique title launch model. We have expanded our successful go-big strategy to maximize these title launches with integrated customer exclusives, in-store launch events, public relations and media buys. We have also planned compelling offers to drive the use of trade currency and increase our day one market share on these new title launches. Consumers respond to the unparalleled value offered by the buy-sell trade ecosystem, and we continue to be the destination of choice for the new game buyer.We have received some questions on DRM and publisher actions to limit resale value of new titles. Through our years in the Used business, we have learned that the secondhand user is a value-oriented consumer. The average price of a used Xbox game is $20, so we don't believe that a $10 add-on piece of downloadable content is compelling to a used game buyer.  We are encouraging publishers to offer add-on content for new titles at a higher price, and then a lower-price option for used games. In fact, publishers can participate in our used business by offering add-on content for the most popular used titles, creating a win-win situation for publishers, retailers and consumers. GameStop will also assist in expanding the sales of DLC, as we can market and execute the sale right in our stores to the millions of customers coming through our doors.For the rest of the first half, we see a strong title line up. We believe we are well-positioned to drive high share on new title launches, with solid expectations for God of War III, UFC 2010, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Lost Planet 2 among other titles. On the handheld front, we expect a strong launch of the DSi XL.In hardware, we continue to see tightness of supply, but are working with our console manufacturers to accelerate through our supply chain any inventory that becomes available.In terms of the Sony Move motion controller and Microsoft Project Natal, we are optimistic about the opportunity for these devices to transform the gaming experience on these consoles. We have seen the gameplay on both technologies, and are working closely with the manufacturers to make sure GameStop will be the destination for both.  Title development and product availability for both accessories will be critical for their success.Dan mentioned the implementation of strategies outlined at the BMO Conference in November. As a reminder, GameStop began a strategic review close to 18 months ago, and the resulting investments of that process are beginning to arrive at market in 2010. Our customers and associates are excited about a loyalty program that will be unique for video game retailing, browser game promotions and sale of downloadable add-on content in-store. The key point for you to understand about the evolution of our strategy is that it will allow consumers to discover digital gaming through the most powerful element in this business: A knowledgeable, passionate GameStop associate, with unique knowledge of gaming to provide expert advice to the gaming enthusiast.We have demonstrated in the past that the assisted sales marketing environment in our stores leads to high attachment rates for accessories, magazine subscriptions, strategy guides and Xbox Live, PlayStation and Nintendo network point cards. In fact, if you look at our network point cards, digital game downloads, POSA [point of sale activation] and World of Warcraft time cards, we generated $170 million in digital sales in 2009, representing a 55% growth rate over 2008. Digital content will become a seamless add-on sale when it is recommended by your game adviser, and we will eliminate much of the friction that has existed in the digital world. You will also see the arrival of digital kiosks, known as the Interactive Gaming Guide, in over 1,700 stores that will assist our customers and associates in driving digital sales. We will also bring the power of our buy-sell trade model to these digital sales.In closing, I would like to thank all our GameStop associates in 17 countries for their passionate commitment to the video game consumer during 2009. And now, open it up for questions."

In terms of activation codes, in fact we just had a contingency get back from Destination PlayStation. We just arrived last night. Obviously we talked with all of our major publishing partners on this area. And there is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement for GameStop to be selling DLC in their stores. The concern that the publishers have is, they provide great content that like Dan said earlier, their biggest opportunity is to have that discovered. And we believe there's no better way to discover it than to have people who are actively using it, assist customers who want to know about it and sell that in the stores. So there is a lot of excitement about that. The relationship with the platform holders is also very good and we are making great strides in that. We talked about Microsoft. We believe that a Sony decision is imminent, and we will work with that as well. In terms of the percent of gains that offer that, it's relatively small at this point and that in terms of the DLC that has been added on. However, due to the strong online component that is being added to practically every game and given the opportunity that they see ahead of them, what we heard this week is that most publishers are looking to accelerate the percent of games that they developed DLC for. And we're clearly encouraging that trend, as we believe that it's a great augmentation for the gamer."

It's probably the most successful video game loyalty program in existence. If you look at Micromania as we did early on, 86% of their transactions have a Megacarte ID associated with them. Megacarte is not only a loyalty program, it becomes a launch device and a vehicle, it becomes a marketing vehicle, even helps you decide where to put new stores as a real estate vehicle. We believe that the loyalty program at Micromania drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe that we see. So we think it's a very effective program. And that's the base for what we added to our existing loyalty program here at the Edge. How will ours be different? Our program will build heavily on what you see at Micromania today, but it will add some very significant pieces. Our marketing team has done extensive surveys of the kinds of rewards consumers are looking for. If you recall on one of our previous calls or one of our conferences, we talked about the fact that we did an Internet survey and had to shut down the response engine because there was so much interest in the GameStop loyalty program. Ours will have different rewards, it won't be purely a markdown program that gives you discounts once you reach a certain threshold. It will also have unique rewards like tickets to shows and early entrance to a midnight launch, et cetera. So we think that it builds on what we have from Micromania, but it really adds a lot of sophisticated consumer insights to monetize that GameStop consumer. And it brings unique rewards that only GameStop can bring you, so we like our plan on that."

With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer; Tony Bartel, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; Mike Mauler, our EVP of International; and Rob Lloyd, our Senior VP of Accounting and acting CFO. As we reported today, January finished strong, and earnings came in at the high end of the range due to better-than-anticipated software sales. As a matter of fact, we gained significant share in both January and February, as our new software grew single digits, compared to double-digit declines for the industry. And we had a record month in February when we sold almost 50% of the new title releases. We attribute this market share increase to the model we have developed which continues to resonate with the value-conscious consumer. Rob will give you more details on the 2009 financial wrap-up.And just as in aside about the industry in 2009, as reported, video game sales declined 9.7% from the prior year. But if you backed at the music genre out of both years, sales were flat with 2008, the highest record software year ever. We expect to see growth in both new and used software in 2010 and it continued gaining market share. Our first quarter should be positive over last year with releases like Final Fantasy XIII, Heavy Rain and many others. Paul will give you more color on this quarter and prognosis for the future.  Based on this release schedule, we forecast earnings growth between 14% and 18% for the year. And Rob will go over the financial details of 2010.Now, I'd like to address some concerns that have been raised while we were in our quiet period. The resignation of our CFO will have no impact on the company. She left for another opportunity. There is nothing wrong with our books or our future outlook. Rob Lloyd has been with us 14 years, and is well-qualified to act in this role.Next, Redbox is testing video game rentals in some markets. Video game rental has always been a channel of distribution in the industry, and I see it as a shift from rental stores to machines if they are successful, and no impact on our sales. There seems to be concern over our used model. The recent promotion we had been giving consumers, an incremental 50% per trade, is in line with other promotions we have done in the past to drive trades post holiday when we were low on inventory. Used USA inventory was down 2% on a per-store basis before we began this offer, And now, it is up. We don't expect it to have a meaningful impact on margin rate in Q1. As an aside, it has worked extremely well, and because of our external marketing of the offer, we are seeing consumers trade with us that never had before. The competition in this used base has diminished with the removal of the trade machines in Best Buy and Wal-Mart, and the closure of many Game Crazy stores which is part of Hollywood. And as we discussed last quarter, our margin rates will be impacted by mix, as less mature company countries ramp up their used game penetration. Rob will discuss this in more detail.We have been asked why we are continuing to add more stores. First, we see many opportunity to add stores in markets where we have no presence. And albeit some rare circumstances, we open stores to take share from our competitors and not cannibalize our stores. This is translated to a continuous market share growth. And the returns on these stores are fantastic, and they continue to overachieve our financial model. Paul will give you more on this model. Now I'd like to switch and discuss some strategies that we unveiled last fall at the BMO conference. Beginning later this quarter, we'll be testing the marketing of downloadable add-on content and its acquisition right in the retail store. This project has been worked on with our internal IT team and Microsoft. We have great expectations for our ability to drive sales of downloadable add-on content for the industry, and see it as a meaningful way to participate in digital sales. In May, we will be testing a new loyalty program that is designed to increase our share of boxed product sales, increase our knowledge of our customers' purchasing preferences, and allow us to better serve and recommend products to our consumers today and in the future. And last year, we announced the acquisition of a browser game publisher, Jolt. Beginning this month, you will see marketing in our stores to drive traffic to their game, Legends of Zork. We see this test as another meaningful way we can participate in the growing browser game category, and we'll use key learnings from the test to drive traffic to other publishers' browser games. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a more detailed financial review."

Today I will begin with a recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 year-end results. And then I will provide our initial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2010. Total sales increased 0.9% to $3.52 billion.",1055,"Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Today I will begin with a recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 year-end results. And then I will provide our initial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2010. Total sales increased 0.9% to $3.52 billion. Net earnings were $215.9 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, which was at the high end of the revised guidance of $1.25 to $1.29 per share communicated on January 7. Comparable store sales declined 7.9%. The result of hardware price cuts but better than our revised guidance due to solid sell-through of titles released in January. During the quarter, new software sales increased 5.2% primarily on the strength of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and the strong sales of titles released in January, including Mass Effect 2, Army of Two: The 40th Day, Darksiders and MAG. GameStop's fourth quarter new software market share was 140 basis points higher than Q4 2008. Used product sales increased 8.8%, as budget-conscious customers continue to utilize our buy-sell trade model. New hardware sales declined 9.2% during the fourth quarter, largely due to the hardware price cuts as well as shortages on the Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii.Gross margins improved 80 basis points as our product mix shifted from low-margin hardware sales to higher margin new and used software sales. The used software margin rate was flat as margin improvements in the U.S., due to one fewer promotion during the quarter, were offset by lower margin European used sales, which were a greater percentage of the company's total used sales. Looking at select financials for full year 2009, total sales increased 3.1% to $9.08 billion, while comparable store sales decreased 7.9%. Net earnings were $377.3 million, and diluted earnings per share were $2.25, including debt retirement costs of $0.03 per share.Gross margins improved 100 basis points as our product mix shifted from low-margin hardware sales to higher margin used software sales. SG&A expenses on a per store basis increased 150 basis points, driven primarily by deleveraging fixed costs due to the negative same-store sales.Moving to the balance sheet. We ended 2009 with a strong balance sheet having over $905 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 5.8% on a per store basis year-over-year, and in the U.S., our average inventory per store is approximately $20,000 lower than at the start of fiscal 2009. This change is due to inventory management efforts in light of lower-than-expected sales. We have heard concern about a possible buildup in used inventory. In 2009, company used sales increased 18%, while used inventory per store increased only 13%. In addition, there's some concern about the price we pay for our used games. In 2009, GameStop paid an average price of $7.61 for used game, so you can see that they have a very low cost basis.Now regarding cash flow. GameStop delivered net cash flow of $327 million in 2009. As you may recall in January, we announced our $300 million share repurchase program as part of our 2010 capital allocation plan. As of today, GameStop has purchased 12,642,200 shares at an average price of $19.56 or $247 million worth of stock. GameStop is committed to returning excess cash to shareholders going forward, assuming the company continues to generate cash at current levels. 2009 capital expenditures totaled $164 million, a year-over-year decrease of 11%, mainly from opening fewer stores worldwide as we open 388 stores, compared to 674 in 2008. Net net, we ended the year with 98 additional stores in the U.S. and 145 internationally. 2010 financial outlook. We are confident in our ability to deliver a year of top and bottom line growth. Full year 2010 revenues are projected to grow between 4% and 6%, with comparable store sales ranging from flat to plus 2%. As a reminder, hardware price points are significantly lower than at this time last year. The Wii is priced 20% less and the PS3 is 25% less. This will put significant pressure on our comparable store sales number until we anniversary these price cuts. We expect the U.S. software market to be flat to up 2%. Earnings per share for the full year are projected to range from $2.58 to $2.68, representing an EPS growth rate of 14% to 18%, based on 2009 EPS of $2.27, which excludes the debt retirement costs. Operating margins are expected to improve 10 to 20 basis points as we gained 50 basis points of margin improvements, offset by increases in SG&A expenses to support our strategic initiatives in digital and loyalty. We expect used margin rates for the year to be in a range of 46% to 49%. As the growing, immature European Used business continues to contribute a greater share of our overall sales mix, the company used margin rate will be impacted. Our efforts to roll out best practices internationally in used inventory and margin management will continue through 2010. The 2010 effective tax rate is expected to be between 36% and 37%, depreciation should range from $171 million to $174 million and net interest expense should range from $39 million to $41 million. Our 2010 $217 million capital expenditure budget calls for 400 new store openings, improvements to existing stores in order to improve the customer experience, information systems support, refurbishment upgrades, distribution expansion and digital and loyalty program development and enhancements. We expect to end fiscal 2010 with approximately $900 million in cash, and expect to generate approximately $600 million in cash flow from operations. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, GameStop expects first quarter comparable store sales to range from negative 3% to flat. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.46 to $0.48, a 7% to 12% increase, compared to $0.43, excluding debt retirement costs in the prior-year quarter. This forecasted growth comes on top of last year's record first quarter net earnings of $70 million. Over the first six weeks of the first quarter of 2010, we have been excited by the strength of new releases, including Bioshock 2, Dante's Inferno, Heavy Rain, Final Fantasy XIII and Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as well as the performance of our Used business. We are still being challenged by Wii and PlayStation 3 hardware shortages. Now, I will turn it over to Paul for his comments."

I would now like to add some color to our progress in 2009 and discuss the drivers of sales for the first half. On the real estate front, Rob noted that we added 388 stores in 2009 in the United States and internationally. As we have pointed",907,"Thanks, Rob. I would now like to add some color to our progress in 2009 and discuss the drivers of sales for the first half. On the real estate front, Rob noted that we added 388 stores in 2009 in the United States and internationally. As we have pointed out on prior calls, our new store performance continues to be very favorable, with the portfolio well exceeding our internal return targets. Our U.S. returns approached 45% in the first year and 95% by the third year of store operation. Based on our continued market share gains, we see that our ability to identify voids in markets allows us to bring the GameStop model to more consumers and gain market share from competitors. We estimate that our 2009 U.S. store openings added significant new product market share. We've analyzed the financial contribution of all our stores built during the last three years, and have found that those stores contributed $0.66 per share in earnings in 2009, making this the best possible investment for our shareholders. The return on invested capital in our entire portfolio continues to be well above our cost of capital. Consumers continue to respond to the GameStop ecosystem, we continue to gain share and our store investments continue to be a productive strategy.As Dan mentioned, we continue to gain share on titles released in January and February, thanks to our unique title launch model. We have expanded our successful go-big strategy to maximize these title launches with integrated customer exclusives, in-store launch events, public relations and media buys. We have also planned compelling offers to drive the use of trade currency and increase our day one market share on these new title launches. Consumers respond to the unparalleled value offered by the buy-sell trade ecosystem, and we continue to be the destination of choice for the new game buyer.We have received some questions on DRM and publisher actions to limit resale value of new titles. Through our years in the Used business, we have learned that the secondhand user is a value-oriented consumer. The average price of a used Xbox game is $20, so we don't believe that a $10 add-on piece of downloadable content is compelling to a used game buyer.  We are encouraging publishers to offer add-on content for new titles at a higher price, and then a lower-price option for used games. In fact, publishers can participate in our used business by offering add-on content for the most popular used titles, creating a win-win situation for publishers, retailers and consumers. GameStop will also assist in expanding the sales of DLC, as we can market and execute the sale right in our stores to the millions of customers coming through our doors.For the rest of the first half, we see a strong title line up. We believe we are well-positioned to drive high share on new title launches, with solid expectations for God of War III, UFC 2010, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Lost Planet 2 among other titles. On the handheld front, we expect a strong launch of the DSi XL.In hardware, we continue to see tightness of supply, but are working with our console manufacturers to accelerate through our supply chain any inventory that becomes available.In terms of the Sony Move motion controller and Microsoft Project Natal, we are optimistic about the opportunity for these devices to transform the gaming experience on these consoles. We have seen the gameplay on both technologies, and are working closely with the manufacturers to make sure GameStop will be the destination for both.  Title development and product availability for both accessories will be critical for their success.Dan mentioned the implementation of strategies outlined at the BMO Conference in November. As a reminder, GameStop began a strategic review close to 18 months ago, and the resulting investments of that process are beginning to arrive at market in 2010. Our customers and associates are excited about a loyalty program that will be unique for video game retailing, browser game promotions and sale of downloadable add-on content in-store. The key point for you to understand about the evolution of our strategy is that it will allow consumers to discover digital gaming through the most powerful element in this business: A knowledgeable, passionate GameStop associate, with unique knowledge of gaming to provide expert advice to the gaming enthusiast.We have demonstrated in the past that the assisted sales marketing environment in our stores leads to high attachment rates for accessories, magazine subscriptions, strategy guides and Xbox Live, PlayStation and Nintendo network point cards. In fact, if you look at our network point cards, digital game downloads, POSA [point of sale activation] and World of Warcraft time cards, we generated $170 million in digital sales in 2009, representing a 55% growth rate over 2008. Digital content will become a seamless add-on sale when it is recommended by your game adviser, and we will eliminate much of the friction that has existed in the digital world. You will also see the arrival of digital kiosks, known as the Interactive Gaming Guide, in over 1,700 stores that will assist our customers and associates in driving digital sales. We will also bring the power of our buy-sell trade model to these digital sales.In closing, I would like to thank all our GameStop associates in 17 countries for their passionate commitment to the video game consumer during 2009. And now, open it up for questions."

We believe that a Sony decision is imminent, and we will work with that as well. In terms of the percent of gains that offer that, it's relatively small at this point and that in terms of the DLC that has been added on. However, due to the strong online component that is being added to practically every game and given the opportunity that they see ahead of them, what we heard this week is that most publishers are looking to accelerate the percent of games that they developed DLC for.

It's probably the most successful video game loyalty program in existence. If you look at Micromania as we did early on, 86% of their transactions have a Megacarte ID associated with them. Megacarte is not only a loyalty program, it becomes a launch device and a vehicle, it becomes a marketing vehicle, even helps you decide where to put new stores as a real estate vehicle. We believe that the loyalty program at Micromania drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe that we see. So we think it's a very effective program. And that's the base for what we added to our existing loyalty program here at the Edge. How will ours be different? Our program will build heavily on what you see at Micromania today, but it will add some very significant pieces. Our marketing team has done extensive surveys of the kinds of rewards consumers are looking for. If you recall on one of our previous calls or one of our conferences, we talked about the fact that we did an Internet survey and had to shut down the response engine because there was so much interest in the GameStop loyalty program. Ours will have different rewards, it won't be purely a markdown program that gives you discounts once you reach a certain threshold. It will also have unique rewards like tickets to shows and early entrance to a midnight launch, et cetera. So we think that it builds on what we have from Micromania, but it really adds a lot of sophisticated consumer insights to monetize that GameStop consumer. And it brings unique rewards that only GameStop can bring you, so we like our plan on that."

With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer, Tony Bartell, our Executive VP of Merchandizing and Marketing, Mike Maller, our EVP International and Rob Lloyd, our Senior VP of",773,"Good morning, and thanks for attending today’s conference call. With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer, Tony Bartell, our Executive VP of Merchandizing and Marketing, Mike Maller, our EVP International and Rob Lloyd, our Senior VP of Accounting and Acting CFO.
As we reported today, we had a great quarter and reported record sales and earnings for a Q1. Sales for the first time in a non-holiday quarter exceeded $2 billion as we gained significant market share on new releases during the quarter due to our innovative new release marketing. Paul will give you more color on that later.
Our earnings came in at the high end of expectation and in absolute dollars; we’re at an all time high. And, as we mentioned in the release, Q1 earnings have grown at a compound rate of 62% over the last four years. Truly amazing, and Rob will give you more details on the financials.
Lastly, we made great progress on our strategic initiatives relating to DLC sales, loyalty program development and browser game marketing which will be discussed later. That being said, there’s a great deal of concern over the health of the industry given the April NPD data. Even as our software sales grew 13% in the quarter, industry software sales for the first quarter were not as strong as last year’s due to a weaker catalogue compared to last year when Mario cart We Fit and We Play continued to sell through in significant numbers.
Now in our Q2, we expect U.S. software to be down slightly based on our internal growth expectations and title release schedule. On a month-by-month basis, we expect new video game software to be up in May, due to releases like Red Dead Redemption, which is doing extremely well, USC and Super Mario Galaxy, followed by a decline in June and July, excluding Star Craft 2, as it will fall into the PC software category.
But, if you added the two categories together, PC software and video game software, we believe that the industry in the U.S. will show software growth for the quarter. Based on this analysis, we expect earnings to grow in the quarter 9% to 17%.
Moving on to Q3, we expect to see double digit growth beginning with the release of Halo Reach followed by Medal of Honor, Fall Out New Vegas, Men NFL 2011, Star Wars, Dead Rising 2, and True Crime. Based on the anticipated strength of these titles, we expect earnings to grow in Q3 by 19% to 28% over last year, and at E3, we will be reviewing titles for Microsoft Natal and Sony’s Move, as we have nothing in our forecast for them.
All in all, we expect software sales in the U.S. to grow this year and are holding to our full year guidance of $258 million to $268 million, a 14% to 18% increase over fiscal 2009.
While some may be concerned about our use sale growth of 4%, it should be noted that these sales are on top of 32% use growth in Q1 last year. Indeed, our use sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 22% over the last four years, so to expect this same torrid growth to continue in unreasonable.
We will see growth in use this year. It will be more likely to be in the single digit range driven by expansion and less developed markets outside of the U.S.
There have been some questions concerning first user only content and the effect on our use business. We have not seen an impact thus far and as a matter of fact, we will turn this into a positive with our ability to sell DLC through our investments made in technology to market and sell this content in our stores. Paul will elaborate more on that later.
This morning, Wal Mart announced a more aggressive e-commerce initiative to reserve new video games. This is an obvious attempt to increase first week market share, which we dominate. Indeed, many titles we have 60% to 70% first week share.
We believe our pre-release marketing, exclusive content and the immediate currency provided by our trade-in program allow us to continue to gain market share as it has for the last few years. In addition, the profile of the hard core gamer, often identifies a credit cardless consumer that has purchasing online.
So, next Rob will review with you the financials in more detail, then Paul will discuss the state of the business, and lastly we will hold a question and answer session for those issues we have not addressed.

This morning we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 5.1% to $2.08 billion driven by new software sales growth of 13% on the strength of several new title releases which Paul will cove",783,"Good morning everyone. This morning we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 5.1% to $2.08 billion driven by new software sales growth of 13% on the strength of several new title releases which Paul will cover. GameStop gained 500 basis points on new software market share over the prior year quarter.
Net earnings were $75.2 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, which was at the high end of the guidance. Comparable store sales came in at the midpoint of guidance, declining 1.6% primarily due to the supply constraint on new video game consoles throughout the quarter and due to reduced hardware price points.
These factors led to a decline in new hardware sales of 12% during the first quarter. We continue to deal with product shortages on the Sony Playstation 3. On a unit basis, X Box 360 and Sony PS3 showed year over year quarterly growth while the Nintendo Wii and DS were down.
As Dan mentioned, used product sales increased 4% positively lapping the 32% growth from the first quarter of 2009. We saw solid improvement in our international markets and still expect full year growth in this category to range between 5% and 10%. Used margins were the highest since the first quarter of 2009 and sequentially, the used category margin increased 170 basis point. 
International used margins improved over last year and moved closer to the U.S. margin rate. International used sales increased as a percentage of overall used sales while setting the margin improvement and resulting in consolidated used margins that were flat to last year. Consolidate gross margins were comparable to the prior year quarter of 27.4%.
New hardware margins were flat while new software margins declined 150 basis point. During the quarter, we saw  mix shift in the software category from Play Station 2 to newer platform sales. In addition, we offered more value to our customers during our annual Game Day sale resulting in a significant increase in our sales volume, while recognizing there would be an impact on margin.
The other category contributed a greater percentage to total sales and the margin rate improved as we gained traction in the sales of digital online game cards. 
On the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had over $430 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased  4.5% on a per store basis year over year. As you may recall, in January we announced our $300 million share repurchase program as part of our 2010 capital allocation plan. We have not purchased any shares under the program since our last call in March, leaving us with $53 million for future repurchases.
We opened 47 stores in the United States and 27 internationally. Overall, the global store base had a net increase of 36 stores. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 38% in the first quarter of last year with the decline coming from international tax strategies.
Quarterly guidance; as we analyzed our earnings estimates for the next few quarters, we determined that current consensus estimates for the second and third quarters were not appropriately weighted based on historical earnings results or by the expected growth over the next six months.
Therefore, in order to provide shareholders with a more accurate business outlook GameStop is going to provide this one-time earnings guidance for the next two quarters. For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect comparable store sales to range from negative 2% to plus 2%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.25 to $0.27, a 9% to 17% increase compared to $0.23 in the prior year quarter.
Based on our current industry analysis and expected strength in several upcoming new video games software releases, the company is projecting third quarter fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share to range from $0.38 to $0.41, a 195 to 28% increase over the prior year quarter.
We are reiterating our full year 2010 guidance that we first announced on our call in March. Company revenues are still projected to grow between 4% and 6% with comparable store sales ranging from flat to 2%.
Earnings per share for the full year are still projected to range from $2.58 to $2.68 representing an EPS growth rate of 14% to 18% based on 2009’s EPS of $2.27 excluding debt retirement costs.
Our current expectation for foreign currency exchange rates is that any impact felt by the change in the Euro relative to our initial plan will be offset by the movement in the Canadian and Australian dollars.
Now I will turn it over to Paul for his comments.

Advanced mar",1003,"I would now like to add some color to our progress in the first quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. As Dan mentioned, we continue to gain share on titles released in the quarter thanks to our unique title launch model. Advanced marketing of exclusive content helped us exceed our pre-order goals during the quarter. Midnight events created an excitement in stores at launch, and trade credits provided the best value proposition for purchasing a new video game.
We continue to innovate the title launch process; this quarter leveraging social media to multiple our impressions in media value as well as using our online team to drive traffic both online and in stores.
Our title lineup was strong in the first quarter and GameStop’s share of these titles was dominant. Nintendo’s Pokémon Soul Silver Hard Gold was a great success as consumers love GameStop’s exclusive downloadable characters, contributing to a our highest week one share in history with a Nintendo product.
DA’s Battlefield Bad Company 2, Sony’s God of War 3, Final Fantasy XIII and Take Two’s Bio Shock 2 rounded out our top titles.
On the hardware front, we had a successful launch of the Nintendo DSI LX and led market share at launch on this handheld. Supply on hardware was a continuing challenge this quarter as on an average daily basis, our U.S. stores were out of stock on PS3 for 80% of the time and our out of stocks on Wii was 50% of the time. In spite of that shortage, GameStop gained market share on all three consoles.
Our stores team launched a customer service recognition program during the first quarter providing for better technology in tracking out customer survey data. We have also changed processes in store to reduce tasking and allow for enhanced service, continuing to improve our industry leading service levels in store.
Our new store performance during the quarter continued to be solid with the portfolio ahead of pro forma. Our real estate renewal process continues to yield rent savings during 2010. 
Moving on to strategic and digital initiatives, we promoted the online browser game Legends of Zork for several weeks in all of our U.S. stores during the first quarter. Targeted customers received free in-game play cards with purchases at GameStop and they used the codes on cards to enter the game site online.
The results were that we added a large number of new game players to Legends of Zork, roughly doubling the audience of that game in four weeks. Our customer acquisition costs were significantly lower than advertising driven customer acquisition, and it is clear to us now that stores can efficiently convert online game players and provide a multi-channel gaming experience.
A second strategic initiative we shared with you previously is our in store downloadable content pilot. That will launch in 35 stores in partnership with Microsoft at the end of May. These stores will merchandise a limited amount of DLC and promote that digital content to consumers. Consumers will pay for the content with any form of tender including trade credits. 
This process will eliminate a lot of the friction of searching and discovering content online and will bring the power of buy/sell/trade to the digital sale. The test will expand the SKU count each month through the summer, going live to our entire U.S. store base in the fall. 
We are pleased to participate in the launch of electronic arts online pass and sales of DLC on new titles. We support the creation of added downloadable content for popular franchises, as we see that as extending the life of titles and broadening the base of game players.
We do not anticipate an impact to our used margins due to this program. The amount of used game buyers currently playing online is low, and as it grows, our proprietary models will manage trade and sale pricing to reach margin goals.
Lastly, we believe that the online pass process will allow publishers to better leverage their IP content through DLC sales to both used players and new game buyers. A great example of this trend is this quarter’s launch of Modern Warfare 2 stimulus package from Activision. It gave us an opportunity to promote DLC in store on a popular franchise and we are pleased with the results.
We have leading market share on download cards and saw a significant increase in our run rate of point cards during this launch, reaffirming that consumers see GameStop as the destination for purchasing their digital add on content.
Market data tells us that GameStop consumers are ahead of the mass market in digital adoption and we see the percent of customers buying both physical games and digital points cards growing rapidly in the first quarter.
Our investments in proprietary, point of sale technology have put us in a position to partner with publishers as they grow their digital offerings. Merchandizing and promoting this content as part of the in store and online sales process, extends the reach of the GameStop brand as a multi-channel game destination. We are having conversations with multiple publishers on leveraging the potential of digital sales at GameStop stores.
A third strategic initiative we have discussed with you previously is our new loyalty program. In development for over a year, the program will launch in four U.S. markets and 204 stores on Friday, May 28. This program will provide members special access to game related rewards and merchandise based on increased purchases, and we have created proprietary technology at POS and online to differentiate and reward our loyal customers.
The loyalty program will roll out to the rest of our United States stores in the fall of this year and will become a major component of our new title marketing efforts.
In closing, I would like to thank all of our GameStop associates in 17 countries for their passionate commitment to the video game consumer during the first quarter and now open it up for questions.

We’re also working on merchandising and marketing the DLC content in our stores. So this is something that we feel like the industry is moving our way and our investments are starting to really be timely in publishers CCS destination for sales of DLC in store.
We will be piloting in, I think we said the 35 stores, in the spring. We’ll be adding SKU’s to the catalog. We’re starting off with a limited catalog and then we’ll be adding select titles and SKU’s over the course of the summer, and we’ll be live in all our U.S. stores in the fall. The timing is based largely on our POS release and the technology rollouts that we have.
As far as loyalty, four markets which we’ve not announced, you’ll have to wait until Friday, May 28, because we don’t want to create too much pressure on our stores with too many customers running in, but you will see that in those stores on Friday, the 28th and that will be rolling nationally as well in the fall, riding along with our fall POS release.

And thanks for attending today's conference call. With me today are Paul Raines, our Chief Operating Officer; Tony Bartel, our Executive VP of Merchandising and Marketing; Mike Mauler, our EVP International; and Rob Lloyd, our Senior VP of Accounting and Acting CFO.
As we reported today, we had a great quarter and reported record sales and earnings for Q1. Sales for the first time in a non-holiday quarter exceeded $2 billion as we gained significant market share on new releases during the quarter due to our innovative new release marketing. Paul will give you more color on that later. Our earnings came in at the high end of expectation, and in absolute dollars were at an all-time high. And as we mentioned in the release, Q1 earnings have grown at a compound rate of 62% over the last four years, truly amazing. And Rob will give you more detail on the financials. Lastly, we made great progress on our strategic initiatives relating to DLC sales, loyalty program development, and browser game marketing, which will be discussed later.
That being said, there's a great deal of concern over the health of the industry given the April NPD data. Even as our software sales grew 13% in the quarter, industry software sales for the first quarter were not as strong as last year's due to a weaker catalog compared to last year when Mario Kart, Wii Fit and Wii Play continued to sell through insignificant numbers. Now in our Q2, we expect U.S. software to be down slightly, based on our internal growth expectations and title release schedule. On a month by month basis, we expect new video game software to be up in May due to releases like Red Dead Redemption, which is doing extremely well, UFC, and Super Mario Galaxy, followed by a decline in June and July. Excluding StarCraft II, as it will fall into the PC software category. But if you added the two categories together, PC software and video game software, we believe that the industry in the U.S. will show software growth for the quarter. Based on this analysis, we expect earnings to grow in the quarter 9% to 17%.
Moving on to Q3, we expect to see double-digit growth beginning with the release of Halo: Reach, followed by Medal of Honor, Fallout New Vegas, Madden NFL 2011, Star Wars, Dead Rising 2 and True Crime. Based on the anticipated strength of these titles, we expect earnings to grow in Q3 by 19% to 28% over last year. And at E3, we will be reviewing titles for Microsoft Natal and Sony's Move as we have nothing in our forecast for them. All in all, we expect software sales in the U.S. to grow this year and are holding to our full-year guidance of $2.58 to $2.68, a 14% to 18% increase over fiscal 2009. While some may be concerned about our used sale growth of 4%, it should be noted that these sales are on top of 32% used growth in Q1 last year. Indeed, our used sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 22% over the last four years. So to expect this same torrid growth to continue is unreasonable. We will see growth in used this year but it will be more likely to be in the single-digit range driven by expansion in less developed markets outside of the U.S. There have been some questions concerning first user-only content and the effect on our used business. We have not seen an impact thus far and as a matter of fact, we will turn this into a positive, with our ability to sell DLC through our investments made in technology to market and sell this content in our stores. Paul will elaborate more on that later.
This morning, Wal-Mart announced a more aggressive e-commerce initiative to reserve new video games. This is an obvious attempt to increase first week market share, which we dominate. Indeed, many titles we have 60% to 70% first week share. We believe our prerelease marketing, exclusive content and the immediate currency provided by our trade-in program will allow us to continue to gain market share as it has for the last few years. In addition, the profile of the hardcore gamer often identifies a credit card-less consumer that is purchasing online.
So next Rob will review with you the financials in more detail, then Paul will discuss the state of the business, and lastly, we will hold a question-and-answer session for those issues we have not addressed. Bob?"

This morning, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 5.1% to $2.08 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 13% on the strength of several new title releases,",777,"Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 5.1% to $2.08 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 13% on the strength of several new title releases, which Paul will cover. GameStop gained 500 basis points of new software market share over the prior year quarter.
Net earnings were $75.2 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, which was at the high end of the guidance. Comparable store sales came in at the midpoint of guidance, declining 1.6%, primarily due to the supply constraint on new video game consoles throughout the quarter, and due to reduced hardware price points. These factors led to a decline in new hardware sales of 12% during the first quarter. We continue to deal with product shortages on the Sony PlayStation 3. On a unit basis, Xbox 360 and Sony PS3 showed year-over-year quarterly growth while the Nintendo Wii and DS were down. As Dan mentioned, used product sales increased 4%, positively lapping the 32% growth from the first quarter of 2009. We saw solid improvement in our international markets and still expect full-year growth in this category to range between 5% and 10%. Used margins were the highest since the first quarter of 2009 and sequentially, the used category margin increased 170 basis points.
International used margins improved over last year and moved closer to the U.S. margin rate. International used sales increased as a percentage of overall used sales, offsetting the margin improvement and resulting in consolidated used margins that were flat to last year. Consolidated gross margins were comparable to the prior year quarter at 27.4%. New hardware margins were flat, while new software margins declined 150 basis points. During the quarter, we saw a mix shift in the software category from PlayStation 2 to newer platform sales. In addition, we offered more value to our customers during our annual Game Days sale, resulting in a significant increase in our sales volume, while recognizing there would be an impact on margin. The other category contributed a greater percentage to total sales and the margin rate improved as we gained traction in the sales of digital online game cards. 
On the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had over $430 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 4.5% on a per store basis year-over-year. As you may recall, in January we announced our $300 million share repurchase program as part of our 2010 capital allocation plan. We have not purchased any shares under the program since our last call in March, leaving us with $53 million for future repurchases. We opened 47 stores in the United States and 27 internationally. Overall, the global store base had a net increase of 36 stores. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 38% in the first quarter of last year, with the decline coming from international tax strategies. 
Quarterly guidance. As we analyzed our earnings estimates for the next few quarters, we determined that current consensus estimates for the second and third quarters were not appropriately weighted based on historical earnings results, or by the expected growth over the next six months. Therefore, in order to provide shareholders with a more accurate business outlook, GameStop is going to provide this one-time earnings guidance for the next two quarters. For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect comparable store sales to range from -2% to plus 2%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.25 to $0.27, a 9% to 17% increase compared to $0.23 in the prior year quarter. Based on our current industry analysis and expected strength of several upcoming new video game software releases, the company is projecting third quarter fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share to range from $0.38 to $0.41, a 19% to 28% increase over the prior year quarter. We are reiterating our full-year 2010 guidance that we first announced on our call in March. Company revenues are still projected to grow between 4% and 6% with comparable store sales ranging from flat to 2%. 
Earnings per share for the full year are still projected to range from $2.58 to $2.68, representing an EPS growth rate of 14% to 18% based on 2009's EPS of $2.27, excluding debt retirement costs. Our current expectation for foreign currency exchange rates is that any impact felt by the change in the euro relative to our initial plan will be offset by the movement in the Canadian and Australian dollars. Now I will turn it over to Paul for his comments."

I would now like to add some color to our progress in the first quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. As Dan mentioned, we continued to gain share on titles released in the quarter thanks to our unique title launch model. Advanced marketing of exclusive content helped us exceed our pre-order goals during the quarter. Midnight events created excitement in stores at launch, and trade credits provided the best value proposition for purchasing a new video game. We continue to innovate the title launch process, this quarter leveraging social media to multiply our impressions and media value as well as using our online team to drive traffic both online and in-stores.
Our title lineup was strong in the first quarter and GameStop's share of these titles was dominant. Nintendo's Pokémon SoulSilver HeartGold was a great success as consumers loved GameStop's exclusive downloadable characters, contributing to our highest week one share in history with a Nintendo product. EA's Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Sony's God of War III, Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIII and Take 2's Bioshock 2 rounded out our top titles. On the hardware front, we had a successful launch of the Nintendo DSi XL and led market share at launch on this handheld. Supply on hardware was a continuing challenge this quarter as, on an average daily basis, our U.S. stores were out of stock on PS3 for 80% of the time and our out-of-stocks on Wii was 50% of the time. In spite of that shortage, GameStop gained market share on all three consoles.
Our stores team launched a customer service recognition program during the first quarter, providing for better technology in tracking our customer survey data. We have also changed processes in-store to reduce tasking and allow for enhanced service, continuing to improve our industry-leading service levels in-store. Our new store performance during the quarter continued to be solid, with the portfolio ahead of pro forma. Our real estate renewal process continues to yield rent savings during 2010.
Moving on to strategic and digital initiatives, we promoted the online browser game, Legends of Zork, for several weeks in all of our U.S. stores during the first quarter. Targeted customers received free in-game play cards with purchases at GameStop. And they used the codes on cards to enter the game site online. The results were that we added a large number of new game players to Legends of Zork, roughly doubling the audience of that game in four weeks. Our customer acquisition costs were significantly lower than advertising-driven customer acquisition and it is clear to us now that stores can efficiently convert online game players and provide a multi-channel gaming experience.
A second strategic initiative we shared with you previously is our in-store downloadable content pilot. That will launch in 35 stores in partnership with Microsoft at the end of May. These stores will merchandise a limited amount of DLC and promote that digital content to consumers. Consumers will pay for the content with any form of tender including trade credits. This process will eliminate a lot of the friction of searching and discovering content online and will bring the power of buy-sell trade to the digital sale. The test will expand the SKU count each month through the summer, going live to our entire U.S. store base in the fall.
We are pleased to participate in the launch of Electronic Arts' online pass and sales of DLC on new titles. We support the creation of added downloadable content for popular franchises, as we see that as extending the life of titles and broadening the base of game players. We do not anticipate an impact to our used margins due to this program. The amount of used game buyers currently playing online is low, and as it grows our proprietary models will manage trade and sale pricing to reach margin goals. Lastly, we believe that the online pass process will allow publishers to better leverage their IP content through DLC sales to both used players and new game buyers. A great example of this trend is this quarter's launch of Modern Warfare 2's stimulus package from Activision. That gave us an opportunity to promote DLC in-store on a popular franchise and we are pleased with the results. We have leading market share on download cards and saw a significant increase in our run rate of point cards during this launch, reaffirming that consumers see GameStop as the destination for purchasing their digital add-on content. Market data tells us that GameStop consumers are ahead of the mass market in digital adoption and we see the percent of customers buying both physical games and digital [inaudible] cards growing rapidly in the first quarter.
Our investments in proprietary point-of-sale technology have put us in a position to partner with publishers as they grow their digital offerings. Merchandising and promoting this content as part of the in-store and online sales process extends the reach of the GameStop brand as a multi-channel game destination. We are having conversations with multiple publishers on leveraging the potential of digital sales at GameStop stores.
A third strategic initiative we have discussed with you previously is our new loyalty program. In development for over a year, the program will launch in four U.S. markets and 204 stores on Friday, May 28. This program will provide members special access to game-related rewards and merchandise based on increased purchases. And we have created proprietary technology at POS and online to differentiate and reward our loyal customers. The loyalty program will roll out to the rest of our United States stores in the fall of this year and will become a major component of our new title marketing efforts. In closing, I would like to thank all of our GameStop associates in 17 countries for their passionate commitment to the video game consumer during the first quarter and now open it up for questions."

Now having said that, forecasting into 2011 is a little soon but, however, we believe that the Natal and the Move as a category, a new category, will generate a lot of creativity amongst the publishers and that will probably provide, not knowing all the titles, a growth situation for 2011.

Paul will give you more color on that later. Our earnings came in at the high end of expectation, and in absolute dollars were at an all-time high. And as we mentioned in the release, Q1 earnings have grown at a compound rate of 62% over the last four years, truly amazing. And Rob will give you more detail on the financials. Lastly, we made great progress on our strategic initiatives relating to DLC sales, loyalty program development, and browser game marketing, which will be discussed later.
That being said, there's a great deal of concern over the health of the industry given the April NPD data. Even as our software sales grew 13% in the quarter, industry software sales for the first quarter were not as strong as last year's due to a weaker catalog compared to last year when Mario Kart, Wii Fit and Wii Play continued to sell through in significant numbers. Now in our Q2, we expect U.S. software to be down slightly, based on our internal growth expectations and title release schedule. On a month by month basis, we expect new video game software to be up in May due to releases like Red Dead Redemption, which is doing extremely well, UFC and Super Mario Galaxy, followed by a decline in June and July. Excluding StarCraft II, as it will fall into the PC software category. But if you added the two categories together, PC software and video game software, we believe that the industry in the U.S. will show software growth for the quarter. Based on this analysis, we expect earnings to grow in the quarter 9% to 17%.
Moving on to Q3. We expect to see double-digit growth beginning with the release of Halo: Reach, followed by Medal of Honor, Fallout New Vegas, Madden NFL 2011, Star Wars, Dead Rising 2 and True Crime. Based on the anticipated strength of these titles, we expect earnings to grow in Q3 by 19% to 28% over last year. And at E3, we will be reviewing titles for Microsoft Natal and Sony's Move as we have nothing in our forecast for them. All in all, we expect software sales in the U.S. to grow this year and are holding to our full-year guidance of $2.58 to $2.68, a 14% to 18% increase over fiscal 2009. While some may be concerned about our used sale growth of 4%, it should be noted that these sales are on top of 32% used growth in Q1 last year. Indeed, our used sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 22% over the last four years. So to expect this same torrid growth to continue is unreasonable. We will see growth in used this year but it will be more likely to be in the single-digit range driven by expansion in less developed markets outside of the U.S. There have been some questions concerning first-user-only content and the effect on our used business. We have not seen an impact thus far and as a matter of fact, we will turn this into a positive, with our ability to sell DLC through our investments made in technology to market and sell this content in our stores. Paul will elaborate more on that later.
This morning, Wal-Mart announced a more aggressive e-commerce initiative to reserve new video games. This is an obvious attempt to increase the first week market share, which we dominate. Indeed, many titles we have 60% to 70% first week share. We believe our pre-release marketing, exclusive content and the immediate currency provided by our trade-in program will allow us to continue to gain market share as it has for the last few years. In addition, the profile of the hardcore gamer often identifies a credit card-less consumer that is purchasing online.
So next Rob will review with you the financials in more detail, then Paul will discuss the state of the business, and lastly, we will hold a question-and-answer session for those issues we have not addressed. Bob?"
1342560,104717691,64671,"GameStop Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 20, 2010",2010-05-20,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 5.1% to $2.08 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 13% on the strength of several new title releases,",777,"Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 5.1% to $2.08 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 13% on the strength of several new title releases, which Paul will cover. GameStop gained 500 basis points of new software market share over the prior year quarter.
Net earnings were $75.2 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, which was at the high end of the guidance. Comparable store sales came in at the midpoint of guidance, declining 1.6%, primarily due to the supply constraint on new video game consoles throughout the quarter, and due to reduced hardware price points. These factors led to a decline in new hardware sales of 12% during the first quarter. We continue to deal with product shortages on the Sony PlayStation 3. On a unit basis, Xbox 360 and Sony PS3 showed year-over-year quarterly growth while the Nintendo Wii and DS were down. As Dan mentioned, used product sales increased 4%, positively lapping the 32% growth from the first quarter of 2009. We saw solid improvement in our international markets and still expect full-year growth in this category to range between 5% and 10%. Used margins were the highest since the first quarter of 2009 and sequentially, the used category margin increased 170 basis points.
International used margins improved over last year and moved closer to the U.S. margin rate. International used sales increased as a percentage of overall used sales, offsetting the margin improvement and resulting in consolidated used margins that were flat to last year. Consolidated gross margins were comparable to the prior year quarter at 27.4%. New hardware margins were flat, while new software margins declined 150 basis points. During the quarter, we saw a mix shift in the software category from PlayStation 2 to newer platform sales. In addition, we offered more value to our customers during our annual Game Days sale, resulting in a significant increase in our sales volume, while recognizing there would be an impact on margin. The other category contributed a greater percentage to total sales and the margin rate improved as we gained traction in the sales of digital online game cards. 
On the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had over $430 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 4.5% on a per store basis year-over-year. As you may recall, in January we announced our $300 million share repurchase program as part of our 2010 capital allocation plan. We have not purchased any shares under the program since our last call in March, leaving us with $53 million for future repurchases. We opened 47 stores in the United States and 27 internationally. Overall, the global store base had a net increase of 36 stores. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 38% in the first quarter of last year, with the decline coming from international tax strategies. 
Quarterly guidance. As we analyzed our earnings estimates for the next few quarters, we determined that current consensus estimates for the second and third quarters were not appropriately weighted based on historical earnings results, or by the expected growth over the next six months. Therefore, in order to provide shareholders with a more accurate business outlook, GameStop is going to provide this one-time earnings guidance for the next two quarters. For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect comparable store sales to range from -2% to plus 2%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.25 to $0.27, a 9% to 17% increase compared to $0.23 in the prior year quarter. Based on our current industry analysis and expected strength of several upcoming new video game software releases, the company is projecting third quarter fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share to range from $0.38 to $0.41, a 19% to 28% increase over the prior year quarter. We are reiterating our full-year 2010 guidance that we first announced on our call in March. Company revenues are still projected to grow between 4% and 6% with comparable store sales ranging from flat to 2%. 
Earnings per share for the full year are still projected to range from $2.58 to $2.68, representing an EPS growth rate of 14% to 18% based on 2009's EPS of $2.27, excluding debt retirement costs. Our current expectation for foreign currency exchange rates is that any impact felt by the change in the euro relative to our initial plan will be offset by the movement in the Canadian and Australian dollars. Now I will turn it over to Paul for his comments."
1342560,104717691,64671,"GameStop Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 20, 2010",2010-05-20,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. I would now like to add some color to our progress in the first quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. As Dan mentioned, we continued to gain share on titles released in the quarter thanks to our unique title launch model",989,"Thanks, Rob. I would now like to add some color to our progress in the first quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. As Dan mentioned, we continued to gain share on titles released in the quarter thanks to our unique title launch model. Advanced marketing of exclusive content helped us exceed our pre-order goals during the quarter. Midnight events created excitement in stores at launch, and trade credits provided the best value proposition for purchasing a new video game. We continue to innovate the title launch process, this quarter leveraging social media to multiply our impressions and media value as well as using our online team to drive traffic both online and in-stores.
Our title lineup was strong in the first quarter and GameStop's share of these titles was dominant. Nintendo's Pokémon SoulSilver HeartGold was a great success as consumers loved GameStop's exclusive downloadable characters, contributing to our highest week one share in history with a Nintendo product. EA's Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Sony's God of War III, Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIII and Take 2's Bioshock 2 rounded out our top titles. On the hardware front, we had a successful launch of the Nintendo DSi XL and led market share at launch on this handheld. Supply on hardware was a continuing challenge this quarter as, on an average daily basis, our U.S. stores were out of stock on PS3 for 80% of the time and our out-of-stocks on Wii was 50% of the time. In spite of that shortage, GameStop gained market share on all three consoles.
Our stores team launched a customer service recognition program during the first quarter, providing for better technology in tracking our customer survey data. We have also changed processes in-store to reduce tasking and allow for enhanced service, continuing to improve our industry-leading service levels in-store. Our new store performance during the quarter continued to be solid, with the portfolio ahead of pro forma. Our real estate renewal process continues to yield rent savings during 2010.
Moving on to strategic and digital initiatives, we promoted the online browser game, Legends of Zork, for several weeks in all of our U.S. stores during the first quarter. Targeted customers received free in-game play cards with purchases at GameStop. And they used the codes on cards to enter the game site online. The results were that we added a large number of new game players to Legends of Zork, roughly doubling the audience of that game in four weeks. Our customer acquisition costs were significantly lower than advertising-driven customer acquisition and it is clear to us now that stores can efficiently convert online game players and provide a multi-channel gaming experience.
A second strategic initiative we shared with you previously is our in-store downloadable content pilot. That will launch in 35 stores in partnership with Microsoft at the end of May. These stores will merchandise a limited amount of DLC and promote that digital content to consumers. Consumers will pay for the content with any form of tender including trade credits. This process will eliminate a lot of the friction of searching and discovering content online and will bring the power of buy-sell trade to the digital sale. The test will expand the SKU count each month through the summer, going live to our entire U.S. store base in the fall.
We are pleased to participate in the launch of Electronic Arts' online pass and sales of DLC on new titles. We support the creation of added downloadable content for popular franchises, as we see that as extending the life of titles and broadening the base of game players. We do not anticipate an impact to our used margins due to this program. The amount of used game buyers currently playing online is low, and as it grows our proprietary models will manage trade and sale pricing to reach margin goals. Lastly, we believe that the online pass process will allow publishers to better leverage their IP content through DLC sales to both used players and new game buyers. A great example of this trend is this quarter's launch of Modern Warfare 2's stimulus package from Activision that gave us an opportunity to promote DLC in-store on a popular franchise and we are pleased with the results. We have leading market share on download cards and saw a significant increase in our run rate of point cards during this launch, reaffirming that consumers see GameStop as the destination for purchasing their digital add-on content. Market data tells us that GameStop consumers are ahead of the mass market in digital adoption and we see the percent of customers buying both physical games and digital points cards growing rapidly in the first quarter.
Our investments in proprietary point-of-sale technology have put us in a position to partner with publishers as they grow their digital offerings. Merchandising and promoting this content as part of the in-store and online sales process extends the reach of the GameStop brand as a multi-channel game destination. We are having conversations with multiple publishers on leveraging the potential of digital sales at GameStop stores.
A third strategic initiative we have discussed with you previously is our new loyalty program. In development for over a year, the program will launch in four U.S. markets and 204 stores on Friday, May 28. This program will provide members special access to game-related rewards and merchandise based on increased purchases. And we have created proprietary technology at POS and online to differentiate and reward our loyal customers. The loyalty program will roll out to the rest of our United States stores in the fall of this year and will become a major component of our new title marketing efforts. In closing, I would like to thank all of our GameStop associates in 17 countries for their passionate commitment to the video game consumer during the first quarter and now open it up for questions."

With me today are Paul Raines, our CEO; Tony Bartel, our President; Rob Lloyd, EVP and CFO; and Mike Mauler, our EVP of International.
As you know, in early June, we announced these promotions as the next step in the succession plan that Dick Fontaine and I developed several years ago. The team, now led by Paul, is doing a great job of running the business and making significant progress on our strategic initiatives which you will be hearing about more today.
As you can see, we gained significant market share in a market that is struggling for growth. The data suggests that U.S. software sales slid 7% in the quarter. The GameStop's U.S. software sales grew significantly. We believe that the slate of new releases for the back-half is stronger than last year and the new console add-ons, Kinect and Move, will help grow the category and return to positive growth.
Also, new console sales and units grew an overall 43% in the quarter, and these new users to be very active buying games in the coming months. Whatever you believe, we are well positioned to continue market share and manage our business to create shareholder value.
Our portfolio of stores has very flexible lease terms and we can right-size for the market quickly. We have slowed our new stores footage and will continue to do so while taking advantage of real estate opportunities to grow share.
Our investments in alternative game distribution methods are well thought-out, have synergies with existing assets and give us a hedge on the future without a huge investment. Our investments in other initiatives, such as our new loyalty program, are working well and you will hear more on this later from Paul. And given the free cash flow we generate, you will hear on how we plan on using this cash to provide even greater shareholder returns in the near future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a thorough review of the quarter.

As we begin our comments this morning, we want to thank our team of over 50,000 associates worldwide. The GameStop teams in 17 countries continue to demonstrate our passion for serving video game customers everyday, and we appreciate them.
We saw strength in the core business this quarter, driven by new software titles. New software grew 5.3% as the GameStop model of providing unique content to drive reserves, exciting midnight launches and the best value proposition of buy-sell trade drove record market share at launch. Hardware growth was driven by exciting new SKUs from PS3, Black Wii and the new Xbox Slim.
The used business, which is overlapping 19% growth in 2Q of 2009, grew just under 1%. Next-generation used software continues to grow, while older generation continues to decline. On the hardware side, used hardware sales were impacted by the growth of new hardware.
As we have pointed out in the past, the used sales growth lagged that of new by three to six months, as customers purchased hot new titles and traded them once they're done playing them. We have built our used inventory levels this quarter through a 10.6% trade comp, and that inventory growth gives us confidence on back-half used growth.
We have seen no competitive impact from emerging competitors in the used business and also have not seen any impact from the first user codes in recent titles. We are watching carefully the latest round of competitor entries in the used business, but would remind investors of the extensive competitive barriers GameStop has built around the used business. Rob will give you details around our back-half forecast in his remarks.
Our customer service metrics continued to improve to record levels, as the GameStop team engages customers in-store with industry-leading knowledge and focus on only video games. Our consumers continue to tell us that we set the standard for the in-store experience, thanks to our trusted game advisors, and our record market share growth validates that consumer feedback.
Our International business continues to face pressure from the macroeconomic environment. Mike Mauler and his team have accelerated the rollout of best practices to drive operations improvement.
On the merchandizing side, we are making progress on integrating our go-big and launch process internationally, and we will launch our first title with unique content globally this fall.
As you know, we developed the strategy over the last two years to make GameStop a multi-channel aggregator of gaming. As part of that strategic work, we defined several technology initiatives, and they have been in pilot over the last year.
We announced this morning that we will be accelerating our successful strategic initiatives in the third quarter, and we would to like to give you some color on our thinking in that area.
The PowerUp Rewards program, which is the name of our new loyalty initiative, is now live in over 500 stores in multiple markets across the United States, and we have over 350,000 affiliated members. Our projections put us on a path to several million members in the first year. And in the lead markets, the program is already twice the size of our Edge program.
After only 10 weeks in pilot, members represent over 50% of all transactions in those markets, and we are seeing growth in consumer segments that we're not participating previously in our Edge program. PowerUp members are shopping at roughly twice the frequency of non-members, and 15% of members have shopped us five times or more in the last 10 weeks. We are also seeing a high level of trades in used sales from PowerUp members.
Publishers are showing strong interest in participating in the program, and our Epic Reward calendar already has a waiting list. 40% of our members have already completed their game libraries online, and we now have millions of games registered in the collective libraries of PowerUp members.
We believe the PowerUp Rewards program has struck accord with our customers, and we will accelerate the program to be live in all stores nationally during the third quarter. The costs associated with that rollout are one of the best investments we can make to increase purchase frequency and deepen consumers' relationships with GameStop ahead of holiday.
Now on to downloadable content. In partnership with Microsoft, we started our downloadable content initiative during the second quarter in 35 stores. Consumer acceptance has been strong, as gamers enjoy being able to buy add-on content while they are shopping with their trusted game advisor.
Our assortment continues to grow, and our proprietary Code Server technology continues to serve consumers shopping in-store and via our digital kiosk and very soon online. We will be rolling out that initiative nationally during August and will be adding DLC from Sony during the quarter.
As discovery of DLC in store increases, so do the number of transactions with the digital SKU. And that number is now 5% of total transactions during the second quarter, representing an 80% year-over-year increase.
We are also making very strong progress on our GameStop.com journey and added a major component of our strategy with the acquisition of Kongregate.com during the quarter. Tony Bartel will give you color on both of these items and our digital aggregation strategy in his remarks.
We know that investors have been mixed on their view of GameStop's terminal value, and we have spent a lot of time looking at our capital allocation. As a team, we are committed to providing shareholders a return on their invested capital.
We have a framework to increase those returns through a multi-channel approach that leverages our brick and mortar footprint with emerging digital channels and have a filtering process that examines the ROIC of every major investment we make.
Our new stores consistently exceed their performance targets, and our strong cash flow allows for investments in the digital future while also returning cash to shareholders. Rob will give you more color on our approach in this area.
In conclusion, we told you a year ago that we were developing a multi-channel strategy enabled by technology innovation to be the gaming aggregator across physical and digital channels, and we are delivering on that commitment in a disciplined way.
I will now turn the call over to Rob for his remarks.

This morning we announced our financial results for the second quarter of 2010.Total sales increased 3.4% to $1.8 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 5.3% on the strength of Red Dead Redemption, Super Ma",967,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. This morning we announced our financial results for the second quarter of 2010.
Total sales increased 3.4% to $1.8 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 5.3% on the strength of Red Dead Redemption, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and NCAA Football 2011. Strong sales through new hardware, up 4% from the second quarter of 2009, also contributed to topline growth.
NPD reported a 43% increase in next-generation console units sold in the quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. GameStop had a 60% increase in net sales of next-gen consoles.
Comparable store sales were 0.9%, at the midpoint of guidance. We expect comps to be positive for the remainder for the fiscal year based on the strong line-up of new titles, new hardware, Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect.
Following impressive market share gains in the first quarter, GameStop continued to take share in the new video games software category. Our quarterly new software growth correlates to a 590 basis point increase in new software market share. Considering that the majority of the title launches in the third quarter appealed to the core gamer, we expect our new software market share to remain very healthy.
Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing the company's 2010 worldwide new video software sales growth forecast from 2% to 5% to 5% to 10%.
Net earnings were $40.3 million. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, a 13% increase over the prior-year quarter and in line with guidance of $0.25 to $0.27 per share. Consolidated gross margins expanded to 28.7% from 28.5% in the prior-year quarter as margins in each category improved.
SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of sales, in line with our previously anticipated increase of 30 to 40 basis points, as we invest in strategic initiatives. The FX impact in the second quarter reduced company sales by $13 million due to the European currencies, but the impact on operating earnings was immaterial.
Moving on to the balance sheet, GameStop closed the quarter with $289 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 0.6% on a per store basis year-over-year. We continue to maintain tight inventory control during this uncertain economy. During the quarter, GameStop repurchased and retired $2.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $20.93 per share.
Using the remaining $52.8 million available of the $300 million share repurchase plan. As Dan and Paul mentioned earlier, over the last few months we have projected our future cash needs in order to appropriately define our long term capital needs and build a capital allocation program which reflects our focus on return on invested capital.
We believe the business will continue to produce adequate cash flow from operations over the next four to five years, to fund our prudent vigilant store expansion and strategic digital investments and acquisitions, fund debt maturities and allow us to develop a plan to repurchase shares on an annual basis.
GameStop's return on invested capital as defined by Bloomberg, at 13% is in the top half of a peer group of more than 20 retailers and approximately 100 basis points above the average of that group. As we navigate through the remainder of this video game cycle, GameStop has committed to improving it's ROIC by at least 400 basis points.
This will be accomplished by measuring the returns of the aforementioned objectives, both individually and collectively to ensure that deploying cash between strategic and growth initiative and returning cash to shareholders, enhances our current rate of return while at the same time achieving our strategic and operational growth goals.
A few other items to highlight for you; year-to-date, the total store base has increased by 99 stores, or roughly one-third of our 2008 new store growth rate the effective tax rate for the second quarter was 33.2% compared to 35.2% in the second quarter of 2009. With the decrease due to the accounting funds certain tax positions.
Based on the success of the company's new power of rewards loyalty program, an in-store DLC sales pilot, these two initiatives will be rolled out nationally during the third quarter. GameStop is adjusting its third quarter diluted earnings per share guidance, to range from $0.35 to $0.38. To account for incremental expenses related to these programs as well as for the upfront expenses in the Kongregate acquisition and investments in e-commerce.
This earnings per share range represents a 9% to 19% increase over the prior year quarter. Internationally, our expectations from meaningful economic recovery, in the countries which we operate have not yet materialized. So we have tempered our second half growth estimates, which will offset the upside we expect to capture from the Sony Move launch and our efforts to drive operating margin.
Based on the used inventory and trade in comp improvements seen over the last few weeks, we project that the used products category will increase between 7% and 9% in the third quarter. This growth corresponds to the initial use growth forecast of 5% to 10% for the full year. We project that $0.03 of earnings per share can be realized in the forth quarter from the new customer initiative and the launch of Microsoft's Kinect. Therefore, we are maintaining our full year 2010 guidance of diluted earnings per share at the range from 258 to 268. Total sales growth of between 4% and 6%.
In comparable store sales ranging from flat to 2%, we continue to monitor foreign currency exchange rates very closely. At this time, we project that the impacts on the third quarter and for the full year will be immaterial when comparing current projected rates to the rates we projected at the beginning of the year.
Tony will now provide an update on our digital strategy.

During the quarter, we completed the staffing of our e-commerce development team and have begun to execute the road map we developed to drive significant e-commerce growth.
We've already made significant changes to the website including streamlining the check out process, updating our search engine and improving our merchandising features. From a marketing perspective, we increased our paid search and affiliate advertising and have tested several discount strategies to compete where necessary with aggressive price points on the web. Also, we are leveraging our growing database that has over 35 million customer records to drive growth through targeted emails.
And these efforts have paid off. In the first half of the year, our online market share has grown by 50% over last year according to MPD. During this time, we were the fastest growing dot com in the gaming segment. Much of this growth was driven by attracting female shoppers as our market share among females more than double over last year.
With our development team in place, we'll now increase the pace of changes to our website. During Q3, we will begin rolling out a buy online, pickup in store program, fully implement our royalty program on the web, incorporate the sale of Microsoft and Sony Digital add on content including STOA, full game downloads and launch our enhanced user abusing social commerce features.
In addition, we will launch in store programs that will incent our customers to leverage our website and will increase our advertising sales force to better monetize the quickly growing 15 million unique customers that we see on a monthly basis.
In late July, we announced the acquisition of Kongregate. Kongregate represents an integral part of our strategy to become the aggregator of choice in the online gaming space. We looked at many companies that offered an online gaming platform and we chose Kongregate due to its fit with our strategy. Kongregate has well-designed technologies that allows developers to quickly and easily offer their games on the Kongregate platform and on mobile phones running the Android operating system.
In today's advertising, the micro-transaction monetization method to a robust achievement system Kongregate provides developers with tools to maximize their revenue. This is evidenced by the fact that over 8,500 developers have lost over 30,000 games to-date on this platform.
Kongregate also syncs well with our existing customer base. While Kongregate has games that cover all genres, its base of over 10 million monthly users skews more mail and more core than most online gaming sites. This provides for a natural transition to leverage the $0.5 billion business that we see annually in our stores and the 15 million monthly users of gamestop.com to send traffic to Kongregate's site.
Kongregate will have no material impact on 2010 earnings. And we do anticipate that it will positively impact our ROs IC calculation in the coming years.
With that I'll turn it over to the moderator for Q&A.

The first point is, we are seeing a tremendous participation. We called out the number of transactions that include a PowerUp number. That gives us great visibility when over 50% of the transactions have a PowerUp number associated with them. So we can look at that consumer behavior pretty well.
And 50% is not our goal. Remember that Micromania in France where we modeled some of this was significantly higher than that and they've been at it for 10 to 12 years. We also know that frequency is up significantly on PowerUp numbers versus non-PowerUp numbers, which means we're getting a lot more visits from the same customer, and getting also significantly more trades in used business.
That's going to drive lots of comp growth we think, in the markets where we roll this out. And candidly, David, we've been surprised by consumer acceptance. Everybody in our organization, we were optimistic about the program. But if you go to those markets where we're live today, which you'll see as a consumer, almost a frenzy to get into the program.
We also are very encouraged by our game libraries. The reason that is important is, we now know what consumers have bought from us, what they would like to have from us, and what they could potentially trade with us. So that is going to give an opportunity to market to them and drive sales and comps as well.

They visit us more frequently; want to know what's going on at GameStop today. We're also seeing more used and more trade activity. The program is also very incremental.
One of the things that we've been surprised by, we've had an Edge card program for many years at GameStop. There is a large amount of people who are not Edge members, who are signing up for the PowerUp paid program, which means we're getting a lot more non-core audience participating in the program, a lot more moms, a lot more female shoppers, casual shoppers, etcetera.
So all of that is rolling up into us; just about the best idea we've got to get in to hit a holiday and be ready for those consumers.

As far as the first used codes, we look at the title that have the first used codes and we look at the trade volume and the used inventories on those and just haven't seen an impact yet. Just a point on the first used codes; remember that only 25% of used buyers play online. So when we talk about those first used codes, it's not a large audience of gamers that you're talking about.

With me today are Paul Raines, our CEO; Tony Bartel, our President; Rob Lloyd, EVP and CFO; and Mike Mauler, our EVP of International. 
As you know, in early June, we announced these promotions as the next step in the succession plan that Dick Fontaine and I developed several years ago. The team, now led by Paul, is doing a great job at running the business and making significant progress on our strategic initiatives, which you will be hearing about more today. 
As you can see, we gained significant market share in a market that is struggling for growth. The data suggests that U.S. software sales slipped 7% in the quarter, but GameStop's U.S. software sales grew significantly. We believe that the slate of new releases for the back half is stronger than last year. 
And the new console add-ons, Kinect and Move, will help grow the category and return to positive growth. Also, new console sales and units grew an overall 43% in the quarter, and these new users should be very active buying games in the coming months. 
Whatever you believe, we are well-positioned to continue market share growth and manage our business to create shareholder value. Our portfolio of stores has very flexible lease terms, and we can right size for the market quickly. We have slowed our new stores footage and will continue to do so while taking advantage of real estate opportunities to grow share.
Our investments in alternative game distribution methods are well thought out, have synergies with existing assets and give us a hedge on the future without a huge investment. Our investments and other initiatives, such as our new loyalty program are working well, and you will hear more on this later from Paul. And given the free cash flow we generate, you will hear on how we plan on using this cash to provide even greater shareholder returns in the near future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a thorough review of the quarter."

As we begin our comments this morning, we want to thank our team of over 50,000 associates worldwide. The GameStop teams in 17 countries continue to demonstrate our passion for serving video game customers everyday and we appreciate them.",1046,"Thank you, Dan. As we begin our comments this morning, we want to thank our team of over 50,000 associates worldwide. The GameStop teams in 17 countries continue to demonstrate our passion for serving video game customers everyday and we appreciate them. 
We saw strength in the Core business this quarter driven by new software titles. New software grew 5.3% as the GameStop model of providing unique content to drive reserves, exciting midnight launches and the best value proposition of buy-sell-trade drove record market share at launch. Hardware growth was driven by exciting new SKUs from PS3, black Wii and the new Xbox Slim. 
The Used business, which is overlapping 19% growth in 2Q of 2009, grew just under 1%. Next generation used software continues to grow while older generation continues to decline. On the hardware side, used hardware sales were impacted by the growth of new hardware. 
As we have pointed out in the past, the used sales growth lags that of new by three to six months as customers purchase hot new titles and trade them once they are done playing them. We have built our used inventory levels this quarter through a 10.6% trade comp, and that inventory growth gives us confidence on back-half used growth. 
We have seen no competitive impact from emerging competitors in the Used business and also have not seen any impact from the first user codes in recent titles. We are watching carefully the latest round of competitor entries in the Used business, but would remind investors of the extensive competitive barriers GameStop has built around the Used business. Rob will give you details around our back-half forecast in his remarks.
Our customer service metrics continue to improve to record levels as the GameStop team engages customers in-store with industry-leading knowledge and focus on only video games. Our consumers continue to tell us that we set the standard for the in-store experience, thanks to our trusted game advisors, and our record market share growth validate that consumer feedback.
Our International business continues to face pressure from the macroeconomic environment. Mike Mauler and his team have accelerated the roll out of best practices to drive operations improvement. On the merchandising side, we are making progress on integrating our Go Big launch process internationally, and we will launch our first title with unique content globally this fall.
As you know, we developed a strategy over the last two years to make GameStop a multi-channel aggregator of gaming. As part of that strategic work, we defined several technology initiatives and they have been in pilot over the last year. We announced this morning that we will be accelerating our successful strategic initiatives in the third quarter, and we would like to give you some color on our thinking in that area.
The PowerUp Rewards program, which is the name of our new loyalty initiative, is now live in over 500 stores in multiple markets across the United States, and we have over 350,000 affiliated members. Our projections put us on a path to several million members in the first year. And in the lead markets, the program is already twice the size of our Edge program. 
After only 10 weeks in pilot, members represent over 50% of all transactions in those markets. And we are seeing growth in consumer segments that were not participating previously in our Edge program. PowerUp members are shopping at roughly twice the frequency of non-members, and 15% of members have shopped us five times or more in the last 10 weeks. We are also seeing a higher level of trades in used sales from PowerUp members. 
Publishers are showing strong interest in participating in the program, and our Epic Reward's calendar already has a waiting list. 40% of our members have already completed their game libraries online, and we now have millions of games registered in the collective libraries of PowerUp members. We believe the PowerUp Rewards program has struck a chord with our customers, and we will accelerate the program to be live in all stores nationally during the third quarter. The costs associated with that rollout are one of the best investments we can make to increase purchase frequency and deepen consumers' relationships with GameStop ahead of holiday.
Now, onto downloadable content. In partnership with Microsoft, we started our downloadable content initiative during the second quarter in 35 stores. Consumer acceptance has been strong, as gamers enjoy being able to buy add-on content while they are shopping with their trusted game advisor. Our assortment continues to grow, and our proprietary Code Server technology continues to serve consumers shopping in-store via our digital kiosks and very soon, online. We will be rolling out that initiative nationally during August and we'll be adding DLC from Sony during the quarter. As discovery DLC in-store increases, so do the number of transactions with the digital SKU. And that number is now 5% of total transactions during the second quarter, representing an 80% year-over-year increase.
We are also making very strong progress on our GameStop.com journey and added a major component of our strategy with the acquisition of Kongregate.com during the quarter. Tony Bartel will give you color on both of these items and our digital aggregation strategy in his remarks.
We know that investors have been mixed on their view of GameStop's terminal value, and we have spent a lot of time looking at our capital allocation. As a team, we are committed to providing shareholders a return on their invested capital. We have a framework to increase those returns through a multi-channel approach that leverages our brick-and-mortar footprint with emerging digital channels and have a filtering process that examines the ROIC of every major investment we make. 
Our new stores consistently exceed their performance targets, and our strong cash flow allows for investments in the digital future while also returning cash to shareholders. Ralph will give you more color on our approach in this area.
In conclusion, we told you a year ago that we were developing a multi-channel strategy enabled by technology innovation to be the gaming aggregator across physical and digital channels, and we are delivering on that commitment in a disciplined way.
I will now turn the call over to Rob for his remarks."

This morning, we announced our financial results for the second quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 3.4% to $1.8 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 5.3% on the strength of Red Dead Redemption, Super",974,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our financial results for the second quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 3.4% to $1.8 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 5.3% on the strength of Red Dead Redemption, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and NCAA Football 2011. 
Strong sell-through of new hardware, up 4% from the second quarter of 2009, also contributed to topline growth. NPD reported a 43% increase in next generation console units sold in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. GameStop had a 60% increase in its sales of next gen consoles. Comparable store sales were 0.9% at the midpoint of guidance. We expect comps to be positive for the remainder of the fiscal year based on the strong line-up of new titles, new hardware, Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect. 
Following impressive market share gains in the first quarter, GameStop continued to take share in the new video game software category. Our quarterly new software growth correlates to a 590 basis point increase in new software market share. Considering that the majority of the title launches in the third quarter appeal to the core gamer, we expect our new software market share to remain very healthy.
Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing the company's 2010 worldwide new video game software sales growth forecast from 2% to 5%, to 5% to 10%. Net earnings were $40.3 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, a 13% increase over the prior year quarter and in-line with guidance of $0.25 to $0.27 per share. Consolidated gross margins expanded to 28.7% from 28.5% in the prior year quarter as margins in each category improved. 
SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of sales, in-line with our previously anticipated increase of 30 to 40 basis points as we invest in strategic initiatives. The FX impact in the second quarter reduced company sales by $13 million due to the European currencies, but the impact on operating earnings was immaterial. 
Moving on to the balance sheet, GameStop closed the quarter with $289 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 0.6% on a per store basis year-over-year. We continue to maintain tight inventory control during this uncertain economy. During the quarter, GameStop repurchased and retired 2.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $20.93 per share, using our remaining $52.8 million available of the $300 million share repurchase plan. 
As Dan and Paul mentioned earlier, over the last few months, we have projected our future cash needs in order to appropriately define our long-term capital needs and build a capital allocation program, which reflects our focus on return on invested capital. We believe the business will continue to produce adequate cash flow from operations over the next four to five years to fund our prudent and vigilant store expansion and strategic digital investments and acquisitions, fund debt maturities and allow us to develop a plan to repurchase shares on an annual basis. 
GameStop's return on invested capital, as defined by Bloomberg, at 13% is in the top half of a peer group of more than 20 retailers and approximately 100 basis points above the average of that group. As we navigate through the remainder of this video game cycle, GameStop is committed to improving its ROIC by at least 400 basis points. This will be accomplished by measuring the returns of the aforementioned objectives, both individually and collectively, to ensure that deploying cash between strategic and growth initiative and returning cash to shareholders enhances our current rate of return while at the same time, achieving our strategic and operational growth goals.
A few other items to highlight for you. Year to date, the total store base has increased by 99 stores, or roughly 1/3 of our 2008 new store growth rate. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 33.2% compared to 35.2% in the second quarter of 2009, with the decrease due to accounting for uncertain tax positions.
Based on the success of the company's new PowerUp Rewards loyalty program and in-store DLC sales pilot, these two initiatives will be rolled out nationally during the third quarter. GameStop is adjusting its third quarter diluted earnings per share guidance to range from $0.35 to $0.38 to account for incremental expenses related to these programs as well as for the upfront expenses of the Kongregate acquisition and investments in e-commerce. This earnings per share range represents a 9% to 19% increase over the prior year quarter.
Internationally, our expectations for a meaningful economic recovery in the countries in which we operate have not yet materialized. So we have tempered our second half growth estimates, which will offset the upside we expect to capture from the Sony Move launch and our efforts to drive operating margin. Based on the used inventory and trading comp improvement seen over the last few weeks, we project that the used products category will increase between 7% and 9% in the third quarter. This growth corresponds to the initial used growth forecast of plus 5% to plus 10% for the full year. 
We project that $0.03 of earnings per share can be realized in the fourth quarter from the new customer initiatives and the launch of Microsoft's Kinect. Therefore, we are maintaining our full year 2010 guidance of diluted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.68, total sales growth of between 4% and 6% and comparable store sales ranging from flat to plus 2%. We continue to monitor foreign currency exchange rates very closely. At this time, we project that the impact in the third quarter and for the full year will be immaterial when comparing current projected rates to the rates we projected at the beginning of the year. 
Tony will now provide an update on our digital strategy."

I would like to provide an update on two of our strategic initiatives, the evolution of our e-commerce site and the development of our digital aggregation site. 
During the quarter, we completed the staffing of our e-commerce development team and have begun to execute the roadmap that we developed to drive significant e-commerce growth. We've already made significant changes to the website, including streamlining the checkout process, updating our search engine and improving our merchandising features. From a marketing perspective, we increased our paid search and affiliate advertising and have tested several discount strategies to compete where necessary, with aggressive price points on the web. Also, we are leveraging our growing database that has over 35 million customer records to drive growth through targeted e-mails. And these efforts have paid off. 
In the first half of the year, our online market share has grown by 50% over the last year according to NPD. During this time, we were the fastest-growing dot-com in the Gaming segment. Much of this growth was driven by attracting female shoppers, as our market share among females more than doubled over the last year. With our development team in place, we will now increase the pace of changes to our website. During Q3, we will begin rolling out a Buy Online Pickup In-Store program, fully implement our loyalty program on the web, incorporate the sale of Microsoft and Sony digital add-on content, including XBLA [Xbox Live Arcade] full game downloads, and launch our enhanced user reviews and social commerce features. 
In addition, we will launch in-store programs that will incent our customers to leverage our website, and we'll increase our advertising sales force to better monetize the quickly growing 15 million unique customers that we see on a monthly basis. 
In late July, we announced the acquisition of Kongregate. Kongregate represents an integral part of our strategy to become the aggregator of choice in the online gaming space. We looked at many companies that offered an online gaming platform, and we chose Kongregate due to its fit with our strategy. Kongregate has well-designed technology that allows developers to quickly and easily offer their games on the Kongregate platform and on mobile phones running the Android operating system. 
From integrated advertising to microtransaction monetization methods to a robust achievement system, Kongregate provides developers with tools to maximize their revenue. This is evidenced by the fact that over 8,500 developers have launched over 30,000 games to date on this site. 
Kongregate also syncs well with our existing customer base. While Kongregate has games that cover all genres, its base of over 10 million monthly users skews more mail and more core than most online gaming sites. This provides for a natural transition to leverage the 0.5 billion visits that we see annually in our stores and the 15 million monthly users of GameStop.com to send traffic to Kongregate's site. Kongregate will have no material impact on 2010 earnings, and we do anticipate that it will positively impact our ROIC calculation in the coming years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the moderator for Q&A."

The first point is we're seeing a tremendous participation. We called out the number of transactions that include a PowerUp member. That gives us great visibility when over 50% of the transactions have a PowerUp member associated with them. So we can look at that consumer behavior pretty well, and 50% is not our goal. Remember that Micromania in France, where we modeled some of this, was significantly higher than that, and they've been at it for 10 to 12 years. We also know that frequency is up significantly on PowerUp members versus non-Power Up members, which means we're getting a lot more visits from the same customer and getting also significantly more trades and Used business. That's going to drive lots of comp growth, we think, in the markets where we roll this out. And candidly, David, we've been surprised by consumer acceptance. Everybody in our organization has been a little bit -- we were optimistic about the program. But if you go to those markets where we're live today, what you'll see is a consumer almost at frenzy to get into the program. We also are very encouraged by our game libraries. The reason that's important is we now know what consumers have bought from us, what they would like to have from us and what they could potentially trade with us. So that's going to give us an opportunity to market to them and drive sales and comps as well."

We're also seeing a huge impact with our associates. Our associates are energized by the program. It's been a real positive around customer service and been a positive around used and trade. So too soon for us to give you a projection on that. But internally, we're running a lot of numbers, and we believe we'll have a significant impact by moving the program up."

With me today are Paul Raines, our CEO; Tony Bartel, our President; Rob Lloyd, EVP and CFO; and Mike Mauler, our EVP of International. 
As you know, in early June, we announced these promotions as the next step in the succession plan that Dick Fontaine and I developed several years ago. The team, now led by Paul, is doing a great job at running the business and making significant progress on our strategic initiatives, which you will be hearing about more today. 
As you can see, we gained significant market share in a market that is struggling for growth. The data suggests that U.S. software sales slipped 7% in the quarter, but GameStop's U.S. software sales grew significantly. We believe that the slate of new releases for the back half is stronger than last year. 
And the new console add-ons, Kinect and Move, will help grow the category and return to positive growth. Also, new console sales and units grew an overall 43% in the quarter, and these new users should be very active buying games in the coming months. 
Whatever you believe, we are well-positioned to continue market share growth and manage our business to create shareholder value. Our portfolio of stores has very flexible lease terms, and we can right size for the market quickly. We have slowed our new stores footage and will continue to do so while taking advantage of real estate opportunities to grow share.
Our investments in alternative game distribution methods are well thought out, have synergies with existing assets and give us a hedge on the future without a huge investment. Our investments and other initiatives, such as our new loyalty program are working well, and you will hear more on this later from Paul. And given the free cash flow we generate, you will hear on how we plan on using this cash to provide even greater shareholder returns in the near future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a thorough review of the quarter."

As we begin our comments this morning, we want to thank our team of over 50,000 associates worldwide. The GameStop teams in 17 countries continue to demonstrate our passion for serving video game customers everyday and we appreciate them. 
We saw strength in the Core business this quarter driven by new software titles. New software grew 5.3% as the GameStop model of providing unique content to drive reserves, exciting midnight launches and the best value proposition of buy-sell-trade drove record market share at launch. Hardware growth was driven by exciting new SKUs from PS3, black Wii and the new Xbox Slim. 
The Used business, which is overlapping 19% growth in 2Q of 2009, grew just under 1%. Next generation used software continues to grow while older generation continues to decline. On the hardware side, used hardware sales were impacted by the growth of new hardware. 
As we have pointed out in the past, the used sales growth lags that of new by three to six months as customers purchase hot new titles and trade them once they are done playing them. We have built our used inventory levels this quarter through a 10.6% trade comp, and that inventory growth gives us confidence on back-half used growth. 
We have seen no competitive impact from emerging competitors in the Used business and also have not seen any impact from the first user codes in recent titles. We are watching carefully the latest round of competitor entries in the Used business, but would remind investors of the extensive competitive barriers GameStop has built around the Used business. Rob will give you details around our back-half forecast in his remarks.
Our customer service metrics continue to improve to record levels as the GameStop team engages customers in-store with industry-leading knowledge and focus on only video games. Our consumers continue to tell us that we set the standard for the in-store experience, thanks to our trusted game advisors, and our record market share growth validate that consumer feedback.
Our International business continues to face pressure from the macroeconomic environment. Mike Mauler and his team have accelerated the roll out of best practices to drive operations improvement. On the merchandising side, we are making progress on integrating our Go Big launch process internationally, and we will launch our first title with unique content globally this fall.
As you know, we developed a strategy over the last two years to make GameStop a multi-channel aggregator of gaming. As part of that strategic work, we defined several technology initiatives and they have been in pilot over the last year. We announced this morning that we will be accelerating our successful strategic initiatives in the third quarter, and we would like to give you some color on our thinking in that area.
The PowerUp Rewards program, which is the name of our new loyalty initiative, is now live in over 500 stores in multiple markets across the United States, and we have over 350,000 affiliated members. Our projections put us on a path to several million members in the first year. And in the lead markets, the program is already twice the size of our Edge program. 
After only 10 weeks in pilot, members represent over 50% of all transactions in those markets. And we are seeing growth in consumer segments that were not participating previously in our Edge program. PowerUp members are shopping at roughly twice the frequency of non-members, and 15% of members have shopped us five times or more in the last 10 weeks. We are also seeing a higher level of trades in used sales from PowerUp members. 
Publishers are showing strong interest in participating in the program, and our Epic Reward calendar already has a waiting list. 40% of our members have already completed their game libraries online, and we now have millions of games registered in the collective libraries of PowerUp members. We believe the PowerUp Rewards program has struck a chord with our customers, and we will accelerate the program to be live in all stores nationally during the third quarter. The costs associated with that rollout are one of the best investments we can make to increase purchase frequency and deepen consumers' relationships with GameStop ahead of holiday.
Now on to downloadable content. In partnership with Microsoft, we started our downloadable content initiative during the second quarter in 35 stores. Consumer acceptance has been strong, as gamers enjoy being able to buy add-on content while they are shopping with their trusted game advisor. Our assortment continues to grow, and our proprietary Code Server technology continues to serve consumers shopping in-store via our digital kiosks and very soon, online. We will be rolling out that initiative nationally during August and we'll be adding DLC from Sony during the quarter. As discovery of DLC in-store increases, so do the number of transactions with the digital SKU. And that number is now 5% of total transactions during the second quarter, representing an 80% year-over-year increase.
We are also making very strong progress on our GameStop.com journey and added a major component of our strategy with the acquisition of Kongregate.com during the quarter. Tony Bartel will give you color on both of these items and our digital aggregation strategy in his remarks.
We know that investors have been mixed on their view of GameStop's terminal value, and we have spent a lot of time looking at our capital allocation. As a team, we are committed to providing shareholders a return on their invested capital. We have a framework to increase those returns through a multi-channel approach that leverages our brick-and-mortar footprint with emerging digital channels and have a filtering process that examines the ROIC of every major investment we make. 
Our new stores consistently exceed their pro forma targets, and our strong cash flow allows for investments in the digital future while also returning cash to shareholders. Ralph will give you more color on our approach in this area.
In conclusion, we told you a year ago that we were developing a multi-channel strategy enabled by technology innovation to be the gaming aggregator across physical and digital channels, and we are delivering on that commitment in a disciplined way.
I will now turn the call over to Rob for his remarks."
1342560,110189688,75583,"GameStop Corp., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2010",2010-08-19,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our financial results for the second quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 3.4% to $1.8 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 5.3% on the strength of Red Dead Redemption, Super",975,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our financial results for the second quarter of 2010. Total sales increased 3.4% to $1.8 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 5.3% on the strength of Red Dead Redemption, Super Mario Galaxy 2 and NCAA Football 2011. 
Strong sell-through of new hardware, up 4% from the second quarter of 2009, also contributed to topline growth. NPD reported a 43% increase in next generation console units sold in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. GameStop had a 60% increase in its sales of next gen consoles. Comparable store sales were 0.9% at the midpoint of guidance. We expect comps to be positive for the remainder of the fiscal year based on the strong line up of new titles, new hardware, Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect. 
Following impressive market share gains in the first quarter, GameStop continued to take share in the new video game software category. Our quarterly new software growth correlates to a 590 basis point increase in new software market share. Considering that the majority of the title launches in the third quarter appeal to the core gamer, we expect our new software market share to remain very healthy.
Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing the company's 2010 worldwide new video game software sales growth forecast from 2% to 5%, to 5% to 10%. Net earnings were $40.3 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, a 13% increase over the prior year quarter and in-line with guidance of $0.25 to $0.27 per share. Consolidated gross margins expanded to 28.7% from 28.5% in the prior year quarter as margins in each category improved. 
SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of sales, in-line with our previously anticipated increase of 30 to 40 basis points as we invest in strategic initiatives. The FX impact in the second quarter reduced company sales by $13 million due to the European currencies, but the impact on operating earnings was immaterial. 
Moving on to the balance sheet, GameStop closed the quarter with $289 million in cash. Total company inventory levels decreased 0.6% on a per store basis year-over-year. We continue to maintain tight inventory control during this uncertain economy. During the quarter, GameStop repurchased and retired 2.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $20.93 per share, using our remaining $52.8 million available of the $300 million share repurchase plan. 
As Dan and Paul mentioned earlier, over the last few months, we have projected our future cash needs in order to appropriately define our long-term capital needs and build a capital allocation program, which reflects our focus on return on invested capital. We believe the business will continue to produce adequate cash flow from operations over the next four to five years to fund our prudent and vigilant store expansion and strategic digital investments and acquisitions, fund debt maturities and allow us to develop a plan to repurchase shares on an annual basis. 
GameStop's return on invested capital, as defined by Bloomberg, at 13% is in the top half of a peer group of more than 20 retailers and approximately 100 basis points above the average of that group. As we navigate through the remainder of this video game cycle, GameStop is committed to improving its ROIC by at least 400 basis points. This will be accomplished by measuring the returns of the aforementioned objectives, both individually and collectively, to ensure that deploying cash between strategic and growth initiative and returning cash to shareholders enhances our current rate of return while at the same time, achieving our strategic and operational growth goals.
A few other items to highlight for you. Year to date, the total store base has increased by 99 stores, or roughly 1/3 of our 2008 new store growth rate. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 33.2% compared to 35.2% in the second quarter of 2009, with the decrease due to accounting for uncertain tax positions.
Based on the success of the company's new PowerUp Rewards loyalty program and in-store DLC sales pilot, these two initiatives will be rolled out nationally during the third quarter. GameStop is adjusting its third quarter diluted earnings per share guidance to range from $0.35 to $0.38 to account for incremental expenses related to these programs as well as for the upfront expenses of the Kongregate acquisition and investments in e-commerce. This earnings per share range represents a 9% to 19% increase over the prior year quarter.
Internationally, our expectations for a meaningful economic recovery in the countries in which we operate have not yet materialized. So we have tempered our second half growth estimates, which will offset the upside we expect to capture from the Sony Move launch and our efforts to drive operating margin. Based on the used inventory and trading comp improvement seen over the last few weeks, we project that the used products category will increase between 7% and 9% in the third quarter. This growth corresponds to the initial used growth forecast of plus 5% to plus 10% for the full year. 
We project that $0.03 of earnings per share can be realized in the fourth quarter from the new customer initiatives and the launch of Microsoft's Kinect. Therefore, we are maintaining our full year 2010 guidance of diluted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.68, total sales growth of between 4% and 6% and comparable store sales ranging from flat to plus 2%. We continue to monitor foreign currency exchange rates very closely. At this time, we project that the impact in the third quarter and for the full year will be immaterial when comparing current projected rates to the rates we projected at the beginning of the year. 
Tony will now provide an update on our digital strategy."

I would like to provide an update on two of our strategic initiatives, the evolution of our e-commerce site and the development of our digital aggregation site. During the quarter, we completed the staffing of our e-commerce development tea",519,"Thanks, Rob. I would like to provide an update on two of our strategic initiatives, the evolution of our e-commerce site and the development of our digital aggregation site. 
During the quarter, we completed the staffing of our e-commerce development team and have begun to execute the roadmap that we developed to drive significant e-commerce growth. We've already made significant changes to the website, including streamlining the checkout process, updating our search engine and improving our merchandising features. From a marketing perspective, we increased our paid search and affiliate advertising and have tested several discount strategies to compete where necessary, with aggressive price points on the web. Also, we are leveraging our growing database that has over 35 million customer records to drive growth through targeted e-mails. And these efforts have paid off. 
In the first half of the year, our online market share has grown by 50% over the last year according to NPD. During this time, we were the fastest-growing dot-com in the Gaming segment. Much of this growth was driven by attracting female shoppers, as our market share among females more than doubled over the last year. With our development team in place, we will now increase the pace of changes to our website. During Q3, we will begin rolling out a Buy Online Pickup In-Store program, fully implement our loyalty program on the web, incorporate the sale of Microsoft and Sony digital add-on content, including XBLA [Xbox Live Arcade] full game downloads, and launch our enhanced user reviews and social commerce features. 
In addition, we will launch in-store programs that will incent our customers to leverage our website, and we'll increase our advertising sales force to better monetize the quickly growing 15 million unique customers that we see on a monthly basis. 
In late July, we announced the acquisition of Kongregate. Kongregate represents an integral part of our strategy to become the aggregator of choice in the online gaming space. We looked at many companies that offered an online gaming platform, and we chose Kongregate due to its fit with our strategy. Kongregate has well-designed technology that allows developers to quickly and easily offer their games on the Kongregate platform and on mobile phones running the Android operating system. 
From integrated advertising to microtransaction monetization methods to a robust achievement system, Kongregate provides developers with tools to maximize their revenue. This is evidenced by the fact that over 8,500 developers have launched over 30,000 games to date on this site. 
Kongregate also syncs well with our existing customer base. While Kongregate has games that cover all genres, its base of over 10 million monthly users skews more mail and more core than most online gaming sites. This provides for a natural transition to leverage the 0.5 billion visits that we see annually in our stores and the 15 million monthly users of GameStop.com to send traffic to Kongregate's site. Kongregate will have no material impact on 2010 earnings, and we do anticipate that it will positively impact our ROIC calculation in the coming years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the moderator for Q&A."

The first point is we are seeing a tremendous participation. We called out the number of transactions that include a PowerUp member. That gives us great visibility when over 50% of the transactions have a PowerUp member associated with them. So we can look at that consumer behavior pretty well, and 50% is not our goal. Remember that Micromania in France, where we modeled some of this, was significantly higher than that, and they've been at it for 10 to 12 years. We also know that frequency is up significantly on PowerUp members versus non-Power Up members, which means we're getting a lot more visits from the same customer and getting also significantly more trades and Used business. That's going to drive lots of comp growth, we think, in the markets where we roll this out. And candidly, David, we've been surprised by consumer acceptance. Everybody in our organization has been a little bit -- we were optimistic about the program. But if you go to those markets where we're live today, what you'll see is a consumer almost at frenzy to get into the program. We also are very encouraged by our game libraries. The reason that's important is we now know what consumers have bought from us, what they would like to have from us and what they could potentially trade with us.

There have been several big-box competitors who have launched Used business.

Now you know some of the big-box competitors have not really even begun yet, they've announced that they've not started. We haven't seen that. And then, another of the big-box competitors began with a small amount of stores. We haven't seen any expansion there. So on the competitor side, we just don't see the impact yet in our stores. But of course, we take them seriously. We watch them closely. Believe us, a lot of the traffic in those competitor stores are our guys testing the process, et cetera, so we're all over that. As far as the first use codes, we look at the titles that have the first use codes and we look at the trade volume and the used inventories on those and just haven't seen an impact yet. Just a point on the first use codes, remember that only 25% of used buyers play online. So when we talk about those first use codes, it's not a large audience of gamers that you're talking about. That consumer is really not as much of an online player. They're moving that weight some, but it's still not a very large audience."

With me today are Paul Raines, our CEO; Tony Bartel, our President; Rob Lloyd, our EVP and CFO; and Mike Mauler, our EVP of International. This morning, we announced we met the high end of our Q3 EPS range and raised our full year guidance due to continued market share gains, product and product releases that are exceeding expectations.
In the quarter, we rolled out several new initiatives that are performing extremely well. Our new loyalty program, PowerUp Rewards, has been accepted beyond our expectations by the consumer. And Paul will speak more on this initiative later.
GameStop now has the ability to sell add-on digital content in all U.S. stores, making us the first retailer to have the technology and marketing to sell DLC from retail doors. Our recently retooled GameStop.com commerce site is driving huge sales increases and allows the customer now to buy online and pick up in store. And Tony will provide more color on this.
We have added e-commerce sites in Spain, Germany and Ireland during the quarter. And we are now driving traffic to congregate our online game platform from our e-commerce site and retail stores. Tony will discuss plans for this business in his discussion.
So 2010 has been a great year for making huge strides on our strategic initiatives, but we are not done yet. We are planning on taking these all to new levels in 2011 to drive in-store, e-commerce and digital revenues. Also, we understand the evolving nature of gaming and are identifying opportunities to expand the GameStop brand wherever gamers are playing, as we have proven that there's a huge base of customers that shop our stores and play games digitally, such as on Kongregate. We remain focused on continuous regrowth in our return on invested capital through prudent store growth, strategic initiatives to grow market share, aligned investments in the digital space and cash returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul for his comments on the quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year."

I would like to start off my remarks by thanking our team of over 50,000 associates worldwide. GameStop associates around the world continue to bring power to the players by providing the best customer service, value and assortment in video gaming. 
We saw strength in the core business this quarter, driven by new software titles and record market share. New software grew 9%, as new game players reacted well to our unique launch process and by sell trade value proposition.
We were pleased to have the first global launch of unique content with Halo: Reach, as GameStop stores around the world offered consumers unique body armor to drive market share at launch. 
Hardware sales declined 14% due to price cuts and international weakness in hardware. We were also pleased to see positive comps again in our U.S. business.
The Used business, which is overlapping 19% growth in the third quarter of 2009, grew 4%. Next-generation used software continues to grow, while over generation continues to decline. As we have seen in the past, consumers are spending on new titles at launch, with some impact being felt in new software. 
Our same-store used inventory levels are in excellent shape going into the peak holiday season. As we have pointed out in the past, we build inventory aggressively during this time of the year to drive higher sell-through at holiday. And our average inventory levels are well above last year in the Used business.
We are also following closely competitor initiatives in the Used business and execute weekly analysis of used sales in stores within competitor trade areas. That analysis indicates no impacts from competitors to our used sales.
As we told you on our last call, we chose to accelerate the rollout of our PowerUp Rewards program into the third quarter and have now completed that rollout in the United States. Millions of game consumers are now enjoying the unique benefits of the program, and we are building relationships with them that will drive share of wallet through holiday. 
A few color items on PowerUp Rewards. Members are shopping with us 3x as often as nonmembers, and they are above-average customers on both trading games, as well as multichannel shopping. Members are also activating their membership by building their game libraries online and we now have over 20 million games in those libraries, allowing us to market and recommend to those customers in unique ways.
PowerUp Rewards is a key part of our holiday strategy, and you will see us leverage the program to communicate in a stealthy and personal way with our most valuable customers and also support our publishers' launches. 
We are pleased with the progress we are making in executing the multichannel strategy we have developed. Transactions including a digital SKU grew to 9.9% during the third quarter. We watched this metric closely as it gives us a view to the chronology of digital adoption and are seeing more and more consumers buy both digital and physical products in our stores and on our sites.
Unlike any other player in gaming, GameStop is uniquely positioned to understand consumer needs and offer them the right game any time and on any platform. Tony will give you more color on digital sales in stores, on our websites and on our digital gaming platform in his remarks.
In terms of our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are seeing strong consumer reaction to the title slate and motion accessories. Strong titles, plus Sony Move, Microsoft Kinect and Nintendo are a strong offering for holiday shoppers. We are staffing up for traffic growth, as customers come out to get the right gaming gifts. And we are offering a guaranteed in-stock promise on the hottest video games, including Call of Duty: Black Ops. Lastly, the benefits of PowerUp Rewards are giving gaming consumers one more great reason to shop at GameStop stores and websites. 
I will now pass the call over to Rob."
1342560,115380959,88667,"GameStop Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off my remarks today by reviewing our capital allocation program and providing some commentary on the balance sheet. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we've established the capital allo",756,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off my remarks today by reviewing our capital allocation program and providing some commentary on the balance sheet. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we've established the capital allocation program, which reflects our focus on return on invested capital. We believe the business will continue to produce adequate cash flow from operations over the next four to five years to fund our prudent store expansion and get market share growth, our strategic digital investments and acquisitions, debt maturities and share repurchases.
In the third quarter, we announced the new share and debt repurchase program of $500 million. Since then, we called $200 million of debt on October 29 and repurchased and retired 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $18.91 per share, using just over $49 million of our current $300 million share repurchase plan. After the debt and stock buybacks, GameStop closed the quarter with $181 million in cash.
Total company inventory levels increased 8.3% on a per-store basis year-over-year. The increase is related to having Kinect and Call of Duty: Black Ops inventory in-stock ahead of their respective launches and increases in used inventory. Inventory turns have remained comparable and accounts payable leverage percentages increased from 76.6% to 78%. 
Now I'll review the financial results for the third quarter.
Total sales increased 3.5% to $1.9 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 9%. On the strength of new title launches such as Halo: Reach, Fallout: New Vegas and Medal of Honor. Building on strong U.S. market share gains in the first and second quarters, GameStop continues to take share in the new video game software category. Our year-to-date share gain in new software now stands at 580 basis points. 
U.S. comps were positive for the third quarter in a row, coming in at 5.3%. International comps were lower than planned due to weakness in hardware sales, resulting in total comparable store sales of 1.1%, lower than our guidance of plus 3% to plus 6%. 
Internationally, as we discussed in August, significant economic recovery in the countries in which we operate has not materialized, so we continue to have modest full year growth estimates. Despite this, we expect total company comps to be positive for the remainder of the fiscal year based on a strong line of software titles and consumer excitement for Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect.
As Paul mentioned, the Used category grew 4% during the quarter, which showed improvement from Q2, but less than we'd forecast. Paul also talked about how our used inventory position sets us up for growth in the fourth quarter. We project that the used products category will increase between 8% and 12% in the fourth quarter, bringing full year growth in at 4% to 6%. 
Consolidated gross margins improved by 30 basis points to 28.8% from 28.5% in the prior year quarter as we experienced a shift in sales from low-margin hardware to new software and accessories. Used margins were slightly better than last year, and increased 140 basis points over the second quarter. Continued rollout of best practices have led to improvement in international used gross margins.
SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of sales versus the prior year quarter from 21.3% to 21.5% and were essentially flat on a per-store basis. This is slightly less than our anticipated increase of 30 to 40 basis points for the full year as we invest in strategic initiatives. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.6% compared to 32.5% in the third quarter of 2009, with the decrease due to accounting for uncertain tax positions. 
Net earnings were $54.7 million. And excluding debt retirement costs, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.38, exceeding analysts consensus estimates and showing 19% growth over last year.
Based on the strength in our new Software business, demand for Microsoft Kinect and Sony Move and the effective capital allocation plan, we are raising our fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance. In our second quarter earnings release, we added $0.03 per share to our fourth quarter guidance for the effect of our initiatives in Kinect. And we are now raising that implied guidance range of $1.49 to $1.56 to a range of $1.53 to $1.59. Diluted earnings per share for the full year had been raised from previously released guidance of $2.58 to $2.68, up to a range of $2.63 to $2.69. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tony for his comments."

During the quarter, we continued to evolve our digital efforts both in our stores and on our website. In our stores, we extended our downloadable content efforts by beginning the rollout of Sony downloadable content to all stores, an effort that will be complete in the next three weeks. We also began a first-ever pre-ordering campaign for Halo: Reach, Noble Map Pack that allows the customer to pre-order downloadable content and have the code delivered to them electronically assuming the content is available.
We are launching the Halo: Reach Noble Map Pack as a major game release with the full media campaign focused on pre-ordering, with a GameStop exclusive flaming Mark V Spartan helmet for your Xbox Live avatar. The TV advertising started today, and we are already pleased with the pre-orders that we are receiving.
As we said previously, there's a lot of great content that developers have created to enhance console game play. And we are working with the publisher community to better market these downloadable content launches. Now that we are able to offer digital content on the day of launch, Halo: Reach Noble Map Pack represents our initial entree into the program of preselling and digitally releasing downloadable content on both the Microsoft and Sony platforms. 
As Paul, mentioned earlier, we are seeing a 9.9% attach rate of digital content to our transactions. And half of the customers who purchased downloadable content are purchasing it with a game, so you see that the release of this content is actually driving game purchases.
During Q3, we also made significant changes to our website, including implementing pickup at store, streamlining our checkout process, making our product pages more shoppable, integrating with our PowerUp Rewards program, adding the sale of downloadable content online and expanding our capacity to handle the expected Q4 demand. We continue to be the fastest-growing website in the gaming space as we became the number two largest online game retailer behind Amazon. We more than doubled our sales in Q3 and are poised to have the best Q4 on dot-com in our history.
Our digital gaming platform, Kongregate, continues to thrill online gamers and attract new game developers. As expected, we saw 45% year-over-year growth in traffic in Q3 and are finalizing our plans to integrate PowerUp Rewards into the Kongregate experience in Q4. Microtransactions now account for more than 1/2 of all revenue on Kongregate and continue to grow as a percentage of revenue generated. 
Kongregate provides us with a robust gaming platform that can reach beyond the PC and on the phones, tablets and even into the connected living room. And our roadmap for 2011 includes plans to pursue these areas of growth. Those of you with an Android phone can already enjoy many of Kongregate's great games by accessing the website directly from your Flash-enabled phones.
With that, I'll turn it over to the moderator for questions."

I'm not going to give share on that title. But we've been very pleased with our Kinect sales. The biggest opportunity that we have is just keeping them in stock.

So whenever consumers do see Kinect and they want Kinect for the holiday season, they should pick it up because it will be in short supply during the holiday."

However,",305,"Sure, I can add some color to that. In most countries, the rebound from the recession has been slower than in the U.S. This resulted in lower same-store sales in Q3, which was driven primarily by a major decline in hardware, especially handhelds. However, international, we did see growth in new and used software sales and market share. So actually, this change in mix, as well as improvement in our used margins, resulted in higher overall margin internationally versus prior year. So in Q3, internationally, we drove a 6% earnings increase versus prior year due to those margin increases, as well as aggressive cost control and a number of new initiatives that we rolled out, including e-commerce in three new markets, Spain, Ireland and Germany. We also continued the rollout of our proprietary use pricing model, which was one of the drivers of the used margin increases, and we expanded refurbishment capabilities internationally. So looking forward, Q4 has a real strong slate of new releases, and we anticipate positive comps in the quarter. Let me also touch on future new store growth. For new store growth, we're very focused as was mentioned earlier on ROIC. And so in mature markets like Canada or Australia, we'll see slowing store growth, but we'll be much more judicious in our site selection. However, there are still strong growth opportunities in other markets, such as Italy and Germany. Finally, we continue to expect to gain market through strategic initiatives, many of which are the ones that Tony mentioned, such as the ongoing expansion of our e-commerce capabilities in new markets, DLC worldwide rollout and, finally, international rollout of the PowerUp Rewards Loyalty Program. So that customers in all countries can really see the benefits that the customers are seeing in the U.S. and France currently with their royalty programs."

If you remember our two 2Q call, we were kind of surprised by what our pilot market showed us when we started in May, and we chose to accelerate. One of the reasons is we're seeing consumers far stickier than we thought would they be. We're not ready to talk about all of that for competitive reasons but when we say that people are shopping 3x the frequency, we're really seeing a subset shop has even far more than that. So we're seeing consumers in what is a price parity category, right, because the category is generally all the same price. Given consumers one more reason to turn left into GameStop instead of ride into a big box has turned out to be a very powerful thing. The other thing that's happening, Gary, is our ability to communicate individually with consumers based on their game library has become a very powerful marketing effort. We are seeing a lot of productivity from those unique recommendations we're making in those unique messages. In fact, Tony talked about our DLC launch. That's available only to PowerUp Rewards members, because we're going to communicate with them through our encrypted site at poweruprewards.com.

And what that means that we are bringing in a lot of new people to the paid membership. And the way that looks when you're in a store, we're seeing a lot of moms, dads, grandparents, gift buyers, people who would not be our core edge customer, would not be people who previously had shopped us in used, would not people who previously received our Game Informer magazine. So we are very encouraged by the incremental nature of PowerUp Rewards, both pro and free. And find that it's bringing in a lot of people who weren't aware of GameStop's buy-sell trade, for example, and you know that all the customer work says the more awareness we get of buy-sell trade with the consumer, the more loyal they become because it brings value into the equation, et cetera.

With me today are Paul Raines, our CEO; Tony Bartel, our President; Rob Lloyd, our EVP and CFO; and Mike Mauler, our EVP of International. This morning, we announced we met the high end of our Q3 EPS range and raised our full year guidance due to continued market share gains, product and product releases that are exceeding expectations.
In the quarter, we rolled out several new initiatives that are performing extremely well. Our new loyalty program, PowerUp Rewards, has been accepted beyond our expectations by the consumer. And Paul will speak more on this initiative later.
GameStop now has the ability to sell add-on digital content in all U.S. stores, making us the first retailer to have the technology and marketing to sell DLC from retail doors. Our recently retooled GameStop.com commerce site is driving huge sales increases and allows the customer now to buy online and pick up in store. And Tony will provide more color on this.
We have added e-commerce sites in Spain, Germany and Ireland during the quarter. And we are now driving traffic to congregate our online game platform from our e-commerce site and retail stores. Tony will discuss plans for this business in his discussion.
So 2010 has been a great year for making huge strides on our strategic initiatives, but we are not done yet. We are planning on taking these all to new levels in 2011 to drive in-store, e-commerce and digital revenues. Also, we understand the evolving nature of gaming and are identifying opportunities to expand the GameStop brand wherever gamers are playing, as we have proven that there's a huge base of customers that shop our stores and play games digitally, such as on Kongregate. We remain focused on continuous regrowth in our return on invested capital through prudent store growth, strategic initiatives to grow market share, aligned investments in the digital space and cash returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul for his comments on the quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year."

I would like to start off my remarks by thanking our team of over 50,000 associates worldwide. GameStop associates around the world continue to bring power to the players by providing the best customer service, value and assortment in video gaming. 
We saw strength in the core business this quarter, driven by new software titles and record market share. New software grew 9%, as new game players reacted well to our unique launch process and buy-sell-trade value proposition.
We were pleased to have the first global launch of unique content with Halo: Reach, as GameStop stores around the world offered consumers unique body armor to drive market share at launch. 
Hardware sales declined 14% due to price cuts and international weakness in hardware. We were also pleased to see positive comps again in our U.S. business.
The Used business, which is overlapping 19% growth in the third quarter of 2009, grew 4%. Next-generation used software continues to grow, while older generation continues to decline. As we have seen in the past, consumers are spending on new titles at launch, with some impact being felt in used software. 
Our same-store used inventory levels are in excellent shape going into the peak holiday season. As we have pointed out in the past, we build inventory aggressively during this time of the year to drive higher sell-through at holiday. And our average inventory levels are well above last year in the Used business.
We are also following closely competitor initiatives in the Used business and execute weekly analysis of used sales in stores within competitor trade areas. That analysis indicates no impacts from competitors to our used sales.
As we told you on our last call, we chose to accelerate the rollout of our PowerUp Rewards program into the third quarter and have now completed that rollout in the United States. Millions of game consumers are now enjoying the unique benefits of the program, and we are building relationships with them that will drive share of wallet through holiday. 
A few color items on PowerUp Rewards. Members are shopping with us 3x as often as nonmembers, and they are above-average customers on both trading games, as well as multichannel shopping. Members are also activating their membership by building their game libraries online and we now have over 20 million games in those libraries, allowing us to market and recommend to those customers in unique ways.
PowerUp Rewards is a key part of our holiday strategy, and you will see us leverage the program to communicate in a stealthy and personal way with our most valuable customers and also support our publishers' launches. 
We are pleased with the progress we are making in executing the multichannel strategy we have developed. Transactions, including a digital SKU, grew to 9.9% during the third quarter. We watch this metric closely, as it gives us a view to the chronology of digital adoption and are seeing more and more consumers buy both digital and physical products in our stores and on our sites.
Unlike any other player in gaming, GameStop is uniquely positioned to understand consumer needs and offer them the right game any time and on any platform. Tony will give you more color on digital sales in stores, on our websites and on our digital gaming platform in his remarks.
In terms of our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are seeing strong consumer reaction to the title slate and motion accessories. Strong titles, plus Sony Move, Microsoft Kinect and Nintendo are a strong offering for holiday shoppers. We are staffing up for traffic growth, as customers come out to get the right gaming gifts. And we are offering a guaranteed in-stock promise on the hottest video games, including Call of Duty: Black Ops. Lastly, the benefits of PowerUp Rewards are giving gaming consumers one more great reason to shop at GameStop stores and websites. 
I will now pass the call over to Rob."
1342560,115380959,88727,"GameStop Corp., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off my remarks today by reviewing our capital allocation program and providing some commentary on the balance sheet. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we've established the capital allo",757,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off my remarks today by reviewing our capital allocation program and providing some commentary on the balance sheet. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we've established the capital allocation program, which reflects our focus on return on invested capital. We believe the business will continue to produce adequate cash flow from operations over the next four to five years to fund our prudent store expansion and get market share growth, our strategic digital investments and acquisitions, debt maturities and share repurchases.
In the third quarter, we announced a new share and debt repurchase program of $500 million. Since then, we called $200 million of debt on October 29 and repurchased and retired 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $18.91 per share, using just over $49 million of our current $300 million share repurchase plan. After the debt and stock buybacks, GameStop closed the quarter with $181 million in cash.
Total company inventory levels increased 8.3% on a per-store basis year-over-year. The increase is related to having Kinect and Call of Duty: Black Ops inventory in stock ahead of their respective launches and increases in used inventory. Inventory turns have remained comparable and accounts payable leverage percentages increased from 76.6% to 78%. 
Now I'll review the financial results for the third quarter.
Total sales increased 3.5% to $1.9 billion, driven by new software sales growth of 9% on the strength of new title launches such as Halo: Reach, Fallout: New Vegas and Medal of Honor. Building on strong U.S. market share gains in the first and second quarters, GameStop continues to take share in the new video game software category. Our year-to-date share gain in new software now stands at 580 basis points. 
U.S. comps were positive for the third quarter in a row, coming in at 5.3%. International comps were lower than planned due to weakness in hardware sales, resulting in total comparable store sales of 1.1%, lower than our guidance of plus 3% to plus 6%. 
Internationally, as we discussed in August, significant economic recovery in the countries in which we operate has not materialized, so we continue to have modest full year growth estimates. Despite this, we expect total company comps to be positive for the remainder of the fiscal year based on a strong line of software titles and consumer excitement for Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect.
As Paul mentioned, the Used category grew 4% during the quarter, which showed improvement from Q2, but less than we'd forecast. Paul also talked about how our used inventory position sets us up for growth in the fourth quarter. We project that the Used products category will increase between 8% and 12% in the fourth quarter, bringing full year growth in at 4% to 6%. 
Consolidated gross margins improved by 30 basis points to 28.8% from 28.5% in the prior year quarter, as we experienced a shift in sales from lower-margin hardware to new software and accessories. Used margins were slightly better than last year, and increased 140 basis points over the second quarter. Continued rollouts of best practices have led to improvement in international used gross margins.
SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of sales versus the prior year quarter from 21.3% to 21.5% and were essentially flat on a per-store basis. This is slightly less than our anticipated increase of 30 to 40 basis points for the full year as we invest in strategic initiatives. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.6% compared to 32.5% in the third quarter of 2009, with the decrease due to accounting for uncertain tax positions. 
Net earnings were $54.7 million. And excluding debt retirement costs, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.38, exceeding analyst consensus estimates and showing 19% growth over last year.
Based on the strength in our new Software business, demand for Microsoft Kinect and Sony Move and the effective capital allocation plan, we are raising our fourth quarter and full year 2010 guidance. In our second quarter earnings release, we added $0.03 per share to our fourth quarter guidance for the effect of our initiatives in Kinect. And we are now raising that implied guidance range of $1.49 to $1.56 to a range of $1.53 to $1.59. Diluted earnings per share for the full year had been raised from previously released guidance of $2.58 to $2.68, up to a range of $2.63 to $2.69. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tony for his comments."

During the quarter, we continued to evolve our digital efforts both in our stores and on our website. In our stores, we extended our downloadable content efforts by beginning the rollout of Sony downloadable content to all stores, an effort that will be complete in the next three weeks. We also began a first-ever pre-ordering campaign for Halo: Reach, Noble Map Pack that allows the customer to pre-order downloadable content and have the code delivered to them electronically assuming the content is available.
We are launching the Halo: Reach Noble Map Pack as a major game release with the full media campaign focused on pre-ordering, with a GameStop exclusive flaming Mark V Spartan helmet for your Xbox Live avatar. The TV advertising started today, and we are already pleased with the pre-orders that we are receiving.
As we've said previously, there's a lot of great content that developers have created to enhance console game play, and we are working with the publisher community to better market these downloadable content launches. Now that we are able to offer digital content on the day of launch, Halo: Reach Noble Map Pack represents our initial entree into the program of pre-selling and digitally releasing downloadable content on both the Microsoft and Sony platforms. 
As Paul mentioned earlier, we are seeing a 9.9% attach rate of digital content to our transactions. And half of the customers who purchased downloadable content are purchasing it with a game, so we see that the release of this content is actually driving game purchases.
During Q3, we also made significant changes to our website, including implementing pickup at store, streamlining our checkout process, making our product pages more shoppable, integrating with our PowerUp Rewards program, adding the sale of downloadable content online and expanding our capacity to handle the expected Q4 demand. We continue to be the fastest-growing website in the gaming space as we became the number two largest online game retailer behind Amazon. We more than doubled our sales in Q3 and are poised to have the best Q4 on dot-com in our history.
Our digital gaming platform, Kongregate, continues to thrill online gamers and attract new game developers. As expected, we saw 45% year-over-year growth in traffic in Q3 and are finalizing our plans to integrate PowerUp Rewards into the Kongregate experience in Q4. Microtransactions now account for more than 1/2 of all revenue on Kongregate and continue to grow as a percentage of revenue generated. 
Kongregate provides us with a robust gaming platform that can reach beyond the PC and on the phones, tablets and even into the connected living room. And our roadmap for 2011 includes plans to pursue these areas of growth. Those of you with an Android phone can already enjoy many of Kongregate's great games by accessing the website directly from your Flash-enabled phones.
With that, I'll turn it over to the moderator for questions."

In most countries, the rebound from the recession has been slower than in the U.S. This resulted in lower same-store sales in Q3, which was driven primarily by a major decline in hardware, especially handhelds. However, internationally, we did see growth in new and used software sales and market share. So actually this change in mix, as well as improvements in our used margins, resulted in higher overall margin internationally versus prior year. So in Q3, internationally, we drove a 6% earnings increase versus prior year due to those margin increases, as well as aggressive cost control and a number of new initiatives that we rolled out, including e-commerce in three new markets, Spain, Ireland and Germany. We also continued the rollout of our proprietary used pricing model, which was one of the drivers of the used margin increases, and we expanded refurbishment capabilities internationally. So looking forward, Q4 has a real strong slate of new releases, and we anticipate positive comps in the quarter. Let me also touch on future new store growth. For new store growth, we're very focused as was mentioned earlier on ROIC. And so in mature markets like Canada or Australia, we'll see slowing store growth, but we'll be much more judicious in our site selection. However, there are still strong growth opportunities in other markets, such as Italy and Germany. Finally, we continue to expect to gain market through strategic initiatives, many of which are the ones that Tony mentioned, such as the ongoing expansion of our e-commerce capabilities in new markets, DLC worldwide rollout and finally, international rollout of the PowerUp Rewards Loyalty Program. So that customers in all countries can really see the benefits that the customers are seeing in the U.S. and France currently with their royalty programs."

And with all the titles that came out in September and October, we continued to see strength in the new and haven't sort of hit that tipping point yet where the used consumer kicks in to the extent that we expect it."

Definitely right now, we have Microsoft rolled out in all of our stores, and Sony is being rolled out in all of our stores in the U.S. at this point. But what we have is a wide assortment and where we are now with Microsoft and where we will be soon with Sony is as new DLC comes out from any publisher, we will be offering that at the same time that it is available for Xbox live users or PSN users so that we can offer it in our store. That gives us the opportunity to allow for pre-order and allow for pre-marketing of that like we do with major titles and then deliver it digitally to our PowerUp Rewards members. So it is a full assortment of DLC that is available. We also have invested lots of money in our POS system and our guides that are in our stores so that we actually recommend automatically DLC with both new and used games and have DLC available."
