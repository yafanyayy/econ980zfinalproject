Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. Well, what a difference a year makes. As you recall this time last year, we were facing unprecedented demand destruction and of course steep declines in manufacturing activity across virtually all sectors. If you look at Slide 4, you'll see we've responded by taking decisive actions throughout the year and the results of those actions are clearly demonstrated in the fourth quarter results. Here, Dow grew earnings year-over-year in the quarter, and we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating earnings in highly challenging economic conditions. But the big story of the quarter is top line growth driven by year-over-year volume gains. We achieved 4% top line growth and 10% higher volumes versus the same quarter last year. This is on a pro forma basis excluding divestitures, which is really the best way to view the underlying performance of our operations. This was driven by strengthening demand across many of our key segments. Sales increased sequentially each quarter of the year and even accelerated during the fourth quarter. The power of our strong geographic footprint manifested itself once again specifically in the emerging geographies of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe, India and the Middle East, which all had double-digit volume growth over the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, the emerging geographies posted volume growth of 33%. EBITDA increased by $809 million in the quarter and in all operating segments, except Health and  Agricultural Sciences, which declined primarily due to increased investment in R&D, as we continue to fund growth in this exciting segment of our company. EBITDA and the combined performance segments was up 88% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, EBITDA was in a $6 billion annualized run rate for the third consecutive quarter. Equity earnings were very strong at $284 million and back to normalized levels not seen since prior to the economic downturn led by strong performance in Dow Corning and EQUATE. These joint ventures will continue to be important elements of our growth strategy going forward. We continued our focus on cash flow, generating $1.4 billion of cash from operations in the quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. We also are well ahead of our goals on cost reductions. We ended the year with a run rate of $1.7 billion in savings from structural cost reductions and cost synergies related to Rohm and Haas. We are now 70% of the way towards our two-year goal of $2.5 billion in savings. We completed the divestment of Morton Salt in the quarter. This was the fourth non-core divestment of 2009, all with strategic buys and all at favorable multiples. We paid off the balance of our bridge loan well ahead of plan, and we also repaid our revolver. In total, we reduced our debt by $2.5 billion since April 1, reducing our net debt-to-cap to 48%, ahead of our goal through to a number of actions I'm going to highlight later. Now this is a very impressive list when taken on its own. But when you consider we did all of this while continuing the integration of Rohm and Haas, cutting costs, reducing our Basics footprint, divesting non-core assets while continuing our many investments for growth, all of which was done during the worst recession in decades. These accomplishments are even more extraordinary. I'm also proud that the Dow team continues its focus on serving customers well and driving top line growth. Looking at Slide 45 and turning to the outlook for industry demand, here again is the tracking tool we showed you last quarter. We saw improvements across many of our end-use industries throughout the year. This underscores the unique view we have into the economic recovery based on our participation of the value chains of a vast array of industries and end markets. On Slide 6, you can see our broad geographic reach, also gives us insights on overall global demand trends. Emerging geographies once again led our growth in the fourth quarter with volumes up 33% over the fourth quarter of last year. Volumes in China, for example, were up nearly 60% and India and Russia were up around 30%. Brazil was up 20%.  Globally, North America was the only region that we did not see volume growth. But even here, there was some bright spots. Automotive demand was improved and the demand for packaging remains resilient. Broader growth, however, continued to lag as high unemployment and reduced consumer spending drag on the progression of the U.S. recovery. Conditions were similar in Europe for many of the same reasons, and the higher value of the euro further impacted exports out of that region. These trends, along with our fourth quarter results, represent clear and positive steps forward in the global economy and in our operating segments. We begin 2010 well-positioned to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions in key areas of the world. Our new portfolio, our R&D engine, our strong geographic presence, our ability to remain financially disciplined will all be key drivers to earnings growth well into the future. I'm going to speak more about these points in a moment. But first, I would like turn the call over to Bill for a review of the fourth quarter. Bill?"

Reported sales were $12.5 billion, an increase of 15% over the same period last year and 3% over the third quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis and excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 4%, driven by a volume growth of 10%. EBITDA, excluding certain items, was up on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter by $809 million. It was basically flat sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally weak quarter. Earnings excluding certain items were $0.18 per share, ending the year with four quarters of positive results. The current quarter included $0.10 per share unfavorable impact for a certain item. Details for these items are included in the appendix. Our tax rate was lower this quarter due to higher earnings in emerging geographies and strong joint venture results. We expect the lower tax rate to continue in 2010 and with estimated rate between 15% to 20% for modeling purposes. As Andrew mentioned, we saw strong volume in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 8, we saw year-over-year improvements in virtually every operating segments and across all geographies, except North America. Strong growth in Electronic Materials of 14% was, however, offset by lower demand in Specialty Materials, driven by a lower capital spending in industrial water applications. We see this as just a temporary pause and remain confident in the long-term fundamentals and the demand for clean water.Emerging regions also clearly performed very well versus last year, while growth in the more developed economies is lagging. On a sequential basis, as you can see on the next slide, volumes rose 3%. This is in spite of normal seasonality is segments, such as Electronic Materials and Coatings and Infrastructure. Once again, emerging geographies led the volume gains.On Slide 10, you can see that price rose sequentially in every operating segment, except Health and Agricultural Sciences in every geography. These gains were largely offset by more than $525 million. These gains largely offset to more than $525 million increase in purchased feedstock and energy cost. As you know, energy prices rose significantly in the last half of December, and we have responded quickly to pass on these increased costs.Now let's take a look at how the company performed at an operating segment level on Slide 11. Electronic and Specialty Materials, as I just mentioned, volume was up 14% in our Electronics business versus last year. Foundry utilization rates remain strong and we do not see the typical seasonal pause. The semiconductor industry also continue to see solid downstream demand. In Specialty Materials, volume was somewhat muted during the quarter in industrial water end markets and demand for Cellulosics used in construction applications was weak in North America and Europe. We continue to see growth in our Coatings and Infrastructure segments, as emerging regions continue to drive increased demand. Significant growth in China was driven by a stimulus program, which strengthens construction and residential end markets. In North America and Japan, we are beginning to see improvement. However, commercial construction continues to be slow in these geographies and in Europe.Now, turning to Health and Agricultural Sciences on Slide 12, the fourth quarter produced double-digit channel sales growth in Ag Chem, as farmers in Brazil resume plantings after a temporary pause last quarter. Seeds, Traits and Oils volume grew 24%, as the business continues to reap rewards of this technology-rich pipeline and recent seed acquisition. This drove sequential and year-over-year volume growth. We remain focused on investing in this segment, given this robust long-term fundamental. Both R&D and SG&A investments increased in the quarter to support product launches and recent seed acquisition.One example of this just last week, Dow AgroSciences announced regulatory approval for Mexico for the importation of corn grain produced from SmartStax. This is an important approval because Mexico is among the world's largest importers of U.S. corn and this ensures they will have access to this world-class technology. Now, let me turn to Performance Systems. Performance Systems continue to show strong operating performance in the quarter. Demand for wind energy applications in China drove growth in our Formulated Systems business, while demand in food packaging and automotive applications strongly benefited our Elastomers business. While there was double-digit increase in light vehicle production within the automotive industry versus last year due to government stimulus, visibility remains unclear in this sector as the programs come to an end.Moving to Performance Products, our Polyurethane Building Block business delivered a solid quarter due to tight supply, increasing demand and further penetration on our unit technologies in the appliance industry. We also saw increased demand for Oxygenated Solvents. These products go into a number of growing healthcare applications, such as hand and surface sanitizers. And lastly, we saw increased demand in Europe for Heat Transfer Fluids used in new Concentrated Solar Power installations.As you can see on Slide 13, our Basic Plastics franchise delivered another outstanding quarter. Continued demand for polyethylene drove double-digit volume growth versus the fourth quarter of 2008. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of polyethylene's volume growth due in part to an open export window from North America due to relatively low gas prices into the weak U.S. dollar. I would also like to point out that the Basic Plastics segment, which is comprised primarily of polyethylene generated $1.7 billion of EBITDA in 2009. In one of the worst economic climates in decades, this is truly an impressive performance.Finally, I am pleased to report that after facing headwinds throughout most of 2009, our Basic Chemicals business showed signs of strengthening. Caustic Soda prices improved after bottoming in the third quarter and Vinyl Chloride Monomer prices rose for the third consecutive quarter on increasing demand. Aggressive economic stimulus efforts in China drove improved performance in EO/EG, a polyester fiber mills, as polyester fiber mills saw an uptick in production. On Slide 14, equity earnings, excluding certain items, were $284 million, which is up 27% sequentially. Once again, this is back to levels we last saw before the economic downturn. Notable contributors to the movement were Down Corning and EQUATE.Turning to our actions on cost control on Slide 15, and in keeping with our long-term heritage of financial and operating discipline, we delivered our structural cost reduction, achieving more than $215 million in the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, SG&A was down 4% in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2008, even with a 15% increase in Ag to support new product launches and commercial activities. On a pro forma basis, R&D spending was up 6%, continuing our investment and growth despite the economic conditions led by increased investments in Dow AgroSciences. And lastly, we made significant progress in our commitments related to cost synergies and our restructuring efforts. On Slide 16, you can see that we're well ahead of our plan to capture the cost synergies related to the acquisition of Rohm and Haas and our structuring program. And we expect to deliver an additional $650 million of savings in 2010 versus 2009. Now, let me hand it back over to Andrew."

Exactly a year ago, I ended my discussion by asking you to judge us by our actions. Despite 2009's  unprecedented demand destruction and the traumatic failure of PIC of Kuwait to close the legally binding joint venture transaction, we acted decisively to reposition ourselves to our new realities. We quickly reduced costs and rightsized our asset footprint to reduce exposure to commodity products in low growth locations. And we increased our presence in high-growth products in fast-growing geographies. We also closed the Rohm and Haas transaction and moved quickly on the cost synergies. As a result, we improved volumes and profits from these actions sequentially throughout the year. And we are benefiting from the pivotal step we took in actually acquiring Rohm and Haas. By year's end, outpace of improvement was increasing as shown by the results in the quarter. We are ahead of all of our operating and financial milestones that we had promised you in early '09. Let me review each of these milestones in turn.On Slide 18, our strategic accomplishments this year were many. As I stated, we acquired and integrated Rohm and Haas, which I believe will be remembered as the singular strategic acquisition that transformed Dow into a higher growth and higher margin business portfolio with significantly improved earnings power. We shed $3 billion of non-core assets at very attractive multiples. This was done ahead of our divestment plan and gave us the proceeds to strengthen our capital structure. We reviewed and recommitted ourselves to our strategy. And after an enterprise-wide review, we remain committed to ongoing and active portfolio management to improve probability and focus resources on higher growth, higher margin opportunities.We have a deliberate and well-put our plan with $12 billion of divestment options, as well as targeted areas for growth. And to me, the best proof of our renewed commitment to grow and deliver shareholder value is our record year of R&D investment, reinforcing our focus on market-driven science-based innovation. On Slide 19, our financial milestones were also an overachievement in a very difficult year. As I mention earlier, we delivered full consecutive quarters of positive operating earnings. And we achieved improved sequential sales throughout the year, reflecting quarterly demand improvement as volume increased particularly in emerging markets. And since the close of Rohm and Haas in April 1, we've taken a number of actions to strengthen our balance sheet. We eliminated the high cost Series B and C preferred shares at par. We've successfully raised equity in an oversubscribed offering and termed out near-term maturities with oversubscribed debt offerings. And we completely paid off the bridge loan ahead of schedule and paid off the remaining balance on the revolver. In addition, we reduced long-term debt maturities through 2011 by 80% and lowered total indefinites by more than $2.5 billion. All of these actions board our net debt-to-total cap down to 48%, which is ahead of our plan. And we lowered our financing costs by $500 million per year. And lastly, as I mentioned at the outset of my talk, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations in 2009. On Slide 20, you can see that we also exceeded our operating goals in every respect, reflecting our commitment to operational discipline and our very strong focus throughout the year. Our actions to reduce structural cost delivered more than $1.2 billion in savings in 2009. And we ended the year with a $1.7 billion run rate, ahead of our plan and 70% of the way towards our two-year goal of $2.5 billion in savings. And we're also well ahead on the cost synergies related to Rohm and Haas. We accelerate our actions and have now achieved 140% of the 12-month costs synergy run-rate target. Finally, we took quick steps to right-size our Basics manufacturing footprint, reducing ethylene consumption on the U.S. Gulf Coast by 30% and repositioning our Basic Chemicals portfolio to more efficiently feed our higher value, higher margin downstream performance businesses.On Slide 21, you can see that overall, this was an amazingly active year with a tremendous number of accomplishments. All of which were made possible because of the hard work of Dow's people around the world.Slide 22, as we look ahead, Dow has all of the elements in place to move forward aggressively on three distinct fronts: Delivering consistent earnings and cash flow, a higher hate of growth and an improved return on capital while doing so. First, we are positioned to be able to drive growth across the board. We have businesses tied to markets that are growing in a multiple of GDP, as well as being present in developing geographies that are providing us tremendous opportunities and driving our earnings trajectory. In fact, we currently predict our revenues will grow by greater than 10% with our new portfolio, driven by science and technology. We expect EBITDA margins to increase from 12% in 2008 to 20% over time with our new portfolio, powered by our ability to provide customers with science-based technology-rich solutions. And we will accelerate these earnings with our new reduced cost structure, which will provide us $2.5 billion in savings by 2011. Also fueling this growth is our innovation engine. In 2009, the $1.6 billion we invested in R&D as a combined entity, which as an aside, is more than the combined R&D budgets of all the university and chemistry programs in the United States is paying up. During the last three years, we have nearly tripled our pipeline valuation to $28 billion by making targeted investments in higher value, higher margin products and businesses. At the same time, as already stated, we have implemented a rigorous cross-company system of portfolio management to ensure every research dollar is well spent. All of this leads to a tremendous earnings power, which would generate significant cash flow that we have committed to both reinvesting in our businesses for growth, while at the same time rewarding our owners.On Slide 23, you have heard me speak throughout this past year of a new Dow. The decisions we made in 2009, along with the speed and decisiveness of the actions we took, we believe that we have firmly delivered the Dow of tomorrow. Today, we have the right portfolio, the right geographic position and the right pipeline, as indicated by all the points in this slide.On Slide 24, you could see the right portfolio is in place to define how we will grow. This portfolio is supported by three integrated business models: Basics, performance and market-driven. And on Slide 25, you could see we now have a robust portfolio of businesses exposed to high-growth industries, such as electronics, coatings, infrastructure, personal care, water, energy, food and agriculture. All with higher EBITDA margins and higher growth. You can see this across our Advanced Materials, AgroSciences and Performance either sciences and performance businesses. And these represent two-thirds of our overall business portfolio and almost all of them have leading industry positions.On Slide 26, we also have the right geographic position. Dow's volume from emerging geographies grew 33% year-over-year and actions we took this year further strengthen our geographic presence and position the company for even greater success. Sales in emerging geographies now represent 32% of our total sales, up from 28% last year. We will continue to expand in these fast-growing geographies. On Slide 27, you can see that we also now have the right pipeline. At our Investor Day in November, we highlighted the power of our innovation engine. This is an engine that today has a potential value of $28 billion, five times higher than in 1997. The more than 500 projects in our innovation table are strategically aligned with four global megatrends: health and nutrition, energy, consumerism and infrastructure and transportation. The $1.6 billion that we plan to invest annually in R&D will continue to be aimed squarely at the intersection of society's greatest needs and business opportunity.A further proof point in innovation is the growth synergies we're gaining from the integration of Rohm and Haas. This growth synergies will produce $2 billion of revenue by the end of 2012 on a run-rate basis and cut across our portfolio, geographies and pipeline. They are focused on new commercial activities, such as cross-selling, to increase our share of products with existing customers, leveraging the new product portfolio and creating new and innovative solutions for customers. In our Coatings business, for example, we've realized a number of successful cross-selling opportunities between our Architectural and Industrial Coatings portfolio. In Ion Exchange business, we delivered additional growth opportunities for industrial water purification. And in Adhesives, our expanded product line was able to capture new business with a global packaging converter. These are just some of the many examples that by the end of the fourth quarter of this year delivered last year, delivered more than $340 million in new annual revenue. So with the right portfolio, the right footprint and the right pipeline, the Dow of tomorrow is here today.On Slide 28, let me address the outlook for 2010. From a geographic perspective, the sustained demand growth we're witnessing in the emerging geographies bodes well for global growth. The recovery in regions, such as China, is creating positive volume opportunities, which have helped us through much of 2009. However, we continue to closely monitor China's overheating manufacturing engine and the potential for the creation of asset bubbles. The Brazilian economy fairs better than most during the global economic recession. And we've seen strong demand rebound there as well. We feel better about the North American and European economies today than we did one year ago, or even one quarter ago, so with the U.S. GDP numbers released last week, point to an economy that is recovering. The impressive 5.7% annualized number in the fourth quarter shows that the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in more than six years, although over half of this was inventory restocking.This much stronger than expected numbers provide yet another data point that our recovery is taking hold. This number also shows that U.S. inventory destocking has ended. And the good news is that we see supply-chain inventory levels remaining low. So the potential for growth and a rebound is there. But high unemployment and questions about the sustainability of government stimulus spending continue to mute the possibility of a strong rebound like the one we saw in '03, '04. Therefore, in our view in the U.S., this recovery looks more like a U than a V. And the opposite is true in the emerging world, which gives us a view that the recovery on the global business this year is probably shaped like a lazy. Our portfolio is perfectly positioned for such an outcome. On our performance side of the business, we have the right exposure to fast-growing sectors, such as electronics, water, coatings, energy, consumer goods and agriculture. And our powerful Basics Plastics franchise now has a relatively low cost position with the increased supply-demand dynamic in U.S. natural gas. Our investments in feedstock flexibility in this region, coupled with our low cost positions in Canada, Kuwait and Argentina will continue to generate strong profits in this business, as the economic recovery takes hold and the cycle turns. Finally, as I just mentioned, our growing presence in the emerging geographies will fuel earnings growth as witnessed by our 33% year-over-year growth from these regions in the fourth quarter alone.On Slide 29, you can see our tracking tool. And this time, it shows the first quarter outlook where we see continued improvement across many of our end-use industries, as you can see from the predominance of green boxes. However, despite the sequential revenue and volume growth throughout 2009 and even the acceleration of our results in the second half of last year, we believe the economic environment continues to warrant caution because of the potential for uneven growth. That's why our plan does not count on a material improvement in economic activity from end-of-year 2009 levels. Accordingly, we will keep a tight rein on costs and capital while maximizing cash flow just as we did last year. This disciplined focus, when coupled with our higher margin, higher growth portfolio, strong geographic presence and invigorated pipeline really positions us well to benefit from the economic recovery.On Slide 30, you know and you've seen our clear path to earnings growth. And this slide, which you will recall from our Investor Day, sets the framework to achieve this goal. We have all the elements in place: A new portfolio, our R&D engine, our strong geographic presence, our ability to remain financially disciplined, as well as our ongoing portfolio management, plus the full retention of our powerful Basics Plastics business. All add up to this new earnings profile, one with significant upside potential and one that we will realize over these next few years with flaws [ph] and rigorous execution, something that Dow is known for. So on Slide 31, that brings me to my priorities for 2010. From a strategic perspective, we will maintain our commitment to innovation-based science and plan to invest the further $1.6 billion in our world-class R&D capabilities to accelerate our future growth on multiple fronts. We will also continue to invest in the emerging geographies to further expand our market and asset presence in this high-growth regions. We will continue our focus on portfolio management by divesting non-core assets. Our target at 2010 is $2 billion. STYRON represents the largest portion of that. I am pleased to report the STYRON divestment process has continued to move forward on a very timely basis. As with any strategic process, we will update you when we have an announcement.The business is now running in a separate structure and is doing very well. And we will seek to deliver on the right asset-light strategy. And we will only do so if it creates a long-term growth enterprise that creates value for our shareholders. We will remain in an active process of exploring our strategic asset-light joint venture.Financially, we'll continue to take the appropriate steps to maintain optionality and financial flexibility. We will remain focused on cash generation with the goal of generating free cash flow of $1.5 billion. As I mentioned before, we will further pay down debt in 2010 with a goal of reaching a net debt to total cap of 45%. We will protect and enhance our investment grade rating. To that end, our intention is to use our excess cash to repay debt. And lastly, on operation priorities, we will maintain our commitment to fix cost reductions and cost synergies at a run rate a $2.5 billion by year end. We will capitalize on the gross synergies related to the integration of Rohm and Haas delivering greater than $500 million on a run rate basis by the end of the year. We will continue to deliver on our working capital disciplined to the tune of $500 million.These priorities are a balance. A balance between appropriate caution and therefore maintaining cost and operating discipline and focus, especially with the uncertainty around the U.S. consumer. And a balance with growth, given our exciting new portfolio, our broad opportunity mix and our transformation into a consistent earnings growth enterprise. And just to repeat one more time, this enterprise is here today.I will now turn the call back to Howard."

Because you're basically funding your Butyl Ether to grow and to restore margins. But you have to obviously, tolerate those cost increases. We're looking at structural cost decreases of $1.2 million year-to-date or end of '09, and another 650 in 2010 that will drop to the bottom line versus '09. So that gives you a sense of the two-year number that is true cost reductions. And we will let cost go up on the good cost side. But if those costs, okay, start, you have to follow the 1.85, then we'll find other ways to mitigate those. And then that's basically our commitment to make sure that 1.85 is the bottom line."

And so look, the volume momentum through the fourth quarter, and whether or not unique in this regard, built up as the quarter went by, and December was a strong month and very unusually so. Of course, what was happening through the quarter also",402,"Correct. And so look, the volume momentum through the fourth quarter, and whether or not unique in this regard, built up as the quarter went by, and December was a strong month and very unusually so. Of course, what was happening through the quarter also on the Basics side, is price increases were being put in place. But hydrocarbon run-up occurred faster than the price increases were allowed. Now, we now have price increases out there on the Basics side, hydrocarbons are attenuating a little bit. So we're playing a price volume titration, but polyethylene has got $0.04 a pound out there already that there are another $0.06 a pound planned for February. So we really -- when you look at the price momentum on Basics, it's all about the operating rates being in the mid- to-low eighties. And certainly with the United States having an export window and China showing robust demand, there's room for price. Now, we expect, in terms of hydrocarbon run-up, another $500 million quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of that is going to flow through not just on the ethylene side but also the propylene side, which will hurt the Performance businesses unless they can get price momentum. Now we do -- as you know, it's harder on the Performance side to get prices to stick, but we have about a 90 day lag. And with price increases announced in semi-commodities like oxygen and solvents, is a good example of that, and a means [ph], some of that should start to stick in the first quarter, and so that 90 day lag, if your lag started in December. We're watching very carefully. Our operating rate is still a little lower than we've wanted, it's in the high 70s, as we see things. As a company, we'd like it to be in the 80s. So we're not going to lose volume with these price increases. Which is why this whole year is a little tenuous at the beginning. We have Chinese New Year in February, so we've got to be careful about that. There will be some shut downs of factories in Asia and China. But in the end, your question is really the story of the quarter. There is price momentum, there's good volume momentum, we saw it in the fourth quarter. We saw it run into from December to January, and we're out there pushing price hard."

And I believe, and we have studied this extensively, some of the points you make the base case. There's is bear case, there's a bull case, and one of your colleagues just recently put out a bearish case, we don't believe that case at all, because of a couple of points you made. Number one, the supply side of this will be constrained coming out of the Middle East, it has been constrained for several years. Even though there will be capacity adds, it won't come on when people think it will come on. We're one of the best operators out there. We had a slow start up of our Kuwait asset, and we're very good at this. So I would tell you have not as much supply coming on, as people think. The second thing is, if you take the normalized GDP globally this year of a roughly 3%, the typical multiplier in polyethylene is 1.4%, 1.5%, that's a 4.5% demand growth that could happen this year, and inventory restocking. Inventory is very low at the moment in the entire chain. So this is a case out there where you could actually go higher than 4.5%, which is in our base case. Then you have six to 9 million tons of high-cost liquids rationalization, three of which is already permanently down. Then you, in fact, your point which is gas is not as fairly available in the Middle East as people think. And then have your extra point, which is the advantage of the United States, which is now the second lowest cost producer on ethane which is an advantage versus naphtha because of where gas is. We have flexi crackers, so we are one of the few that can take advantage of that. 20% of our production in the fourth quarter was exports out of the United States to China and Asia. So when you put all that together, I think there's a case or a trough-like environment in '10, with the excess capacity, a recovery in '11, and a peak environment in the '13 time frame."

The partners we're talking to are all strategic, there's three of them. They are all very, very keen on being our partner, so we can grow this business in a JV construct. JV construct is our strategy for us in the Basics because we believe, like our equity earnings already showed, that we can generate money for the Dow Chemical Company's shareholders on a different construct, in a different ownership structure that will come in below the line and will generate like you saw, $284 million of earnings, a good chunk of that coming from EQUATE last quarter.

Going forward and to answer your question going forward into 2010, our position is that the dollar is going to remain weak, and so we see the same conditions that we got existing today. To answer your question about the tax rate as I mentioned in my prepared comments, the reason the tax rate is lower is because of the significant growth that we've had in the emerging geographies. And as you know, the emerging geographies have a lower tax rate that the more developed countries. And also the quick rebound in our equity earnings, which as you know on the financial statements, are reported at an after-tax basis. If you look at the underlying tax rate for Dow this year, it was about 15%. We see that continuing for 2010. As I mentioned, we think the tax rate will be 15% and 20%.

Now if your look at our positioning though to your point, we are not going to be in the merchant market on EDC/VCM long-term, and our partnership in 2011 with Shintech is obviously over. We have rerightsized our asset footprint to really fundamentally get down to the U.S. Gult Coast where were advantaged, especially on the gas side.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. Well, what a difference a year makes. As you recall this time last year, we were facing unprecedented demand destruction and of course steep declines in manufacturing activity across virtually all sectors. If you look at Slide 4, you'll see we've responded by taking decisive actions throughout the year and the results of those actions are clearly demonstrated in the fourth quarter results. Here, Dow grew earnings year-over-year in the quarter, and we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating earnings in highly challenging economic conditions. But the big story of the quarter is top line growth driven by year-over-year volume gains. We achieved 4% top line growth and 10% higher volumes versus the same quarter last year. This is on a pro forma basis excluding divestitures, which is really the best way to view the underlying performance of our operations. This was driven by strengthening demand across many of our key segments. Sales increased sequentially each quarter of the year and even accelerated during the fourth quarter. The power of our strong geographic footprint manifested itself once again specifically in the emerging geographies of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe, India and the Middle East, which all had double-digit volume growth over the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, the emerging geographies posted volume growth of 33%. EBITDA increased by $809 million in the quarter and in all operating segments, except Health and  Agricultural Sciences, which declined primarily due to increased investment in R&D, as we continue to fund growth in this exciting segment of our company. EBITDA in the combined performance segments was up 88% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, EBITDA was at a $6 billion annualized run rate for the third consecutive quarter. Equity earnings were very strong at $284 million and back to normalized levels not seen since prior to the economic downturn led by strong performance in Dow Corning and EQUATE. These joint ventures will continue to be important elements of our growth strategy going forward. We continued our focus on cash flow, generating $1.4 billion of cash from operations in the quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. We are also well ahead of our goals on cost reductions. We ended the year with a run rate of $1.7 billion in savings from structural cost reductions and cost synergies related to Rohm and Haas. We are now 70% of the way towards our two-year goal of $2.5 billion in savings. We completed the divestment of Morton Salt in the quarter. This was the fourth non-core divestment of 2009, all with strategic buyers and all at favorable multiples. We paid off the balance of our bridge loan well ahead of plan, and we also repaid our revolver. In total, we reduced our debt by $2.5 billion since April 1, reducing our net debt-to-cap to 48%, ahead of our goal through a number of actions I'm going to highlight later. Now this is a very impressive list when taken on its own. But when you consider we did all of this while continuing the integration of Rohm and Haas, cutting costs, reducing our Basics footprint, divesting non-core assets while continuing our many investments for growth, all of which was done during the worst recession in decades, these accomplishments are even more extraordinary. I am also proud that the Dow team continues its focus on serving customers well and driving top line growth. Looking at Slide 4 -- 5 and turning to the outlook for industry demand, here again is the tracking tool we showed you last quarter. We saw improvements across many of our end-use industries throughout the year. This underscores the unique view we have into the economic recovery based on our participation in the value chains of a vast array of industries and end markets. On Slide 6, you can see our broad geographic reach also gives us insights on overall global demand trends. Emerging geographies once again led our growth in the fourth quarter with volumes up 33% over the fourth quarter of last year. Volumes in China, for example, were up nearly 60% and India and Russia were up around 30%. Brazil was up 20%. Globally, North America was the only region that we did not see volume growth. But even here there were some bright spots. Automotive demand was improved and the demand for packaging remained resilient. Broader growth, however, continued to lag as high unemployment and reduced consumer spending dragged on the progression of the U.S. recovery. Conditions were similar in Europe for many of the same reasons, and the higher value of the euro further impacted exports out of that region. These trends, along with our fourth quarter results, represent clear and positive steps forward in the global economy and in our operating segments. We begin 2010 well-positioned to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions in key areas of the world. Our new portfolio, our R&D engine, our strong geographic presence, our ability to remain financially disciplined will all be key drivers to earnings growth well into the future. I'm going to speak more about these points in a moment. But first, I would like turn the call over to Bill for a review of the fourth quarter. Bill?"

Reported sales were $12.5 billion, an increase of 15% over the same period last year and 3% over the third quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis and excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 4%, driven by volume growth of 10%. EBITDA, excluding certain items, was up on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter by $809 million. It was basically flat sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally weak quarter. Earnings excluding certain items were $0.18 per share, ending the year with four quarters of positive results. The current quarter included $0.10 per share unfavorable impact for a certain item. Details for these items are included in the appendix. Our tax rate was lower this quarter due to higher earnings in emerging geographies and strong joint venture results. We expect the lower tax rate to continue in 2010 and with estimated rate between 15% to 20% for modeling purposes. As Andrew mentioned, we saw strong volume in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 8, we saw year-over-year improvements in virtually every operating segments and across all geographies, except North America. Strong growth in Electronic Materials of 14% was, however, offset by lower demand in Specialty Materials, driven by a lower capital spending in industrial water applications. We see this as just a temporary pause and remain confident in the long-term fundamentals and the demand for clean water.Emerging regions also clearly performed very well versus last year, while growth in the more developed economies is lagging. On a sequential basis, as you can see on the next slide, volumes rose 3%. This is in spite of normal seasonality is segments, such as Electronic Materials and Coatings and Infrastructure. Once again, emerging geographies led the volume gains.On Slide 10, you can see that price rose sequentially in every operating segment, except Health and Agricultural Sciences in every geography. These gains were largely offset by more than $525 million. These gains largely offset to more than $525 million increase in purchased feedstock and energy cost. As you know, energy prices rose significantly in the last half of December, and we have responded quickly to pass on these increased costs.Now let's take a look at how the company performed at an operating segment level on Slide 11. Electronic and Specialty Materials, as I just mentioned, volume was up 14% in our Electronics business versus last year. Foundry utilization rates remain strong and we do not see the typical seasonal pause. The semiconductor industry also continue to see solid downstream demand. In Specialty Materials, volume was somewhat muted during the quarter in industrial water end markets and demand for Cellulosics used in construction applications was weak in North America and Europe. We continue to see growth in our Coatings and Infrastructure segments, as emerging regions continue to drive increased demand. Significant growth in China was driven by a stimulus program, which strengthens construction and residential end markets. In North America and Japan, we are beginning to see improvement. However, commercial construction continues to be slow in these geographies and in Europe.Now, turning to Health and Agricultural Sciences on Slide 12, the fourth quarter produced double-digit channel sales growth in Ag Chem, as farmers in Brazil resume plantings after a temporary pause last quarter. Seeds, Traits and Oils volume grew 24%, as the business continues to reap rewards of this technology-rich pipeline and recent seed acquisition. This drove sequential and year-over-year volume growth. We remain focused on investing in this segment, given this robust long-term fundamental. Both R&D and SG&A investments increased in the quarter to support product launches and recent seed acquisition.One example of this just last week, Dow AgroSciences announced regulatory approval for Mexico for the importation of corn grain produced from SmartStax. This is an important approval because Mexico is among the world's largest importers of U.S. corn and this ensures they will have access to this world-class technology. Now, let me turn to Performance Systems. Performance Systems continue to show strong operating performance in the quarter. Demand for wind energy applications in China drove growth in our Formulated Systems business, while demand in food packaging and automotive applications strongly benefited our Elastomers business. While there was double-digit increase in light vehicle production within the automotive industry versus last year due to government stimulus, visibility remains unclear in this sector as the programs come to an end.Moving to Performance Products, our Polyurethane Building Block business delivered a solid quarter due to tight supply, increasing demand and further penetration on our unit technologies in the appliance industry. We also saw increased demand for Oxygenated Solvents. These products go into a number of growing healthcare applications, such as hand and surface sanitizers. And lastly, we saw increased demand in Europe for Heat Transfer Fluids used in new Concentrated Solar Power installations.As you can see on Slide 13, our Basic Plastics franchise delivered another outstanding quarter. Continued demand for polyethylene drove double-digit volume growth versus the fourth quarter of 2008. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of polyethylene's volume growth due in part to an open export window from North America due to relatively low gas prices into the weak U.S. dollar. I would also like to point out that the Basic Plastics segment, which is comprised primarily of polyethylene generated $1.7 billion of EBITDA in 2009. In one of the worst economic climates in decades, this is truly an impressive performance.Finally, I am pleased to report that after facing headwinds throughout most of 2009, our Basic Chemicals business showed signs of strengthening. Caustic Soda prices improved after bottoming in the third quarter and Vinyl Chloride Monomer prices rose for the third consecutive quarter on increasing demand. Aggressive economic stimulus efforts in China drove improved performance in EO/EG, a polyester fiber mills, as polyester fiber mills saw an uptick in production. On Slide 14, equity earnings, excluding certain items, were $284 million, which is up 27% sequentially. Once again, this is back to levels we last saw before the economic downturn. Notable contributors to the movement were Dow Corning and EQUATE.Turning to our actions on cost control on Slide 15, and in keeping with our long-term heritage of financial and operating discipline, we delivered our structural cost reduction, achieving more than $215 million in the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, SG&A was down 4% in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2008, even with a 15% increase in Ag to support new product launches and commercial activities. On a pro forma basis, R&D spending was up 6%, continuing our investment and growth despite the economic conditions led by increased investments in Dow AgroSciences. And lastly, we made significant progress in our commitments related to cost synergies and our restructuring efforts. On Slide 16, you can see that we're well ahead of our plan to capture the cost synergies related to the acquisition of Rohm and Haas and our structuring program. And we expect to deliver an additional $650 million of savings in 2010 versus 2009. Now, let me hand it back over to Andrew."

Exactly a year ago, I ended my discussion by asking you to judge us by our actions. Despite 2009's  unprecedented demand destruction and the traumatic failure of PIC of Kuwait to close the legally binding joint venture transaction, we acted decisively to reposition ourselves to our new realities. We quickly reduced costs and rightsized our asset footprint to reduce exposure to commodity products in low growth locations. And we increased our presence in high-growth products in fast-growing geographies. We also closed the Rohm and Haas transaction and moved quickly on the cost synergies. As a result, we improved volumes and profits from these actions sequentially throughout the year. And we are benefiting from the pivotal step we took in actually acquiring Rohm and Haas. By year's end, outpace of improvement was increasing as shown by the results in the quarter. We are ahead of all of our operating and financial milestones that we had promised you in early '09. Let me review each of these milestones in turn.On Slide 18, our strategic accomplishments this year were many. As I stated, we acquired and integrated Rohm and Haas, which I believe will be remembered as the singular strategic acquisition that transformed Dow into a higher growth and higher margin business portfolio with significantly improved earnings power. We shed $3 billion of non-core assets at very attractive multiples. This was done ahead of our divestment plan and gave us the proceeds to strengthen our capital structure. We reviewed and recommitted ourselves to our strategy. And after an enterprise-wide review, we remain committed to ongoing and active portfolio management to improve probability and focus resources on higher growth, higher margin opportunities.We have a deliberate and well-put our plan with $12 billion of divestment options, as well as targeted areas for growth. And to me, the best proof of our renewed commitment to grow and deliver shareholder value is our record year of R&D investment, reinforcing our focus on market-driven science-based innovation. On Slide 19, our financial milestones were also an overachievement in a very difficult year. As I mention earlier, we delivered full consecutive quarters of positive operating earnings. And we achieved improved sequential sales throughout the year, reflecting quarterly demand improvement as volume increased particularly in emerging markets. And since the close of Rohm and Haas in April 1, we've taken a number of actions to strengthen our balance sheet. We eliminated the high cost Series B and C preferred shares at par. We've successfully raised equity in an oversubscribed offering and termed out near-term maturities with oversubscribed debt offerings. And we completely paid off the bridge loan ahead of schedule and paid off the remaining balance on the revolver. In addition, we reduced long-term debt maturities through 2011 by 80% and lowered total indefinites by more than $2.5 billion. All of these actions board our net debt-to-total cap down to 48%, which is ahead of our plan. And we lowered our financing costs by $500 million per year. And lastly, as I mentioned at the outset of my talk, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations in 2009. On Slide 20, you can see that we also exceeded our operating goals in every respect, reflecting our commitment to operational discipline and our very strong focus throughout the year. Our actions to reduce structural cost delivered more than $1.2 billion in savings in 2009. And we ended the year with a $1.7 billion run rate, ahead of our plan and 70% of the way towards our two-year goal of $2.5 billion in savings. And we're also well ahead on the cost synergies related to Rohm and Haas. We accelerate our actions and have now achieved 140% of the 12-month costs synergy run-rate target. Finally, we took quick steps to right-size our Basics manufacturing footprint, reducing ethylene consumption on the U.S. Gulf Coast by 30% and repositioning our Basic Chemicals portfolio to more efficiently feed our higher value, higher margin downstream performance businesses.On Slide 21, you can see that overall, this was an amazingly active year with a tremendous number of accomplishments. All of which were made possible because of the hard work of Dow's people around the world.Slide 22, as we look ahead, Dow has all of the elements in place to move forward aggressively on three distinct fronts: Delivering consistent earnings and cash flow, a higher hate of growth and an improved return on capital while doing so. First, we are positioned to be able to drive growth across the board. We have businesses tied to markets that are growing in a multiple of GDP, as well as being present in developing geographies that are providing us tremendous opportunities and driving our earnings trajectory. In fact, we currently predict our revenues will grow by greater than 10% with our new portfolio, driven by science and technology. We expect EBITDA margins to increase from 12% in 2008 to 20% over time with our new portfolio, powered by our ability to provide customers with science-based technology-rich solutions. And we will accelerate these earnings with our new reduced cost structure, which will provide us $2.5 billion in savings by 2011. Also fueling this growth is our innovation engine. In 2009, the $1.6 billion we invested in R&D as a combined entity, which as an aside, is more than the combined R&D budgets of all the university and chemistry programs in the United States is paying up. During the last three years, we have nearly tripled our pipeline valuation to $28 billion by making targeted investments in higher value, higher margin products and businesses. At the same time, as already stated, we have implemented a rigorous cross-company system of portfolio management to ensure every research dollar is well spent. All of this leads to a tremendous earnings power, which would generate significant cash flow that we have committed to both reinvesting in our businesses for growth, while at the same time rewarding our owners.On Slide 23, you have heard me speak throughout this past year of a new Dow. The decisions we made in 2009, along with the speed and decisiveness of the actions we took, we believe that we have firmly delivered the Dow of tomorrow. Today, we have the right portfolio, the right geographic position and the right pipeline, as indicated by all the points in this slide.On Slide 24, you could see the right portfolio is in place to define how we will grow. This portfolio is supported by three integrated business models: Basics, performance and market-driven. And on Slide 25, you could see we now have a robust portfolio of businesses exposed to high-growth industries, such as electronics, coatings, infrastructure, personal care, water, energy, food and agriculture. All with higher EBITDA margins and higher growth. You can see this across our Advanced Materials, AgroSciences and Performance either sciences and performance businesses. And these represent two-thirds of our overall business portfolio and almost all of them have leading industry positions.On Slide 26, we also have the right geographic position. Dow's volume from emerging geographies grew 33% year-over-year and actions we took this year further strengthen our geographic presence and position the company for even greater success. Sales in emerging geographies now represent 32% of our total sales, up from 28% last year. We will continue to expand in these fast-growing geographies. On Slide 27, you can see that we also now have the right pipeline. At our Investor Day in November, we highlighted the power of our innovation engine. This is an engine that today has a potential value of $28 billion, five times higher than in 1997. The more than 500 projects in our innovation table are strategically aligned with four global mega-trends: health and nutrition, energy, consumerism and infrastructure and transportation. The $1.6 billion that we plan to invest annually in R&D will continue to be aimed squarely at the intersection of society's greatest needs and business opportunity.A further proof point in innovation is the growth synergies we're gaining from the integration of Rohm and Haas. This growth synergies will produce $2 billion of revenue by the end of 2012 on a run-rate basis and cut across our portfolio, geographies and pipeline. They are focused on new commercial activities, such as cross-selling, to increase our share of products with existing customers, leveraging the new product portfolio and creating new and innovative solutions for customers. In our Coatings business, for example, we've realized a number of successful cross-selling opportunities between our Architectural and Industrial Coatings portfolio. In Ion Exchange business, we delivered additional growth opportunities for industrial water purification. And in Adhesives, our expanded product line was able to capture new business with a global packaging converter. These are just some of the many examples that by the end of the fourth quarter of this year delivered last year, delivered more than $340 million in new annual revenue. So with the right portfolio, the right footprint and the right pipeline, the Dow of tomorrow is here today.On Slide 28, let me address the outlook for 2010. From a geographic perspective, the sustained demand growth we're witnessing in the emerging geographies bodes well for global growth. The recovery in regions, such as China, is creating positive volume opportunities, which have helped us through much of 2009. However, we continue to closely monitor China's overheating manufacturing engine and the potential for the creation of asset bubbles. The Brazilian economy fairs better than most during the global economic recession. And we've seen strong demand rebound there as well. We feel better about the North American and European economies today than we did one year ago, or even one quarter ago, so with the U.S. GDP numbers released last week, point to an economy that is recovering. The impressive 5.7% annualized number in the fourth quarter shows that the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in more than six years, although over half of this was inventory restocking.This much stronger than expected numbers provide yet another data point that our recovery is taking hold. This number also shows that U.S. inventory destocking has ended. And the good news is that we see supply-chain inventory levels remaining low. So the potential for growth and a rebound is there. But high unemployment and questions about the sustainability of government stimulus spending continue to mute the possibility of a strong rebound like the one we saw in '03, '04. Therefore, in our view in the U.S., this recovery looks more like a U than a V. And the opposite is true in the emerging world, which gives us a view that the recovery on the global business this year is probably shaped like a lazy. Our portfolio is perfectly positioned for such an outcome. On our performance side of the business, we have the right exposure to fast-growing sectors, such as electronics, water, coatings, energy, consumer goods and agriculture. And our powerful Basics Plastics franchise now has a relatively low cost position with the increased supply-demand dynamic in U.S. natural gas. Our investments in feedstock flexibility in this region, coupled with our low cost positions in Canada, Kuwait and Argentina will continue to generate strong profits in this business, as the economic recovery takes hold and the cycle turns. Finally, as I just mentioned, our growing presence in the emerging geographies will fuel earnings growth as witnessed by our 33% year-over-year growth from these regions in the fourth quarter alone.On Slide 29, you can see our tracking tool. And this time, it shows the first quarter outlook where we see continued improvement across many of our end-use industries, as you can see from the predominance of green boxes. However, despite the sequential revenue and volume growth throughout 2009 and even the acceleration of our results in the second half of last year, we believe the economic environment continues to warrant caution because of the potential for uneven growth. That's why our plan does not count on a material improvement in economic activity from end-of-year 2009 levels. Accordingly, we will keep a tight rein on costs and capital while maximizing cash flow just as we did last year. This disciplined focus, when coupled with our higher margin, higher growth portfolio, strong geographic presence and invigorated pipeline really positions us well to benefit from the economic recovery.On Slide 30, you know and you've seen our clear path to earnings growth. And this slide, which you will recall from our Investor Day, sets the framework to achieve this goal. We have all the elements in place: A new portfolio, our R&D engine, our strong geographic presence, our ability to remain financially disciplined, as well as our ongoing portfolio management, plus the full retention of our powerful Basics Plastics business. All add up to this new earnings profile, one with significant upside potential and one that we will realize over these next few years with flawless and rigorous execution, something that Dow is known for. So on Slide 31, that brings me to my priorities for 2010. From a strategic perspective, we will maintain our commitment to innovation-based science and plan to invest the further $1.6 billion in our world-class R&D capabilities to accelerate our future growth on multiple fronts. We will also continue to invest in the emerging geographies to further expand our market and asset presence in this high-growth regions. We will continue our focus on portfolio management by divesting non-core assets. Our target at 2010 is $2 billion. STYRON represents the largest portion of that. I am pleased to report the STYRON divestment process has continued to move forward on a very timely basis. As with any strategic process, we will update you when we have an announcement.The business is now running in a separate structure and is doing very well. And we will seek to deliver on the right asset-light strategy. And we will only do so if it creates a long-term growth enterprise that creates value for our shareholders. We will remain in an active process of exploring our strategic asset-light joint venture.Financially, we'll continue to take the appropriate steps to maintain optionality and financial flexibility. We will remain focused on cash generation with the goal of generating free cash flow of $1.5 billion. As I mentioned before, we will further pay down debt in 2010 with a goal of reaching a net debt to total cap of 45%. We will protect and enhance our investment grade rating. To that end, our intention is to use our excess cash to repay debt. And lastly, on operation priorities, we will maintain our commitment to fix cost reductions and cost synergies at a run rate a $2.5 billion by year end. We will capitalize on the gross synergies related to the integration of Rohm and Haas delivering greater than $500 million on a run rate basis by the end of the year. We will continue to deliver on our working capital disciplined to the tune of $500 million.These priorities are a balance. A balance between appropriate caution and therefore maintaining cost and operating discipline and focus, especially with the uncertainty around the U.S. consumer. And a balance with growth, given our exciting new portfolio, our broad opportunity mix and our transformation into a consistent earnings growth enterprise. And just to repeat one more time, this enterprise is here today.I will now turn the call back to Howard."

But you have to obviously tolerate those cost increases. We're looking at structural cost decreases of $1.2 billion year-to-date or end of '09, and another $650 million in 2010 that will drop to the bottom line versus '09. So that gives you a sense of the two-year number that is true cost reductions. And we will let cost go up on the good cost side. But if those costs, okay, start, you have to follow the 1.85, then we'll find other ways to mitigate those. And then that's basically our commitment to make sure that 1.85 is the bottom line."

And so look, the volume momentum through the fourth quarter, and whether or not unique in this regard, built up as the quarter went by, and December was a strong month and very unusually so. Of course, what was happening through the quarter also",399,"Correct. And so look, the volume momentum through the fourth quarter, and whether or not unique in this regard, built up as the quarter went by, and December was a strong month and very unusually so. Of course, what was happening through the quarter also on the Basics side, is price increases were being put in place. But hydrocarbon run-up occurred faster than the price increases were allowed. Now, we now have price increases out there on the Basics side, hydrocarbons are attenuating a little bit. So we're playing a price volume titration, but polyethylene has got $0.04 a pound out there already that there are another $0.06 a pound planned for February. So we really -- when you look at the price momentum on Basics, it's all about the operating rates being in the mid- to-low eighties. And certainly with the United States having an export window and China showing robust demand, there's room for price. Now, we expect, in terms of hydrocarbon run-up, another $500 million quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of that is going to flow through not just on the ethylene side but also the propylene side, which will hurt the Performance businesses unless they can get price momentum. Now we do -- as you know, it's harder on the Performance side to get prices to stick, but we have about a 90-day lag. And with price increases announced in semi-commodities like oxygen and solvents, is a good example of that, and amines, some of that should start to stick in the first quarter, and so that 90 day lag, if your lag started in December. We're watching very carefully. Our operating rate is still a little lower than we've wanted, it's in the high 70s, as we see things. As a company, we'd like it to be in the 80s. So we're not going to lose volume with these price increases. Which is why this whole year is a little tenuous at the beginning. We have Chinese New Year in February, so we've got to be careful about that. There will be some shut downs of factories in Asia and China. But in the end, your question is really the story of the quarter. There is price momentum, there's good volume momentum, we saw it in the fourth quarter. We saw it run into from December to January, and we're out there pushing price hard."

And I believe, and we have studied this extensively, some of the points you make the base case. There's is bear case, there's a bull case, and one of your colleagues just recently put out a bearish case, we don't believe that case at all, because of a couple of points you made. Number one, the supply side of this will be constrained coming out of the Middle East, it has been constrained for several years. Even though there will be capacity adds, it won't come on when people think it will come on. We're one of the best operators out there. We had a slow start up of our Kuwait asset, and we're very good at this. So I would tell you have not as much supply coming on, as people think. The second thing is, if you take the normalized GDP globally this year of a roughly 3%, the typical multiplier in polyethylene is 1.4%, 1.5%, that's a 4.5% demand growth that could happen this year, and inventory restocking. Inventory is very low at the moment in the entire chain. So this is a case out there where you could actually go higher than 4.5%, which is in our base case. Then you have six to 9 million tons of high-cost liquids rationalization, three of which is already permanently down. Then you, in fact, your point which is gas is not as fairly available in the Middle East as people think. And then have your extra point, which is the advantage of the United States, which is now the second lowest cost producer on ethane which is an advantage versus naphtha because of where gas is. We have flexi crackers, so we are one of the few that can take advantage of that. 20% of our production in the fourth quarter was exports out of the United States to China and Asia. So when you put all that together, I think there's a case or a trough-like environment in '10, with the excess capacity, a recovery in '11, and a peak environment in the '13 time frame."

The partners we're talking to are all strategic, there's three of them. They are all very, very keen on being our partner, so we can grow this business in a JV construct. JV construct is our strategy for us in the Basics because we believe, like our equity earnings already showed, that we can generate money for the Dow Chemical Company's shareholders on a different construct, in a different ownership structure that will come in below the line and will generate like you saw, $284 million of earnings, a good chunk of that coming from EQUATE last quarter. So we believe we're on strategy. We're not in a hurry. We're very patient. The people we're talking to are very, very deliberate and understanding how we put such a venture together.

And also the quick rebound in our equity earnings, which as you know on the financial statements, are reported at an after-tax basis.

We have re-rightsized our asset footprint to really fundamentally get down to the U.S. Gulf Coast where were advantaged, especially on the gas side. And that advantage, we want to parlay directly into our performance business. So today, a good chunk of our chlorine capacity in Louisiana or in Texas will feed our downstream chlorine envelope for performance businesses and be advantaged, because it's integrated, we have all the utilities, the infrastructure, the gas, et cetera. You can expect us though to continue to find meaningful partnerships with people who want to be PVC. So in essence, we will use our competitive edge to partner with others, because you have to have scale in the chlorine side obviously, because it's obviously, very capital-intensive business.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. Well, what a difference a year makes. As you recall this time last year, we were facing unprecedented demand destruction and of course steep declines in manufacturing activity across virtually all sectors. If you look at Slide 4, you'll see we've responded by taking decisive actions throughout the year and the results of those actions are clearly demonstrated in the fourth quarter results. Here, Dow grew earnings year-over-year in the quarter, and we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating earnings in highly challenging economic conditions. But the big story of the quarter is top line growth driven by year-over-year volume gains. We achieved 4% top line growth and 10% higher volumes versus the same quarter last year. This is on a pro forma basis excluding divestitures, which is really the best way to view the underlying performance of our operations. This was driven by strengthening demand across many of our key segments. Sales increased sequentially each quarter of the year and even accelerated during the fourth quarter. The power of our strong geographic footprint manifested itself once again specifically in the emerging geographies of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe, India and the Middle East, which all had double-digit volume growth over the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, the emerging geographies posted volume growth of 33%. EBITDA increased by $809 million in the quarter and in all operating segments, except Health and  Agricultural Sciences, which declined primarily due to increased investment in R&D, as we continue to fund growth in this exciting segment of our company. EBITDA in the combined performance segments was up 88% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, EBITDA was at a $6 billion annualized run rate for the third consecutive quarter. Equity earnings were very strong at $284 million and back to normalized levels not seen since prior to the economic downturn led by strong performance in Dow Corning and EQUATE. These joint ventures will continue to be important elements of our growth strategy going forward. We continued our focus on cash flow, generating $1.4 billion of cash from operations in the quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year. We are also well ahead of our goals on cost reductions. We ended the year with a run rate of $1.7 billion in savings from structural cost reductions and cost synergies related to Rohm and Haas. We are now 70% of the way towards our two-year goal of $2.5 billion in savings. We completed the divestment of Morton Salt in the quarter. This was the fourth non-core divestment of 2009, all with strategic buyers and all at favorable multiples. We paid off the balance of our bridge loan well ahead of plan, and we also repaid our revolver. In total, we reduced our debt by $2.5 billion since April 1, reducing our net debt-to-cap to 48%, ahead of our goal through a number of actions I'm going to highlight later. Now this is a very impressive list when taken on its own. But when you consider we did all of this while continuing the integration of Rohm and Haas, cutting costs, reducing our Basics footprint, divesting non-core assets while continuing our many investments for growth, all of which was done during the worst recession in decades, these accomplishments are even more extraordinary. I am also proud that the Dow team continues its focus on serving customers well and driving top line growth. Looking at Slide 4 -- 5 and turning to the outlook for industry demand, here again is the tracking tool we showed you last quarter. We saw improvements across many of our end-use industries throughout the year. This underscores the unique view we have into the economic recovery based on our participation in the value chains of a vast array of industries and end markets. On Slide 6, you can see our broad geographic reach also gives us insights on overall global demand trends. Emerging geographies once again led our growth in the fourth quarter with volumes up 33% over the fourth quarter of last year. Volumes in China, for example, were up nearly 60% and India and Russia were up around 30%. Brazil was up 20%. Globally, North America was the only region that we did not see volume growth. But even here there were some bright spots. Automotive demand was improved and the demand for packaging remained resilient. Broader growth, however, continued to lag as high unemployment and reduced consumer spending dragged on the progression of the U.S. recovery. Conditions were similar in Europe for many of the same reasons, and the higher value of the euro further impacted exports out of that region. These trends, along with our fourth quarter results, represent clear and positive steps forward in the global economy and in our operating segments. We begin 2010 well-positioned to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions in key areas of the world. Our new portfolio, our R&D engine, our strong geographic presence, our ability to remain financially disciplined will all be key drivers to earnings growth well into the future. I'm going to speak more about these points in a moment. But first, I would like turn the call over to Bill for a review of the fourth quarter. Bill?"

Reported sales were $12.5 billion, an increase of 15% over the same period last year and 3% over the third quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis and excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 4%, driven by volume growth of 10%. EBITDA, excluding certain items, was up on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter by $809 million. It was basically flat sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally weak quarter. Earnings excluding certain items were $0.18 per share, ending the year with four quarters of positive results. The current quarter included $0.10 per share unfavorable impact for a certain item. Details for these items are included in the appendix. Our tax rate was lower this quarter due to higher earnings in emerging geographies and strong joint venture results. We expect the lower tax rate to continue in 2010 and with estimated rate between 15% to 20% for modeling purposes. As Andrew mentioned, we saw strong volume in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 8, we saw year-over-year improvements in virtually every operating segments and across all geographies, except North America. Strong growth in Electronic Materials of 14% was, however, offset by lower demand in Specialty Materials, driven by a lower capital spending in industrial water applications. We see this as just a temporary pause and remain confident in the long-term fundamentals and the demand for clean water.Emerging regions also clearly performed very well versus last year, while growth in the more developed economies is lagging. On a sequential basis, as you can see on the next slide, volumes rose 3%. This is in spite of normal seasonality is segments, such as Electronic Materials and Coatings and Infrastructure. Once again, emerging geographies led the volume gains.On Slide 10, you can see that price rose sequentially in every operating segment, except Health and Agricultural Sciences in every geography. These gains were largely offset by more than $525 million. These gains largely offset to more than $525 million increase in purchased feedstock and energy cost. As you know, energy prices rose significantly in the last half of December, and we have responded quickly to pass on these increased costs.Now let's take a look at how the company performed at an operating segment level on Slide 11. Electronic and Specialty Materials, as I just mentioned, volume was up 14% in our Electronics business versus last year. Foundry utilization rates remain strong and we do not see the typical seasonal pause. The semiconductor industry also continue to see solid downstream demand. In Specialty Materials, volume was somewhat muted during the quarter in industrial water end markets and demand for Cellulosics used in construction applications was weak in North America and Europe. We continue to see growth in our Coatings and Infrastructure segments, as emerging regions continue to drive increased demand. Significant growth in China was driven by a stimulus program, which strengthens construction and residential end markets. In North America and Japan, we are beginning to see improvement. However, commercial construction continues to be slow in these geographies and in Europe.Now, turning to Health and Agricultural Sciences on Slide 12, the fourth quarter produced double-digit channel sales growth in Ag Chem, as farmers in Brazil resume plantings after a temporary pause last quarter. Seeds, Traits and Oils volume grew 24%, as the business continues to reap rewards of this technology-rich pipeline and recent seed acquisition. This drove sequential and year-over-year volume growth. We remain focused on investing in this segment, given this robust long-term fundamental. Both R&D and SG&A investments increased in the quarter to support product launches and recent seed acquisition.One example of this just last week, Dow AgroSciences announced regulatory approval for Mexico for the importation of corn grain produced from SmartStax. This is an important approval because Mexico is among the world's largest importers of U.S. corn and this ensures they will have access to this world-class technology. Now let me turn to Performance Systems. Performance Systems continue to show strong operating performance in the quarter. Demand for wind energy applications in China drove growth in our Formulated Systems business, while demand in food packaging and automotive applications strongly benefited our Elastomers business. While there was double-digit increase in light vehicle production within the automotive industry versus last year due to government stimulus, visibility remains unclear in this sector as the programs come to an end.Moving to Performance Products, our Polyurethane Building Block business delivered a solid quarter due to tight supply, increasing demand and further penetration on our unit technologies in the appliance industry. We also saw increased demand for Oxygenated Solvents. These products go into a number of growing healthcare applications, such as hand and surface sanitizers. And lastly, we saw increased demand in Europe for Heat Transfer Fluids used in new Concentrated Solar Power installations.As you can see on Slide 13, our Basic Plastics franchise delivered another outstanding quarter. Continued demand for polyethylene drove double-digit volume growth versus the fourth quarter of 2008. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of polyethylene's volume growth due in part to an open export window from North America due to relatively low gas prices into the weak U.S. dollar. I would also like to point out that the Basic Plastics segment, which is comprised primarily of polyethylene generated $1.7 billion of EBITDA in 2009. In one of the worst economic climates in decades, this is truly an impressive performance.Finally, I am pleased to report that after facing headwinds throughout most of 2009, our Basic Chemicals business showed signs of strengthening. Caustic Soda prices improved after bottoming in the third quarter and Vinyl Chloride Monomer prices rose for the third consecutive quarter on increasing demand. Aggressive economic stimulus efforts in China drove improved performance in EO/EG, a polyester fiber mills, as polyester fiber mills saw an uptick in production. On Slide 14, equity earnings, excluding certain items, were $284 million, which is up 27% sequentially. Once again, this is back to levels we last saw before the economic downturn. Notable contributors to the movement were Dow Corning and EQUATE.Turning to our actions on cost control on Slide 15, and in keeping with our long-term heritage of financial and operating discipline, we delivered our structural cost reduction, achieving more than $215 million in the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, SG&A was down 4% in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2008, even with a 15% increase in Ag to support new product launches and commercial activities. On a pro forma basis, R&D spending was up 6%, continuing our investment and growth despite the economic conditions led by increased investments in Dow AgroSciences. And lastly, we made significant progress in our commitments related to cost synergies and our restructuring efforts. On Slide 16, you can see that we're well ahead of our plan to capture the cost synergies related to the acquisition of Rohm and Haas and our structuring program. And we expect to deliver an additional $650 million of savings in 2010 versus 2009. Now let me hand it back over to Andrew."

Exactly a year ago, I ended my discussion by asking you to judge us by our actions. Despite 2009's  unprecedented demand destruction and the traumatic failure of PIC of Kuwait to close the legally binding joint venture transaction, we acted decisively to reposition ourselves to our new realities. We quickly reduced costs and rightsized our asset footprint to reduce exposure to commodity products in low growth locations. And we increased our presence in high-growth products in fast-growing geographies. We also closed the Rohm and Haas transaction and moved quickly on the cost synergies. As a result, we improved volumes and profits from these actions sequentially throughout the year. And we are benefiting from the pivotal step we took in actually acquiring Rohm and Haas. By year's end, outpace of improvement was increasing as shown by the results in the quarter. We are ahead of all of our operating and financial milestones that we had promised you in early '09. Let me review each of these milestones in turn.On Slide 18, our strategic accomplishments this year were many. As I stated, we acquired and integrated Rohm and Haas, which I believe will be remembered as the singular strategic acquisition that transformed Dow into a higher growth and higher margin business portfolio with significantly improved earnings power. We shed $3 billion of non-core assets at very attractive multiples. This was done ahead of our divestment plan and gave us the proceeds to strengthen our capital structure. We reviewed and recommitted ourselves to our strategy. And after an enterprise-wide review, we remain committed to ongoing and active portfolio management to improve probability and focus resources on higher growth, higher margin opportunities.We have a deliberate and well-put our plan with $12 billion of divestment options, as well as targeted areas for growth. And to me, the best proof of our renewed commitment to grow and deliver shareholder value is our record year of R&D investment, reinforcing our focus on market-driven science-based innovation. On Slide 19, our financial milestones were also an overachievement in a very difficult year. As I mention earlier, we delivered full consecutive quarters of positive operating earnings. And we achieved improved sequential sales throughout the year, reflecting quarterly demand improvement as volume increased particularly in emerging markets. And since the close of Rohm and Haas in April 1, we've taken a number of actions to strengthen our balance sheet. We eliminated the high cost Series B and C preferred shares at par. We've successfully raised equity in an oversubscribed offering and termed out near-term maturities with oversubscribed debt offerings. And we completely paid off the bridge loan ahead of schedule and paid off the remaining balance on the revolver. In addition, we reduced long-term debt maturities through 2011 by 80% and lowered total indefinites by more than $2.5 billion. All of these actions board our net debt-to-total cap down to 48%, which is ahead of our plan. And we lowered our financing costs by $500 million per year. And lastly, as I mentioned at the outset of my talk, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations in 2009. On Slide 20, you can see that we also exceeded our operating goals in every respect, reflecting our commitment to operational discipline and our very strong focus throughout the year. Our actions to reduce structural cost delivered more than $1.2 billion in savings in 2009. And we ended the year with a $1.7 billion run rate, ahead of our plan and 70% of the way towards our two-year goal of $2.5 billion in savings. And we're also well ahead on the cost synergies related to Rohm and Haas. We accelerate our actions and have now achieved 140% of the 12-month costs synergy run-rate target. Finally, we took quick steps to right-size our Basics manufacturing footprint, reducing ethylene consumption on the U.S. Gulf Coast by 30% and repositioning our Basic Chemicals portfolio to more efficiently feed our higher value, higher margin downstream performance businesses.On Slide 21, you can see that overall, this was an amazingly active year with a tremendous number of accomplishments. All of which were made possible because of the hard work of Dow's people around the world.Slide 22, as we look ahead, Dow has all of the elements in place to move forward aggressively on three distinct fronts: Delivering consistent earnings and cash flow, a higher hate of growth and an improved return on capital while doing so. First, we are positioned to be able to drive growth across the board. We have businesses tied to markets that are growing in a multiple of GDP, as well as being present in developing geographies that are providing us tremendous opportunities and driving our earnings trajectory. In fact, we currently predict our revenues will grow by greater than 10% with our new portfolio, driven by science and technology. We expect EBITDA margins to increase from 12% in 2008 to 20% over time with our new portfolio, powered by our ability to provide customers with science-based technology-rich solutions. And we will accelerate these earnings with our new reduced cost structure, which will provide us $2.5 billion in savings by 2011. Also fueling this growth is our innovation engine. In 2009, the $1.6 billion we invested in R&D as a combined entity, which as an aside, is more than the combined R&D budgets of all the university and chemistry programs in the United States is paying up. During the last three years, we have nearly tripled our pipeline valuation to $28 billion by making targeted investments in higher value, higher margin products and businesses. At the same time, as already stated, we have implemented a rigorous cross-company system of portfolio management to ensure every research dollar is well spent. All of this leads to a tremendous earnings power, which would generate significant cash flow that we have committed to both reinvesting in our businesses for growth, while at the same time rewarding our owners.On Slide 23, you have heard me speak throughout this past year of a new Dow. The decisions we made in 2009, along with the speed and decisiveness of the actions we took, we believe that we have firmly delivered the Dow of tomorrow. Today, we have the right portfolio, the right geographic position and the right pipeline, as indicated by all the points in this slide.On Slide 24, you could see the right portfolio is in place to define how we will grow. This portfolio is supported by three integrated business models: Basics, performance and market-driven. And on Slide 25, you could see we now have a robust portfolio of businesses exposed to high-growth industries, such as electronics, coatings, infrastructure, personal care, water, energy, food and agriculture. All with higher EBITDA margins and higher growth. You can see this across our Advanced Materials, AgroSciences and Performance either sciences and performance businesses. And these represent two-thirds of our overall business portfolio and almost all of them have leading industry positions.On Slide 26, we also have the right geographic position. Dow's volume from emerging geographies grew 33% year-over-year and actions we took this year further strengthen our geographic presence and position the company for even greater success. Sales in emerging geographies now represent 32% of our total sales, up from 28% last year. We will continue to expand in these fast-growing geographies. On Slide 27, you can see that we also now have the right pipeline. At our Investor Day in November, we highlighted the power of our innovation engine. This is an engine that today has a potential value of $28 billion, five times higher than in 1997. The more than 500 projects in our innovation table are strategically aligned with four global mega-trends: health and nutrition, energy, consumerism and infrastructure and transportation. The $1.6 billion that we plan to invest annually in R&D will continue to be aimed squarely at the intersection of society's greatest needs and business opportunity.A further proof point in innovation is the growth synergies we're gaining from the integration of Rohm and Haas. This growth synergies will produce $2 billion of revenue by the end of 2012 on a run-rate basis and cut across our portfolio, geographies and pipeline. They are focused on new commercial activities, such as cross-selling, to increase our share of products with existing customers, leveraging the new product portfolio and creating new and innovative solutions for customers. In our Coatings business, for example, we've realized a number of successful cross-selling opportunities between our Architectural and Industrial Coatings portfolio. In Ion Exchange business, we delivered additional growth opportunities for industrial water purification. And in Adhesives, our expanded product line was able to capture new business with a global packaging converter. These are just some of the many examples that by the end of the fourth quarter of this year delivered last year, delivered more than $340 million in new annual revenue. So with the right portfolio, the right footprint and the right pipeline, the Dow of tomorrow is here today.On Slide 28, let me address the outlook for 2010. From a geographic perspective, the sustained demand growth we're witnessing in the emerging geographies bodes well for global growth. The recovery in regions, such as China, is creating positive volume opportunities, which have helped us through much of 2009. However, we continue to closely monitor China's overheating manufacturing engine and the potential for the creation of asset bubbles. The Brazilian economy fairs better than most during the global economic recession. And we've seen strong demand rebound there as well. We feel better about the North American and European economies today than we did one year ago, or even one quarter ago, so with the U.S. GDP numbers released last week, point to an economy that is recovering. The impressive 5.7% annualized number in the fourth quarter shows that the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in more than six years, although over half of this was inventory restocking.This much stronger than expected numbers provide yet another data point that our recovery is taking hold. This number also shows that U.S. inventory destocking has ended. And the good news is that we see supply-chain inventory levels remaining low. So the potential for growth and a rebound is there. But high unemployment and questions about the sustainability of government stimulus spending continue to mute the possibility of a strong rebound like the one we saw in '03, '04. Therefore, in our view in the U.S., this recovery looks more like a U than a V. And the opposite is true in the emerging world, which gives us a view that the recovery on the global business this year is probably shaped like a lazy. Our portfolio is perfectly positioned for such an outcome. On our performance side of the business, we have the right exposure to fast-growing sectors, such as electronics, water, coatings, energy, consumer goods and agriculture. And our powerful Basics Plastics franchise now has a relatively low cost position with the increased supply-demand dynamic in U.S. natural gas. Our investments in feedstock flexibility in this region, coupled with our low cost positions in Canada, Kuwait and Argentina will continue to generate strong profits in this business, as the economic recovery takes hold and the cycle turns. Finally, as I just mentioned, our growing presence in the emerging geographies will fuel earnings growth as witnessed by our 33% year-over-year growth from these regions in the fourth quarter alone.On Slide 29, you can see our tracking tool. And this time, it shows the first quarter outlook where we see continued improvement across many of our end-use industries, as you can see from the predominance of green boxes. However, despite the sequential revenue and volume growth throughout 2009 and even the acceleration of our results in the second half of last year, we believe the economic environment continues to warrant caution because of the potential for uneven growth. That's why our plan does not count on a material improvement in economic activity from end-of-year 2009 levels. Accordingly, we will keep a tight rein on costs and capital while maximizing cash flow just as we did last year. This disciplined focus, when coupled with our higher margin, higher growth portfolio, strong geographic presence and invigorated pipeline really positions us well to benefit from the economic recovery.On Slide 30, you know and you've seen our clear path to earnings growth. And this slide, which you will recall from our Investor Day, sets the framework to achieve this goal. We have all the elements in place: A new portfolio, our R&D engine, our strong geographic presence, our ability to remain financially disciplined, as well as our ongoing portfolio management, plus the full retention of our powerful Basics Plastics business. All add up to this new earnings profile, one with significant upside potential and one that we will realize over these next few years with flawless and rigorous execution, something that Dow is known for. So on Slide 31, that brings me to my priorities for 2010. From a strategic perspective, we will maintain our commitment to innovation-based science and plan to invest the further $1.6 billion in our world-class R&D capabilities to accelerate our future growth on multiple fronts. We will also continue to invest in the emerging geographies to further expand our market and asset presence in this high-growth regions. We will continue our focus on portfolio management by divesting non-core assets. Our target at 2010 is $2 billion. STYRON represents the largest portion of that. I am pleased to report the STYRON divestment process has continued to move forward on a very timely basis. As with any strategic process, we will update you when we have an announcement.The business is now running in a separate structure and is doing very well. And we will seek to deliver on the right asset-light strategy. And we will only do so if it creates a long-term growth enterprise that creates value for our shareholders. We will remain in an active process of exploring our strategic asset-light joint venture.Financially, we'll continue to take the appropriate steps to maintain optionality and financial flexibility. We will remain focused on cash generation with the goal of generating free cash flow of $1.5 billion. As I mentioned before, we will further pay down debt in 2010, with a goal of reaching a net debt to total cap of 45%. We will protect and enhance our investment grade rating. To that end, our intention is to use our excess cash to repay debt. And lastly, on operation priorities, we will maintain our commitment to fix cost reductions and cost synergies at a run rate of $2.5 billion by year end. We will capitalize on the growth synergies related to the integration of Rohm and Haas, delivering greater than $500 million on a run rate basis by the end of the year. We will continue to deliver on our working capital discipline to the tune of $500 million.These priorities are a balance, a balance between appropriate caution and therefore, maintaining cost and operating discipline and focus, especially with the uncertainty around the U.S. consumer, and a balance with growth. Given our exciting new portfolio, our broad opportunity mix and our transformation into a consistent earnings growth enterprise. And just to repeat one more time, this enterprise is here today.I will now turn the call back to Howard."

We're looking at structural cost decreases of $1.2 billion year-to-date or end of '09, and another $650 million in 2010 that will drop to the bottom line versus '09. So that gives you a sense of the two-year number that is true cost reductions. And we will let cost go up on the good cost side.

And so look, the volume momentum through the fourth quarter, and whether or not unique in this regard, built up as the quarter went by, and December was a strong month and very unusually so. Of course, what was happening through the quarter also on the Basics side, is price increases were being put in place. But hydrocarbon run-up occurred faster than the price increases were allowed. Now, we now have price increases out there on the Basics side, hydrocarbons are attenuating a little bit. So we're playing a price volume titration, but polyethylene has got $0.04 a pound out there already that there are another $0.06 a pound planned for February. So we really -- when you look at the price momentum on Basics, it's all about the operating rates being in the mid- to-low eighties. And certainly with the United States having an export window and China showing robust demand, there's room for price. Now, we expect, in terms of hydrocarbon run-up, another $500 million quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of that is going to flow through not just on the ethylene side but also the propylene side, which will hurt the Performance businesses unless they can get price momentum. Now we do -- as you know, it's harder on the Performance side to get prices to stick, but we have about a 90-day lag. And with price increases announced in semi-commodities like oxygen and solvents, is a good example of that, and amines, some of that should start to stick in the first quarter, and so that 90 day lag, if your lag started in December. We're watching very carefully. Our operating rate is still a little lower than we've wanted, it's in the high 70s, as we see things. As a company, we'd like it to be in the 80s. So we're not going to lose volume with these price increases. Which is why this whole year is a little tenuous at the beginning. We have Chinese New Year in February, so we've got to be careful about that. There will be some shut downs of factories in Asia and China. But in the end, your question is really the story of the quarter. There is price momentum, there's good volume momentum, we saw it in the fourth quarter. We saw it run into from December to January, and we're out there pushing price hard."

And I believe, and we have studied this extensively, some of the points you make the base case. There's a bear case, there's a bull case, and one of your colleagues just recently put out a very bearish case, we don't believe that case at all because of the couple of points you made. Number one, the supply side of this will be constrained coming out of the Middle East. It has been constrained for several years. Even though there will be capacity adds, it won't come on when people think it'll come on. We're one of the best operators out there. We had a slow start-up of our Kuwait asset, and we're very good at this. So I would tell you, you have not as much supply coming on as people think. The second thing is, if you take a normalized GDP globally this year of roughly 3%, the typical multiplier in polyethylene is 1.4%, 1.5%. That's a 4.5% demand growth that could happen this year and inventory restocking. Inventory is very low at the moment in the entire chain. So there's a case out there where you could actually go higher than 4.5%, which is in our base case. Then you have six to nine million tons of high-cost liquids rationalization, three of which is already permanently down. Then you have, in fact, your point, which is, gas is not as freely available in the Middle East as people think. And then have your extra point, which is the advantage in the United States, which is now the second lowest cost producer on ethane, which is an advantage versus naphtha because of where gas is. We have flexi-crackers, so we are one of the few that can take advantage of that. 20% of our production in the fourth quarter was exports out of the United States to China and Asia.

JV construct is our strategy for us in the Basics because we believe, like our equity earnings already showed, that we can generate money for the Dow Chemical Company's shareholders on a different construct, in a different ownership structure that will come in below the line and will generate, like you saw, $284 million of earnings, a good chunk of that coming from EQUATE last quarter. So we believe we're on strategy. We're not in a hurry. We're very patient. The people we're talking to are very, very deliberate and understanding how we put such a venture together.

So on a net margin basis, the currency didn't have a material impact on our earnings for the year. Going forward and to answer your question going forward into 2010, our position is, that the dollar is going to remain weak, and so we see the same conditions that we've got existing today. To answer your question about the tax rate, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, the reason the tax rate is lower is because of the significant growth that we've had in the emerging geographies. And as you know, the emerging geographies have a lower tax rate than the more developed countries. And also, the quick rebound in our equity earnings, which, as you know, on the financial statements, are reported at an after-tax basis. If you look at the underlying tax rate for Dow this year, it was about 15%. We see that continuing for 2010. As I mentioned, we think the tax rate will be between 15% and 20%. And probably continuing into probably 2011 because I think, again, until the U.S. and Europe catch up, which are higher tax areas, then our tax, overall tax rate will be lower.

I think the board of middle [ph] (1:14:55) that you just spoke about is one of the reasons, and that is, the third quarter Cash for Clunkers weren't there. So that's on the negative side of the volume. So fourth quarter was a decline for us. We had the Coatings issue we talked about, which is seasonality. So that was another reason the North American volumes were not as good as maybe the rest of the world. And certainly, even Europe was better than North America. But I would say this, the car companies are coming back and they're building, so that's a positive. Housing starts are coming back, so residential is looking better. And I would say there's a case to say North America will start to get better in the next six months, and the drag happens to be the U.S. consumer spend. So I would say to you, though, some of the indicators are that the North American volume issue in the fourth quarter, if you can call it that, was not a severe one."

To get you to turn to slide four, if I could sum up the quarter in just a few words, it would be this. We are a company that continues to deliver on its commitments and we believe the outperformance in the first quarter represents a pivotal point in demonstrating the earnings power of the new Dow.
The benefits of staying true to our strategic agenda are clear and we are proving it quarter after quarter. Our results once again showed the merits of our strategy in several key ways, starting with our broad-based topline growth and significant EBITDA margin expansion. Let me summarize a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. Operating earnings were $0.43 per share, up significantly from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of last year.
Sales were up a robust 33% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, and excluding divestitures driven by significant improvements in both price and volume. And on a sequential basis, our growth continued as well, with sales up 8% over the fourth quarter, pointing to a strengthening global recovery. Another very encouraging sign was our volume growth in both North America and Europe, each up an impressive 11% compared with last year.
Emerging geographies grew as well, with volume up 27% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, volume in China was up an impressive 46%. All of this pushed our global operating rate to levels not seen since the second quarter of 2008, and our manufacturing momentum improved as the quarter progressed, despite several unplanned outages. EBITDA increased $877 million versus the same quarter last year and was up more than 60% in the combined performance segments.
EBITDA margin expanded both year-over-year and sequentially at the enterprise level. And finally, our joint ventures continued to outperform with equity earnings up more than $200 million year-over-year, reaching a record $304 million driven by performance at Dow Corning, EQUATE, and MEGlobal.
Let me turn to slide 5. We stayed true to our strategic path and in fact made great progress on our key milestones. Financially, we are delivering on the earnings power of the new portfolio, especially in our performance businesses and in emerging geographies. Operationally, we delivered cost reductions of $275 million in the first quarter. We remained well ahead of plan and are currently on an annual run rate of $1.8 billion, which is ahead of our commitments. Strategically, we exceeded our growth synergy targets by delivering $530 million in revenue on a run rate basis, while at the same time, we maintained our commitment to growth, increasing our investment in research and development by 10%.
We also made substantial progress in achieving our goal to divest $2 billion of non-strategic assets in 2010 and remain on track to deliver $5.5 billion in divestments in just 12 months, more than our commitment of $5 billion and in half the time. On slide 6, as most of you know, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the Styron division for just over $1.6 billion. Additionally, this deal includes supply and service contracts that would generate substantial value for Dow in the neighborhood of $400 million. This brings the total value of the deal to more than $2 billion, the high end of our stated target for 2010.
The value reflects what we consider an excellent multiples of over eight times EBITDA. The sale of Styron will be our fifth non-core divestments since April of 2009 all at favorable multiples. On slide 7, another feature of our earnings call has been to exhibit the tracking tool that provides a look into industry and market demand trends across our geographic footprint. This look underscores the unique view we have into the emerging global economic recovery based on our participation and the value chain of a vast array of industries and end markets. And the picture is bright.
On slide 8, starting with an operating segment view, volume was up across virtually all of our businesses. And we are seeing increased demand in a wide variety of end markets, most of which are tied to consumer spending, electronics, appliances and other durable goods and furniture, as long as consumer staples, all showed strong growth. In addition, the automotive sector in North America is improving and in Asia, it’s accelerating.
And finally, there is increased demand in our water business, which drove improved results in specialty materials. These trends are particularly relevant, given their alignment with a global mega trends that will drive our long-term performance and demonstrate that our new portfolio is very well positioned. As you can see on the right of the slide, infrastructure stimulus spending still hasn’t found its way through many value chains and commercial construction and developed regions continues to lag. But some good news is that the housing segment seems to have finally come off with historic lows.
On slide 9, turning now to a geographic look, we see a similar story with a few lingering challenges. We have our eye on high unemployment in developed regions, but we have seen positive signs that job markets have stabilized. The potential for access in credit bubbles in emerging geographies and lingering concerns surrounding sovereign debt in southern Europe could both be potential drags on global growth. However, these factors are clearly outweighed by the strengths that we are seeing.
The overall global economic environment is on a stronger footing, with a highlight being significant demand growth in Europe and North America. In addition, the step change in the relevant cost position of US Gulf Coast natural gas provides even further strength for Dow. Finally, continuing rapid growth in emerging geographies led by China where demand as I said was up an impressive 46% was driven primarily by growing domestic consumption.
In summary, Dow’s vast portfolio and broad geographic reach provide us with a unique perspective on the trends that are shaping the global economic recovery.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bill who will give you some more details on how these trends drove our results in the quarter.

Let’s begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results on slide 10.

Let’s begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results on slide 10. Reported sales were $13.4 billion, an increase of 49% over the same period last year and 8% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis and excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 33%, driven by volume growth of 16% and increase of price of 17%.
EBITDA excluding certain items was up on a year-over-year basis by $877 million to $1.8 billion. On a sequential basis, EBITDA was up $356 million, an impressive increase considering that we had some margin compression in our performance businesses due to the rapid run-up in propylene costs. Earnings excluding certain items were $0.43 per share. The current quarter included $0.02 per share unfavorable impact for certain items. Details for these items are included in the appendix.
Our effective tax rate was 15.7%, in line with the 15% to 20% range we committed previously. The year-over-year increase in corporate was due in part to the inclusion of Morton Salt’s results in the first quarter of last year. Our current quarter results also included higher performance share compensation and increased participation in our employee stock purchase program. We view this as a positive as it aligns the interest of our employees with those of our shareholders. For modeling purposes, you should expect corporate to run in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter.
Moving to slide 11, overall volume growth versus the same quarter last year was 16% on a pro forma basis, excluding divestitures, with our Combined Performance segments delivering an impressive 19% increase. We also achieved price gains in nearly all segments and double digit increases across all geographies. Price was up an impressive 16% in North America and 24% in Europe.
On a sequential basis, price was up in all geographic regions with the exception of Europe. Again, North America showed strength with gains of 8%. Volume was up 4% versus the fourth quarter of last year, with particular strength in both North America and Europe.
Now, let’s take a look at how the company performed on a segment level starting on slide 14. In Electronic and Specialty Materials, volume was up 31% compared to the first quarter of 2009. In fact, volume in our electronic materials business was up 55% year-over-year. This reflects increased demand in memory, logic and display technologies.
Our semiconductor technologies are capturing share as this sector continues to recover. We also are seeing substantial growth in the demand for water applications as these fundamental markets recovery, contributing to substantial improvement in EBITDA margins across specialty materials. In Coatings and Infrastructure, volume increased 16% excluding divestitures, while price was up 5%. Emerging regions were driving increased demand while commercial construction continued to represent a challenge in North America and Europe. We are however seeing global improvements in residential construction end markets.
I think it’s important to highlight that excluding divestitures, EBITDA in this segment actually improved year-over-year. We also increased R&D spending as we moved the investment in our POWERHOUSE Solar Shingle program into the business this quarter, as we are getting closer to commercialization.
Taking both of these points into consideration, EBITDA actually improved 8%. In acrylic-based Architectural Coatings business generated a solid EBIT-to-margin of around 15%. Coatings in infrastructure should see further margin improvement as the businesses continue to work aggressively to recapture price related to more than 25% sequential increase in propylene combined with seasonal volume increases.
Moving to Health and Ag Sciences, both price and volume were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, due to continued oversupply of glyphosate. This segment still holds significant growth potential looking forward. Our new Ag Chem molecules continue to gain traction, our seeds, traits and oil flag points continue to grow and the introduction of SmartStax corn hybrids is continuing to meet our expectations.
In Performance Systems, volumes increased 27%, with increases in all geographies and business units primarily driven by Dow Automotive, which benefited from increases in automotive demand in North America and Asia and robust elastomer demand in all geographies through the continued strength in food packaging, a sector that has been extremely resilient during the recent economic downturn.
Finally, on this slide, you can see the primary driver, Performance Products, which posted volume gains of 27% excluding divestitures and price gains of 14%. Volume was up in all geographies in business units driven by consumer-led demand growth in polyurethanes, and growth in appliance end markets driven by government incentives and energy-efficient standards.
Slide 16 details the performance of our Basic Plastics segment. Sales increased 49% year-over-year and EBITDA was $718 million for the quarter. Volume and price increases in polyethylene were the largest contributors. Here, operating rates were high in the quarter, enabling the business to focus on price.
And finally, in Basic Chemicals, volume increased 16% and price increased 6%. The major drivers in performance in this segment were an increase in demand for caustic soda in North America due to the strength in the aluminum industry and the fourth consecutive quarter of price increases in vinyl chloride monomer which more than offset volume declines.
Now, turning to slide 17, another high point in the quarter was equity earnings. We have rebounded strongly over the past five quarters, and now exceed pre-recession levels. In the first quarter, we delivered a record $304 million in equity earnings, more than $200 million year-over-year. Turning to slide 18, our focus on financial discipline continued in the quarter, with tight control on working capital. Our CapEx spending was under $300 million in the quarter. However I would like to point that the first quarter is typically a low quarter for us in terms of capital spending, and we do anticipate an increase next quarter due to scheduled turnarounds.
It is important to know that due to the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter, (ASU) 2009-17, previously referred to as FAS 167. Our investment in our Thailand joint venture will be recognized as CapEx going forward, springing our total spending closer to $2 billion for the year. However, I would also like to point that, this change will not increase our actual cash outflows. Cash flow from operations was slightly higher in the quarter versus a year ago, and remember, our receivables are higher as a result of our higher sales and we experienced a normal inventory build in our seasonal businesses. We remain on track to generate $1.5 billion in free cash flow in 2010.
Our net debt-to-capital rose slightly in the quarter, due to the adoption of a new accounting standards I just previously mentioned, changing the accounting treatment for some of our liabilities. Despite this change, we remained committed to achieving our 2010 goal of 45% net debt-to-total cap by yearend. With the increase of our profitability this quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA multiple improved by half a point to 3.2 and we are on a run rate of 2.8 exiting the quarter.
I would also like to highlight, we continue to make meaningful progress on our cost synergy and restructuring goals, achieving $275 million in total cost reduction for the quarter and achieving an annualized run rate of $1.8 billion. That wraps up my review of the details for the quarter, and I will pass it back to Andrew.

This is clearly the central element of our strategy and our story. We have the right portfolio, the right geographic footprint and the right innovation pipeline and I want to emphasize, we have all of this today.
So, I would like to share with you a new and actually more granular look at our innovation pipeline and update you on the growth synergies we are realizing in our portfolio. So, please turn to slide 19 where you will see we currently have more than 500 projects in our innovation playbook, and these are strategically aligned with our four mega trends. This impressive playbook is supported by our significant investment in research and development which should yield another $1.6 billion. This investment is aimed squarely at the intersection of society’s greatest needs and business opportunities.
Our innovation pipeline represents $30 billion on a non-risk adjusted NPV basis. Consistent with our strategy and as you would expect, you see the pipeline is most robust in our performance segments. On slide 20, when you look at it from a stage day perspective, you can see that we have no shortage of new projects at the early stage of our pipeline, but equally exciting is how many are at advanced stage and near commercialization. We have a very rigorous process to ensure our programs deliver commercial success. On a risk-adjusted basis, these programs represent $12.5 billion of net present value and as you can see, the value is clearly tilted to implementation.
On slide 21, I will give you a few examples of some of the innovation projects that are yielding results today. Firstly, we have successfully commercialized next-generation STYROFOAM Brand Insulation in North America, which provides customers the same great performance with a much improved and better than alternative products environmental profile. Our proprietary technology was the result of a multi-year effort led by one of our researchers who by the way was recognized as a co-recipient for his contributions with a 2007 Nobel Prize. The technology gives us a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace, which is reflected in our first quarter results.
In our electronics business, we opened up a new display materials manufacturing facility late last year in Korea. This plant was fully operational in the first quarter, which was critical to meet increasing demand for display chemicals and OLED materials to very fast-growing areas of the industry. This new capacity came on at a good time, as Asian panel manufacturers are now running at full capacity.
And in our polyurethanes business, we launched a new technology that delivers productivity gains for our key appliance customers, including energy savings and productivity efficiency while lowering their raw material consumption. We are gaining market share as a result, in fact Haier, one of the world’s largest appliance manufacturers recently recognized Dow with a Best Strategic Supplier Award, thanks in part to this technology.
When you turn to slide 22 and look at acquisition-related growth synergies, we are capturing tangible value from a range of new market opportunities. Let me just give you a few examples. We have landed a new long-term multi-year agreement with a strategic customer, we gained new sales for acrylic monomers with an industry-leading adhesives producer. We developed new solutions in Latin America that enhanced oil and gas production. We generated new biocide cells for water treatment applications. We secured higher margin higher value PO derivatives businesses in the food sector through focused marketing. We invented new novel polyolefin disbursement base technology that has been adopted by leading global consumer products company.
There are many more examples and most of these have enabled us to achieve the $530 million in revenue already on a run rate basis, which already surpasses our full year 2010 goal. These growth projects clearly illustrate how the acquisition of Rohm and Haas provided the perfect opportunity to renew our existing customer relationships, jumpstart innovation and build stronger partnerships. Our commercial activities have been re-energized not just in advanced materials, but across the entire enterprise. And this mindset is proliferating through every part of our company, enabling us to grow faster and more profitably. No way is this more evident than in Dow Advanced Materials division where an entrepreneurial spirit is striving.
That’s one of the primary reasons we chose Jerome Peribere to run this division. As the former head of Dow AgroSciences, he led an organization that today is one of Dow’s most profitable growth-oriented businesses. This is a perfect time to ask him to talk about some of the key drivers of growth in his portfolio.

In Dow Advanced Materials, we drive an empowered culture where every employee has an own mindset and is accountable for delivering results while building a new and valuable technology pipeline and channel to market that sustain our future growth.
My comments today will only scratch the surface of our progress, but we are hosting an investor event next month where we will have an even richer discussion of Dow Advanced Materials and our winning formula for growth, and I would invite you to turn on to slide 23, where you will see that our businesses served a broad and diverse range of high growth end markets, their recognized leaders in their respective industries.
These businesses employ a model that focuses on technology-intensive innovations and high-touch customer service. I am proud to say that we have made tremendous progress in creating a formidable portfolio of high growth and high margin businesses. As you know, we gained from Rohm and Haas, in impressive electronics business, an industry-leading acrylics platform for strong customer intimacy model and a large and growing presence in Asia. To this, we are Dow strong industrial coatings position and we blended our industry-leading water businesses, our building and construction franchises and our vast geographic reach and hitting power.
Last year, our division had sales in excess of $9 billion, representing about 20% of Dow’s total sales, and contributing almost a third of total Dow’s EBITDA. I would like to touch upon some of the key business drivers for growth and profitability and invite you to turn to slide 24.
Dow Electronic Materials is a leading producer of technologies that enable the production of memory chips, displays, and other critical components that power today’s electronic devices. The business is strongly tied to demand for consumer electronics devices, which has rebounded significantly this year. In fact, this business is already operating at peak profitability despite volumes that are 20% below normalized levels. Our technology position and speed to market led to several significant wins in the quarter, with leading global memory and logic manufacturers as well as display producers.
Turning now on to our Building and Construction business, which like the broader Dow have substantially reduced its cost base, while continuing to invest in innovation. Since 2006, this business has increased average revenue per single family housing starts in the US by some 80%, benefiting from increasing regulations and product innovation. And in the high growth regions like China, we recently launched our external insulation finishing system, which enhances energy performance and lowers overall installation costs. Dow Coating Materials is the world’s largest supplier of coating raw materials to the global paint and coating industry. This business holds the broadest range of coating chemistries in the world, and the largest ever commitment in the industry.
You can see this already in our ultra low-VOC formulations. Today’s technologies cannot offer ultra low-VOC and deliver the performance properties that customers expect. Our tremendous expertise in emulsion polymers and high support R&D capabilities has led to rapid ultra low-VOC innovations that meet demanding performance requirements and are now in the hands of many customers. We expect to revolutionize the coating industry in the next five years, thanks to major additions to our technology toolkits.
On slide 25, our coating business isn’t the only area where we see the benefits of addressing environmental trends. Dow Adhesives and Functional Polymers is meeting demand for more lightweight and biodegradable packaging materials. This business increased penetration of water-based lamination adhesives and is very well positioned to meet the industry’s demand to move from solvent-based materials. And we are further strengthening our portfolio in the global packaging arena by leveraging expertise from other areas in Dow that also touched this very large and growing sector. Expect to hear more about this as the year progresses.
And finally, our large Specialty Materials portfolio serves markets ranging from food and nutrition to household care moving to biocides. You may know that this business is best for the industry-leading water portfolio. This is an area where we have created the world’s largest reverse osmosis membrane and ion exchange business. The benefits of our technology have already been rewarded in the marketplace, and considerably about half of the world’s largest membrane desalination plant that have started up in the last two years are using Dow technology.
On slide 26, we have a broad portfolio of innovations valued at more than $7 billion NPV. We will provide a very detailed review of our Advance Materials portfolio at our sector day on May 18th in Philadelphia. And I hope that you will be able to join us and take advantage of this opportunity to see examples of our growth projects and hear directly from our business and technology leaders.
Dow Advanced Materials is an incredibly exciting place to be right now, and I hope you will watch us closely in the months and quarters to come.

Due in large part to strong fundamentals in the solar industry, Hemlock’s capacity will have expanded by more than 10 times by 2015.
Dow Corning will also be a part of the Advanced Materials sector day in Philadelphia. So, that’s one more reason for you to attend. Please turn to slide 28 where I am going to now turn to our outlook. The global economy is showing signs of a meaningful recovery, including the most significant piece of new information is the robust improvement we have seen in North America and Europe. Two geographic areas that until now have lagged the recovery of the world economy. Our 27% sales growth in North America and 35% growth in Europe are compelling proof points that economic recovery is now underway in these areas.
These numbers are even more impressive when you consider that volume gains comprised of full 11% of the growth in each region showing that demand is indeed returning. Broad-based strength in many sectors of North America such as electronics to automotive to furniture shows a sustainable upturn is emerging. Even housing starts have shown more positive signs in recent weeks, as new home sales surged to 27% in March, the highest gains in more than 40 years. Also new orders for durable US manufactured goods excluding transportation posted the largest gains in more than two years last month. Strength in all of these sectors illustrates that the consumer is finally returning. The story for emerging geographies is strong growth continuing at a robust pace.
Volume growth of 27% versus one year ago, with China, Brazil, Eastern Europe and South East Asia and India leading the way. In fact, volume growth as we have already said in Greater China was an impressive 46%. This strong performance coupled with a recovering demand in North America and Europe is driving notable manufacturing momentum and bode particularly well for Dow. We recognized there are some continuing challenges, especially in the construction industry and unemployment and tight credit conditions continue to weigh on consumer sentiment. However, to date, these have been balanced by improving consumer and business spending.
So, our outlook is one of the strengthening global economic environment with increasing signs of sustained growth. We saw the results of this growth in the first quarter through both volume growth and margin expansion, driven by our new portfolio and the benefits of our significant cost reduction efforts. And as we turn to our priorities in the coming quarter, we will continue to remain focused on delivering our commitments. This means maintaining operational and financial discipline, further strengthening our balance sheet, and investing for growth. Our actions to deliver our new portfolio with a lean cost structure and reinvigorated innovation engine coupled with our strong presence in emerging geographies lead are poised to deliver continued earnings momentum.
This quarter was indeed a pivotal point and given the world of glimpse of our earnings power, and of the constant and consistent progress we are making in driving our strategic agenda forward. Quarter-after-quarter, we are displaying the new Dow, a Dow that delivers earnings growth for its shareholders. Stay tuned as we continue to demonstrate the power of this new company.
I will now turn the call back to Howard.

The consequence of that is that US natural gas will start to stabilize, be less volatile as will indeed natural gas liquids. This will still not be competitive versus the Middle East. The Middle East has the lowest cost of natural gas in ethane, but when you throw on top of that, the notion that the Middle East is running out of natural gas liquid production and ethane in particular, it is mostly dry gas with the exception of Iran, then the US production base and the US asset base that is in market and it has flexibility of cracker feed stocks which ours does. Ours is the most flexible in the industry, then it has an advantage getting market and therefore has made the business and the assets more valuable for the foreseeable future.
That value is being demonstrated in the results. Even though these are trough like conditions, the business is earning four to five times what is earned in the ’01 and ’02 trough, which is a spectacular statement, not the least of the reason being that we are relying less and less in exports, although of course export windows open and close based on this newfound arbitrage could be more sustainable. How are we communicating it? Well, we are pacing ourselves, because we have earned the right to do the right transaction at the right time, even though the strategy is exactly the way we wanted to be, to be a more predictable earnings growth company, the up and down of the cyclicality of that business is something that hurts that. The fact that this business is earning this much money has made the business more valuable and we are definitely taking our time in structuring the right deal. We have got that right. How this unfolds over the next many quarters, will be really driven by maximizing the value that you alluded to in your question. And ultimately the answer to your question is a resounding yes, that has been proved and increase the value of our franchise.

What of course is happened over these many years is that you go to a light of feedstock that propylene coming out of crackers reduces, and therefore potentially especially with declining refinery margins, propylene would go short, which it in fact has started to do. Now, as we look at the outlook for propylene, we see actually these supply demand balances improving, particularly in the third quarter, and one of the biggest reasons for that is the world’s largest propane dehydro unit in Texas will come online and produce on-purpose propylene. Propylene dehydro is prevalent is elsewhere around the world, notably in the Middle East, but for it to be prevalent here in the US decouples propylene and remember, we actually consume, we consume a lot of propylene, but we produce half of it.
So, we produce half of the propylene we have consumed. We do believe that propylene will see some near term price drops. As a consequence of that, the propylene arbitrage to ethylene will be less. Clearly also on the back end of this year, there could be a drop in ethylene because of excess supply coming on in the Middle East. So, we do believe this first half in ethylene, polyethylene is strong that natural gas arbitrage would be good, but having said that, its sustainability with excess supply coming on the back half will see that start to drop, but we believe we will benefit on the propylene side of that.

On Ag, I think the key message here is independent of what our partner has said, you have got to know and remember that we price SmartStax independent of them and we have two key objectives in our strategy that may be different to the original strategy. Firstly, a rapid transition of our portfolio to SmartStax is very key to Dow. And two, to grow our market share. So, we have always priced SmartStax over triple stacks [ph] to reflect the incremental value that the technology brings, but at the same time, penetration pricing has been our mantra. So, we are doing everything, we are meeting our goals where everything we said we do, we have done. There is no question that even with a revised numbers from our partner, (inaudible) is still one of the largest biotech launches in history. We are selling everything we have available to sell. There are no surprises in our field trials, and we are achieving the results that we said we would achieve.
In fact, we are very confident, we actually are launching SmartStax to nearly 40 hybrids this season and expect to have SmartStax in more than 70% of our corn portfolio in the next two to three years. So, we are on target, no effect from the partners’ announcements to us, we are on strategy and we see absolutely no negative effect to our forecast.

I probably would give you that, but I really do think the bigger reason is actions we and others have taken in Europe and US to rightsize the footprint, especially here in the US and Canada to not really have the export capacity in downstream businesses.

Germany is doing quite well and well for us. And there is a plethora of different ways we see it. We see it for example in our installation business, energy efficiency measures that have come through government stimuli not just in Germany, but across other countries in Europe like France in particular, northern Europe and also over into eastern Europe, and in fact we are seeing eastern Europe coming back stronger, that’s a quicker rebound than western Europe, but that helps Western Europe, in particular it helps Germany in particular.

So, the number of assets that have been taken down especially on the commodity side, the hydrocarbon and energy, compression that’s occurred in this quarter versus the quarter back then, propylene in particular, the question that was asked earlier on propylene cost base, propylene cost base is going up. There is lot of moving parts. So, I think the way we look at product, in 2008, that quarter was 93% operating rate, we had lowered the cost point of the company on structural cost by the combined company by the two big restructurings that were taken, one by Rohm and Haas, one by Dow, when you put those two together, that’s about $750 million takeout of costs and structural costs. And then the $1.3 billion of synergies, that $2 billion will be out of the combined cost base that you saw back in the first quarter of ’08.
That will then in turn mean the volume, once you get the volumes up there, that will all drop to the bottom line. And one way we have explained it is reuse ’07. If you take $6.5 billion of EBITDA in ’07 from Dow, $2.5 billion of EBITDA Rohm and Haas, that’s $9 billion. Add the $2 billion of EBITDA from cost savings, that’s $11 billion. And then if you add and subtract, add the equity earnings, then will have Dow Corning’s expansion (inaudible) that gives us up to around $11.5 billion, subtract the solvent businesses, that’s $10.7 billion of EBITDA or $4.50 a share. That $10.7 billion of EBITDA, when will that be attained? If you make the assumption of the 12, it will look like 7, then we are on the run rate to that number based on the current asset footprint, not counting any of the growth pipeline.

It’s number 1 in the world, it’s actually, technologically advanced. There is a right partner out there with feedstocks that, that business should be joint ventured with, but we are not counting on it this year. That’s the area we are going to interpret it, Bill. In terms of export windows from the US on polyethylene, I believe we moved significant amount outside to China and Asia in the first quarter, about 20%. We look very closely at pre-buying the pervious question, we don’t see any signs of inventory builds based on perspective price drop.

There is demand pool going on, not restocking.
We believe Rohm and Haas was a great acquisition for us and we are demonstrating it earlier than anyone expected on not only the bottom line but also the topline, which speaks my revenue point, and the two things that we were asked on the column of Q&A, our cost reductions give us great leverage to economic upside and economic recovery, and then growth will in fact drive the upside, and our innovations and the agenda around R&D and I really urge you to come to May 18th, sector day with Jerome because he’s going to show growth in all of its colors.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. Now to get you to turn to Slide 4. If I could sum up the quarter in just a few words, it would be this: We are a company that continues to deliver on its commitments, and we believe our performance in the first quarter represents a pivotal point in demonstrating the earnings power of the new Dow. 
The benefits of staying true to our strategic agenda are clear. And we are proving it quarter after quarter. Our results, once again, show the merits of our strategy in several key ways, starting with our broad-based top line growth and significant EBITDA margin expansion.
Let me summarize a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. Operating earnings were $0.43 per share, up significantly from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of last year. Sales were up a robust 33% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, and excluding divestitures, driven by significant improvements in both price and volume. And on a sequential basis, our growth continued as well, with sales up 8% over the fourth quarter pointing to a strengthening global recovery.
Another very encouraging sign was our volume growth in both North America and Europe. Each up an impressive 11% compared with last year. Emerging geographies grew as well, with volume up 27% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, volume in China was up an impressive 46%. All of this pushed our global operating rate to levels not seen since the second quarter of 2008. And our manufacturing momentum improved as the quarter progressed despite several unplanned outages.
EBITDA increased $877 million versus the same quarter last year, and was up more than 60% in the combined Performance segments. EBITDA margin expanded both year-over-year and sequentially at the enterprise level. And finally, our joint ventures continue to outperform with equity earnings up more than $200 million year-over-year, reaching a record $304 million driven by performance at Dow Corning, EQUATE and MEGlobal.
Let me turn to Slide 5. We stayed true to our strategic path and, in fact, made great progress on our key milestones. Financially, we are delivering on the earnings power of the new portfolio, especially in our Performance businesses and in emerging geographies. Operationally, we delivered cost reductions of $275 million in the first quarter. We remain well ahead of plan and are currently on annual run rate of $1.8 billion, which is ahead of our commitments. Strategically, we exceeded our growth synergy targets by delivering $530 million in revenue on a run-rate basis, while at the same time, we maintained our commitment to growth increasing our investment in research and development by 10%. We also made substantial progress in achieving our goal to divest $2 billion of non-strategic assets in 2010 and remain on track to deliver $5.5 billion in divestments in just 12 months, more than our commitment of $5 billion and in half the time.
On Slide 6, as most of you know, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the Styron division for just over $1.6 billion. Additionally, this deal can include supply and service contracts that will generate substantial value for Dow in the neighborhood of $400 million. This brings the total value of the deal to more than $2 billion, the high-end of our stated target for 2010. The value reflects what we consider an excellent multiple of over 8x EBITDA. The sale of Styron will be our fifth non-core divestment since April 2009, all at favorable multiples.
On Slide 7. Another feature of our earnings call has been to exhibit the tracking tool that provides a look into industry- and market-demand trends across our geographic footprint. This look underscores the unique view we have into the emerging global economic recovery, based on our participation in the value chains of a vast array of industries and end markets. And the picture is bright.
On Slide 8. Starting with an operating segment view, volume was up across virtually all of our businesses. And we are seeing increased demand in a wide variety of end markets, most of which are tied to consumer spending. Electronics, appliances and other durable goods and furniture, as well as consumer staples all showed strong growth. In addition, the automotive sector in North America is improving. And in Asia, it's accelerating.
And finally, there's increased demand in our Water business, which drove improved results, especially in Materials. These trends are particularly relevant given the alignment with the global megatrends that will drive our long-term performance and demonstrate that our new portfolio is very well-positioned. And you can see on the right of the slide, infrastructure stimulus spending still hasn't found its way through many value chains and commercial construction in developed regions continues to lag.  But some good news is that the Housing segment seems to have finally come off of its historic lows.
On Slide 9. Turning now to a geographic look. We see a similar story with a few lingering challenges. We have our eye on high unemployment in developed regions, so we are seeing positive signs that job markets have stabilized. The potential for asset and credit bubbles in emerging geographies and lingering concerns surrounding sovereign debt in Southern Europe could both be potential drags in global growth. However, these factors are clearly outweighed by the strengths that we are seeing. 
The overall global economic environment is on a stronger footing with the highlight being significant demand growth in Europe and North America. In addition, the step change and the relative cost position of U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas provides even further strength for Dow.  Finally, continuing rapid growth in emerging geographies led by China, where demand, as I said, was up an impressive 46%, was driven partly by growing domestic consumption. 
In summary, Dow's vast portfolio and broad geographic reach provide us with a unique perspective on the trends that are shaping the global economic recovery.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bill, who will give you some more detail on how these trends drove our results in the quarter."
768440,100639855,58176,"The Dow Chemical Company, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","DuPont de Nemours, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andrew. Let's begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results on Slide 10.  Reported sales were up $13.4 billion, an increase of 48% over the same period last year, and 8% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis a",1228,"Thank you, Andrew. Let's begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results on Slide 10.  Reported sales were up $13.4 billion, an increase of 48% over the same period last year, and 8% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis and excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 33% driven by volume growth of 16% and increased of price of 17%. 
EBITDA excluding certain items was up on a year-over-year basis by $877 million to $1.8 billion. On a sequential basis, EBITDA was up $356 million, an impressive increase considering that we had some margin compression in our Performance businesses due to rapid run-up in propylene costs. 
Earnings, excluding certain items, were $0.43 per share. The current quarter included $0.02 per share unfavorable impact for certain items. Details for these items are included in the appendix. Our effective tax rate was 15.7%, in line with the 15% to 20% range we communicated previously. 
The year-over-year increase in corporate was due in part to the inclusion of Morton Salt's results in the first quarter of last year. Our current quarter results also included higher performance share compensation and increased participation in our employee stock purchase program. We view this as a positive as it aligns the interest of our employees with those of our shareholders. For modeling purposes, you should expect corporate to run in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter.
Moving to Slide 11. Overall volume growth versus the same quarter last year was 16% on a pro forma basis, excluding divestitures. With our combined Performance segments, delivering an impressive 19% increase. We also achieved price gains in nearly all segments in double-digit increases across all geographies. Prices was up an impressive 16% in North America and 24% in Europe. On a sequential basis, price is up in all geographic regions with the exception of Europe. Again, North America showed strength with gains at 8%. Volume was up 4% versus the fourth quarter of last year but particular strength in both North America and Europe.
Now let's take a look at how the company performed on a segment level starting on Slide 14. In Electronic and Specialty Materials, volume was up 31% compared to the first quarter of 2009. In fact, volume in our Electronic Materials business was up 55% year-over-year. This reflect increased demand in memory, logic and display technologies. Our semiconductor technologies are capturing share as this sector continues to recover. We also are seeing substantial growth in the demand for water applications as these fundamental markets recover, contributing to substantial improvement in EBITDA margins across Specialty Materials. 
In Coatings and Infrastructure, volume increased 16%, excluding divestitures, while price was up 5%. Emerging regions are driving increased demand, while commercial construction continued to represent a challenge in North America and Europe. We are, however, seeing global improvements in residential construction end markets. I think it's important to highlight that excluding divestitures, EBITDA in this segment actually improved year-over-year. We also increased R&D spending as we move the investment in our POWERHOUSE Solar Shingle program into the business this quarter, as we're getting quarter closer to commercialization. Taking both of these points into consideration, EBITDA actually improved 8%. In our Acrylic-based Architectural Coatings business generated a solid EBITDA margin of around 15%. Coatings and Infrastructure should see further margin improvement as the businesses continue to work aggressively to recapture price related to more than 25% sequential increase in propylene, combined with seasonal volume increases.
Moving to Health and Ag Sciences. Both price and volume were down slightly on a year-over-year basis due to continued oversupply of glyphosate. This segment still holds significant growth potential looking forward. Our new Ag Chem molecules continue to gain traction. Our Seeds, Traits and Oil platform continue to grow and the introduction of SmartStax corn hybrids is continuing to meet our expectations.
In Performance Systems, volumes increased 27% with increases in all geographies and business units, primarily driven by: Dow Automotive, which benefited from increases in automotive demand in North America and Asia; and robust elastomer demand in all geographies, due to continued strength in food packaging, a sector that has been extremely resilient during the recent economic downturn.
Finally on this slide, you can see the primary drivers for Performance Products, which posted volume gains of 27%, excluding divestitures and price gains of 14%. Volume was up in all geographies and business units driven by consumer-led demand growth in Polyurethanes and growth in appliance-end markets driven by government incentives and energy-efficient standards.
Slide 16 details the performance of our Basic Plastics segment. Sales increased 49% year-over-year and EBITDA was $718 million for the quarter. Volume and price increases in Polyethylene were the largest contributor. Here, operating rates were high in the quarter enabling the business to focus on price. 
And finally in Basic Chemicals, volume increased 16% and price increased 6%. The major drivers in performance for this segment were an increase in demand for caustic soda in North America, due to the strength in the alumina industry, and a fourth consecutive quarter of price increases in Vinyl Chloride Monomer, which more than offset volume declines.
Now turning to Slide 17. Another high point in the quarter was equity earnings. We have rebounded strongly over the past five quarters, and now exceed pre-recession levels. In the first quarter, we delivered a record $304 million in equity earnings, up more than $200 million year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our focus on financial discipline continued in the quarter with tight control on working capital. Our CapEx spending was under $300 million in the quarter. However, I like to point out that the first quarter is typically a low quarter for us in terms of capital spending, and we do anticipate an increase next quarter due to scheduled turnarounds.
It is important to note that due to the adoption of new accounting standards in the first quarter, ASU 2009-17 previously referred to as FAS 167, our investment in our Thailand joint venture will be recognized as CapEx going forward, bringing our total spending closer to $2 billion for the year. However, I also like to point out that this change will not increase our actual cash outflows.
Cash flow from operations was slightly higher in the quarter versus a year ago. And remember, our receivables are higher as a result of our higher sales and we experienced a normal inventory builds in our seasonal businesses. We remain on track to generate $1.5 billion in free cash flow in 2010.
Our net debt to capital rose slightly in the quarter, due to the adoption of the new accounting standards I just previously mentioned, changing the accounting treatment for some of our liabilities. Despite this change, we remain committed to achieving our 2010 goal of 45% net debt to total cap by year end. With the increase of our profitability this quarter, our net-debt-to-EBITDA multiple improved by 0.5 to 3.2. And we are on a run rate of 2.8 exiting the quarter.
I'd also like to highlight, we continue to make meaningful progress on our cost synergy and restructuring goals achieving $275 million in total cost reduction for the quarter, achieving an annualized run rate of $1.8 billion. 
That wraps up my review of the details for the quarter. And I'll pass it back to Andrew."

I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the growth potential of a new Dow. This is clearly the central element of our strategy and our story. We have the right portfolio, the right geographic footprint and the right innovation pipe",777,"Thank you, Bill. I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the growth potential of a new Dow. This is clearly the central element of our strategy and our story. We have the right portfolio, the right geographic footprint and the right innovation pipeline. And I want to emphasize, we have all of this today. 
So I'd like to share with you a new and actually a more granular looked at our innovation pipeline, and update you on the growth synergies we're realizing in our new portfolio. So please turn to Slide 19, where you'll see we currently have more than 500 projects in our innovation playbook. And these are strategically aligned with our four megatrends. 
This impressive playbook is supported by our significant investment in research and development, which this year will be another $1.6 billion. This investment is aimed squarely at the intersection of society's greatest needs and business opportunities. 
Our innovation pipeline represents $30 billion on a non-risk-adjusted NPV. Consistent with our strategy and as you would expect, you see the pipeline is most robust in our Performance segments.
On Slide 20, when you look at it from a stage gate perspective, you can see that we have no shortage of new projects at the early stage of our pipeline. But equally exciting is how many are at an advanced stage and near commercialization. We have a very rigorous process to ensure our programs deliver commercial success. On a risk-adjusted basis, these programs represent $12.5 billion of net present value. And as you can see, the value is clearly tilted to implementation.
On Slide 21, I give you a few examples of some of the innovation projects that are yielding results today. Firstly, we have successfully commercialized next generation STYROFOAM Brand Insulation in North America, which provides customers the same great performance with a much improved and better-than-alternative products environmental profile. Our proprietary technology was the result of a multi-year effort led by one of our researchers, who by the way was recognized as a co-recipient for his contributions with a 2007 Nobel Prize. The technology gives us a significant competitive advantage in the market place, which is reflected in our first quarter results. 
In our Electronics business, we opened up a new display materials manufacturing facility late last year in Korea. This plant was fully operational in the first quarter, which was critical to meet increasing demand for display chemicals and OLED materials, two very fast-growing areas of the industry. This new capacity came on at a good time as Asian panel manufacturers are now running at full capacity.
And in our Polyurethanes business, we launched a new technology that delivers productivity gains for our key appliance customers, including energy savings and productivity efficiency, while lowering their raw material consumption. We are gaining market share as a result. In fact, Haier, one of the world's largest appliance manufacturers recently recognized Dow with their Best Strategic Supplier award, thanks in part to this technology. 
When you turn to Slide 22 and look at acquisition-related growth synergies, we're capturing tangible value from a range of new market opportunities. Let me just give you a few examples. 
We've landed a new long-term multi-year amines agreement with a strategic customer. We gained new sales for acrylic monomers with an industry-leading adhesives producer. We developed new solutions in Latin America that enhanced oil and gas production. We generated new biocides sales for water treatment applications. We secured higher margin, higher value PO-derivatives businesses in the food sector through focused marketing. We invented new novel polyolefin dispersion-based technology that has been adopted by a leading, global consumer products company. There are many more examples. And most of these have enabled us to achieve the $530 million in revenue already on a run-rate basis, which already surpasses our full year 2010 goal.
These growth projects clearly illustrate how the acquisition of Rohm and Haas provided the perfect opportunity to renew our existing customer relationships, jumpstart innovation and build stronger partnerships. Our commercial activities have been re-energized, not just in Advanced Materials, but across the entire enterprise. And this mindset is proliferating. Proliferating through every part of our company, enabling us to grow faster and more profitably. Nowhere is this more evident than in Dow Advanced Materials division, where an entrepreneurial spirit is thriving. That's one of the primary reasons we chose Jerome Peribere to run this division. As the former head of Dow AgroSciences, he led an organization that today is one of Dow's most profitable growth-oriented businesses. This is a perfect time to ask him to talk about some of the key drivers of growth in his portfolio."

In the Dow Advanced Materials, we drive an empowered culture, where every employee has an owner mindset, and is accountable for delivering results while building a new and valuable technology pipeline and channel to market that sustain our future growth. 
My comments today will only scratch the surface of our progress, but we're hosting an Investor Event next month, where we will have an even richer discussion of Dow Advanced Materials and our winning formula for growth. And I would invite you to turn on to Slide 23, where you will see that our businesses serve a broad and diverse range of high growth end markets, and their recognized leaders in their respective industries. These businesses employ a model that focuses on technology-intensive innovations and high-touch customer service. I'm proud to say that we have made tremendous progress in creating a formidable portfolio of high-growth and high-margin businesses.
As you know, we gained from Rohm and Haas an impressive electronics business, an industry-leading acrylics platform, a strong customer intimacy model and a large and growing presence in Asia. To this, we added Dow's strong industrial coatings position and we blended our industry-leading Water businesses, our Building and Construction franchises and our vast geographic reach and hitting power.  Last year, our division had sales in the excess of $9 billion, representing about 20% of Dow total sales and contributing almost a third of total Dow's EBITDA. I'd like to touch upon some of these key business drivers for growth and profitability, and invite you to turn to Slide 24.
Dow Electronics Materials is a leading producer of technologies that enable the production of memory chips, displays and other critical components that power today's electronic devices. The business is strongly tied to demand for consumer electronic devices, which has rebounded significantly this year. In fact, this business is already operating at peak profitability despite volumes that are 20% below normalized levels. Our technology position and speed to market led to several significant wins in the quarter, with leading global memory and logic manufacturer's as well as display producers.
Turning now onto our Building and Construction business, which like the broader Dow, has substantially reduced its cost base while continuing to invest in innovation. Since 2006, this business has increased average revenue per single-family housing start in the U.S. by some 80%, benefiting from increasing regulations and product innovation. And in high-growth regions like China, we recently launched our External Insulation Finishing System, which enhances energy performance and lowers overall installation costs.
Dow Coatings Materials is the world's largest supplier of coating raw materials to the global paint and coating industry. This business holds the broadest range of coating chemistries in the world, and the largest R&D commitment in the industry. You can see this already in our ultra low VOC formulations. Today's technologies cannot offer ultra low VOC and deliver the performance properties that customers expect. Our tremendous expertise in Emulsion Polymers and high throughput R&D capabilities has led to rapid ultra low VOC innovations that meet demanding performance requirements, and are now in the hands of many customers. We expect to revolutionize the coating industry in the next five years, thanks to major additions to our technology toolkits.
On Slide 25, our Coating business isn't the only area where we see the benefits of addressing environmental trends. Dow Adhesives and Functional Polymers is meeting demands for more lightweight and biodegradable packaging materials. This business increased penetration of water-based lamination adhesives, and is very well-positioned to meet the industry's demand to move from solvent-based materials. And we are further strengthening our portfolio in the global packaging arena by leveraging expertise from other areas in Dow that also touched this very large and growing sector. Expect to hear more about this as the year progresses.
And finally, our large Specialty Materials portfolio serves markets ranging from food and nutrition to household care, moving to biocides. You may know that this business best for the industry-leading water portfolio. This is an area where we've created the world's largest reverse osmosis membrane and Ion Exchange business. The benefits of our technology have already been rewarded in the marketplace and consider this, about half of the world's largest membrane desalinization plants that have started up in the last two years are using Dow technology.
On Slide 26, we have a broad portfolio of innovations valued at more than $7 billion NPV. We will provide a very detailed review of our Advanced Materials portfolio at our Sector Day on May 15, in Philadelphia. And I hope that you'll be able to join us and take advantage of this opportunity to see examples of our growth projects and hear directly from our business and technology leaders. Dow Advanced Materials is an incredibly exciting place to be right now, and I hope you'll watch us closely in the months and quarter to come."

I'd like to you to turn to Slide 27 because I'd really would love to mention Dow Corning, which is another key growth driver for our Electronics and Specialty Materials Operating segment. You know, Dow Corning has been growing",630,"Thanks very much, Jerome. I'd like to you to turn to Slide 27 because I'd really would love to mention Dow Corning, which is another key growth driver for our Electronics and Specialty Materials Operating segment. 
You know, Dow Corning has been growing its top line in a robust pace, 10% per year for the last 10 years. Now you can understand why we are excited about the future of this joint venture when you consider Dow Corning's leading global silicons position and the tremendous growth of its polysilicon joint venture, Hemlock Semiconductor. Due in large part to strong fundamentals and a solid industry, Hemlock's capacity will have expanded by more than 10x by 2015. Dow Corning will also be a part of the Advanced Materials' Sector Day in Philadelphia, so that's one more reason for you to attend. 
Please turn to Slide 28, where I'm going to now turn to our outlook. The global economy is showing signs of a meaningful recovery. Clearly, the most significant piece of new information is the robust improvement we've seen in North America and Europe. Two geographic areas that until now have lagged the recovery of the world economy. Our 27% sales growth in North America and 35% growth in Europe are compelling proof points that economic recovery is now underway in these areas. These numbers are even more impressive when you consider that volume gains comprised of full 11% of the growth in each region, showing that demand is indeed returning. Broad-based strength in many sectors of North America, such as Electronics to Automotive to Furniture shows a sustainable upturn is emerging. Even housing starts have shown more positive signs in recent weeks, as new home sales surged 27% in March, the highest gains in more than 40 years. Also, new orders for durable U.S. manufactured goods excluding transportation, posted the largest gains in more than two years last month. Strength in all of these sectors illustrates that the consumer is finally returning.
The story for emerging geographies is strong growth continuing at a robust pace. Volume growth of 27% versus one year ago with China, Brazil, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia and India are leading the way. In fact, volume growth, as we've already said, in Greater China, was an impressive 46%. This strong performance coupled with the recovering demand in North America and Europe is driving notable manufacturing momentum and bode particularly well for Dow. We recognize there are some continuing challenges, especially in the construction industry and unemployment and tight credit conditions continue to weigh on consumer sentiment. However, to date, these have been balanced by improving consumer and business spending. 
So our outlook is one of a strengthening global economic environment with increasing signs of sustained growth. We saw the results of this growth in the first quarter through both volume growth and margin expansion, driven by our new portfolio and the benefits of our significant cost reduction efforts. And as we turn to our priorities in the coming quarter, we will continue to remain focused on delivering our commitments. This means maintaining operational and financial discipline, further strengthening our balance sheet and investing for growth. Our actions to deliver a new portfolio with a lean cost structure and reinvigorated innovation engine, coupled with our strong presence in emerging geographies, lead Dow poised to deliver continued earnings momentum. 
This quarter was indeed a pivotal point, and giving the world a glimpse of our earnings power of the constant and consistent progress we are making in driving our strategic agenda forward. Quarter-after-quarter, we are displaying a new Dow, a Dow that delivers earnings growth for its shareholders. Stay tuned as we continue to demonstrate the power of this new company.

And of course, ethane has decoupled from naphtha and oil and that arbitrage has now been open for a while. And if you go into the next several years and you take the shale gas production that will come online in this country, then that, in our view, is a sustainable advantage for some years. The consequence of that is that U.S. natural gas will start to stabilize, be less volatile, as will indeed natural gas liquids. This will still not be competitive versus the Middle East. The Middle East has the lowest cost of natural gas and ethane. But when you throw on top of that the notion that the Middle East is running out of natural gas liquid production and ethane in particular, it is mostly dry gas, with the exception of Iran, then the U.S. production base and the U.S. asset base that is in-market and has flexibility of cracker feedstocks, which ours does, ours is the most flexible in the industry, then it has an advantage in-market. And therefore, has made the business and the assets more valuable for the foreseeable future. That value is being demonstrated in the results, even though these are trough-like conditions. The business is earning 4x to 5x what it earned in the '01, '02 trough, which is a spectacular statement, not the least of the reasons being that we are relying less and less in exports, although of course, export windows open and close, based on this newfound arbitrage, could be more sustainable. How are we communicating it? Well, we're pacing ourselves. Because we have earned the right to do the right transaction at the right time, even though the strategy is exactly the way we want it to be, to be a more predictable earnings growth company. The up and down of the cyclicality of that business is something that hurts that. The fact that this business is earning this much money has made the business more valuable. And we are definitely taking our time in structuring the right deal. We've earned that right. How this unfolds over the next many quarters? We'll be really driven by maximizing the value that you alluded to in your question. And ultimately, the answer to your question is a resounding, yes. It has improved and increased the value of our franchise."

Refinery-based propylene clearly, being one of the key ones in the United States, which usually makes the U.S. propylene long. What of course has happened over these many years, is as you go to a line of feedstock the propylene coming out of crackers reduces. And therefore, potentially, especially with declining refinery margins, propylene could go short, which is and in fact has started to do. Now as we look at the outlook for propylene, we see actually the supply-demand balance is improving, particularly in the third quarter. And one of the biggest reasons for that is the world's largest propane dehydro unit in Texas will come online and produce on-purpose propylene. Propane dehydro is prevalent elsewhere around the world, notably in the Middle East. But for it to be prevalent here in the U.S., decouples propylene. And remember, we actually consume a lot of propylene, but we produce half of it. So we produce half of the propylene we consume. We do believe that propylene will see some near-term price drops. As a consequence of that, the propylene arbitrage to ethylene will be less. Clearly, also on the back end of this year, there could be a drop in ethylene because of excess supply coming on in the Middle East. So we do believe this first half in ethylene, polyethylene is strong, that natural gas arbitrage will be good. But having said that, its sustainability with excess supply coming on the back half, we'll see that start to drop, but we believe will benefit on the propylene side of that."

And we are definitely the most competitive in the United States, Canada, as a result, due to our flexi crackers. So to your generic point, we do believe that it's elevated the performance of the business to a new level, when you throw on top of it the low-cost feedstocks we have available to us in places like Kuwait and Argentina. So the Dow strategy of asset-light low-cost feedstock place elsewhere to do petroceuticals, to use your favorite term, famous term actually, plus of course, the in-market competitiveness thrown on top of that, the first question from P.J. on natural gas in the U.S. and the arbitrage point has given the business a new level of performance in trough-like conditions.

We see it, for example, in our Insulation business, energy efficiency measures that have come through government's stimuli, not just in Germany, but across other countries in Europe like France in particular, Northern Europe, and also over into Eastern Europe.

What might be the differences here that we should expect, as the operating rates move up, that we will get better performance than what was generated back a couple of years ago?"

So the number of assets that have been taken down, especially on the commodity side, the hydrocarbon and energy compression that's occurred in this quarter versus the quarter back then, propylene in particular, the question that was asked earlier on propylene cost base, the propylene cost base is going up. There's a lot of moving parts. So I think the way we look at 2008, that quarter was an 83% operating rate. We've lowered the cost point of the company on structural cost for the combined company by the two big restructurings that were taken, one by Rohm and Haas, one by Dow. When you put those two together, that's about a $750 million take out of cost from structural costs. And then the $1.3 billion of synergies, that $2 billion will be out of the combined cost base that you saw back in the first quarter of '08. That will then, in turn, mean the volume, once you get the volumes up there, that'll all drop to the bottom line. And one way of explaining it is we use '07. If you take $6.5 billion of EBITDA in '07 from Dow, $2.5 billion of EBITDA from Rohm and Haas, that's $9 billion. Add the $2 billion of EBITDA from cost savings, that's $11 billion. And then if you add and subtract, add the equity earnings that we've had with Dow Corning expansions, Hemlock expansions, [indiscernible], that gives us up to around $11.5 billion, substract the sold businesses, that's $10.7 billion of EBITDA or $4.50 a share. That $10.7 billion of EBITDA, when will that be obtained? If you make the assumption that '12 will look like '07, then we're on the run rate to that number, based on the current asset footprint, not counting any of the growth pipeline."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. Now to get you to turn to Slide 4. If I could sum up the quarter in just a few words, it would be this: We are a company that continues to deliver on its commitments, and we believe that our performance in the first quarter represents a pivotal point in demonstrating the earnings power of the new Dow. 
The benefits of staying true to our strategic agenda are clear, and we are proving it quarter after quarter. Our results, once again, showed the merits of our strategy in several key ways, starting with our broad-based top line growth and significant EBITDA margin expansion.
Let me summarize a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. Operating earnings were $0.43 per share, up significantly from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of last year. Sales were up a robust 33% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, and excluding divestitures, driven by significant improvements in both price and volume. And on a sequential basis, our growth continued as well, with sales up 8% over the fourth quarter pointing to a strengthening global recovery.
Another very encouraging sign was our volume growth in both North America and Europe, each up an impressive 11% compared with last year. Emerging geographies grew as well, with volume up 27% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, volume in China was up an impressive 46%. All of this pushed our global operating rate to levels not seen since the second quarter of 2008. And our manufacturing momentum improved as the quarter progressed despite several unplanned outages.
EBITDA increased $877 million versus the same quarter last year and was up more than 60% in the combined Performance segments. EBITDA margin expanded both year-over-year and sequentially at the enterprise level. And finally, our joint ventures continued to outperform, with equity earnings up more than $200 million year-over-year, reaching a record $304 million driven by performance at Dow Corning, EQUATE and MEGlobal.
Let me turn to Slide 5. We stayed true to our strategic path and, in fact, made great progress on our key milestones. Financially, we are delivering on the earnings power of the new portfolio, especially in our Performance businesses and in emerging geographies. 
Operationally, we delivered cost reductions of $275 million in the first quarter. We remain well ahead of plan and are currently on an annual run rate of $1.8 billion, which is ahead of our commitments. 
Strategically, we exceeded our growth synergy targets by delivering $530 million in revenue on a run-rate basis, while at the same time, we maintained our commitment to growth, increasing our investment in research and development by 10%. We also made substantial progress in achieving our goal to divest $2 billion of non-strategic assets in 2010 and remain on track to deliver $5.5 billion in divestments in just 12 months, more than our commitment of $5 billion and in half the time.
On Slide 6, as most of you know, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the Styron division for just over $1.6 billion. Additionally, this deal can include supply and service contracts that will generate substantial value for Dow in the neighborhood of $400 million. This brings the total value of the deal to more than $2 billion, the high-end of our stated target for 2010. The value reflects what we consider an excellent multiple of over 8x EBITDA. The sale of Styron will be our fifth non-core divestment since April 2009, all at favorable multiples.
On Slide 7. Another feature of our earnings call has been to exhibit the tracking tool that provides a look into industry- and market-demand trends across our geographic footprint. This look underscores the unique view we have into the emerging global economic recovery, based on our participation in the value chains of a vast array of industries and end markets. And the picture is bright.
On Slide 8. Starting with an operating segment view, volume was up across virtually all of our businesses. And we are seeing increased demand in a wide variety of end markets, most of which are tied to consumer spending. Electronics, appliances and other durable goods and furniture, as well as consumer staples all showed strong growth. In addition, the automotive sector in North America is improving. And in Asia, it's accelerating.
And finally, there's increased demand in our Water business, which drove improved results, especially in Materials. These trends are particularly relevant given the alignment with the global megatrends that will drive our long-term performance and demonstrate that our new portfolio is very well-positioned. And you can see on the right of the slide, infrastructure stimulus spending still hasn't found its way through many value chains and commercial construction in developed regions continues to lag.  But some good news is that the Housing segment seems to have finally come off of its historic lows.
On Slide 9. Turning now to a geographic look. We see a similar story with a few lingering challenges. We have our eye on high unemployment in developed regions, so we are seeing positive signs that job markets have stabilized. The potential for asset and credit bubbles in emerging geographies and lingering concerns surrounding sovereign debt in Southern Europe could both be potential drags in global growth. However, these factors are clearly outweighed by the strengths that we are seeing. 
The overall global economic environment is on a stronger footing with the highlight being significant demand growth in Europe and North America. In addition, the step change and the relative cost position of U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas provides even further strength for Dow.  Finally, continuing rapid growth in emerging geographies led by China, where demand, as I said, was up an impressive 46%, was driven partly by growing domestic consumption. 
In summary, Dow's vast portfolio and broad geographic reach provide us with a unique perspective on the trends that are shaping the global economic recovery.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bill, who will give you some more detail on how these trends drove our results in the quarter."

Let's begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results on Slide 10.  Reported sales were $13.4 billion, an increase of 48% over the same period last year, and 8% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis and",1227,"Thank you, Andrew. Let's begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results on Slide 10.  Reported sales were $13.4 billion, an increase of 48% over the same period last year, and 8% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. On a pro forma basis and excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 33% driven by volume growth of 16% and increased of price of 17%. 
EBITDA excluding certain items was up on a year-over-year basis by $877 million to $1.8 billion. On a sequential basis, EBITDA was up $356 million, an impressive increase considering that we had some margin compression in our Performance businesses due to rapid run-up in propylene costs. 
Earnings excluding certain items were $0.43 per share. The current quarter included $0.02 per share unfavorable impact for certain items. Details for these items are included in the appendix. 
Our effective tax rate was 15.7%, in line with the 15% to 20% range we commuted previously. 
The year-over-year increase in corporate was due in part to the inclusion of Morton Salt's results in the first quarter of last year. Our current quarter results also included higher performance share compensation and increased participation in our employee stock purchase program. We view this as a positive as it aligns the interest of our employees with those of our shareholders. For modeling purposes, you should expect corporate to run in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter.
Moving to Slide 11. Overall volume growth versus the same quarter last year was 16% on a pro forma basis excluding divestitures, with our combined Performance segments delivering an impressive 19% increase. We also achieved price gains in nearly all segments and double-digit increases across all geographies. Price was up an impressive 16% in North America and 24% in Europe. On a sequential basis, price was up in all geographic regions with the exception of Europe. Again, North America showed strength with gains at 8%. Volume was up 4% versus the fourth quarter of last year but particular strength in both North America and Europe.
Now let's take a look at how the company performed on a segment level starting on Slide 14. In Electronic and Specialty Materials, volume was up 31% compared to the first quarter of 2009. In fact, volume in our Electronic Materials business was up 55% year-over-year. This reflect increased demand in memory, logic and display technologies. Our semiconductor technologies are capturing share as this sector continues to recover. We also are seeing substantial growth in the demand for water applications as these fundamental markets recover, contributing to substantial improvement in EBITDA margins across Specialty Materials. 
In Coatings and Infrastructure, volume increased 16%, excluding divestitures, while price was up 5%. Emerging regions are driving increased demand, while commercial construction continued to represent a challenge in North America and Europe. We are, however, seeing global improvements in residential construction end markets. 
I think it's important to highlight that excluding divestitures, EBITDA in this segment actually improved year-over-year. We also increased R&D spending as we move the investment in our POWERHOUSE Solar Shingle program into the business this quarter, as we're getting quarter closer to commercialization. Taking both of these points into consideration, EBITDA actually improved 8%. In our Acrylic-based Architectural Coatings business generated a solid EBITDA margin of around 15%. Coatings and Infrastructure should see further margin improvement as the businesses continue to work aggressively to recapture price related to more than 25% sequential increase in propylene, combined with seasonal volume increases.
Moving to Health and Ag Sciences. Both price and volume were down slightly on a year-over-year basis due to continued oversupply of glyphosate. This segment still holds significant growth potential looking forward. Our new Ag Chem molecules continue to gain traction. Our Seeds, Traits and Oil platforms continue to grow, and the introduction of SmartStax corn hybrids is continuing to meet our expectations.
In Performance Systems, volumes increased 27% with increases in all geographies and business units, primarily driven by: Dow Automotive, which benefited from increases in automotive demand in North America and Asia; and robust elastomer demand in all geographies, due to continued strength in food packaging, a sector that has been extremely resilient during the recent economic downturn.
Finally on this slide, you can see the primary drivers for Performance Products, which posted volume gains of 27%, excluding divestitures and price gains of 14%. Volume was up in all geographies and business units driven by consumer-led demand growth in Polyurethanes and growth in appliance-end markets driven by government incentives and energy-efficient standards.
Slide 16 details the performance of our Basic Plastics segment. Sales increased 49% year-over-year and EBITDA was $718 million for the quarter. Volume and price increases in Polyethylene were the largest contributor. Here, operating rates were high in the quarter enabling the business to focus on price. 
And finally in Basic Chemicals, volume increased 16% and price increased 6%. The major drivers in performance for this segment were an increase in demand for caustic soda in North America, due to the strength in the alumina industry, and a fourth consecutive quarter of price increases in Vinyl Chloride Monomer, which more than offset volume declines.
Now turning to Slide 17. Another high point in the quarter was equity earnings. We have rebounded strongly over the past five quarters, and now exceed pre-recession levels. In the first quarter, we delivered a record $304 million in equity earnings, up more than $200 million year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our focus on financial discipline continued in the quarter with tight control on working capital. Our CapEx spending was under $300 million in the quarter. However, I like to point out that the first quarter is typically a low quarter for us in terms of capital spending, and we do anticipate an increase next quarter due to scheduled turnarounds.
It is important to note that due to the adoption of new accounting standards in the first quarter, ASU 2009-17 previously referred to as FAS 167, our investment in our Thailand joint venture will be recognized as CapEx going forward, bringing our total spending closer to $2 billion for the year. However, I also like to point out that this change will not increase our actual cash outflows.
Cash flow from operations was slightly higher in the quarter versus a year ago. And remember, our receivables are higher as a result of our higher sales and we experienced a normal inventory builds in our seasonal businesses. We remain on track to generate $1.5 billion in free cash flow in 2010.
Our net debt to capital rose slightly in the quarter, due to the adoption of the new accounting standards I just previously mentioned, changing the accounting treatment for some of our liabilities. Despite this change, we remain committed to achieving our 2010 goal of 45% net debt to total cap by year end. With the increase of our profitability this quarter, our net-debt-to-EBITDA multiple improved by 0.5 to 3.2. And we are on a run rate of 2.8 exiting the quarter.
I'd also like to highlight, we continue to make meaningful progress on our cost synergy and restructuring goals achieving $275 million in total cost reduction for the quarter, achieving an annualized run rate of $1.8 billion. 
That wraps up my review of the details for the quarter. And I'll pass it back to Andrew."

I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the growth potential of a new Dow. This is clearly the central element of our strategy and our story. We have the right portfolio, the right geographic footprint and the right innovation pipe",776,"Thank you, Bill. I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the growth potential of a new Dow. This is clearly the central element of our strategy and our story. We have the right portfolio, the right geographic footprint and the right innovation pipeline. And I want to emphasize, we have all of this today. 
So I'd like to share with you a new and actually a more granular looked at our innovation pipeline, and update you on the growth synergies we're realizing in our new portfolio. So please turn to Slide 19, where you'll see we currently have more than 500 projects in our innovation playbook. And these are strategically aligned with our four megatrends. 
This impressive playbook is supported by our significant investment in research and development, which this year will be another $1.6 billion. This investment is aimed squarely at the intersection of society's greatest needs and business opportunities. 
Our innovation pipeline represents $30 billion on a non-risk-adjusted NPV. Consistent with our strategy and as you would expect, you see the pipeline is most robust in our Performance segments.
On Slide 20, when you look at it from a stage gate perspective, you can see that we have no shortage of new projects at the early stage of our pipeline. But equally exciting is how many are at an advanced stage and near commercialization. We have a very rigorous process to ensure our programs deliver commercial success. On a risk-adjusted basis, these programs represent $12.5 billion of net present value. And as you can see, the value is clearly tilted to implementation.
On Slide 21, I give you a few examples of some of the innovation projects that are yielding results today. Firstly, we have successfully commercialized next generation STYROFOAM Brand Insulation in North America, which provides customers the same great performance with a much improved and better-than-alternative products environmental profile. Our proprietary technology was the result of a multiyear effort led by one of our researchers, who by the way was recognized as a corecipient for his contributions with a 2007 Nobel Prize. The technology gives us a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace, which is reflected in our first quarter results. 
In our Electronics business, we opened up a new display materials manufacturing facility late last year in Korea. This plant was fully operational in the first quarter, which was critical to meet increasing demand for display chemicals and OLED materials, two very fast-growing areas of the industry. This new capacity came on at a good time as Asian panel manufacturers are now running at full capacity.
And in our Polyurethanes business, we launched a new technology that delivers productivity gains for our key appliance customers, including energy savings and productivity efficiency, while lowering their raw material consumption. We are gaining market share as a result. In fact, Haier, one of the world's largest appliance manufacturers recently recognized Dow with their Best Strategic Supplier award, thanks in part to this technology. 
When you turn to Slide 22 and look at acquisition-related growth synergies, we're capturing tangible value from a range of new market opportunities. Let me just give you a few examples. 
We've landed a new long-term multiyear amines agreement with a strategic customer. We gained new sales for acrylic monomers with an industry-leading adhesives producer. We developed new solutions in Latin America that enhanced oil and gas production. We generated new biocides sales for water treatment applications. We secured higher margin, higher value PO-derivatives businesses in the food sector through focused marketing. We invented new novel polyolefin dispersion-based technology that has been adopted by a leading global consumer products company. There are many more examples. And most of these have enabled us to achieve the $530 million in revenue already on a run-rate basis, which already surpasses our full year 2010 goal.
These growth projects clearly illustrate how the acquisition of Rohm and Haas provided the perfect opportunity to renew our existing customer relationships, jump-start innovation and build stronger partnerships. Our commercial activities have been re-energized, not just in Advanced Materials, but across the entire enterprise. And this mindset is proliferating, proliferating through every part of our company, enabling us to grow faster and more profitably. Nowhere is this more evident than in Dow Advanced Materials division, where an entrepreneurial spirit is thriving. That's one of the primary reasons we chose Jerome Peribere to run this division. As the former head of Dow AgroSciences, he led an organization that today is one of Dow's most profitable growth-oriented businesses. This is a perfect time to ask him to talk about some of the key drivers of growth in his portfolio."

In the Dow Advanced Materials, we drive an empowered culture, where every employee has an owner mindset and is accountable for delivering results while building a new and valuable technology pipeline and channel to market that sustain our future growth. 
My comments today will only scratch the surface of our progress, but we're hosting an Investor Event next month where we will have an even richer discussion of Dow Advanced Materials and our winning formula for growth. And I would invite you to turn on to Slide 23, where you will see that our businesses serve a broad and diverse range of high-growth end markets and their recognized leaders in their respective industries. These businesses employ a model that focuses on technology-intensive innovations and high-touch customer service. I'm proud to say that we have made tremendous progress in creating a formidable portfolio of high-growth and high-margin businesses.
As you know, we gained from Rohm and Haas an impressive Electronics business, an industry-leading acrylics platform, a strong customer intimacy model and a large and growing presence in Asia. To this, we added Dow's strong industrial coatings position and we blended our industry-leading Water businesses, our Building and Construction franchises and our vast geographic reach and hitting power.  Last year, our division had sales in the excess of $9 billion, representing about 20% of Dow total sales and contributing almost a third of total Dow's EBITDA. 
I'd like to touch upon some of these key business drivers for growth and profitability and invite you to turn to Slide 24. Dow Electronics Materials is a leading producer of technologies that enable the production of memory chips, displays and other critical components that power today's electronic devices. The business is strongly tied to demand for consumer electronic devices, which has rebounded significantly this year. In fact, this business is already operating at peak profitability despite volumes that are 20% below normalized levels. Our technology position and speed to market led to several significant wins in the quarter, with leading global memory and logic manufacturers as well as display producers.
Turning now onto our Building and Construction business, which like the broader Dow, has substantially reduced its cost base while continuing to invest in innovation. Since 2006, this business has increased average revenue per single-family housing start in the U.S. by some 80%, benefiting from increasing regulations and product innovation. And in high-growth regions like China, we recently launched our External Insulation Finishing System, which enhances energy performance and lowers overall installation costs.
Dow Coatings Materials is the world's largest supplier of coating raw materials to the global paint and coating industry. This business holds the broadest range of coating chemistries in the world and the largest R&D commitment in the industry. You can see this already in our ultra low VOC formulations. Today's technologies cannot offer ultralow VOC and deliver the performance properties that customers expect. Our tremendous expertise in emulsion polymers and high throughput R&D capabilities has led to rapid ultra low VOC innovations that meet demanding performance requirements, and are now in the hands of many customers. We expect to revolutionize the coating industry in the next five years, thanks to major additions to our technology toolkits.
On Slide 25, our Coating business isn't the only area where we see the benefits of addressing environmental trends. Dow Adhesives and Functional Polymers is meeting demands for more lightweight and biodegradable packaging materials. This business increased penetration of water-based lamination adhesives, and is very well-positioned to meet the industry's demand to move from solvent-based materials. And we are further strengthening our portfolio in the global packaging arena by leveraging expertise from other areas in Dow that also touched this very large and growing sector. Expect to hear more about this as the year progresses.
And finally, our large Specialty Materials portfolio serves markets ranging from food and nutrition to household care, moving to biocides. You may know that this business best for the industry-leading water portfolio. This is an area where we've created the world's largest reverse osmosis membrane and Ion Exchange business. The benefits of our technology have already been rewarded in the marketplace and consider this, about half of the world's largest membrane desalinization plants that have started up in the last two years are using Dow technology.
On Slide 26, we have a broad portfolio of innovations valued at more than $7 billion NPV. We will provide a very detailed review of our Advanced Materials portfolio at our Sector Day on May 18 in Philadelphia. And I hope that you'll be able to join us and take advantage of this opportunity to see examples of our growth projects and hear directly from our business and technology leaders. Dow Advanced Materials is an incredibly exciting place to be right now, and I hope you'll watch us closely in the months and quarter to come."
768440,100639855,64607,"The Dow Chemical Company, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","DuPont de Nemours, Inc.","Executives","Thanks very much, Jerome. I'd like to you to turn to Slide 27, because I'd really would love to mention Dow Corning, which is another key growth driver for our Electronics and Specialty Materials Operating segment. You know, Dow Corning has been growing",630,"Thanks very much, Jerome. I'd like to you to turn to Slide 27, because I'd really would love to mention Dow Corning, which is another key growth driver for our Electronics and Specialty Materials Operating segment. 
You know, Dow Corning has been growing its top line in a robust pace, 10% per year for the last 10 years. Now you can understand why we are excited about the future of this joint venture when you consider Dow Corning's leading global silicons position and the tremendous growth of its polysilicon joint venture, Hemlock Semiconductor. Due in large part to strong fundamentals and a solid industry, Hemlock's capacity will have expanded by more than 10x by 2015. Dow Corning will also be a part of the Advanced Materials' Sector Day in Philadelphia, so that's one more reason for you to attend. 
Please turn to Slide 28, where I'm going to now turn to our outlook. The global economy is showing signs of a meaningful recovery. Clearly, the most significant piece of new information is the robust improvement we've seen in North America and Europe, two geographic areas that until now have lagged the recovery of the world economy. Our 27% sales growth in North America and 35% growth in Europe are compelling proof points that economic recovery is now underway in these areas. These numbers are even more impressive when you consider that volume gains comprised a full 11% of the growth in each region, showing that demand is indeed returning. Broad-based strength in many sectors of North America, such as electronics to automotive to furniture shows a sustainable upturn is emerging. Even housing starts have shown more positive signs in recent weeks, as new home sales surged 27% in March, the highest gains in more than 40 years. Also, new orders for durable U.S. manufactured goods excluding transportation, posted the largest gains in more than two years last month. Strength in all of these sectors illustrates that the consumer is finally returning.
The story for emerging geographies is strong growth continuing at a robust pace. Volume growth of 27% versus one year ago with China, Brazil, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia and India are leading the way. In fact, volume growth, as we've already said, in Greater China, was an impressive 46%. This strong performance, coupled with the recovering demand in North America and Europe, is driving notable manufacturing momentum and bode particularly well for Dow. We recognize there are some continuing challenges, especially in the construction industry and unemployment and tight credit conditions continue to weigh on consumer sentiment. However, to date, these have been balanced by improving consumer and business spending. 
So our outlook is one of a strengthening global economic environment with increasing signs of sustained growth. We saw the results of this growth in the first quarter through both volume growth and margin expansion, driven by our new portfolio and the benefits of our significant cost-reduction efforts. 
And as we turn to our priorities in the coming quarter, we will continue to remain focused on delivering our commitments. This means maintaining operational and financial discipline, further strengthening our balance sheet and investing for growth. Our actions to deliver a new portfolio with a lean cost structure and reinvigorated innovation engine, coupled with our strong presence in emerging geographies, lead Dow poised to deliver continued earnings momentum. 
This quarter was indeed a pivotal point in giving the world a glimpse of our earnings power and of the constant and consistent progress we are making in driving our strategic agenda forward. Quarter-after-quarter, we are displaying a new Dow, a Dow that delivers earnings growth for its shareholders. Stay tuned as we continue to demonstrate the power of this new company.
I will now turn the call back to Howard."

And of course, ethane has decoupled from naphtha and oil and that arbitrage has now been open for a while. And if you go into the next several years and you take the shale gas production that will come online in this country, then that, in our view, is a sustainable advantage for some years. The consequence of that is that U.S. natural gas will start to stabilize, be less volatile, as will indeed natural gas liquids. This will still not be competitive versus the Middle East. The Middle East has the lowest cost of natural gas and ethane. But when you throw on top of that the notion that the Middle East is running out of natural gas liquid production and ethane in particular, it is mostly dry gas, with the exception of Iran, then the U.S. production base and the U.S. asset base that is in-market and has flexibility of cracker feedstocks, which ours does, ours is the most flexible in the industry, then it has an advantage in-market. And therefore, has made the business and the assets more valuable for the foreseeable future. That value is being demonstrated in the results, even though these are trough-like conditions. The business is earning 4x to 5x what it earned in the '01, '02 trough, which is a spectacular statement, not the least of the reasons being that we are relying less and less in exports, although of course, export windows open and close, based on this newfound arbitrage, could be more sustainable. How are we communicating it? Well, we're pacing ourselves. Because we have earned the right to do the right transaction at the right time, even though the strategy is exactly the way we want it to be, to be a more predictable earnings growth company. The up and down of the cyclicality of that business is something that hurts that. The fact that this business is earning this much money has made the business more valuable. And we are definitely taking our time in structuring the right deal. We've earned that right. How this unfolds over the next many quarters? We'll be really driven by maximizing the value that you alluded to in your question. And ultimately, the answer to your question is a resounding, yes. It has improved and increased the value of our franchise."

Refinery-based propylene clearly, being one of the key ones in the United States, which usually makes the U.S. propylene long. What of course has happened over these many years, is as you go to a line of feedstock the propylene coming out of crackers reduces. And therefore, potentially, especially with declining refinery margins, propylene could go short, which is and in fact has started to do. Now as we look at the outlook for propylene, we see actually the supply-demand balance is improving, particularly in the third quarter. And one of the biggest reasons for that is the world's largest propane dehydro unit in Texas will come online and produce on-purpose propylene. Propane dehydro is prevalent elsewhere around the world, notably in the Middle East. But for it to be prevalent here in the U.S., decouples propylene. And remember, we actually consume a lot of propylene, but we produce half of it. So we produce half of the propylene we consume. We do believe that propylene will see some near-term price drops. As a consequence of that, the propylene arbitrage to ethylene will be less. Clearly, also on the back end of this year, there could be a drop in ethylene because of excess supply coming on in the Middle East. So we do believe this first half in ethylene, polyethylene is strong, that natural gas arbitrage will be good. But having said that, its sustainability with excess supply coming on the back half, we'll see that start to drop, but we believe will benefit on the propylene side of that."

I probably would give you that. But I really do think the bigger reason is actions we and others have taken in Europe and U.S. to right-size the footprint, especially here in the U.S. and Canada to not really have the export capacity in key downstream businesses.

And we are definitely the most competitive in the United States, Canada as a result due to our flexi crackers. So to your generic point, we do believe that it's elevated the performance of the business to a new level, when you throw on top of it the low-cost feedstocks we have available to us in places like Kuwait and Argentina. So the Dow strategy of asset-light, low-cost feedstock plays elsewhere to do petraceuticals, to use your favorite term, famous term actually, plus of course, the in-market competitiveness thrown on top of that, the first question from P.J. on natural gas in the U.S. and the arbitrage point, has given the business a new level of performance in trough-like conditions.

But I was looking through some numbers on a pro forma basis, I actually think that the company performed a bit better back in the second quarter of '08 with Rohm and Haas. Are the numbers wrong here? What might be the differences here that we should expect, as the operating rates move up, that we will get better performance than what was generated back a couple of years ago?"

So the number of assets that have been taken down, especially on the commodity side, the hydrocarbon and energy compression that's occurred in this quarter versus the quarter back then, propylene in particular, the question that was asked earlier on propylene cost base, the propylene cost base is going up. There's a lot of moving parts. So I think the way we look at 2008, that quarter was an 83% operating rate. We've lowered the cost point of the company on structural cost for the combined company by the two big restructurings that were taken, one by Rohm and Haas, one by Dow. When you put those two together, that's about a $750 million take out of cost from structural costs. And then the $1.3 billion of synergies, that $2 billion will be out of the combined cost base that you saw back in the first quarter of '08. That will then, in turn, mean the volume, once you get the volumes up there, that'll all drop to the bottom line. And one way of explaining it is we use '07. If you take $6.5 billion of EBITDA in '07 from Dow, $2.5 billion of EBITDA from Rohm and Haas, that's $9 billion. Add the $2 billion of EBITDA from cost savings, that's $11 billion. And then if you add and subtract, add the equity earnings that we've had with Dow Corning expansions, Hemlock expansions, through white elephants that gives us up to around $11.5 billion, substract the sold businesses, that's $10.7 billion of EBITDA or $4.50 a share. That $10.7 billion of EBITDA, when will that be obtained? If you make the assumption that '12 will look like '07, then we're on the run rate to that number, based on the current asset footprint, not counting any of the growth pipeline."

Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. If I can ask you to turn to Slide 4. This morning, we announced another quarter of strong results both in the top and bottom line. Virtually,",1559,"Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. If I can ask you to turn to Slide 4. 
This morning, we announced another quarter of strong results both in the top and bottom line. Virtually, every financial measure is up: price, volume, EBITDA, operating rate, cash flow and earnings. All demonstrate continuing momentum. 
We remain firmly on the path we laid out at the beginning of the year, and we are delivering the financial performance we promised. The best proof point that our strategic agenda is the right one, is the continued strength in our Performance businesses, which delivered more than 70% of the EBITDA for the quarter, and we believe this performance will continue as momentum continues in a positive direction for a sustained global economic recovery.
Here's some high-level takeaways from the quarter. Operating earnings were $0.54, up more than tenfold from the year-ago period and up more than 25% sequentially. This was driven by sales gains of 26%, with significant increases in both price and volume. EBITDA increased to $1.9 billion, up more than $300 million, and EBITDA year-to-date is up nearly 50% compared to the same period last year.
Our Performance businesses again showed strength and continuing momentum with EBITDA up $175 million sequentially excluding health and agriculture. A number of these businesses delivered EBITDA margins at or above our normalized targets and at pre-recessional or better levels including Electronic and Specialty Materials, which has now surpassed 30% for four quarters running.
Others include Architectural Coatings, which achieved 19% EBITDA margins in the quarter. Elastomers delivered 16% EBITDA margins. This is the largest piece of our Performance Systems segment and has delivered at levels between 15% and 18% for the last five quarters.
Our Epoxy business, driven by continued growth in electronics and our continued shift to higher-margin specialty grades in Asia delivered 20% margins and Polyglycols was more than 20% to name a few. At a division level, our Advanced Materials earnings in the first half are nearly back to the pre-recession levels of first half 2008. For the entire company, our overall EBITDA performance is particularly notable given a $1.6 billion increase in purchased feedstock cost and a $100 million increase in planned turnaround cost.
We also had several major unplanned outages that were completely unforeseen, and this cost us an estimated lost-sales opportunity of more than $300 million or at least $0.07 in earnings per share. While we clearly lost sales in earnings opportunities in these unplanned events as well as in our turnarounds, we did not compromise the safety of our operations and took the necessary time to repair them despite the difficulties created in our supply chains and our customer base. We operate a ""safety first, production second"" mindset at Dow, and our ""Drive to Zero"" global safety goals will always come first. The good news is that these outages and turnarounds are now behind us, and we have returned to normal levels. 
And specifically in our Coatings business, our performance was dampened by severe global industry supply constraints, coupled with our own previously mentioned unplanned outages. This limited our ability to fully capture volume growth. These results were clearly disappointing to us. Even so, the segment showed double-digit sales gains in the quarter, and our outlook is very positive moving ahead.
When you exclude the impact of turnarounds and outages, we surpassed the $2 billion mark in EBITDA, bringing our first half run rate to nearly $4 billion. These are levels not seen since the prerecession period in 2008. 
In terms of demand, emerging geographies posted volume gains at a rate nearly double that of the total company. Performance segments led the way overall, driven in particular by Electronic Materials which was up 27%. This demand improvement pushed our global operating rate higher as well, up year-over-year and sequentially to 86% excluding planned turnarounds.
Turning to the balance sheet. We delivered a more than $1 billion improvement in operating cash flow. Also notable, our net-debt-to-EBITDA run rate exiting the quarter was 2.4. This represents a 14% decline sequentially and is less than half the level of April 2009. We are well on the way to achieving our balance sheet goals by year end. 
If you can turn to Slide 5, it brings me to milestones. We are making tremendous progress on these on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Financially, the earnings power of the new portfolio is already here today. 
Our Performance businesses comprised nearly 2/3 of sales and 3/4 of EBITDA for the quarter. Operationally, we delivered synergy and structural cost reductions of $325 million. In just six quarters, we have achieved more than $1.8 billion in cost savings, significantly improving the company's operating leverage, again, well ahead of our commitments. And strategically, we achieved several noteworthy milestones. We are forming a chlor-alkali joint venture, securing critical raw materials for our Downstream Performance businesses at a lower cost and with less capital outlays. 
We have now shed more than $5 billion of non-strategic assets, well ahead of schedule. And we achieved a stair-step reduction in our net-debt-to-capital ratio, moving from 49% to 46.5%, and we are now well on our way to achieving our goal. We did all of this while maintaining our focus on growth, investing more than $400 million in R&D in the quarter. 
And today, together with Saudi Aramco, we announced that our proposed joint venture project to build a world-scale integrated manufacturing facility for Performance Products, Plastics and Performance Systems businesses is now entering the final stages of the FEED study. We expect this work to be completed in mid-2011.
Together, we have also confirmed that the planned site location for the project will move to Jubail Industrial City, the largest industrial complex of its kind in the world. This new venue provides the benefit of extensive existing infrastructure and significantly enhances the capital efficiency of this project. It also provides the perfect platform for us to deploy our successful value bag concept like we have at our Dow Central Germany facility and other large Dow locations. This project aligns perfectly with our strategy to invest in key emerging regions and ensures our Downstream businesses have the competitive critical building block products they need to grow.
If you turn to Slide 6, speaking of growth, I also want to highlight that we have achieved a run rate of $684 million in growth synergies from our transformational Rohm and Haas acquisition. This represents a 30% increase versus last quarter, and we continue to make great progress towards our 2012 target of $2 billion. Let me mention a few examples achieved in the quarter.
Dow Coating Materials recorded new wins with surfactants in Asia. We landed new business with a leading multinational consumer products company, delivering new innovative formulations for hair care applications. We won new business in the Oil & Gas sector in Latin America. Our leading consumer products company has adopted our new household cleaner technology. A world-class petroleum additives company is now using our enabling chemistry to bring new technology for automotive lubricants to market.
Now I'd like to turn to a high-level view of the geographic and market demand trends that drove our performance in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 7. 
We saw broad-based recovery in global demand in a wide variety of end markets as momentum continued from last quarter. This was evident in our volume growth across the entire company led predominately by the combined Performance businesses, which were up 12%. Emerging geographies collectively posted volume gains nearly double that of the total company. Here are a few examples of why our portfolio is well positioned to capture this momentum. 
Electronics end markets continue to perform well driven by demand for flat screen technologies and semiconductors. Automotive end markets further strengthened in North America and Asia. Our Specialty Materials and Adhesives and Functional Polymers businesses benefited from strong demand in Latin America. From a geographical perspective, both North America and Europe continued their growth. And finally, we saw continued demand gains in Asia, particularly in our Electronic and Specialty Materials segment, which was up more than 30%. 
As you can see, fundamentals remain strong across a wide variety of high-growth sectors. Of course, we also experienced some challenges in the quarter, notably, the unplanned outages especially in the coatings value chain as well as the unfavorable weather patterns in North America and Europe, which impacted results in Dow AgroSciences. 
Overall, these challenges have been more than balanced by the broad-based positives we're seeing. Now Bill is going to give you some more detail on how these trends drove our results in the quarter.  But as I reflect on the quarter, I'd say there are a number of areas in which we excelled, and clearly, a couple of specific areas where we could have done more. Putting it transparently, we were firing on seven of our eight cylinders in the quarter. 
We know where the issues were for the eighth cylinder, and we now believe we have them fixed so we can go even further. We remain firmly on the earnings trajectory we laid out at the beginning of the year. 
So let me now turn the call over to Bill who will provide more details on our results."

Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, sales were up 26% driven by volume growth of 7% and an increase in price of 19%. 
EBITDA, excluding certain items was up $327 million to $1.9 billion. Earnings, excluding certain items that totaled $0.04, were $0.54 per share. Before I discuss results at the segment level, let me cover Dow's operating rate and the impact of turnarounds and outages.
Our operating rate continued to improve, reflecting sustained demand growth. Excluding the impact of planned turnarounds, it was up eight percentage points year-over-year. The second quarter is typically a high period of turnarounds, but this quarter was unique in several ways. As Andrew mentioned, we had more planned turnarounds than usual in the quarter, up $100 million versus the same quarter last year and up $150 million compared with the first quarter. 
We also faced a number of unplanned outages, particularly in the coatings value chain. This resulted in lost sales of more than $300 million. The estimated EPS impact was about $0.07 per share.
Now let me turn to price and volume. Overall volume growth was 7% with our combined Performance segments delivering a 12% increase. Volume grew in all segments except Basic Plastics, which was down 7%. It also grew in all geographies except Latin America, which was down 3%. Both of these declines were primarily due to an unplanned outage at our facility in Bahia Blanca. 
Excluding Basic Plastics, volume was actually up 9% in Latin America. We experienced particular strength in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa, and this marked the second consecutive quarter of growth in these geographic areas.
Turning to Slide 11. We also achieved price gains across most operating segments in all geographies. In total, price was up 19%. Again, North America and Europe, Middle East, Africa, delivered the strongest performance as price was up 20% and 21%, respectively.
Now turning to our segment overview on Slide 12. Electronic and Specialty Materials recovery continued in electronic end markets particularly in Asia, where the business saw volume growth of 25% or more across all its business units. This was driven by sustained high-utilization rates at chip foundries, strong demand for consumer electronics and high operating rates at major flat-panel display manufacturers. Our Electronics business recorded several wins in the quarter and places next-generation VISIONPAD technology with a large Japanese customer. Our Water business also continues to achieve volume growth in all geographies in its Ion Exchange Resin and RO Membrane business lines. 
Turning to our Coatings and Infrastructure segment. Dow Coating Materials grew sales 10% and expanded margins sequentially due to price increases and lower raw material cost despite monomer supply issues in the quarter. 
We also saw a double-digit sales increase in our Building and Construction business, with particular improvement in insulation products led by our STYROFOAM brand insulation. And finally, our Adhesives and Functional Polymers business achieved double-digit volume growth, with the strongest improvement seen in Asia and Latin America.
Moving to Health and Agricultural Sciences. This segment experienced solid volume improvement due to ramp up of new ag chems as well as gains in Seeds, Traits and Oils business, which included the successful launch of SmartStax technology. This segment continues to hold significant growth potential going forward, and Antonio will provide more detail shortly. 
Performance Systems saw improvement across all geographic areas in every business unit. We are benefiting from a strong rebound in automotive end markets, particularly in Asia and North America. And demand for our technology-differentiated products used in acoustics and body structure applications grew in excess of 25%. And in Formulated Systems, energy efficiency and infrastructure applications drove growth in the quarter.
Finally, on this slide, you'll see the primary drivers in performance products. Volume growth was recorded in all geographies except Asia, where our Polyurethanes business shed low-margin sales. Other key drivers in this segment included strong demand in electronic laminates in our Epoxy business and demand growth in our Polyglycols, Surfactants and Fluid businesses for heat transfer fluids used in solar power applications. The Basic Plastics on Slide 14, double-digit price gains in all geographies drove performance.
Notably, strong industry demand for polyethylene continued, primarily in North America and Asia. However, our overall sales were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned outage in Latin America. And finally, in Basic Chemicals, recovery continued in the alumina and the pulp and paper industries, which drove price up year-over-year.
Now turning to our joint ventures. Equity earnings were up significantly. This was driven by our joint ventures in Kuwait and by Dow Corning, where demand in Silicones and Polysilicon segments has returned to pre-recession levels. Equity earnings were down sequentially from the record levels of last quarter due to planned turnarounds at MEGlobal, EQUATE  and Kuwait Olefins Company. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to highlight our tight control on working capital. DSO was 46 days, down one day versus the same period last year. DSI was 67 days, down three days from a year-ago period. We reduced inventory units by 3% versus the same period last year. 
Our CapEx spending was under $400 million, and we remain on track toward our $2 billion goal for 2010. Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and free cash flow was $650 million, up nearly $1 billion versus the same quarter last year.
Our net-debt-to-total-cap declined 250 basis points to 46.5%. Progress here reflects a $1.9 billion decrease in net debt driven by proceeds from the Styron divestiture and our operating cash flow generated in the quarter. Please note that for modeling purposes, you should expect a $1 billion quarterly impact on revenue from the Styron divestiture. Our net-debt-to-EBITDA multiple improved to 2.8, and we are at a run rate of 2.4 exiting the quarter.
Finally, our progress in cost synergy and restructuring goals. We have now surpassed our $1.3 billion run-rate target for cost synergies associated with the Rohm and Haas acquisition two quarters ahead of schedule. 
That wraps up my review. Now I'd like to turn it over to Antonio for a discussion on key growth and profitability drivers for Dow AgroSciences."

While we encountered some short-term headwinds, our growth strategy remains on track. We predicted early",823,"Thanks, Bill. I'm glad to be here today to talk about AgroSciences' growth strategy and our technology progress. 
First, let me discuss the quarter. While we encountered some short-term headwinds, our growth strategy remains on track. We predicted early in the year that crop protection market conditions will reach a normalized level this year, meaning that 2010 will look a lot like 2007, which was a more stable year in agriculture versus the two previous years. 
The good news is that the first half of 2010, we increased EBITDA by more than $90 million versus 2009. And compared with the same period of 2007, our EBITDA was over $40 million higher. This takes into account more than $150 million of additional growth investments we have made in R&D and SG&A, and these investments are paying off. For example, our new product launches illustrate our technology power as sales from new ag chemicals are up more than 40% in the first half of 2010 versus last year.
Another area of progress is our Seeds portfolio, which reported a 15% increase in first half sales over last year's. These gains are a direct result of new products such as SmartStax, our biggest biotech launch ever, as well as our outstanding cotton varieties, the strength of our germplasm in Latin America and the performance of acquired seed companies. 
However, these wins were masked in our results for the quarter due to the price pressure in commodity ag chem products and poor weather conditions in the northern hemisphere, which limited some product applications. So while the quarter was not what we expected, we did improve our results versus last year and 2007, and we believe the long-term fundamentals of this industry are strong. Why? Because growth in this sector will be driven by the need of an increasing amount of food, feed and even fuel. The agricultural industry must produce more food with limited land, less water and fewer resources to feed a population that will reach 9 billion in 2050.
There is a global consensus among leading institutions about the challenge of feeding the world. Here's a fact from the Coalition for a Sustainable Agricultural Workforce: ""Over the next 40 years, we must produce more food than has been produced over the past 10,000 years combined."" Technology is one of the answers, and it is a critical one. While we expect some short-term market challenges as supply-demand dynamics balance out for commodity crop protection products, there is no doubt the need to enhance farmers' productivity is a critical challenge.
Please turn to Slide 19. So let me talk about our Ag Chem pipeline, which is the best we have ever had. We continue launching new proprietary agricultural chemical solutions that contribute to our growth objectives and generate cash flow. For example, sulfoxaflor insecticide will open new markets for us in 2012. And we have new herbicide and fungicide solutions coming next that are very promising.
In total, we expect new product sales to reach $500 million this year, it's 25% from our original estimates of $400 million. And we are projecting this number will grow to $800 million by 2013.
Our portfolio strategy is one of balance between biotechnology and crop protection, and our Seeds and Traits advances are truly exciting. Today, we have SmartStax, which is the only, I repeat, the only commercially available product approved for a 5% reduced-structure refuge requirement for both below- and above-ground pest. We had a very successful launch. In fact, we sold out everything we had planned to and more. 
Our SmartStax Refuge in the Bag concept will extend this leadership by providing the convenience that growers want, combined with the best technology. And we have the next industry breakthrough, with our DHT family of Traits. We already submitted DHT-stacked corn for regulatory approval in September of last year, and the soybean trait was submitted in December. 
We will continue hitting all our technology milestones, while increasing channel access through licensing, collaboration and bolt-on seed acquisitions. Combined with the launch of SmartStax and both Refuge in the Bag and DHT on the horizon, we are now on our way to reach our goal of having a $1 billion global corn business and achieving double-digit share of demand in North America.
And our collaborations in key row crops will catalyze the growth of the Seeds, Traits and Oil platform. We will move the mix in our portfolio closer to our 50-50 vision versus its 15% level today. We will do this, not by making Ag Chem smaller, but by making Seeds and Traits larger. 
In summary, we are on track to deliver our targets as we continue growing the top and bottom line in an industry where long-term fundamentals are compelling. We are achieving our new product sales targets and, most importantly, key R&D milestones, while investing in a strong pipeline products and capabilities. 
Thanks, and back to you, Andrew."

The long-term fundamentals for this sector remains strong, and we will continue to execute our build-and-collaborate strategy. In the time that remains, I'd like to provid",1150,"Thank you, Antonio, for sharing your insights regarding Dow AgroSciences' growth. The long-term fundamentals for this sector remains strong, and we will continue to execute our build-and-collaborate strategy. 
In the time that remains, I'd like to provide some granularity on our expectations for the back half of the year. So let me first start with the ethylene chain. If you look at Slide 22, there's been a great deal of discussion recently regarding the supply-and-demand dynamics of ethylene. From our perspective, fundamentals have not changed. 
We've long discussed that margins would likely contract in the second half of this year as new capacity comes online, thereby defining the trough. The reality is this new capacity is not ramping up as quickly as some predicted, and this effect, plus unplanned outages which always occur in this industry, coupled with 2010 GDP forecast that continue to project stronger growth than expected, makes for a better-than-expected scenario. And we are seeing that today, evidenced by the strong first half our Polyethylene Business delivered.
On Slide 23, you can see that this growth is due to real underlying demand and can be seen in North America at different places in the value chain. At the converter level, railcar days and destination are down about 20% versus the long-term average. And at the producer level, the ACC June data confirmed a 200-million pound draw-down, which dropped inventory by five days. Both are strong proof points that industry inventories remain at low levels.
As I mentioned, this underlying demand was evident in our tremendously strong performance in the first half of the year, where we averaged $700 million of EBITDA per quarter.
On Slide 24, we had the most competitive Ethylene and Polyethylene business in the industry. Plus, as mentioned last quarter, our U.S. assets will continue to benefit from the unfolding and positive domestic shale gas dynamics. We expect other factors, like new fractionation capacity that is coming online this year and next, to the tune of 7% each year, will even further improve the competitiveness of our U.S. cost position.
So while we continue to expect some margin contraction in the second half, we believe these positives will mitigate the downside. As a result, we could see profitability in the Polyethylene business decline by only about $150 million in the third quarter.
Our view is that our PE business will be entering peak margin territory over the next few years, and that the exiting from the trough will occur late 2010, early 2011. This decline in polyethylene in the second half, as modest as it is, will be more than made up by our new portfolio of businesses which will capitalize from the ongoing positive macroeconomic fundamentals and increasingly gain market position with new technology offerings and with continued pricing power.
On Slide 25, I'd turn you to our overall outlook. With another quarter of top- and bottom-line growth delivered, we are confident that the momentum continues to build in the global economic recovery. Our U.S. macroeconomic view remains guardedly optimistic and we see continued demand growth from both business spending and a slow return of the consumer, albeit at a tempered pace.
In other industrialized regions, particularly Europe, monetary stimulus continues to provide support against headwinds, such as tighter fiscal policies. And in the emerging world, especially Asia, we will continue to see strong growth. From a sector perspective, there are many areas of strength: Electronics, consumer staples, food, pharmaceuticals and personal care are all showing signs of growth. 
And in Electronics, global tech spending will continue to be robust, benefiting from a combination of increased business investment and consumer-led demand as we ramp for the end-of-year buying season. Transportation has been robust and should see a more typical seasonal decline as the industry once again prepares for new model launches. The good news is, year-over-year, we expect continued strength. 
In Construction, while the commercial sector remains challenged, we expect programs in the U.S, such as Home Star, to provide incentives that will boost residential improvements and drive demand higher. We continue to see this sector as a key indicator to our robust recovery. 
If you turn to Slide 26, based on these aforementioned strong geographic and sector fundamentals, we expect high demand for our products in our downstream, market-driven businesses, as well as in our Polyethylene business. As you can see, the vast majority of our portfolio is perfectly positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
And just to mention some specifics for you: our momentum in Electronic Materials continues; we recently started up a new OLED facility and are building a new R&D center, both in Korea. Asia is the largest market for coatings in the world, and we are investing in additional emulsion plants that will meet growing demand.
Our new STYROFOAM brand insulation continues to gain market share. And we have received DOE funding to develop the next generation of advanced insulation systems. Also we broke ground on our joint venture manufacturing facility to produce lithium-ion batteries for next-generation hybrid and electric vehicles. 
Our Elastomers businesses announced today a technology breakthrough that expands capacity for polyolefin elastomers and positions us to take full advantage of future growth.  And just last week, the EU announced that it has approved biotech corn products, enabled by our leading Trait technology for import.
And as you heard me say earlier, today, we announced a huge joint venture with one of two world's leading companies going to the next step, how Saudi Aramco partners and ourselves would move to the final stage of engineering design of what would be one the world's largest, freestanding industrial complexes.  These are just few of the many examples that bode well for our ability to outpace the overall economic recovery and drive our earnings growth and reward our shareholders. 
Let me wrap up, if I can, with our priorities. If you turn to Slide 27 for the second half of the year. We remain focused on executing our strategic and financial plan. From a strategic perspective, we are well ahead of our revenue growth goal and have already exceeded our year-end growth synergy run rate, with more to come. Operationally, we surpassed our commitments to deliver our Rohm and Haas acquisition cost synergies and reduce structural cost. Financially, we exceeded our two-year divestiture goal ahead of schedule and are on track to deliver our net-debt-to-cap and free cash flow targets. 
In summary, our earnings trajectory continued once again this quarter, with our robust innovation pipeline, our broad geographic reach and our leadership in high-growth, profitable sectors leading the way. We remain focused on realizing the full potential of our new portfolio and lean cost structure, while executing on our innovation engine. 
We believe we have the plan, the people and the technology to deliver continued earnings growth for our shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Howard."

We had lost sales, as I said, both Bill and I talked about, that does about three percentage points on volume. And STYRON, no one factored that into the forecast, and we sold STYRON close to mid-June. So that's another percentage point. So we would have seen 11% just on a like-and-like basis. If there was, didn't have these unplanned outages. I can't stress enough how strong an impact these unplanned outages were across our chains. Coatings had a great quarter, but actually would have been a much better quarter. I mean, if you look at our other peer groups or even look at downstream from our sub-customers, they all reported strong numbers. Our Coatings numbers were strong, but would have been much stronger, more in line with what they reported, and that alone would've bumped up the volume significantly. Plus plant turnarounds hit us, we would have an operating rate of 6% if we didn't have the plant turnarounds, forgetting the outages themselves. And in fact, if you look at the number of plants that were down through the quarter for various periods of time, 120 of our 600 plants were down, that's a big impact to any company. And I would tell you that, therefore, going forward, we see very good positive volume momentum, so again we are not concerned. These were one-time events. They are over with. We've fixed them. The plants are running safely, as I said on the call. So frankly, as you say, we see the positive of the point even though, of course, it didn't help us in the quarter."

One is in-market and competitive because of coal, that's the China one. One is export-oriented because of where it's located and access to feedstocks of the oil-and-gas kind. The key on sequencing for us is a equity-like structure and these are building blocks. If we build a PL plant on our own, that's a billion dollars. The fact that we can make it part of an industrial complex where we are partnering, and in the case of Aramco, 35% will go to public. So we'll end up earning 35%. You end up getting more back for your capital, in this case, equity back. So we believe the way it'll sequence is, the next several years, we'll get the Aramco project, the Jubail project, up and running in the mid-part of the decade, and the China project will come in the latter part of the decade."

We have a 2% hit to our EBITDA margin based on the situation between price on propylene. The most important thing on propylene is the arbitrage between U.S. and Asia didn't work in our favor in the quarter. You'd normally -- U.S. propylene is discounted by about 20% versus Asia. We have the exactly the inverse through the quarter. Asia propylene stayed artificially low. And in fact, the spread at the beginning of the quarter was $0.21 versus by exiting the quarter was $0.07. So in essence, U.S. propylene was artificially high, and we believe that will return to equilibrium in the third quarter, which will allow margin expansion on our Performance businesses to come through in the Q3 versus what we're expecting in Q2. So we will play catch-up in the third quarter. So that really takes care of the whole issue of margins and Performance businesses in the second quarter. In the third quarter, this whole point you made on the PDH unit, yes, GBP 1.2 billion starting up in August, we're 50% of the offtake. This will help us enormously on propylene competitiveness in the United States and enable us to have margin expansions. And the related effect, the fact that we have this propylene arbitrage, the fact that we didn't have the ability to export to Asia -- also, I heard the previous question on volume, we lost volume in Asia because we couldn't successfully export because of the propylene arbitrage, which was an extra point of Sergey's earlier question. And last but not least, we're taking care of it not just in the U.S. but also in Asia with the start up of our big propylene derivative facility in Thailand next year. So that will take care of that propylene structure imbalance in Asia. All of the remedies are in place and should handle the questions you asked."

Now Deer Park is the only legacy Rohm and Haas site that is a petrochemical site. Frankly, we've had to pull all of our people over Deer Park to let it run to its potential. And that's why safety first, pound second. We've take taken the opportunity to root-cause investigate not only MMA but the entire acrylics production units there so that they run to Dow's standards. And that's, in essence, what answers that question. They're all onetimers, 2/3 Performance, 1/3 PE. So the impact was in Coatings and Infrastructure in particular, but also in the other Performance Products. We believe the $315 million [ph] loss revenue, as a consequence, is a onetimer."

The Aramco announcement is a new asset. The Kuwait investment, the expansion down there is a new asset. But over time, we believe our relationships with those two places as well as other places will yield an opportunity for us in polyethylene-existing assets. We are driven to get an answer there, but we have a newfound competitive advantage with U.S. shale gas that helps us. Once we execute that strategy, we will do it at the highest possible valuation going into peak earnings rather than living through trough earnings. So you'd expect us to time it better and right versus right now. And it will help tilt our portfolio more to specialty, which will decline the volatility of the portfolio."

So truly, Latin America was very impacted, Jeff, by the polyethylene issue with Bahía Blanca. If you look at China, Electronics, up 32% as Howard already referenced. There, we had more of an impact than we did in Latin America because we have less in-market assets. So the big export opportunities that were propylene derivatives, acrylics, polyurethanes, epoxies, were all very tilted to be impacted in the emerging world where we import those products in. As I've mentioned already, our Thai complex and ultimately, our Saudi complex, should take care of that because these assets are dedicated for the Asian growth. But we were disproportionately affected compared to our competitors because of, in particular in Asia, this propylene arbitrage I mentioned."

Secondly, issues of companies with regards to garnering letters of credit and the like. And finally, of late, we've been starting to hear about potentially a privatization of MPC. And if at all that happens, the escalation of the gas price regime over there. So now as one thinks through all these different elements, in your mind how do all these things sort of click together when thinking about near and medium terms for the supply-demand balances?"

And on top of that, add an extra point which is implied in your question, which is at the end of the day, competitive price gas and therefore, ethane in the Middle East has a very short time frame. Now when you look at crackers being announced in that part of the world, there will be mixed speed crackers and using NGLs and maybe naptha. As a consequence of that, you're going to find that everyone's going to start having a rising tide on gas and ethane price. And the MPC privatization and changing the gas price structure there, which we believe is also inevitable, will change the -- if you like the competitiveness of those crackers vis-a-vis product making its way either to Europe, and in particular to in-market crackers in Asia, in particular in China. So I believe that's why our Aramco joint venture is so important. It's really going to be one of the last large complexes. And the way we designed that with Aramco is to tilt the Performance businesses, propylene oxide, epichlorohydrin, acrylic acid, all these businesses that are building blocks that can take advantage of the competitive feedstock being both gas, NGLs and some naptha. I think there will be less and less of that available out of the Middle East."

Our results announced this morning were outstanding by every measure. Our earnings were more than double those of a year ago. EBITDA reached a level not seen since before the economic crisis. Margins were up significantly. Volume increased double digits and was up across every single one of our segments and in every geography. Our operating rates surged as we fully met the growth in demand. Equity earnings hit the $1 billion mark on a trailing 12-month basis. Our growth synergies accelerated, reaching nearly $1 billion. We are outperforming on the cost synergy front, having delivered a run rate of greater than $2.1 billion exiting the quarter. And finally, we generated almost $1 billion in cash from operations.
But this is only the beginning of the Dow story. We are on the right trajectory to deliver even higher levels of earnings growth, and we're going to have a lot more to say on how we will achieve these goals at our Investor Day here in Midland next week. 
So on Slide 4, let's walk through some of the key takeaways from the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.54, up impressively from $0.24 last year. This was driven by broad-based sales gains of 23% with double-digit increases in every operating segments and in every geography. Volume was up a notable 14%. EBITDA increased more than $350 million to $1.9 billion, reaching an annualized run rate of $8 billion compared to $5.5 billion last year.
Basics Plastics was, once again, delivering strong results, with EBITDA of nearly $730 million, up 24%. And Performance Products and Performance Systems together delivered an EBITDA increase of $150 million or 30%. Margins improved nearly 200 basis points overall for the company to pre-recession levels, even though volumes have not yet recovered for most of our businesses.
On a segment basis, Electronics and Specialty Materials has now achieved five straight quarters of 30% plus margins. Performance Products delivered a 400 basis point expansion. In fact, our combined Performance operating segments have now delivered margin gains for five out of the last six quarters. And sequentially, margin growth was notable in Performance Products with a nearly 500 basis point improvement and in Performance Systems, with a more than 250 basis point gain. 
So now let's turn to our milestones on Slide 5. First, our tremendous earnings growth this quarter demonstrated the power of our portfolio. As I said, we delivered $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Also, we are outperforming on both the cost and growth synergy front, and we achieved another stair-step reduction in our net debt-to-cap ratio, achieving 44%, exceeding our goal for the year. From an operational perspective, the increase in demand drove our operating rate to 86%, a level not seen since the first quarter of 2008 and once again, showing why Dow is highly regarded for our signature operational capabilities.
Last quarter, as you know, I said that we were firing on seven of eight cylinders due to the significant number of planned and unplanned outages that impacted our results. We said we were taking the time to make corrective actions and that those issues would be behind us. I'm pleased to report this quarter that we are now back on track. All of our operating cylinders are firing.
And we have not and will not compromise on safety. In fact, we were honored earlier this month with the prestigious Robert Campbell Award for our unwavering commitment to safety. The first chemical company ever to be so recognized. 
Strategically, we achieved several more noteworthy milestones this quarter. Our proposed joint venture project with Saudi Aramco has now entered the final stages of the FEED study with work expected to be completed in mid-2011. We are now step Chlor-Alkali joint venture with Mitsui, enhancing the integration strength of our performance and market-driven businesses at a lower cost and with less capital outlays. And we are reaping the benefits of our Elastomers technology breakthrough with increased capacity in both North America and Europe. We further strengthened our [indiscernible] sciences with another bolt-on acquisition in seeds. And we did all of this while maintaining our investments with growth with another $400 million in R&D in the quarter to progress our innovation pipeline.
Finally, we announced a new divisional structure and leadership changes, putting in place a team that is the best in the industry. This team is accountable for taking our businesses to the next level and delivering on the full potential of each division. In fact, this quarter is a strong early indicator of what this team is capable of achieving moving forward.
On Slide 6, turning to growth synergies. Here again, we are demonstrating the power of our strategy. We have now achieved nearly $1 billion in growth synergies on a run rate basis, up well over 40% from last quarter and accelerating rapidly towards our 2012 target of $2 billion. This momentum reflects that these synergies are becoming part of the fabric of our company. This mine says has taken hold and is very positive, and we'll have a lasting impact well beyond what we deliver on our target. Here are just a few examples of the literally hundreds of growth synergies achieved in the quarter.
We are leveraging our strong market channel in electronics to capture rapid growth for advanced packaging technologies. We are extending our leadership position in the fast-growing semiconductor space with the development of new polymers for leading-edge wafer manufacturing. We won a number of multi-million dollar cross-selling opportunities across a wide array of our businesses, including construction chemicals, water, home and personal care and microbial control and new formulation technologies in the construction sector enabled the fast track launch of an additive solution. Here is just a few of the abundant opportunities that contributed to the $300 million run rate increase we achieved in the quarter, and it shows the power of our game-changing Rohm and Haas acquisition. 
We said we would over deliver on the cost synergies, and we did. We said we would reap growth synergies, and we are. And most importantly, we said we will retain the best of Rohm and Haas' culture and its people, and we have. This acquisition has changed Dow, irreversibly and for the better. Now let me turn the call over to Bill who will provide more details on our results."

Before I get to the numbers, let me remind you that all sales, price and volume comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and exclude divestitures.
Now turning to Slide 7. Sales were up 23%, driven by volume growth of 14% and an increase in price of 9%. EBITDA, excluding certain items, was up $356 million to $1.9 billion. Overall, margins improved almost 200 basis points over the same quarter last year and 100 basis points from last quarter. In margins in our combined Performance segments, excluding ag, were 19%, up more than 150 basis points over the year-ago period and up over 250 basis points significantly.
Earnings, excluding certain items, were $0.54 per share, more than double the $0.24 per share in the same period last year. Certain items, which totaled $0.09 included a charge associated with a labor-related litigation in Latin America of $0.03, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.02 an adjustment of $0.02 on the divestiture of Styron and $0.02 of Rohm and Haas integration costs. 
Now let me turn to price and volume on Slide 8. We experienced demand growth across all segments, led by double-digit gains in all of our performance segments, except for Coatings and Infrastructure. We also experienced demand growth in all geographies. The strength in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa was particularly notable. This marked the third consecutive quarter of growth in these geographic areas.
Now moving to price. We achieved a 9% increase in price with improvements in all geographies and across most operating segments. Price gains more than offset a $585 million increase in purchase feedstock energy cost. Here, I'd like to point out that we expect these costs to rise approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter.
The largest price increases were reported in the combined Basics segment, which collectively reported a 17% increase. Performance Products and Coatings and Infrastructure also delivered double-digit price improvements. And from a geographic perspective, Latin America and North America grew double digits.
Now turning to our segment overview on Slide 10. The strong performance in Electronic and Specialty Materials continued, with revenue up 12% for the business segment. This was driven by continued strong results in Asia-Pacific were volumes were up 25%. The performance of Electronic Materials continues to be driven by sustained end-market demand for consumer electronics and flat panel displays, particularly in Asia. In fact, end market demand for flat panels was so strong that it drove volumes for our display and growth technology businesses up by more than 50%. Volumes in our Specialty Materials business rose in all geographies, driven by double-digit demand growth in our Water, Cellulosics and Microbial Solutions businesses.
Turning to Coatings and Infrastructure. Sales were up 11% with volume and price gains across all geographies. Our Coatings business expanded margins, reflecting tight Epoxy fundamentals. In agricultural coatings, we're seeing robust volume growth in Asia-Pacific due to new product introductions. In fact, 30% of our portfolio is less than three years old. Our Building Construction business grew sales 7% over last year and delivered volume improvements across all geographies, except North America. And finally, our Adhesive and Functional Polymers business delivered double-digit sales growth across all of our geographies, driven primarily by growth in packaging applications. 
Now moving to Health and Ag Sciences. This segment experienced strong volume growth of 26% with significant gains in our Seeds, Traits and Oils business, as well as continued growth in ag chemicals. Sales grew double digits in most regions, driven by a number of factors, which offset continued pricing pressure in ag chemicals. 
I would like to point out we are gaining share in cotton in North America, and we are continuing to make inroads in corn as well. Volume grew for cereal herbicides in Europe, Middle East and Africa and higher-than-expected plantings of corn, especially in Brazil benefited Latin America. In addition, we announced the acquisition of Grand Valley, adding to our seed marketing capabilities. Finally, while harvest continues, nearly half of our yield data from SmartStax is in, and it indicates positive performance. We continue to be pleased with the launch of this new technology.
In Performance Systems, we achieved double-digit volume growth and a 260 basis point expansion in EBITDA margins during the quarter. We are benefiting from a rebound in automotive end markets, driven by a double-digit increase in global light vehicle production. In Formulated Systems, double-digit volume growth and energy efficiency and fast growing wind energy applications drove results in the quarter.
Finally on the slide, you see the primary drivers behind improvements in our Performance Products segment. Volume was up 10%, and price was up 15%. EBITDA margins expanded 400 basis points year-over-year and 500 points sequentially. Demand growth was driven by significant improvements in Epoxy and Oxygenated Solvents and continued growth in Polyglycols, Surfactants and Fluids as well. Pricing increases across a number of businesses, particularly in Epoxy and Polyurethanes also contributed to margin improvement.
Now turning to Basic Plastics on Slide 12. Volume growth in double-digit price gains drove performance. Strong industry demand for Polyethylene continued, particularly in North America. Global demand growth delays and start-ups and operational issues for industry participants other than Dow continue to mitigate concerns around capacity coming online. And finally in Basic Chemicals, we were over 30%. Sales were up over 30% as price and demand both rose double digits. 
Now turning to our joint ventures. Equity earnings were slightly over $250 million, up more than 10% from a year ago. This was driven by strong results from our joint ventures in Kuwait, MEGlobal and Dow Corning. 
I'd like to close my comments by highlighting, make highlights in our tight control on working capital. DSO was 44 days, down two days from last quarter and down one day versus the same quarter last year. DSI was 68 days, down four days from the year-ago period. Our CapEx spending was under $500 million after consolidating our Thailand joint ventures, and we are just under $1.2 billion year-to-date.
Overall, we remain on track to achieve our $2 billion goal for 2010. Cash flow from our operations was $1 billion, up $376 million over the same period last year. Free cash flow was $233 million, up $143 million versus the same quarter last year. And our net debt to total cap declined 230 basis points to 44.2%, reflecting a greater than a $450 million decrease in net debt.
We are currently tracking ahead of our plan, and you should expect to see, end of the year, close to our 45% target as we look at opportunities to make voluntary contributions to our pension plan in the range of $350 million in each of the next two quarters. And finally, our net debt to EBITDA multiple improved to 2.5, and we are on run rate of 2.3 exiting quarter. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Andrew."

Let's turn to our outlook now on Slide 15, and you are very familiar with this chart I know. It's our unique view into a wide array of geographical sector trends, which we believe supports our outlook that growth is firming and firming to a more measured pace. The broad-based demand growth you see here is across geographies and industry segments, and this gives us even greater confidence to the sustained global economic recovery is gradually building momentum. 
Emerging economies will continue to lead this growth in our view over the longer term as domestic demand strengthens in a number of leading end markets in fast growing regions such as Brazil, Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe. In China, concerns around fiscal policy tightening and asset bubbles are waning, and you can see growth trends remain robust across almost all industry segments in that country.
Our outlook in North America and Europe is also encouraging, as we see signs of increased momentum and more sustainable growth, particularly in the end markets where Dow holds a strong position such as electronics, coatings, packaging and automotive. And while ongoing headwinds from high unemployment and continued weakness in construction spending still restrain the rate of growth of these developed regions, it is growth nonetheless.
And we expect that growth to continue in the U.S. although at a slightly lower rate than experienced in the first half of the year, despite positive signs of increased corporate profits and investment. In Europe, we expect growth to remain uneven, with Southern Europe remaining restrained by sovereign debt concerns and tightening in government spending. However, economic activity in the rest of Europe, especially those countries centered around Germany, is showing signs of improvement. On balance, we are seeing positive signs of more sustainable global growth, driven by strength in many sectors. This is good news in particular for Dow with our well-balanced portfolio of businesses and our key presence in emerging geographies, both of which position Dow well to deliver a sustained earnings growth.
Turning to Slide 16. Let me wrap up briefly with an update on our 2010 priorities. For the remainder of this year, we will stay focused on executing our strategic, operational and financial plan. As I said, we are firing in all cylinders, delivering at or beyond our goals. We are well ahead of our revenue growth goal of 10%. On the growth synergy front, we've delivered 2010 results nearly double that of our year-end goal. 
Our Performance businesses are performing. These combined segments have expanded margins now for five out of the last six quarters, and we are over delivering on the cost reductions we've promised. Our leadership team is squarely focused on and accountable for delivering results. 
In this quarter, you saw early indicators of what this team is capable of accomplishing. And on that note, let me provide a bit of a preview for our Investor Day in Midland next week. Our last Investor Day was about what we expected at our transformed portfolio to deliver. And today, we can clearly state we have achieved or are on track to deliver each of the commitments made back in November of last year. And that we are firmly on the earnings trajectory we outlined at that time. 
This year's Investor Day will focus on how we're achieving the full potential of our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio from this moment onward. You've asked for more transparency into how we will achieve our goals, and this meeting will be granular, providing a level of detail like we have never given before and directly from our business leadership. Moreover, you will see first hand that Dow has the right formula through our innovations, our growth platforms, our global presence and the robust roadmaps we have in place to deliver. I look forward to seeing many of you next week, and now I'll turn the call back over to Howard."

We're running them pretty high at high rates with the exception of TDI. We've got the start up of new units that will feed the surge in demand in Asia. Notably, the one in Thailand, the HPPO plant there, as well as the elastomers plant there.

But de-commoditizing the downstream by taking out EDC, by taking out EO we are taking out EB/Styrene, so that has strengthen our envelope if you like around NGLs, our Flexi-crackers, our ability to use some of his new found pricing structure that differentiates the oil and gas ratio in our favor. It means that there's a higher value of those assets. Clearly, that's point number one. Point number two, Andy, we'll say a lot more next Monday or Tuesday. But certainly, we are rethinking, as I said, on an earlier question. We rethinking how we will divide the plastics unit today, post all the actions we've taken such as the shutdowns, such as the divestment of Styron. We are different plastics portfolio a lot more focused and devised itself pretty nicely between high-end, high-value plastics, especially plastics if you like that go into growth market such as packaging and more commodity like plastics. So we are looking at doing a different type of deal than K-Dow in the future. I think that's fair to say. But we will do deals nevertheless, and so that's in our future that will help us on our balanced portfolio more and more to downstream businesses that have much more IP protection and margin expansion based on innovation and that will, of course, strengthen our balance sheet even further from where it is right now.

You can expect us to be more and more active on alternative ways to get propane into the mix for sure to produce propylene in the crackers or to do on purpose propylene production. So that we can take advantage of it on the propylene side of the house, as well as the ethylene side of the house. More longer term, Bob, it's not for today, but certainly the sorts of things we're doing in China where you are decoupling and going all the way back to a C1 source. So MTP, methanol to a propylene and technologies like that, I think will become a little more prevalent here in the United States. If you believe all the shale gas numbers right now, I think we're looking at natural gas to shale gas as being an oversupply for several years to come, and that will widen the arbitrage, which means that you have to make sure you can source propylene off of a propane."

The way w",408,"Well, growth is an interesting word. If you put the word profitable growth in front of the word growth, you might get a different balance of mix, and I think that speaks a little bit to our strategy in Asia and has for some years been very true. The way we position ourselves in places like China or in Asia is downstream products, and the value add, i.e. the margins of those products might not be high in volume. So we did not do a cracker in China as a good example of my point. We deliberately did not do that because we couldn't see our way to profitable growth of the downstream, either the first or second derivatives. Now of course, that then speaks to how are you going to participate in the economic growth of those countries beyond the high-margin downstream specialties, remembering using China as our benchmark of all the products we sell in China. It's over 80% Performance businesses. So it shows you our strategy has been very much in the downstream. But how we're remedying the point you're making overall is to get in fact, profitable back integration into our building blocks so we can meet emerging market demands from in-market production, the very first loaded capacity in that regard is coming on as we speak, which is the Thai capacity. So you could expect us then to have profitable growth with volume in the more intermediate first line derivatives such as propylene oxide, polyols and all the downstream from Polyethylene, black specialty elastomers. The second will be in the 14, 15, 16 time frame with the final approval of the Saudi project next year because that's a very big project equity like. That will also serve Southeast Asia, South Asia and China from the Middle East as well as the Middle East itself. And then the their project which is the one in the back half the decade is the end market project on coal chemicals in China. So what you're seeing today is that a lot of the commodities and building blocks that we might supply Asia, we much rather supply into higher margin in market production areas like the U.S. and Europe. And so we're making more money by keeping them home than by exporting them. But in high value-add businesses like Electronic Materials, our China business is up 28%. So it speaks to the strategic positioning on profitable growth."

So you got to really almost bifurcate and start to look at the segments underneath that, Jeff, and I'd say to you there are still supply constraints in industrial coatings, especially the Epoxy chain that is speaking to price power, so there's price increases going on in liquid Epoxy resins and all the downstream from Epoxy. And the end-use side of that, that's actually demand growth is being pretty good, but its supply constrained. I think it's fair to say that as all of our downstream customers have reported that the United States and Southern Europe and housing is still very weak and anemic, and it's the one sector, certainly from a construction new residences is still very much flat to weak. Therefore, as a result of that, most of the architectural coatings market that we would supply in the acrylic chain is really going into markets that are soft and only painting your own house, the way the cycle painting are you seeing any sort of growth. So overall, demand is not strong in the entire housing area. So we're running our assets very hard. They're running well, even towards the low, and we're very focused on price. So in other words, we're pretty much sold out and now, selling up."

And really the early equation, Frank, if you play the arbitrage right in terms of oil and gas ratio, then you should be able to get the price increases where you make the product. In our case, North America and Europe are big home markets. So we are working very hard to keep that margin expansion on the Basics alive, and that all comes down in new capacity. Now the next several quarters, there will be capacity coming on still in the Middle East and the Far East. So it will be spotty quarter-to-quarter, I think like we said and Bill said on his script, there's no question we will see ups and downs in the margin profile, in particular the Polyethylene chain, but you can expect with capacity operations at the mid 80s to high 80s to low 90s to see still continual pricing power over the next several quarters.

You might argue that it's well into 2011. So our customers are seeing a lot of pressures, and their margins are getting compressed as many of them are reported. And clearly, acrylics is part of that. But the biggest part of that is titanium dioxide, and I think you're going to see if it's not price power, they're part of the chain, which we should look to them to comment on. But I think their raw materials are going to be a continual issue for them because of tightness in the chains. And to that end, by the way, we at Dow have innovations that can help them. They can re-formulate, and we actually have substitutes for titanium dioxide out there already that will be very beneficial to them to get away from what's going on in the titanium dioxide area. So given that, I think what you're going to see is a lot of companies working very hard with their supplies like us to do reformulates, to do different types of ingredient mixes, to accommodate what is a tightness in the upstream. I believe that tightness in acrylics will continue for some period of time. Look On POWERHOUSE, yes. It is a drag on earnings as we reposition our sales ahead of the launch. The costs are going up ahead of launched. Launch is middle of next year. We'll have a lot to say on POWERHOUSE next Monday or Tuesday. So I won't steal the thunder until then."

A good Ag sector that gives us the seasonality and account cyclicality, but the less reliance we have on the ethylene cycle is what you're starting to see. Now we are, of course, making a lot of money in the ethylene, polyethylene chain, but I want to point out that is less the cycle and more our own interventions. I think we have upgraded our margins in that whole plastics area by, a, getting out of Commodity business; and b, shutting down a lot of the footprint that was not competitive versus what it used to be five years ago; and c, we repositioned the downstream to value add such as Elastomers, Wire and Cable and Specialty Packaging. So a different mix even in the Basics has occurred, and I want to leave this conversation without also acknowledging that's happened in chemicals. With our MEGlobal joint venture now being a very competitive Ethylene Glycol supplier in the joint venture mode and our Chlor-Alkali footprint serving our downstreams and doing innovative ways to get upstream integration through this deal with Mitsui. We've been able to lessen the cyclicality of petrochemicals and its effect on our earnings. So from here, I believe you're going to see margin expansion in both sides because of the interventions we've done."

Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Our results announced this morning were outstanding by every measure. Our earnings were more than double those of a year ago. EBITDA reached a le",1085,"Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Our results announced this morning were outstanding by every measure. Our earnings were more than double those of a year ago. EBITDA reached a level not seen since before the economic crisis. Margins were up significantly. Volume increased double digits and was up across every single one of our segments and in every geography. Our operating rates surged as we fully met the growth in demand. Equity earnings hit the $1 billion mark on a trailing 12-month basis. Our growth synergies accelerated, reaching nearly $1 billion. We are outperforming on the cost synergy front, having delivered a run rate of greater than $2.1 billion exiting the quarter. And finally, we generated almost $1 billion in cash from operations.
But this is only the beginning of the Dow story. We are on the right trajectory to deliver even higher levels of earnings growth, and we're going to have a lot more to say on how we will achieve these goals at our Investor Day here in Midland next week. 
So on Slide 4, let's walk through some of the key takeaways from the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.54, up impressively from $0.24 last year. This was driven by broad-based sales gains of 23% with double-digit increases in every operating segment and in every geography. Volume was up a notable 14%. EBITDA increased more than $350 million to $1.9 billion, reaching an annualized run rate of $8 billion compared to $5.5 billion last year.
Basics Plastics was, once again, delivering strong results, with EBITDA of nearly $730 million, up 24%. And Performance Products and Performance Systems together delivered an EBITDA increase of $150 million or 30%. Margins improved nearly 200 basis points overall for the company to pre-recession levels, even though volumes have not yet recovered for most of our businesses.
On a segment basis, Electronics and Specialty Materials has now achieved five straight quarters of 30% plus margins. Performance Products delivered a 400 basis point expansion. In fact, our combined Performance operating segments have now delivered margin gains for five out of the last six quarters. And sequentially, margin growth was notable in Performance Products with a nearly 500 basis point improvement and in Performance Systems, with a more than 250 basis point gain. 
So now let's turn to our milestones on Slide 5. First, our tremendous earnings growth this quarter demonstrated the power of our portfolio. As I said, we delivered $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Also, we are outperforming on both the cost and growth synergy front, and we achieved another stair-step reduction in our net debt-to-cap ratio, achieving 44%, exceeding our goal for the year. From an operational perspective, the increase in demand drove our operating rate to 86%, a level not seen since the first quarter of 2008 and once again, showing why Dow is highly regarded for our signature operational capabilities.
Last quarter, as you know, I said that we were firing on seven of eight cylinders due to the significant number of planned and unplanned outages that impacted our results. We said we were taking the time to make corrective actions and that those issues would be behind us. I'm pleased to report this quarter that we are now back on track. All of our operating cylinders are firing.
And we have not and will not compromise on safety. In fact, we were honored earlier this month with the prestigious Robert Campbell Award for our unwavering commitment to safety. The first chemical company ever to be so recognized. 
Strategically, we achieved several more noteworthy milestones this quarter. Our proposed joint venture project with Saudi Aramco has now entered the final stages of the FEED study with work expected to be completed in mid-2011. We are now step [ph] (00:25:39) Chlor-Alkali joint venture with Mitsui, enhancing the integration strength of our performance and market-driven businesses at a lower cost and with less capital outlays. And we are reaping the benefits of our Elastomers technology breakthrough with increased capacity in both North America and Europe. We further strengthened our channel access in Dow Agrosciences [ph] (00:25:57) with another bolt-on acquisition in seeds. And we did all of this while maintaining our investments with growth with another $400 million in R&D in the quarter to progress our innovation pipeline.
Finally, we announced a new divisional structure and leadership changes, putting in place a team that is the best in the industry. This team is accountable for taking our businesses to the next level and delivering on the full potential of each division. In fact, this quarter is a strong early indicator of what this team is capable of achieving moving forward.
On Slide 6, turning to growth synergies. Here again, we are demonstrating the power of our strategy. We have now achieved nearly $1 billion in growth synergies on a run rate basis, up well over 40% from last quarter and accelerating rapidly towards our 2012 target of $2 billion. This momentum reflects that these synergies are becoming part of the fabric of our company. This mineset has taken hold and is very positive, and we'll have a lasting impact well beyond what we deliver on our target. Here are just a few examples of the literally hundreds of growth synergies achieved in the quarter.
We are leveraging our strong market channel in electronics to capture rapid growth for advanced packaging technologies. We are extending our leadership position in the fast-growing semiconductor space with the development of new polymers for leading-edge wafer manufacturing. We won a number of multi-million dollar cross-selling opportunities across a wide array of our businesses, including construction chemicals, water, home and personal care and microbial control and new formulation technologies in the construction sector enabled the fast track launch of an additive solution. Here is just a few of the abundant opportunities that contributed to the $300 million run rate increase we achieved in the quarter, and it shows the power of our game-changing Rohm and Haas acquisition. 
We said we would over deliver on the cost synergies, and we did. We said we would reap growth synergies, and we are. And most importantly, we said we will retain the best of Rohm and Haas' culture and its people, and we have. This acquisition has changed Dow, irreversibly and for the better. Now let me turn the call over to Bill who will provide more details on our results."

Before I get to the numbers, let me remind you that all sales, price and volume comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and exclude divestitures.
Now turning to Slide 7. Sales were up 23%, driven by volume growth of 14% and an increase in price of 9%. EBITDA, excluding certain items, was up $356 million to $1.9 billion. Overall, margins improved almost 200 basis points over the same quarter last year and 100 basis points from last quarter. In margins in our combined Performance segments, excluding ag, were 19%, up more than 150 basis points over the year-ago period and up over 250 basis points sequentially.
Earnings, excluding certain items, were $0.54 per share, more than double the $0.24 per share in the same period last year. Certain items, which totaled $0.09 included a charge associated with a labor-related litigation in Latin America of $0.03, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.02 an adjustment of $0.02 on the divestiture of Styron and $0.02 of Rohm and Haas integration costs. 
Now let me turn to price and volume on Slide 8. We experienced demand growth across all segments, led by double-digit gains in all of our performance segments, except for Coatings and Infrastructure. We also experienced demand growth in all geographies. The strength in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa was particularly notable. This marked the third consecutive quarter of growth in these geographic areas.
Now moving to price. We achieved a 9% increase in price with improvements in all geographies and across most operating segments. Price gains more than offset a $585 million increase in purchase feedstock energy cost. Here, I'd like to point out that we expect these costs to rise approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter.
The largest price increases were reported in the combined Basics segment, which collectively reported a 17% increase. Performance Products and Coatings and Infrastructure also delivered double-digit price improvements. And from a geographic perspective, Latin America and North America grew double digits.
Now turning to our segment overview on Slide 10. The strong performance in Electronic and Specialty Materials continued, with revenue up 12% for the business segment. This was driven by continued strong results in Asia-Pacific where volumes were up 25%. The performance of Electronic Materials continues to be driven by sustained end-market demand for consumer electronics and flat panel displays, particularly in Asia. In fact, end market demand for flat panels was so strong that it drove volumes for our display and growth technology businesses up by more than 50%. Volumes in our Specialty Materials business rose in all geographies, driven by double-digit demand growth in our Water, Cellulosics and Microbial Solutions businesses.
Turning to Coatings and Infrastructure. Sales were up 11% with volume and price gains across all geographies. Our Coatings business expanded margins, reflecting tight Epoxy fundamentals. In agricultural coatings, we're seeing robust volume growth in Asia-Pacific due to new product introductions. In fact, 30% of our portfolio is less than three years old. Our Building Construction business grew sales 7% over last year and delivered volume improvements across all geographies, except North America. And finally, our Adhesive and Functional Polymers business delivered double-digit sales growth across all of our geographies, driven primarily by growth in packaging applications. 
Now moving to Health and Ag Sciences. This segment experienced strong volume growth of 26% with significant gains in our Seeds, Traits and Oils business, as well as continued growth in ag chemicals. Sales grew double digits in most regions, driven by a number of factors, which offset continued pricing pressure in ag chemicals. 
I would like to point out we are gaining share in cotton in North America, and we are continuing to make inroads in corn as well. Volume grew for cereal herbicides in Europe, Middle East and Africa and higher-than-expected plantings of corn, especially in Brazil benefited Latin America. In addition, we announced the acquisition of Grand Valley, adding to our seed marketing capabilities. Finally, while harvest continues, nearly half of our yield data from SmartStax is in, and it indicates positive performance. We continue to be pleased with the launch of this new technology.
In Performance Systems, we achieved double-digit volume growth and a 260 basis point expansion in EBITDA margins during the quarter. We are benefiting from a rebound in automotive end markets, driven by a double-digit increase in global light vehicle production. In Formulated Systems, double-digit volume growth and energy efficiency and fast growing wind energy applications drove results in the quarter.
Finally on the slide, you see the primary drivers behind improvements in our Performance Products segment. Volume was up 10%, and price was up 15%. EBITDA margins expanded 400 basis points year-over-year and 500 points sequentially. Demand growth was driven by significant improvements in Epoxy and Oxygenated Solvents and continued growth in Polyglycols, Surfactants and Fluids as well. Pricing increases across a number of businesses, particularly in Epoxy and Polyurethanes also contributed to margin improvement.
Now turning to Basic Plastics on Slide 12. Volume growth in double-digit price gains drove performance. Strong industry demand for Polyethylene continued, particularly in North America. Global demand growth, delays and start-ups and operational issues for industry participants other than Dow continue to mitigate concerns around capacity coming online. And finally in Basic Chemicals, we were over 30%. Sales were up over 30% as price and demand both rose double digits. 
Now turning to our joint ventures. Equity earnings were slightly over $250 million, up more than 10% from a year ago. This was driven by strong results from our joint ventures in Kuwait, MEGlobal and Dow Corning. 
I'd like to close my comments by highlighting, make highlights in our tight control on working capital. DSO was 44 days, down two days from last quarter and down one day versus the same quarter last year. DSI was 68 days, down four days from the year-ago period. Our CapEx spending was under $500 million after consolidating our Thailand joint ventures, and we are just under $1.2 billion year-to-date.
Overall, we remain on track to achieve our $2 billion goal for 2010. Cash flow from our operations was $1 billion, up $376 million over the same period last year. Free cash flow was $233 million, up $143 million versus the same quarter last year. And our net debt to total cap declined 230 basis points to 44.2%, reflecting a greater than a $450 million decrease in net debt.
We are currently tracking ahead of our plan, and you should expect to see, end of the year, close to our 45% target as we look at opportunities to make voluntary contributions to our pension plan in the range of $350 million in each of the next two quarters. And finally, our net debt to EBITDA multiple improved to 2.5, and we are on run rate of 2.3 exiting quarter. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Andrew."

Let's turn to our outlook now on Slide 15, and you are very familiar with this chart I know. It's our unique view into a wide array of geographical and sector trends, which we believe supports our outlook that growth is firming and firming to a more measured pace. The broad-based demand growth you see here is across geographies and industry segments, and this gives us even greater confidence to the sustained global economic recovery is gradually building momentum. 
Emerging economies will continue to lead this growth in our view over the longer term as domestic demand strengthens in a number of leading end markets in fast growing regions such as Brazil, Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe. In China, concerns around fiscal policy tightening and asset bubbles are waning, and you can see growth trends remain robust across almost all industry segments in that country.
Our outlook in North America and Europe is also encouraging, as we see signs of increased momentum and more sustainable growth, particularly in the end markets where Dow holds a strong position such as electronics, coatings, packaging and automotive. And while ongoing headwinds from high unemployment and continued weakness in construction spending still restrain the rate of growth of these developed regions, it is growth nonetheless.
And we expect that growth to continue in the U.S. although at a slightly lower rate than experienced in the first half of the year, despite positive signs of increased corporate profits and investment. In Europe, we expect growth to remain uneven, with Southern Europe remaining restrained by sovereign debt concerns and tightening in government spending. However, economic activity in the rest of Europe, especially those countries centered around Germany, is showing signs of improvement. On balance, we are seeing positive signs of more sustainable global growth, driven by strength in many sectors. This is good news in particular for Dow with our well-balanced portfolio of businesses and our key presence in emerging geographies, both of which position Dow well to deliver a sustained earnings growth.
Turning to Slide 16. Let me wrap up briefly with an update on our 2010 priorities. For the remainder of this year, we will stay focused on executing our strategic, operational and financial plan. As I said, we are firing in all cylinders, delivering at or beyond our goals. We are well ahead of our revenue growth goal of 10%. On the growth synergy front, we've delivered 2010 results nearly double that of our year-end goal. 
Our Performance businesses are performing. These combined segments have expanded margins now for five out of the last six quarters, and we are over delivering on the cost reductions we've promised. Our leadership team is squarely focused on and accountable for delivering results. 
In this quarter, you saw early indicators of what this team is capable of accomplishing. And on that note, let me provide a bit of a preview for our Investor Day in Midland next week. Our last Investor Day was about what we expected at our transformed portfolio to deliver. And today, we can clearly state we have achieved or are on track to deliver each of the commitments made back in November of last year. And that we are firmly on the earnings trajectory we outlined at that time. 
This year's Investor Day will focus on how we're achieving the full potential of our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio from this moment onward. You've asked for more transparency into how we will achieve our goals, and this meeting will be granular, providing a level of detail like we have never given before and directly from our business leadership. Moreover, you will see first hand that Dow has the right formula through our innovations, our growth platforms, our global presence and the robust roadmaps we have in place to deliver. I look forward to seeing many of you next week, and now I'll turn the call back over to Howard."

Firstly, for the reasons P.J. talked about, the propylene back integration that we can now speak to. Secondarily, we're number one or number two in many these businesses, and the building blocks that represent them, the propylene oxide, safety chlorohydrin, the fact that we have built capacity, the fact that there is constrained capacity in PO and epichlorohydrin bodes well for price increases. We're running them pretty high at high rates with the exception of TDI. We've got the start up of new units that will feed the surge in demand in Asia. Notably, the one in Thailand, the HPPO plant there, as well as the elastomers plant there. So frankly, we see that the performance in global will continue to show up margin expansion from here as we showed you a year ago.

There is definitely a very different value equation for North American-based petrochemical assets and clearly, our revised footprint after we did all of our shutdowns, we took out a lot of our purchasers. We fundamentally produced all the ethylene that we want now for our consumption downstream. But de-commoditizing the downstream by taking out EDC, by taking out EO we are taking out EB/Styrene, so that has strengthened our envelope if you like around NGLs, our Flexi-crackers, our ability to use some of his new found pricing structure that differentiates the oil and gas ratio in our favor. It means that there's a higher value of those assets. Clearly, that's point number one. Point number two, Andy, we'll say a lot more next Monday or Tuesday. But certainly, we are rethinking, as I said, on an earlier question. We’re rethinking how we will divide the plastics unit today, post all the actions we've taken such as the shutdowns, such as the divestment of Styron. We are different plastics portfolio a lot more focused and devised itself pretty nicely between high-end, high-value plastics, especially plastics if you like that go into growth market such as packaging and more commodity like plastics. So we are looking at doing a different type of deal than K-Dow in the future. I think that's fair to say. But we will do deals nevertheless, and so that's in our future that will help us on our balanced portfolio more and more to downstream businesses that have much more IP protection and margin expansion based on innovation and that will, of course, strengthen our balance sheet even further from where it is right now. And we anticipate that, that will all be in the next 12 to 18 months. So you'll see more action from us in the plastics portfolio, better, higher evaluations, all on strategy to reduce our volatility."

But clearly, it's still quite wide compared to a historical levels. We believe that's going to continue for the next several years. And so it's the by-product point then becomes relevant and that gets back to the propane PDH propylene sourcing point. You can expect us to be more and more active on alternative ways to get propane into the mix for sure to produce propylene in the crackers or to do on purpose propylene production. So that we can take advantage of it on the propylene side of the house, as well as the ethylene side of the house. More longer term, Bob, it's not for today, but certainly the sorts of things we're doing in China where you are decoupling and going all the way back to a C1 source. So MTP, methanol to a propylene and technologies like that, I think will become a little more prevalent here in the United States. If you believe all the shale gas numbers right now, I think we're looking at natural gas to shale gas as being an oversupply for several years to come, and that will widen the arbitrage, which means that you have to make sure you can source propylene off of propane."

If you put the word profitable growth in front of the word growth, you might get a different balance of mix, and I think that speaks a little bit to our strategy in Asia and has for some years been very true. The way we position ourselves in places like China or in Asia is downstream products, and the value add, i.e. the margins of those products might not be high in volume. So we did not do a naphtha cracker in China as a good example of my point. We deliberately did not do that because we couldn't see our way to profitable growth of the downstream, either the first or second derivatives. Now of course, that then speaks to how are you going to participate in the economic growth of those countries beyond the high-margin downstream specialties, remembering using China as our benchmark of all the products we sell in China. It's over 80% Performance businesses. So it shows you our strategy has been very much in the downstream. But how we're remedying the point you're making overall is to get in fact, profitable back integration into our building blocks so we can meet emerging market demands from in-market production, the very first loaded capacity in that regard is coming on as we speak, which is the Thai capacity. So you could expect us then to have profitable growth with volume in the more intermediate first line derivatives such as propylene oxide, polyols and all the downstream from Polyethylene, black specialty elastomers. The second will be in the 14, 15, 16 time frame with the final approval of the Saudi project next year because that's a very big project equity like. That will also serve Southeast Asia, South Asia and China from the Middle East as well as the Middle East itself. And then the third project which is the one in the back half the decade is the end market project on coal chemicals in China. So what you're seeing today is that a lot of the commodities and building blocks that we might supply Asia, we much rather supply into higher margin in market production areas like the U.S. and Europe. And so we're making more money by keeping them home than by exporting them. But in high value-add businesses like Electronic Materials, our China business is up 28%. So it speaks to the strategic positioning on profitable growth."

So you got to really almost bifurcate and start to look at the segments underneath that, Jeff, and I'd say to you there are still supply constraints in industrial coatings, especially the Epoxy chain that is speaking to price power, so there's price increases going on in liquid Epoxy resins and all the downstream from Epoxy. And the end-use side of that, that's actually demand growth is being pretty good, but its supply constrained. I think it's fair to say that as all of our downstream customers have reported that the United States and Southern Europe and housing is still very weak and anemic, and it's the one sector, certainly from a construction of new residences is still very much flat to weak. Therefore, as a result of that, most of the architectural coatings market that we would supply in the acrylic chain is really going into markets that are soft and only painting your own house, the way the cycle painting are you seeing any sort of growth. So overall, demand is not strong in the entire housing area. So we're running our assets very hard. They're running well, even towards the low, and we're very focused on price.

And really the earlier equation, Frank, if you play the arbitrage right in terms of oil and gas ratio, then you should be able to get the price increases where you make the product. In our case, North America and Europe are big home markets. So we are working very hard to keep that margin expansion on the Basics alive, and that all comes down in new capacity. Now the next several quarters, there will be capacity coming on still in the Middle East and the Far East.

One, When we look at coating materials, we see prices up we talked earlier in the call about the propylene pressure. Do you see your customers able to pass those higher prices, your higher prices through? Or are they getting closer to being able to pass-through? That's the first question. And second within the Coatings and Infrastructure segment generally, I'm just wondering is your investment in the POWERHOUSE Solar Shingle causing a drag on margins? And should we expect more upside in margins as that product rolls out next year?"

You might argue that it's well into 2011. So our customers are seeing a lot of pressures, and their margins are getting compressed as many of them are reported. And clearly, acrylics is part of that. But the biggest part of that is titanium dioxide, and I think you're going to see if it's not price power, they're part of the chain, which we should look to them to comment on. But I think their raw materials are going to be a continual issue for them because of tightness in the chains. And to that end, by the way, we at Dow have innovations that can help them. They can re-formulate, and we actually have substitutes for titanium dioxide out there already that will be very beneficial to them to get away from what's going on in the titanium dioxide area. So given that, I think what you're going to see is a lot of companies working very hard with their supplies like us to do reformulates, to do different types of ingredient mixes, to accommodate what is a tightness in the upstream. I believe that tightness in acrylics will continue for some period of time. Look On POWERHOUSE, yes. It is a drag on earnings as we reposition our sales ahead of the launch. The costs are going up ahead of launch. Launch is middle of next year. We'll have a lot to say on POWERHOUSE next Monday or Tuesday. So I won't steal the thunder until then."

A good Ag sector that gives us the seasonality and account cyclicality, but the less reliance we have on the ethylene cycle is what you're starting to see. Now we are, of course, making a lot of money in the ethylene, polyethylene chain, but I want to point out that is less the cycle and more our own interventions. I think we have upgraded our margins in that whole plastics area by, a, getting out of Commodity business; and b, shutting down a lot of the footprint that was not competitive versus what it used to be five years ago; and c, we repositioned the downstream to value add such as Elastomers, Wire and Cable and Specialty Packaging. So a different mix even in the Basics has occurred, and I want to leave this conversation without also acknowledging that's happened in chemicals. With our MEGlobal joint venture now being a very competitive Ethylene Glycol supplier in the joint venture mode and our Chlor-Alkali footprint serving our downstreams and doing innovative ways to get upstream integration through this deal with Mitsui. We've been able to lessen the cyclicality of petrochemicals and its effect on our earnings. So from here, I believe you're going to see margin expansion in both sides because of the interventions we've done."

Our results announced this morning were outstanding by every measure. Our earnings were more than double those of a year ago. EBITDA reached a level not seen since before the economic crisis. Margins were up significantly. Volume increased double digits and was up across every single one of our segments and in every geography.
Our operating rate surged as we fully met the growth in demand. Equity earnings hit the $1 billion mark on a trailing 12-month basis. Our growth synergies accelerated, reaching nearly $1 billion. We are outperforming on the cost synergy front, having delivered a run rate of greater than $2.1 billion exiting the quarter and finally, we generated almost $1 billion in cash from operations.
But this is only the beginning of the Dow story. We are on the right trajectory to deliver even higher levels of earnings growth. And we’re going to have a lot more to say on how we'll achieve these goals at our Investor Day here in Midland next week.
So, on slide four, let's walk through some of the key takeaways from the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.54, up impressively from $0.24 last year. This was driven by broad-based sales gains of 23% with double-digit increases in every operating segment and in every geography.
Volume was up a notable 14%. EBITDA increased more than $350 million to $1.9 billion, reaching an annualized run rate of $8 billion compared to $5.5 billion last year. Basic Plastics was once again delivering strong results with EBITDA of nearly $730 million, up 24%. And Performance Products and Performance Systems together delivered an EBITDA increase of $150 million or 30%. Margins improved nearly 200 basis points overall for the company, to pre-recession levels, even though volumes have not yet recovered for most of our businesses.
On a segment basis, Electronic and Specialty Materials has now achieved five straight quarters of 30% plus margins. Performance Products delivered a 400 basis-point expansion. In fact, our combined Performance operating segments have now delivered margin gains for five out of the last six quarters. And sequentially, margin growth was notable in Performance Products with a nearly 500 basis-point improvement and in Performance Systems with a more than 250 basis-point gain.
So, now let's turn to our milestones on slide five. First, our tremendous earnings growth this quarter demonstrated the power of our portfolio. As I said, we delivered $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Also, we’re outperforming on both the cost and growth synergy front. And we achieved another stair-step reduction in our net debt to cap ratio achieving 44%, exceeding our goal for the year.
From an operational perspective, the increase in demand drove our operating rate to 86%, a level not seen since the first quarter of 2008 and once again showing why Dow is highly regarded for our signature operational capabilities. Last quarter, as you know, I said that we were firing on seven of eight cylinders due to the significant number of planned and unplanned outages that impacted our results. We said we were taking the time to make corrective actions and that those issues would be behind us.
I'm pleased to report this quarter that we are now back on track. All of our operating cylinders are firing. And we have not and will not compromise on safety, period. In fact, we were honored earlier this month with the prestigious Robert Campbell Award for our unwavering commitment to safety, the first chemical company ever to be so recognized.
Strategically, we achieved several more noteworthy milestones this quarter. Our proposed joint venture project with Saudi Aramco has now entered the final stages of the FEED study, with work expected to be completed in mid 2011. We announced our chlor-alkali joint venture with Mitsui, enhancing the integration strength of our performance and market-driven businesses at a lower cost and with less capital outlays. And we are reaping the benefits of our elastomers technology breakthrough with increased capacity in both North America and Europe.
We further strengthened our channel access in Dow AgroSciences, with another bolt-on acquisition in seeds and we did all of this while maintaining our investments with growth with another $400 million in R&D in the quarter to progress our innovation pipeline. Finally, we announced a new divisional structure and leadership changes, putting in place a team that is the best in the industry.
This team is accountable for taking our businesses to the next level and delivering on the full potential of each division. In fact, this quarter is a strong early indicator of what this team is capable of achieving moving forward.
On slide six, turning to growth synergies, here again, we’re demonstrating the power of our strategy. We have now achieved nearly $1 billion in growth synergies on a run rate basis, up well over 40% from last quarter and accelerating rapidly towards our 2012 target of $2 billion. This momentum reflects that these synergies are becoming part of the fabric of our company.
This mindset has taken hold and is very positive and will have a lasting impact well beyond what we deliver on our target. Here are just a few examples of the literally hundreds of growth synergies achieved in the quarter.
We are leveraging our strong market channel in Electronics to capture rapid growth for advanced packaging technologies. We are extending our leadership position in the fast-growing semiconductor space with the development of new polymers for leading-edge wafer manufacturing.
We won a number of multimillion-dollar cross-selling opportunities across a wide array of our businesses, including construction chemicals, water, home and personal care and microbial control. And new formulation technology in the construction sector enabled the fast-track launch of an additive solution.
These are just a few of the abundant opportunities that contributed to the $300 million run rate increase we achieved in the quarter. And it shows the power of our game-changing Rohm and Haas acquisition. We said we would over deliver on the cost synergies and we did. We said we would reap growth synergies and we are.
And most importantly, we said we would retain the best of Rohm and Haas's culture and its people and we have. This acquisition has changed Dow irreversibly and for the better. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill, who will provide more details on our results.

Before I get to the numbers, let me remind you that all sales, price and volume comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and exclude divestitures. Now turning to slide seven, sales were up 23%, driven by volume growth of 14% and an increase in price of 9%. EBITDA, excluding certain items, was up $356 million to $1.9 billion.
Overall margins improved almost 200 basis points over the same quarter last year and 100 basis points from last quarter. And margins in our combined performance segments, excluding ag, were 19%, up more than 150 basis points over the year-ago period and up over 250 basis points sequentially.
Earnings, excluding certain items, were $0.54 per share, more than double the $0.24 per share in the same period last year. Certain items, which totaled $0.09, included a charge associated with a labor-related litigation in Latin America of $0.03, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.02, an adjustment of $0.02 on the divestiture of Styron and $0.02 of Rohm and Haas integration costs.
Now, let me turn to price and volume on slide eight. We experienced demand growth across all segments, led by double-digit gains in all of our performance segments, except for Coatings and Infrastructure. We also experienced demand growth in all geographies. The strength in North America, in Europe, Middle East and Africa was particularly notable. This marked the third consecutive quarter of growth in these geographic areas.
Now, moving to price. We achieved a 9% increase in price with improvement in all geographies and across most operating segments. Price gains more than offset a $585 million increase in purchase feedstock energy costs. Here, I'd like to point out that we expect these costs to rise approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter.
The largest price increases were reported in the combined basic segments, which collectively reported a 17% increase. Performance Products and Coatings and Infrastructure also delivered double-digit price improvements. And from a geographic perspective, Latin America and North America grew double digits.
Now, turning to our segment overview on slide 10. The strong performance in Electronic and Specialty Materials continued with revenue up 12% for the business segment. This was driven by continued strong results in Asia-Pacific, where volumes were up 25%. The performance in electronic materials continues to be driven by sustained end-market demand for consumer electronics and flat-panel displays, particularly in Asia. In fact, end-market demand for flat panels was so strong that it drove volumes for our display and growth technology businesses up by more than 50%. Volumes in our specialty materials business rose in all geographies, driven by double-digit demand growth in our water, cellulosics and microbial solutions businesses.
Turning to Coatings and Infrastructure, sales were up 11% with volume and price gains across all geographies. Our coatings business expanded margins, reflecting tight epoxy fundamentals. In agricultural coatings, we’re seeing robust volume growth in Asia-Pacific due to new product introductions. In fact, 30% of our portfolio is less than three years old.
Our building construction business grew sales 7% over last year and delivered volume improvements across all geographies, except North America. And finally, our adhesive and functional polymers business delivered double-digit sales growth across all of our geographies, driven primarily by growth in packaging applications.
Now, moving to Health and Ag Sciences. This segment experienced strong volume growth of 26%, with significant gains in our seeds, traits and oils business, as well as continued growth in ag chemicals. Sales grew double digits in most regions, driven by a number of factors which offset continued pricing pressure in ag chemicals.
I would like to point out we are gaining share in cotton in North America. And we are continuing to make inroads in corn as well. Volume grew for cereal herbicides in Europe, Middle East and Africa and higher-than-expected plantings of corn, especially in Brazil, benefited Latin America. In addition, we announced the acquisition of Grand Valley, adding to our seed marketing capabilities. Finally, while harvest continues, we - nearly half of our yield data from SmartStax is in. It indicates positive performance. We continue to be pleased with the launch of this new technology.
In Performance Systems, we achieved double-digit volume growth in a 260 basis-point expansion in EBITDA margins during the quarter. We are benefiting from a rebound in automotive end markets, driven by a double-digit increase in global light vehicle production. And in formulated systems, double-digit volume growth in energy efficiency and fast-growing wind energy applications drove results in the quarter.
Finally on this slide, you see the primary drivers behind improvements in our Performance Products segment. Volume was up 10% and price was up 15%. EBITDA margins expanded 400 basis points year-over-year and 500 points sequentially.
Demand growth was driven by significant improvements in epoxy, in oxygenated solvents and continued growth in polyglycols, surfactants and fluids as well. Price increases across a number of businesses, particularly in epoxy and polyurethanes also contributed to margin improvement.
Now, turning to Basic Plastics on slide 12. Volume growth and double-digit price gains drove performance. Strong industry demand for polyethylene continued, particularly in North America. Global demand growth, delays in startups and operational issues for industry participants other than Dow continued to mitigate concerns around capacity coming online. And finally, in Basic chemicals, we were over 30% - sales were up over 30% as price and demand both rose double digits.
Now, turning to our joint ventures. Equity earnings were slightly over $250 million, up more than 10% from a year ago. This was driven by strong results from our joint ventures in Kuwait, MEGlobal and Dow Corning.
I'd like to close my comments by highlighting - make highlights on our tight control on working capital. DSO was 44 days, down two days from last quarter and down one day versus the same quarter last year. DSI was 68 days, down four days from the year-ago period.
Our CapEx spending was under $500 million after consolidating our Thailand joint ventures. And we are just under $1.2 billion year-to-date. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our $2 billion goal for 2010.
Cash flow from operations was $1 billion, up $376 million over the same period last year. Free cash flow was $233 million, up $143 million versus the same quarter last year and our net debt to total cap declined 230 basis points to 44.2%, reflecting a greater than a $450 million decrease in net debt.
We are currently tracking ahead of our plan. And you should expect us to end the year close to our 45% target as we look at opportunities to make voluntary contributions to our pension plan in the range of $350 million in each of the next two quarters. And finally, our net debt to EBITDA multiple improved to 2.5 and we are on a run rate of 2.3 exiting quarter.
Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Andrew.

Let's turn to our outlook now on slide 15 and you are very familiar with this chart, I know. It's our unique view into a wide array of geographical and sector trends, which we believe supports our outlook that growth is firming and firming to a more measured pace.
The broad-based demand growth you see here is across geographies and industry segments. And this gives us even greater confidence that a sustained global economic recovery is gradually building momentum. Emerging economies will continue to lead this growth in our view, over the longer term as domestic demand strengthens in a number of leading end markets in fast-growing regions such as Brazil, Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe.
In China, concerns around fiscal policy tightening and asset bubbles are waning. And you could see growth trends remain robust across almost all industry segments in that country. Our outlook in North America and Europe is also encouraging as we see signs of increased momentum and more sustainable growth, particularly in the end markets where Dow holds a strong position, such as electronics, coatings, packaging and automotive. And while ongoing headwinds from high unemployment and continued weakness in construction spending still restrain the rate of growth of these developed regions, it is growth nonetheless.
And we expect that growth to continue in the U.S., although at a slightly lower rate than experienced in the first half of the year, despite positive signs of increased corporate profits and investment. In Europe, we expect growth to remain uneven, with southern Europe remaining restrained by sovereign debt concerns and tightening in government spending. However, economic activity in the rest of Europe, especially those countries centered around Germany is showing signs of improvement.
On balance, we are seeing positive signs of more sustainable global growth, driven by strength in many sectors. This is good news in particular for Dow with our well-balanced portfolio of businesses and our key presence in emerging geographies, both of which position Dow well to deliver sustained earnings growth.
Turning to slide 16, let me wrap up briefly with an update on our 2010 priorities. For the remainder of this year, we will stay focused on executing our strategic, operational and financial plan. As I said, we are firing on all cylinders, delivering at or beyond our goals. We are well ahead of our revenue growth goal of 10%.
On the growth synergy front, we've delivered 2010 results nearly double that of our year-end goal. Our performance businesses are performing. These combined segments have expanded margins now for five out of the last six quarters and we are over delivering on the cost reductions we promised.
Our leadership team is squarely focused on and accountable for delivering results. In this quarter, you saw early indicators of what this team is capable of accomplishing. And on that note, let me provide a bit of a preview for our Investor Day in Midland next week.
Our last Investor Day was about what we expected our transformed portfolio to deliver. And today, we can clearly state we have achieved or are on track to deliver each of the commitments made back in November of last year. And that we are firmly on the earnings trajectory we outlined at that time.
This year's Investor Day will focus on how we are achieving the full potential of our higher growth, higher-margin portfolio from this moment onward. You’ve asked for more transparency into how we will achieve our goals. And this meeting will be granular, providing a level of detail like we have never given before and directly from our business leadership.
Moreover, you will see firsthand that Dow has the right formula through our innovations, our growth platforms, our global presence and the robust roadmaps we have in place to deliver. I look forward to seeing many of you next week. And now I'll turn the call back over to Howard.

So over time, you can expect that that 500,000-ton unit that's starting up will take over half of it. And that will help our propylene balance to be less, what I call, naphtha-tied or market-oriented tied.

The building blocks that represent them, the propylene oxides, the epichlorohydrin, the fact that we have built capacity, the fact that there is constrained capacity in PO and epichlorohydrin bodes well for price increases. We're running them pretty high, at high rates, with the exception of TDI. We've got the start-up of new units that will feed the surging demand in Asia, notably the one in Thailand, the HPPO plant there as well as the elastomers plant there.

There is definitely a very different value equation for North American-based petrochemical assets and clearly our revised footprint, after we did all of our shutdowns, we took out a lot of our purchasers. We fundamentally produce all the ethylene that we want now for our consumption downstream. By decommoditizing the downstream, by taking out EDC, by taking out EO, by taking out EB styrene, so that has strengthened our envelope, if you like, around NGLs, our flexi-crackers, our ability to use some of this new found pricing structure that differentiates the oil and gas ratio in our favor means that there is a higher value of those assets, clearly. That's point number one.
Point number two, Andy. We'll say a lot more next Monday, Tuesday, but certainly, we are rethinking, as I said on an earlier question. We are rethinking how we will divide the plastics unit today post all the actions we've taken, such as the shutdowns, such as the divestment of Styron. We are a different plastics portfolio, a lot more focused. And it divides itself pretty nicely between high-end, high-value plastics, specialty plastics, if you like, that go into growth markets such as packaging and more commodity-like plastics.
So, we are looking at doing a different type of deal than KDOW in the future. I think that's fair to say but we will do deals nevertheless and so that's in our future. That will help us on our balanced portfolio, more and more to downstream businesses that have much more IP protection and margin expansion based on innovation and that will, of course, strengthen our balance sheet even further from where it is right now.
We anticipate that that will all be in the next 12 to 18 months. So, you'll see more action from us in the plastics portfolio, but at higher valuations, all on strategy to reduce our volatility.

We anticipate the launch around 2013 when it will be available.
So it's on track right now. We've probably - if you look at the types of crops, 2013 will be corn and 2014 will be soy. And then beyond that, ‘15 will be cotton, so, that's not all that far away. And of course, with your point, 2,4-D being the herbicide of choice, I think, is going to be very good for DHT. We're feeling more and more bullish on that launch.

There's been some correction of late, but clearly it's still quite wide compared to historical levels. We believe that's going to continue for the next several years. And so it's - the byproduct point, then, becomes very relevant and that gets back to the propane/PDH/propylene sourcing point. You can expect us to be more and more active on alternative ways to get propane into the mix for shorter-produced propylene in the crackers or to do on-purpose propylene production. So that we can take advantage of it on the propylene side of the house as well as the ethylene side of the house.
More longer term, Bob, it's not for today, but certainly the sorts of things we're doing in China where you are decoupling and going all the way back to a C1 source. So MTP, methanol to propylene and technologies like that, I think will become a little more prevalent here in the United States, if you believe all the shale gas numbers.
Right now, I think we're looking at natural gas to shale gas as being an oversupply for several years to come and that would widen the arbitrage, which means that you have to make sure you can source propylene off of propane.

If you put the word profitable growth in front of the word growth, you might get a different balance of mix. And I think that speaks a little bit to our strategy in Asia and has for some years been very true. The way we position ourselves in places like China and Asia is downstream products and the value add, i.e., the margins of those products may not be high in volume. So we did not do a naphtha cracker in China, as a good example of my point.
We deliberately did not do that because we couldn't see our way to profitable growth of the downstreams, either the first or second derivatives. Now, of course, that then speaks to, well, how are you going to participate in the economic growth of those countries beyond the high-margin downstream specialties, remembering, using China as our benchmark, of all the products we sell in China. It's over 80% performance businesses. So it shows you our strategy has been very much in the downstream.
But how we're remedying the point you're making overall is to get, in fact, profitable back-integration into our building blocks. So we can meet the emerging market demand from in-market production. The very first load of capacity in that regard is coming on as we speak, which is the Thai capacity. So you could expect us then to have profitable growth with volume in the more intermediates, first-line derivatives such as propylene oxide, polyols and all the downstreams from polyethylenes like specialty elastomers.
The second will be in the ‘14, ‘15, ‘16 timeframe with the final approval of the Saudi project next year. Of course, that's a very big project, equity light, but also serves Southeast Asia, South Asia and China from the Middle East, as well as the Middle East itself. And then, the third project, which is the one in the back half of the decade, is the end-market project on coal chemicals in China.
So what you're seeing today is that a lot of the commodities and building blocks that we might supply Asia, we'd much rather supply them to higher-margin end-market areas like the U.S. and Europe. And so, we're making more money by keeping them home than by exporting them. But in high value-add businesses, like electronic materials, our China business is up 28%. So it speaks to the strategic positioning on profitable growth.

So you've got to - you've got to really almost bifurcate and start to look at the segments underneath that, Jeff.
And I'd say to you there are still supply constraints in industrial coatings, especially the epoxy chain. That is speaking to price power. So there is price increases going on in liquid epoxy resins and all the downstreams from epoxy. In the end use side of that, that's actually the demand growth has been pretty good, but it's supply constrained.
I think it's fair to say that as all of our downstream customers have reported, that the United States and southern Europe and housing is still very weak and anemic and it's the one sector, certainly from a construction of new residences, is still very much flat to weak. Therefore, as a result of that, most of the architectural coatings market that we would supply in the acrylic chain is really going into markets that are soft and only in painting your own house, whatever they - the cycle painting are you seeing any sort of growth.
So, overall demand is not strong in the entire housing area. So we're running our assets very hard. They're running well. Inventories are low. Okay. And we are very focused on price. So, in other words, we're pretty much sold out and now are selling up.

In our case, North America and Europe are big home markets. So we are working very hard to keep that margin expansion on the basics alive and that all comes down to new capacity.
Now, in the next several quarters, there will be capacity coming on still in the Middle East and the Far East. So, it will be spotty quarter-to-quarter. I think, like we said on our - and Bill said in his script. There is no question. We will see ups and downs in the margin profiles of, in particular, the polyethylene chain.

You might argue that it's well into 2011. So, our customers are seeing a lot of pressures and their margins are getting compressed, as many of them have reported. And clearly, acrylics is part of that but the biggest part of that is titanium dioxide.
And I think you're going to see if it's not price power at their part of the chain, which really you should look to them to comment on. But I think their raw materials are going to be a continual issue for them and so - because of tightness in the chains and to that end, by the way, we at Dow have innovations that can help them, meaning that they can reformulate and we actually have substitutes for titanium dioxide out there already that will be very beneficial to them to get away from what's going on in the titanium dioxide areas.
So, given that, I think what you're going to see is a lot of companies work very hard with their suppliers like us to do re-formulates, to do different types of ingredient mixes, to accommodate what is a tightness in the upstream. I believe the tightness in acrylics will continue for some period of time.
Look, on POWERHOUSE, yes, it is a drag on earnings as we reposition ourselves ahead of the launch. The costs are going up ahead of launch. Launch is middle of next year. We'll have a lot to say on POWERHOUSE next Monday and Tuesday. So I won't steal their thunder until then.

And so, the readjustment that many of us have done in the chain, certainly Dow, has been to take out capacity.
I know downstream from us that's also happened. I've mentioned reformulation. Will it get back to there by some timeframe? Look, the best estimates out there, Bill, are 2012, but even those are looking a little bullish right now.

We've increased it systemically over these last five years, in particular by allowing ourselves to be able to crack butane in particular, as well as the normal ethane propane. So that's been an on-purpose strategy to increase that number. It's about 70. If you throw into the mix the fact that the flexi-crackers that are mostly on the U.S. Gulf have that capability. Of course, we also have the pure NGL crackers in Canada and Argentina for the Americas.

It used to be that the specialty businesses had some countercyclicality to the basic businesses in terms of margins, so that there'd be some overall diversity there.

Good one to finish on and one that sets up next week very, very well. I believe, we are a different mix today, with different opportunities now to show a degree of different type of countercyclicality. And I think, it will be market-driven more than it will be feedstock-driven, which, of course, is the whole strategy. So, if you look at what we've done here, John, is that I think we've got enough market diversity, a very big footprint in the emerging markets in downstream specialties like electronics, like coatings, for example and infrastructure in general. A good ag sector that gives us a seasonality and a countercyclicality, but the less reliance we have on the ethylene cycle is what you're starting to see.
Now, we are, of course, making a lot of money in the ethylene polyethylene chain, but I want to point out that is less the cycle and more our own interventions. I think we have upgraded our margins in that whole plastics area by, a, getting out of commodity businesses and, b, shutting down a lot of the footprint that was not competitive versus what it used to be five years ago and, c, we've repositioned the downstream to value-add, such as elastomers, wire and cable and specialty packaging.
So, a different mix even in the basics has occurred and I won't leave this conversation without also acknowledging that's happened in chemicals. With our MEGlobal joint venture now being a very competitive ethylene glycol supplier in a joint venture mode and our chlor-alkali footprint serving our downstreams and doing innovative ways to get upstream integration through this deal with Mitsui, we've been able to lessen the cyclicality of petrochemicals and its effect on our earnings. So, from here, I believe you're going to see margin expansion in both sides because of the interventions we've done.
