Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then we will take your questions.In 2009, we took definitive actions to position ourselves for long-term growth, while also addressing the immediate challenges presented by an uncertain business environment. As a result, we achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year of $2.28, which was near the high of our guidance range of $2.19 to $2.31. We enhanced productivity, reduced expenses and increased the variability of our cost structure, all of which helped offset the impact of revenue declines driven by macroeconomic conditions. We produced year-over-year EBIT and EBIT margin improvements in four of our business segments, Software, Management Services, Mail Services and Marketing Services. These actions also resulted in a $170 million reduction in reported SG&A expenses on a year-over-year basis. This will help us leverage revenue more efficiently as markets improve. During the year, we took a balanced approach to our reinvestment into the business, which has allowed us to remain very profitable and generate significant free cash flow. Our free cash flow was $889 million for the year, which exceeded our guidance range of $750 million to $850 million for the year. Free cash flow for the year benefited from lower levels of receivables and inventories, as well as reduced capital expenditures.For the 28th consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.365 per common share for the first quarter of 2010. As we exited 2009, we began to see some early signs of improved economic activity. There was an increased backlog of orders in our Production Mail business. Our Solutions sales activity increased during December in our Mailing businesses, and a moderating decline in the total U.S. mail volumes, especially within standard mail.Last quarter, we announced our partnership with Hewlett-Packard to deliver the industry's only integrated print and mail solution into the market. The Pitney Bowes IntelliJet Printing System leverages the trend towards increased usage of color to deliver higher-valued transactional and transpromotional mail that can help businesses grow revenues while reducing their mailing costs. As we announced today, production mail recently sold its first units of this exciting solution. Additionally, in our Software business, we had an increase in the number of transactions over $500,000, many of which will be recorded as recurring revenue. In 2010, we will continue to expand our recurring revenue stream, as we move more towards a Software as a Service model. We believe that these activities signal some changing customer behaviors and an affirmation of the value of our solutions in supporting our customers' growth and efficiency.Throughout the year, we continue to invest in future growth through innovation, new products, partnerships, and enhancing customer-facing processes. We also initiated a comprehensive transformation process to lay the foundation for increasing long-term customer and shareholder value. This transformation is designed to give us the capacity to invest in future growth and the flexibility and organizational capability to succeed in a range of conditions. Now let me turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the fourth quarter and our full year financial results. Mike?"

Reported revenue for the year was within our guidance range.Revenue was $1.5 billi",1040,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the year was $5.6 billion, which represented an 11% decline from the prior year, but was a 9% decline when you excluded currency effects. Reported revenue for the year was within our guidance range.Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, a decline of 6% compared with the prior year. Revenue growth in this quarter had about a three percentage point benefit from currency. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by 8% when compared with the prior year. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by 3%, but was down 13% when you exclude the positive impact from currency exchange rates. Non-U.S. operations represented 30% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, was $256 million. The adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter declined year-over-year to 17.6% on lower revenue and a shift in the mix of business, but benefited from our cost management and productivity actions. Our adjusted EBIT margin improved by 50 basis points when compared with the third quarter.We reduced our costs as a percentage of revenue for equipment sales, Software, Business Services and Support Services, as well as lowering our SG&A expenses for the year, primarily because of the productivity improvements that we have put in place.On a constant currency basis, we had a year-over-year reduction in SG&A expense of $13 million in the quarter and $113 million for the year.EBIT margins improved sequentially for three consecutive quarters for Production Mail, Software and Management Services, and for two consecutive quarters for International Mailing. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operational efficiency. While we've clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we're committed to doing even more through our transformation program. Strategic transformation will enable us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus, we will put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more efficient and more profitable.When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, EBITDA for the quarter was $333 million or $1.60 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was about $49 million, essentially flat to the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4.2%, again, comparable with the prior year.The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 32.1%. This was lower than our tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 33.6%. While the tax rate can vary during the course of the year depending on timing and mix of business, the tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.7%, only slightly lower than our expected tax rate range for the year.Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64, compared with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 for the same period last year. The decline in earnings per share versus last year is primarily due to lower revenue and a shift in the mix of business. However, our adjusted earnings per share this quarter is 16% higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 in each of the first three quarters of the year. For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.28, which was near the high end of our guidance range of $2.19 to $2.31.Currency exchange rates compared with last year benefited our adjusted earnings per share by $0.01 this quarter, but reduced our earnings per share for the year by $0.04. GAAP earnings per share included pretax restructuring charges of $36 million in the quarter and $49 million for the year. This represented $0.11 per share in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. Additionally, GAAP earnings per share in the quarter included a $0.01 benefit related to adjustments to certain leveraged lease transactions in Canada, and a $0.06 per share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions related to our former Capital Services business.For the year, GAAP EPS includes non-cash net tax adjustments of $0.05, primarily associated with out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the year and a $0.04 loss associated with discontinued operations. Free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter, which was comparable to the third quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $889 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $750 million to $850 million of free cash flow for the year. Free cash flow for the year benefited from lower levels of receivables and inventory, as well as reduced capital expenditures.During the quarter, we returned $74 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends and paid $298 million in dividends for the year. We used commercial paper to reduce our preferred stock outstanding by $75 million. We made a $100 million contribution to our U.S. pension fund, and we contributed a total of $25 million to our U.K. and Canadian pension funds. As a result, our commercial paper balances increased $56 million versus the prior quarter. However, because of our strong free cash flow for the year, we reduced overall debt by $242 million. About 77% of our total debt is fixed rate and 23% is floating rate. Now let me highlight a few points about our transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we began to implement some of the initiatives identified by our project teams who are in the process of finalizing the planning for other initiatives we will implement throughout 2010 and 2011. During the fourth quarter, our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of more than 300 positions across the company.We continue to target net benefits of about $50 million in 2010 and annualized net benefits in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011. As previously discussed, we expect a phased implementation of this program will occur over the next 18 to 24 months. Therefore, we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will provide some insight about our plans going forward, and then we'll take your questions."

We believe that the economy will gradually improve throughout the year, which should translate into a moderation and a decline of U.S. Mail volumes, especially in Standard Mail. We expect a greater percentage of our 2010 earnings will occur in the second half of the year, given the seasonality of our business in a more normal economic environment, the expected lessening of headwinds from lower financing revenue as equipment sales begin to improve and the increasing benefits from our transformation initiatives.We expect 2010 revenue to be in the range of flat to plus 3%, which includes approximately 2% benefit from currency. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50 for the year. Adjusted earnings per share excludes the expected impact of $100 million to $150 million of pretax restructuring charges associated with our transformation initiatives. This range also excludes an expected non-cash tax charge of approximately $0.07 per diluted share associated with out-of-the-money stock options that expire principally in the first quarter of 2010.On a GAAP basis, we expect 2010 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.75 to $2.11. We expect to generate free cash flow for 2010 in the range of $650 million to $750 million. Cash flow is expected to benefit from improved earnings and ongoing asset management, but will be partially reduced by an anticipated increased investment in finance receivables from higher levels of equipment sales. We believe that we are making the right moves to position ourselves to fully leverage the opportunities available in 2010 and beyond. We are fully committed to acting swiftly and decisively to transform our ability to deliver sustained, long-term value for shareholders and for customers. Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

But if we were to speculate, a couple of things, one, there have been deferrals on high-end production equipment. And that equipment is and has been aging, and we would expect them to look to enhance their productivity and enhance their communications to their customers. And hence, our engagement into a high-end color print because we really see that as a market that will come out as the economy begins to accelerate. Because people are looking at how to generate more revenue from their customers. And this is a way of focusing on that. On the second part of your question around the metering business, I would think that customers would be more likely to react to new equipment than to lease extensions, and that would be a positive for us. So during uncertainty, the extension of the lease, which gives us lower upfront revenue but good profitability over the term, would probably switch to more investment in new assets. And I think that would just change with confidence in the market dynamics and wouldn't be affected as a choice, because it's money that's already being spent. It's just a matter of changing the term in going to new assets."

So we are starting to see some of that move back where companies are now focusing back into revenue growth, and how they will get there. I think everyone is sort of taking a reset in their economic outlook, and they're saying, ""We still need to grow revenue."" And that's really what's starting to pick up the advertising mail, as people move away from just cross management in the same, ""Fine, I'm managing costs, but I now have to run with growing revenue."" So that's sort of, I think, what is driving the change on the Standard side. Certainly, during the time period, there has been some substitution in First-Class that has occurred. But with the TransPromo, we see opportunity to move back into the transactional space and provide opportunities for customers to grow their revenue rather than just have it as an expense. And that's really the intent of adding color print at a cost that's affordable, and then incorporate into that the ability to deliver promotional messages that are focused on the recipient and what the recipient's interest is in.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then we will take your questions.In 2009, we took definitive actions to position ourselves for long-term growth, while also addressing the immediate challenges presented by an uncertain business environment. As a result, we achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year of $2.28, which was near the high of our guidance range of $2.19 to $2.31. We enhanced productivity, reduced expenses and increased the variability of our cost structure, all of which helped offset the impact of revenue declines driven by macroeconomic conditions. We produced year-over-year EBIT and EBIT margin improvements in four of our business segments, Software, Management Services, Mail Services and Marketing Services. These actions also resulted in a $170 million reduction in reported SG&A expenses on a year-over-year basis. This will help us leverage revenue more efficiently as markets improve. During the year, we took a balanced approach to our reinvestment into the business, which has allowed us to remain very profitable and generate significant free cash flow. Our free cash flow was $889 million for the year, which exceeded our guidance range of $750 million to $850 million for the year. Free cash flow for the year benefited from lower levels of receivables and inventories, as well as reduced capital expenditures.For the 28th consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.365 per common share for the first quarter of 2010. As we exited 2009, we began to see some early signs of improved economic activity. There was an increased backlog of orders in our Production Mail business. Our Solutions sales activity increased during December in our Mailing businesses, and a moderating decline in the total U.S. mail volumes, especially within standard mail.Last quarter, we announced our partnership with Hewlett-Packard to deliver the industry's only integrated print and mail solution into the market. The Pitney Bowes IntelliJet Printing System leverages the trend towards increased usage of color to deliver higher-valued transactional and transpromotional mail that can help businesses grow revenues while reducing their mailing costs. As we announced today, production mail recently sold its first units of this exciting solution. Additionally, in our Software business, we had an increase in the number of transactions over $500,000, many of which will be recorded as recurring revenue. In 2010, we will continue to expand our recurring revenue stream, as we move more towards a Software as a Service model. We believe that these activities signal some changing customer behaviors and an affirmation of the value of our solutions in supporting our customers' growth and efficiency.Throughout the year, we continue to invest in future growth through innovation, new products, partnerships, and enhancing customer-facing processes. We also initiated a comprehensive transformation process to lay the foundation for increasing long-term customer and shareholder value. This transformation is designed to give us the capacity to invest in future growth and the flexibility and organizational capability to succeed in a range of conditions. Now let me turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the fourth quarter and our full year financial results. Mike?"

Our revenue for the year was $5.6 billion, which represented an 11% decline from the prior year, but was a 9% decline when you excluded currency effects. Reported revenue for the year was within our guidance range.Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, a decline of 6% compared with the prior year. Revenue growth in this quarter had about a three percentage point benefit from currency. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by 8% when compared with the prior year. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by 3%, but was down 13% when you exclude the positive impact from currency exchange rates. Non-U.S. operations represented 30% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter, was $256 million. The adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter declined year-over-year to 17.6% on lower revenue and a shift in the mix of business, but benefited from our cost management and productivity actions. Our adjusted EBIT margin improved by 50 basis points when compared with the third quarter.We reduced our costs as a percentage of revenue for equipment sales, Software, Business Services and Support Services, as well as lowering our SG&A expenses for the year, primarily because of the productivity improvements that we have put in place.On a constant currency basis, we had a year-over-year reduction in SG&A expense of $13 million in the quarter and $113 million for the year.EBIT margins improved sequentially for three consecutive quarters for Production Mail, Software and Management Services, and for two consecutive quarters for International Mailing. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operational efficiency. While we've clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we're committed to doing even more through our transformation program. Strategic transformation will enable us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus, we will put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more efficient and more profitable.When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, EBITDA for the quarter was $333 million or $1.60 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was about $49 million, essentially flat to the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4.2%, again, comparable with the prior year.The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 32.1%. This was lower than our tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 33.6%. While the tax rate can vary during the course of the year depending on timing and mix of business, the tax rate for the year on adjusted earnings was 33.7%, only slightly lower than our expected tax rate range for the year.Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64, compared with our adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 for the same period last year. The decline in earnings per share versus last year is primarily due to lower revenue and a shift in the mix of business. However, our adjusted earnings per share this quarter is 16% higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 in each of the first three quarters of the year. For the year, adjusted earnings per share was $2.28, which was near the high end of our guidance range of $2.19 to $2.31.Currency exchange rates compared with last year benefited our adjusted earnings per share by $0.01 this quarter, but reduced our earnings per share for the year by $0.04. GAAP earnings per share included pretax restructuring charges of $36 million in the quarter and $49 million for the year. This represented $0.11 per share in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. Additionally, GAAP earnings per share in the quarter included a $0.01 benefit related to adjustments to certain leveraged lease transactions in Canada, and a $0.06 per share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions related to our former Capital Services business.For the year, GAAP EPS includes non-cash net tax adjustments of $0.05, primarily associated with out-of-the-money stock options that expired during the year and a $0.04 loss associated with discontinued operations. Free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter, which was comparable to the third quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $889 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $750 million to $850 million of free cash flow for the year. Free cash flow for the year benefited from lower levels of receivables and inventory, as well as reduced capital expenditures.During the quarter, we returned $74 million to our common shareholders in the form of dividends and paid $298 million in dividends for the year. We used commercial paper to reduce our preferred stock outstanding by $75 million. We made a $100 million contribution to our U.S. pension fund, and we contributed a total of $25 million to our U.K. and Canadian pension funds. As a result, our commercial paper balances increased $56 million versus the prior quarter. However, because of our strong free cash flow for the year, we reduced overall debt by $242 million. About 77% of our total debt is fixed rate and 23% is floating rate. Now let me highlight a few points about our transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we began to implement some of the initiatives identified by our project teams who are in the process of finalizing the planning for other initiatives we will implement throughout 2010 and 2011. During the fourth quarter, our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of more than 300 positions across the company.We continue to target net benefits of about $50 million in 2010 and annualized net benefits in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011. As previously discussed, we expect a phased implementation of this program will occur over the next 18 to 24 months. Therefore, we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will provide some insight about our plans going forward, and then we'll take your questions."

We believe that the economy will gradually improve throughout the year, which should translate into a moderation and a decline of U.S. Mail volumes, especially in Standard Mail. We expect a greater percentage of our 2010 earnings will occur in the second half of the year, given the seasonality of our business in a more normal economic environment, the expected lessening of headwinds from lower financing revenue as equipment sales begin to improve and the increasing benefits from our transformation initiatives.We expect 2010 revenue to be in the range of flat to plus 3%, which includes approximately 2% benefit from currency. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50 for the year. Adjusted earnings per share excludes the expected impact of $100 million to $150 million of pretax restructuring charges associated with our transformation initiatives. This range also excludes an expected non-cash tax charge of approximately $0.07 per diluted share associated with out-of-the-money stock options that expire principally in the first quarter of 2010.On a GAAP basis, we expect 2010 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $1.75 to $2.11. We expect to generate free cash flow for 2010 in the range of $650 million to $750 million. Cash flow is expected to benefit from improved earnings and ongoing asset management, but will be partially reduced by an anticipated increased investment in finance receivables from higher levels of equipment sales. We believe that we are making the right moves to position ourselves to fully leverage the opportunities available in 2010 and beyond. We are fully committed to acting swiftly and decisively to transform our ability to deliver sustained, long-term value for shareholders and for customers. Thank you.

But if we were to speculate, a couple of things, one, there have been deferrals on high-end production equipment. And that equipment is and has been aging, and we would expect them to look to enhance their productivity and enhance their communications to their customers. And hence, our engagement into a high-end color print because we really see that as a market that will come out as the economy begins to accelerate. Because people are looking at how to generate more revenue from their customers. And this is a way of focusing on that. On the second part of your question around the metering business, I would think that customers would be more likely to react to new equipment than to lease extensions, and that would be a positive for us. So during uncertainty, the extension of the lease, which gives us lower upfront revenue but good profitability over the term, would probably switch to more investment in new assets. And I think that would just change with confidence in the market dynamics and wouldn't be affected as a choice, because it's money that's already being spent. It's just a matter of changing the term in going to new assets."

I think where Murray referred to some improvement in the Mailing business, particularly in December, was around some of what we would call Solutions products. So more of the mail creation, folding and inserting in an office environment, those types of solutions. In terms of lease extensions, there was probably twice the level versus the prior year.

There is a larger ticket component that's particularly focused around our address hygiene, address-cleansing type Software products. And those have traditionally been sold more as a perpetual license with a sales value upfront. We're looking at -- as we both develop product that operates in a Software as a Service model, but also looking at pricing strategies that provide our customers the ability to license that Software over a period of time. What that will do is smooth the revenue in the Software business over multiple years for a given customer, and provide a little bit higher level of recurring revenue stream in that business. So obviously, in the short term, we won't get as much immediate sales value, but we certainly get the benefit of that recurring revenue stream over time, matching it to the development investments we make and all."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our first quarter results and then we will take your questions.</TAG>
During this quarter we continued to take definitive actions to position ourselves for long-term growth while also addressing the lingering impact on our business from the global economic uncertainty of the last two years. We are focusing on our distinct customer segments, making progress against our growth plans and implementing our strategic transformation. 
Revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 2% including a 3% benefit from currency. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.55 compared with $0.55 from the prior year. This quarter’s results reflect some signs of stabilization among our customer base especially our large enterprise customers as well as to a lesser extent among our small and midsized customer base. 
Notwithstanding the modest decline in revenues, year-over-year revenue performance during the quarter was our best since the third quarter of 2008 with improving trends in equipment sales and support services which was fueled by demand from enterprise customers globally. At year-end we had an increased backlog of orders in our production mail business. This quarter the installation of those orders helped drive production mail’s strong revenue performance in addition to the strong order flow during the quarter. 
We saw the same positive impact from enterprise customer activity in our mail services and our software solutions during the quarter as well. Among our small to midsized customer base, our U.S. mailing equipment sales during the quarter were essentially flat with prior year. However, solutions application sales were particularly strong within this customer segment, an improvement which we previously noted started in December in our U.S. mailing business. 
We believe these developments are early signs of stabilization as U.S. mailing experienced its best year-over-year equipment sales performance since the end of 2008. These positive trends were offset by lower rental and financing revenue which resulted in lower mailing revenue and EBIT growth but consistent with our expectations as shared with you previously. As our equipment sales performance improved the headwinds created by the impact of reduced equipment sales in prior periods on the financing and rental revenues should moderate. 
Along those lines, the April launch of our Connect+ Customer Communication Series is an example of how we are investing for future growth by delivering new products and solutions to meet the distinct needs of our key customer segments. Connect+ is the industry’s first web-enabled mailing system and it reflects our intent to deliver a broader portfolio of business services to our customers in this segment. Our ability to bring an expanding portfolio of mailing, shipping, marketing and business services to customers in this segment is an important competitive differentiator from point solution meter providers. 
We are continuing to invest in our future while reducing our cost of doing business through a strategic transformation program. We are implementing processes and systems to leverage our growth opportunities and address the needs of our distinct customer segments. As a result, gross margin improved year-over-year and there was a reduction in the absolute dollar level of SG&A or selling, general and administrative expense versus the prior year. This was achieved despite reinstituting some employee-related costs which we reduced in 2009. The adjusted EBIT margin for the company improved as a result of improvement in EBIT margins in 6 of our 7 business segments during the quarter. 
Now let me turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the first quarter financial results.

Revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of 2% compared with the prior year. Revenue growth this quarter had about a 3 percentage point benefit from currency. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.",1045,"Thank you Murray. Revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of 2% compared with the prior year. Revenue growth this quarter had about a 3 percentage point benefit from currency. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by 5% when compared with the prior year. Outside of the U.S. revenue increased b 4% but was down about 7% when you exclude the positive impact from currency exchange rates. In addition if you exclude the impact of the timing of a postal rate increase in France then revenue outside of the U.S. would have declined about 5%, similar to the decline in the U.S. 
Non-U.S. operations represented 30% of total revenue in the quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the quarter was $230 million which was slightly better than last year. The adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter increased year-over-year to 17% despite lower revenue as we continued to benefit from our strategic transformation, cost management and productivity actions. 
We reduced our cost as a percentage of revenue in the quarter for equipment sales, business services and support services when compared with the prior year. Selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A) declined $7 million year-over-year and on a constant currency basis we had a year-over-year reduction in SG&A expense of $22 million in the quarter. 
When you look at just our general and administrative expense it declined $17 million year-over-year and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of revenue excluding the effects of currency. EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 6 of our 7 business segments that included international mailing, production mail, software, management services, mail services and marketing services. 
These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our revenue growth in production mail, mail services and international mail management services and our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operating efficiency across all of the business segments. As expected, the EBIT margin in U.S. mailing continued to be pressured by reduced rental and financing revenue which will lag an improvement in U.S. mailing equipment sales as Murray discussed earlier. 
While we have clearly done a lot to improve our productivity we are committed to doing even more through our strategic transformation program. Strategic transformation is enabling us to further improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus we will put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more efficient and profitable. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, EBITDA for the quarter was $309 million or $1.49 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest decreased about $2 million when compared with the prior year to $49 million. This was the result of a combination of a lower average interest rate and lower debt balances. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 3.9%, 30 basis points lower than the prior year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 34.7%. This was slightly higher than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year which was 34.2%. We expect the tax rate on adjusted earnings could vary during the course of the year depending on the timing and mix of business within a range of 34-35%. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 45.8%. The GAAP rate was higher than the adjusted rate primarily for two reasons; first we had an $8.6 million tax charge for out of the money stock options that expired during the quarter. Second, we had a $9.1 million tax charge related to the recently enacted healthcare legislation. We do not expect any further charges this year related to this legislation. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.55 which was equal to our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rates compared with last year benefited our adjusted earnings per share by about $0.02 this quarter. GAAP earnings per share included pre-tax restructuring charges of $21 million or $0.07 per share in the quarter. Additionally, as noted with regard to our GAAP tax results, GAAP EPS in the quarter included non-cash net tax charges of $0.09 per share related to the items I noted earlier. 
GAAP EPS in the quarter also included a $0.02 per share loss for discontinued operations which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions related to our former Capital Services business. Free cash flow was $294 million for the quarter, a 23% increase compared to the prior year. During the quarter free cash flow benefited from reduced working capital requirements, lower capital expenditures and lower finance receivables. However, the contribution to cash flow from finance receivables was $28 million less than last year. Also you should note in the first quarter of 2009 free cash flow was negatively impacted by $20 million from the unwind of interest rate swaps. 
  During the quarter we increased our common stock dividend per share and returned $80 million to our shareholders. We reduced our commercial paper balances by about $122 million in the quarter to a balance of $99 million. About 79% of our total debt is fixed rate and 21% is floating rate. 
Let me now highlight a few points about our strategic transformation program. In the first quarter we continued to implement some of the initiatives identified by our project team and we finalized the planning for other initiatives we will implement throughout 2010 and 2011. During the first quarter our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of more than 500 positions across the company. Since the program’s inception we have eliminated more than 900 positions. 
We have achieved net benefits of about $5 million during the first quarter and continue to target net benefits of about $50 million in 2010. We expect the benefits to build throughout the year as we implement our plan. We are targeting an annualized net benefit for the full program in a range of at least $150-200 million by the end of 2011 and we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance.

We are updating our guidance for GAAP earnings per diluted share to reflect the non-cash tax charge resulting from recently enacted healthcare legislation. 
Let me review our guidance. We expect 2010 reported revenue to be in a range of flat to 3% growth. On a constant currency basis we expect revenue in a range of a 2% decline to 1% growth. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is expected to be in a range of $2.30 to $2.50 for the year. 
This excludes the expected impact of $100-150 million of pre-tax restructuring charges associated with our previously announced transformation initiatives. This also excludes expected non-cash tax charges of approximately $0.07 per diluted share associated with out of the money stock options that expire principally in the first and fourth quarters of 2010 and a non-cash tax charge of $0.04 associated with the recently enacted healthcare legislation. 
On a GAAP basis, the company expects 2010 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to now being a range of $1.71 to $2.07. We expect that a greater percentage of our annual earnings will occur in the second half of the year as e1quipment sales improve and the impact of lower financing revenue moderates as well as from the realization of benefits from our transformation initiatives. 
We continue to expect to generate free cash flow for 2010 in a range of $650-750 million. During the year, we expect an increasing investment in finance receivables through higher levels of equipment sales requiring a higher use of cash versus the prior year. We continue to realize the benefits of our ongoing actions to improve the infrastructure, productivity and the profitability of the company. 
As the economy and business conditions improve we believe we are poised to take advantage of the profitable growth opportunities that lay before us. We are looking forward to talking about our growth strategies and the ways we are addressing the needs of our distinct customer segments at our upcoming investor update meeting on May 11 in New York. More information on the meeting is available on the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at www.PB.com/investorrelations.

As we look at it and we started seeing this in Q4 is the enterprise segment is starting to show growth and we are seeing that through into Q1 and we would expect the enterprise segment to continue to grow and start moving back to more typical growth patterns. In the SMB segment we have seen stabilization there and as we mentioned U.S. mailing equipment sales was basically flat which has been a significant improvement. Then we have launched new products in that area which we expect to be beneficial as we go through the year. That is the Connect+ series of products that were introduced a couple of weeks ago which puts web-based applications into the market and is really the first web-based mailing product. 
So we expect that to be a positive influence in the SMB segment as w ego forward. That should have some change in the number of renewals versus replacement particularly in the upper segments. So as we have discussed previously as you have the lease extensions it is good for us in the long run from a profitability point of view but when it comes to the renewals they actually will generate more revenue for us and we should see that benefit as we move throughout the year. 
Now as we have also mentioned as equipment sales go up we do also then start seeing an offset on the headwind in finance revenue. So we have had the headwind from lower equipment sales over the last couple of years as equipment sales grow that will start eating into that headwind as well. Those are sort of the combinations that we see on a go-forward.

One is in mail services you see we have continued growth there. A portion of that is due to our shift towards standard mail. Standard mail is now seeing some recovery and we have been focusing on that sector in which we have had a very low percentage. So there is a very low percentage of that mail that has been in the work share space. So that would be one area in the enterprise. 
As you move into the SMB space the Connect+ product which we will show to you at the investor day is a product that opens a number of other opportunities. Number one, it doesn’t just do metered mail. It can also do permit mail which is an area which we have not done much in. With full color printing it allows for printing return addresses and logos on the envelope, eliminating the need for pre-printed envelopes. So that is a cost saving for customers that actually we would get a piece of from the device. 
Then also it provides the ability to move to marketing on the envelope. It takes the device from being a productivity device to a device that affects other places within the marketplace so the dependency with that type of product will move from purely an evidencing platform to a broader based platform. 
Then as I mentioned it is the first web-enabled so it has a full touch screen on it which enables web-based services of which we are launching web-based services with the product and that again increases the range of items that can be dealt with on the machine; whether it is shipping applications, addressing, etc. There is a range of applications. So we are moving from just supplying a platform that does postal evidencing to a much broader platform that will be less dependent on just the evidencing component.

That market segment when you are doing more marketing and more customization on the envelope could take a little more time. However, what we have found and again a couple of weeks isn’t much but we are seeing very strong customer reaction to the ability to eliminate pre-printing on the envelope which is a pretty straight forward item to change. That is much easier than adding the marketing because different people would be involved. In the mail room that is straight forward.

When you look at a year-over-year comparison since we had lower sales activity in the prior year of activity that would lower the assets off of which we would generate finance income. That is the primary factor. 
A secondary factor would be that in our credit business where we provide lines of credit to customers through the economic downturn we actually cut back on those lines of credit to manage delinquencies and write offs. So we took proactive actions we felt it was prudent action to reduce that exposure during that period of time. Those two factors obviously drive that. 
As we see improvement in mail volumes that would bring more activity back into the line of credit business because generally customers use that to purchase postage and then at some point in the future if we decide to increase those lines of credit obviously that would make more credit available to customers. 
The leasing side of the business obviously as Murray said you need growth in the sales side of the business in order to return growth to the financing income but that will ladder in as the finance receivables grow over time if we have the equipment sales.

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our second quarter results, and then we will take your questions.We remain focused on transforming our busines",746,"Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our second quarter results, and then we will take your questions.
We remain focused on transforming our business to position Pitney Bowes for the long-term growth and value creation. During the quarter, however, our near-term performance was adversely impacted by a challenging global business and economic environment. The related slowdown in new equipment investments and installations by customers was particularly evident within our Small and Medium Business Solutions and our Production Mail groups.
When we originally gave our 2010 guidance, we expected stabilization and improvement in global business conditions as the year progressed. We instead witnessed deterioration in conditions toward the end of the second quarter and into July.
Revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 6% compared with the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.48 compared with $0.55 for the prior year, and it included a one-time charge of $0.05 primarily to correct rates used to estimate earned but unbilled International Mail Services revenue. Mike will provide more detail on this later.
We continue to take actions to make it easier for our customers to do business with us during these uncertain times. Some of those actions may have a near-term impact on financial performance, but we're confident that they will have a long-term benefit for customer retention and will enhance customer value.
For example, we offer lease extensions on existing equipment as an option for our customers. We saw an increasing number and proportion of customers in our SMB Solutions group take advantage of this offer during the quarter. Lease extensions are profitable transactions. They help us retain customer relationships, though they generate less sales revenue than the new equipment lease.
The transition of our software business model provides an example of actions that we believe will benefit customer value in our Enterprise Business Solutions group. We continue to transition some solutions to annuity-based pricing, which customers prefer in today's global market. While, as previously discussed, this shift impacts revenue in the near term, it will become a long-term benefit as we build our recurring revenue streams from term licenses and continue expansion of our SaaS offerings.
Our actions to reduce costs and enhance productivity are producing meaningful benefits in the near term, while we transition to an overall more flexible and competitive cost structure in the longer term. During the quarter, these benefits were visible in improved EBIT margins in the International Mailing, Management Services, Software and Marketing Services.
The improvement in Management Services global EBIT margin resulted from our focus on more profitable contracts, ongoing productivity initiatives and the continued transition to a more variable cost structure.
In Software, ongoing integration of operations and focus on product offerings continued to improve EBIT margin, while productivity initiatives drove the EBIT gains in International Mailing and Marketing Services.
The disciplined implementation of our Strategic Transformation program is helping us in the near term, while positioning us for the long term. We achieved net benefits of $20 million during the second quarter and approximately $30 million year-to-date. We continue to target net benefits of at least $50 million in 2010.
These significant benefits had helped to mitigate some of the current business weakness, while at the same time freeing up funds to invest for the future. The reinvestment of a portion of the benefits from Strategic Transformation coupled with our strong free cash flow has given us the flexibility to develop, acquire and deliver innovative new offerings and important capabilities in growth areas. These new solutions help our customers grow their business and manage their mail and document operations more efficiently.
In May, we completed the launch of our Connect+ communications and mailing system in the U.S. Our global rollout will continue in phases going forward. Connect+ has a web and application-based software architecture that provides instant online access to numerous mailing, printing and reporting applications.
At the end of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire U.K.-based Portrait Software plc. We expect to complete this transaction in the third quarter. This acquisition is consistent with our long-term growth strategy to expand into faster-growing spaces not necessarily dependent upon physical mail. Portrait will enhance our customer communication management capabilities and offerings as well as our analytical expertise.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the second quarter financial results.

297018,109922824,71839,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of 6% compared with the prior year. Currency had virtually no impact on revenue growth in the quarter.Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-",1160,"Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of 6% compared with the prior year. Currency had virtually no impact on revenue growth in the quarter.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by 7% compared with the prior year; and outside the U.S. revenue decreased by 3%, again with little impact from currency in the quarter. Non-U.S. operations represented 29% of total revenue.
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $203 million. This was $31 million lower than last year as a result of lower revenue, which included declines in relatively high margin financing and rentals revenue as well as the International Mail Services adjustment. However, we reduced our costs as a percentage of revenue in the quarter for equipment sales, software, rental and support services when compared with the prior year, in large measure because of the productivity initiatives we've been implementing.
Selling, general and administrative or SG&A costs decreased $5 million compared with the prior year. The year-over-year comparison reflects the reinstatement this year of certain employee-related costs which we temporarily reduced. Otherwise, our SG&A cost would have further declined year-over-year due to the benefits from Strategic Transformation.
EBIT margins improved year-over-year in four of our seven business segment, International Mailing, Software, Management Services and Marketing Services. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operating efficiency across all the business segments. As expected, the EBIT margin in U.S. mailing continued to be pressured by reduced rentals and financing revenue, which as previously discussed will lag in improvement in U.S. mailing equipment sales.
While we had clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we are committed to doing even more through our Strategic Transformation program, especially in the current environment. Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus, we are putting in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more efficient and profitable.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $280 million or $1.34 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, decreased about $4 million when compared with the prior year to $50 million. This was primarily the result of a lower average interest rate during the quarter. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4%, 26 basis points lower than the prior year.
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 31.5%. This was lower than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 34.4%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of timing of certain tax-related transactions and the mix of business. We expect the tax rate and adjusted earnings could vary during the course of the year depending on the timing and mix of business, but on average for the year should be within a range of 34% to 35%.
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.9%. GAAP tax rate was higher than the adjusted rate primarily for two reasons. First, we had a $3 million tax charge related to certain leverage lease transactions outside the U.S. And second, we had a small tax charge for out-of-the money stock options had expired during the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.48, which was lower than our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. As Murray already stated, adjusted earnings per share for the current quarter included a one-time $0.05 charge related to the International Mail Services portion of our Mail Services business segment.
During the quarter we discovered some inaccuracies in shipping rates used in International Mail Services to estimate revenue on items that were already shipped but not yet billed. These estimates did not affect the amount actually billed to customers. These shipping rates apply to the period from 2007 through the first quarter of 2010.
Further analysis showed that the impact was not material in any give quarter. As a result, we made a onetime out-of-period adjustment to reduce revenue in International Mail Services by about $21 million in the current quarter. And EBIT by about $16 million, primarily related for the correction of estimated shipping rates.
We have conducted a focused review of the process and determined that this was an isolated situation. Additionally, we have taken actions to mitigate the risk of a similar occurrence in the future. Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter.
GAAP earnings per share included pre-tax restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $49 million or $0.15 per share in the quarter. Additionally, as noted with regard to our GAAP tax results, GAAP EPS for continuing operations in the quarter included net tax charges of $0.02 per share related to the items I noted earlier.
GAAP EPS in the quarter also included a $0.01 per share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions related to our former capital services business.
Free cash flow is $157 million for the quarter and $451 million year-to-date. Free cash flow year-to-date was about $8 million more than the prior year. During the quarter free cash flow benefited from lower capital expenditures and lower finance receivables. However, the contribution to cash flow from finance receivables was $11 million less than last year.
During the quarter we returned $80 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Based on the strength of our free cash flow through the end of July, we repurchased about 1.2 million shares of our stock for $29 million. We increased our commercial paper balances by about $44 million during the quarter to $143 million. About 78% of our total debt is fixed rate and 22% is floating rate.
Let me now highlight a few points about our strategic transformation program. In the second quarter we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team, and we finalized the planning for others we will implement throughout 2010 and 2011.
During the second quarter our restructuring charges were largely for severance cost related to the elimination of approximately 400 positions across the company. Since the programs inception, we have eliminated approximately 1,300 positions. Year-to-date we achieved net benefits of approximately $30 million and continue to target net benefits of at least $50 million in 2010.
We expect the benefits to build throughout the year as we implement our plans. We are targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011, and we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012.
That concludes my remarks, now Murray will discuss our guidance.

These changes reflect business trends during the second quarter, the economic business outlook for our customers for the remainder of the year, and the onetime adjustment in the second quarter.
The global economy and business environment have not stabilized or improved as quickly as we had originally anticipated when we provided guidance earlier this year. Also contrary to our previous expectations and based on the uncertainty surrounding the current economic outlook, we no longer expect the business environment to improve as much in the second half of the year.
Given the continued volatility and uncertainty concerning currency, we will now provide constant currency revenue growth guidance. On a constant currency basis, we now expect revenue for the year will be in the range of flat growth to a 3% decline compared to our original expectation of revenue in the range of 1% growth to a 2% decline.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year, is now expected to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.30, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.49 to $1.85. This compared to our previous adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $2.30 to $2.50 for the year, and GAAP EPS guidance for continuing operations in the range of $1.71 to $2.07.
Our current GAAP EPS guidance includes tax charges of $0.13 per diluted share related to out of money stock options, certain capital of least transactions outside the U.S. and the impact of healthcare legislation enacted at the beginning of the year.
GAAP EPS also includes expected restructuring charges and asset impairments in the range of $0.32 to $0.48. We are increasing free cash flow guidance for the year by $50 million based on the strong generation of free cash flow in the first half of the year, and the outlook for the remainder of the year.
We now anticipate generating free cash flow for 2010 in the range of $700 million to $800 million compared to the earlier range of $650 million to $750 million.
We continue to realize the benefits of our ongoing actions to improve the company's efficiency and market responsiveness and to identify and capitalize on long term growth opportunities. We believe these benefits will become increasingly visible as the economy recovers and business confidence rebounds.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions.

So that's where we saw the European shift, and that began around mid-second quarter.
In the SMB segment, we have offered the lease extension option, and when we see uncertainty in the market, customers opt for lease extension rather a new product. So we're seeing more of the lease extension as we've described before that has an impact in the near term. Although long term, it provides fairly similar returns from a profitability with less revenue.
So we started seeing that late in the quarter that there was some slowdown in that area early in the quarter. We did not see that, but the late period bookings we did.

The shift of that has been a little farther down the customer base to some smaller customers as I think you know our customer base, though it's SMB, tends to be more on the small side of the customer base and then a small percentage of our customers are larger entities.
So we saw a fairly significant shift from that perspective. And we have also offered the lease extensions in some of our larger markets in Europe and we did see an increase there as well. I think there's an overall lower demand in the small business marketplace as well.

First, as you recall, in the first quarter, we were seeing some uptick in demand in the SMB marketplace. As we got late in the second quarter, we actually saw demand decline, particularly in the area of new business. So there were less new business starts.
Our program has remained relatively similar on lease extensions. And as I look at it and look at confidence in the marketplace, it is usually as you see the shift. And so as we got through the quarter, we saw lower demand with new business starts and expansion in the tail-end of the quarter. But then the shift to lease extensions accelerated as we went through the quarter from the marketplace. So I think that was the primary driver in the area.
When it comes to the annual payments on software, that has been something that has continued to move forward over the last number of quarters as more and more companies are looking for annual payments rather than term contract payment. So they are signing up for term annual payments rather than an upfront lump sum.
And this really ties into paying for usage, and it is moving in the direction of the software-as-a-service product that we discussed in April that we are launching going forward into that marketplace. So we will continue to see the contract revenue being extended over time rather than upfront. And we'll see an acceleration in software-as-a-service.

And the print business is coming a little slower. We did introduce another printer, which will not be available until late in the year, beginning of next year. And some of that volume will shift to that printer, which will take it out of this period from the revenue recognition.
And then the final area within the Enterprise, which is Marketing Services, we saw good growth in both revenue and in profitability. So it was up 7% in revenue. So in general, if we take that one-time out, we saw a pretty good return in the Enterprise area; a strong profit growth and as good as expected on the revenue side, excluding the adjustment.

As you look at the reports that have been coming out over the last week, there has been a lot of economic uncertainty and decision-making that people are expressing. And we see that as the major component.
But certainly there are segments within the mailing segment, which we've discussed previously, that do have headwinds that we are looking to overcome. And those we don't expect to see any difference on, if we go back to the report that the Postal Service issued, which was about a 2% per year decline over the next decade. So that we see as a long-term headwind that we'll be facing.
But as we've also mentioned, it is a pure volume, because there is an access component here as well. But certainly when there is economic uncertainty, people will look for an extension of what they're doing rather than moving forward with new goods. And that does take down revenues in the near term. On the long term, it has a positive effect from the less need to invest in new product to put into the fleet, because we're utilizing the assets that are already there.

And so we have already moved our product family into a fairly advanced technology, which was ahead of the majority of the market, so people can get access to rate changes, et cetera, remotely rather than having to have physical component set out in adjustments. The inkjet printing was put in place, et cetera.
So those devices, if we go back further in time, we used to have about a seven to eight-year lifecycle on mailing machines that came down during the technology change into a four to five-year cycle. But there is nothing that's mandated change that would keep the existing devices from running and performing very well.
They certainly have the capability and the longevity to do that, and we continue to add and download, because part of that connectivity was that we could download and update software in the equipment. So we keep that software up-to-date as well as the rates. And that makes the equipment very viable in a longer-term arrangement.
So as we look forward and as you look at Connect+, our future product is adding new capabilities and technologies such as web services, which will expand the capability and move them forward into handling more applications and more personal applications that they might be doing in other means.
So that will be the next reason for people to shift. But during this environment, people are staying close to what they have been doing and not making change. And it's much easier to sign a lease extension than it is to take a new contract and have that run through a business.

We normally would be working in advance with the posts on those, because they look to not affect their customers, but haven't happened in cycle, so that their customers can naturally cycle through the equipment.
I think that as we look forward, we'll see more and more things around marketing, which is why we've launched color, the ability to add other services such as address correction, et cetera, from the device. And then with the expansion in shipping, that shipping will be added and become easier to do on the new devices than on old devices, because they have the ability to drive label printers, et cetera, that will enhance that capability.
So I think it will be more from the market demand, an expansion of capabilities and the consolidation around one device rather than multiple devices in the mailing and shipping area. And, Chris, part of that is working with the post to integrate those services. So it's not necessarily a regulatory change, but it is an enhancement of the access to other services.
So with Connect+, for example, we've been working very much with the USPS to put the flat rate boxes, et cetera, all into that device, so that it can handle their new rates and their new capabilities as they moved forward. And so we will continue to add those new services, and some of those will have to be on new devices rather than existing install base.

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance.

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike, will follow with the details of our third quarter results and then we’ll take your questions.
Overall this quarter, we achieved performance in line with the prior year in both revenue at $1.3 billion, excluding the impact of foreign currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.55.
We, like others, have seen an uneven recovery in the global economic environment, which has been characterized by low job growth and lingering weakness in consumer confidence and spending. This quarter, however, we did see some signs of improvement in certain segments of our customer base.
We experienced 10% increases in both equipment sales and in software revenues. The growth in equipment sales included a 5% increase in U.S. mailing equipment, which was the first year-over-year increase in seven quarters.
Double-digit equipment sales growth in Production Mail also included the installation of some of our advanced systems in several accounts in the enterprise customer segment.
The positive equipment sales performance in the segment of our business that serves small-to-medium sized businesses was led by placement of Connect+, our latest generation of mailing solutions.
We recently launched Connect+ in the U.K. and will continue its global rollout in phases over the next few quarters. Connect+ provides full color, process printing on the envelope as well as web-based functionality. We expect this innovative system to be a key component in driving future mailing equipment sales.
During the quarter, our software revenue growth was driven by increased demand for data management, analytics and CRM solutions. We also saw continuing demand in growth in our presort operations driven in part by a greater participation in the standard mail market.
This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in this segment of the Mailstream. The equipment sales and software revenue growth drivers represent important early milestones in returning our total revenue to growth.
It is important to remember, however, as we have discussed in previous calls, our recurring revenue streams of financing, rental and supplies will lag in growth because of the lower equipment sales in prior quarters.
During the quarter, we continued to see benefits from our actions to reduced cost and enhance productivity, which resulted in improved EBIT in International Mailing, Production Mail, Management Services and Marketing Services.
Software EBIT grew at a double-digit rate when the costs associated with the acquisition of Portrait Software are excluded. Increased shipping costs related to our growth and participation in the international eCommerce parcel market reduced EBIT in our Mail Services operation.
We continued the implementation and acceleration of our strategic transformation program. As a result, we achieved net benefits of more than $35 million during the third quarter and approximately $65 million year-to-date. Given the benefits, we’ve been able to achieve year-to-date, we now target net benefits from our transformation program of about $100 million this year.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the third quarter financial results. Mike?

As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged excluding the impact of foreign currency.Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and n",885,"Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged excluding the impact of foreign currency.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 1%. Outside the U.S., revenue was relatively flat versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 3%. Non-U.S. operations represented 29% of total revenue.
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT for the quarter was $228 million, which was about 1.5% lower than last year. During the quarter, EBIT benefited from a favorable adjustment related to the leverage lease portfolio in Canada, but was impacted by costs related to the acquisition of Portrait Software, higher international shipping costs and Mail Services and higher personnel and pension-related costs.
Because of our ongoing productivity initiatives, we were able to reduce our costs as a percentage of revenue in the quarter for equipment sales, software, rentals and support services when compared with the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A costs were flat when compared with the prior year on a reported basis and declined by about $5 million on an organic basis despite the reinstatement this year of certain employee-related costs.
Excluding the acquisition costs that Murray noted earlier, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in six of our seven business segments. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments.
While we’ve clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we remain committed to doing even more to our strategic transformation program, especially in the current environment.
Strategic transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers, plus we are putting in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EDIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $303 million or $1.47 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including finance interest was $51 million, flat when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4.2%, about 10 basis points than the prior year.
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.1%. This was lower than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 34.3%, but lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of favorable tax planning transactions.
We expect the tax rate on adjusted earnings could vary during the course of the year depending on the timing and mix of business and other factors, but we still expect the average tax rate should be within a range of 34% to 35% for the year.
The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.8%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.55, which was equal to our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rate did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter.
GAAP earnings per share included pre-tax restructuring charges that totaled $34 million or $0.10 per share in the quarter. GAAP EPS in the quarter also included a $0.01 per share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions associated with our former Capital Services business.
Free cash flow was $221 million for the quarter and $673 million year-to-date. During the quarter, free cash flow benefited from the unwinding of an interest rate swap position, which generated $32 million and also from lower finance receivables.
During the quarter, we returned $77 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Also, based on the strength of our free cash flow and the price of our stock, we opportunistically purchased about $4.7 million shares during the quarter for $100 million. We have $50 million in share repurchase authorization remaining.
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the second quarter by about $12 million to $132 million. About 84% of our total debt is fixed rate and 16% is floating rate.
Now let me highlight a few points about our strategic transformation program. In the third quarter, we continue to implement initiatives identified by our project team and we have added other initiatives that will implement throughout 2010 and 2011.
During the third quarter, our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 370 positions across the company. Since the program’s inception, we have eliminated about 1,700 positions. We’re achieving net savings identified by our strategic transformation program, more quickly than was originally anticipated as a result of disciplined implementation.
Therefore, we have achieved net benefits of approximately $65 million year-to-date and now expect to realize net benefits of about $100 million in 2010.
We’re still targeting annualized net benefits of the full program in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011, and we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012.
So, that concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance.

We also now expect to be at or above the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow.
These changes reflect our results for the first three quarters of the year and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The global economy and business environment appear to be stabilizing in some areas, but still remain uncertain in other areas such as small business.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we continue to expect revenue for the year will be in the range of flat to a 3% decline when compared with the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22 and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.69.
Our guidance range for GAAP earnings per share, includes tax charges of $0.13 per diluted share related to out-of-the-money stock options, certain capital lease transactions outside the U.S. and the impact of health care legislation enacted in the beginning of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we have accelerated some of our actions related to the transformation program and have generated more benefits and costs than were originally targeted. Therefore, we have narrowed our range for estimated restructuring and asset impairment charges for the year to $0.40 to $0.48, which are included in our range of estimated GAAP EPS for the year.
We now anticipate generating free cash flow for 2010 at or above the high end of our stated range of $700 million to $800 million. We continue to take actions that will help position us for long-term growth, while navigating uneven business and economic conditions in the near term. That is why we remain focused on investing in growth and driving innovation, while streamlining our business operations and creating more flexibility in our cost structure.
Thank you. Now, let’s open the line for questions.

The other is the acceleration of some of our procurement savings programs, where we were able to go out and identify categories where we could get better than expected reductions in cost of doing business.
In terms of its fall-through in the numbers, part of that is really reflected in original targets around revenue were a bit higher and the financing income is very high margin and that’s somewhat lower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, slower start in sales. So, that’s reflected in the total numbers.

There is a natural lag between lower equipment sales and the impact on financing revenue. So as the asset base has come off and we have not put an equivalent amount of sales on, keep in mind that what comes off the base if the average lease is four years long, it will be sales activity that we had four years ago.
So, because we had lower sales activity, particularly the tail end of ‘08 into ‘09, and then obviously in the first half of ‘10, that has the effect of reducing the asset base as the earlier sales roll up, but it’s on a lag basis. So as we talked about back in May at our Analyst Day, that’s going to be a year plus lag before we see the turn in the finance income, if we see continuing growth in the sales side. We did see that the rate of decline in financing income came down quarter-to-quarter.
Your other question was about supplies. Supplies really has two components to it. One is obviously our traditional ink supplies and that is basically volume related, related to mail volumes in terms of the number of indices generated, so that is tied to that. The other piece is non-ink supplies that we sell across our business, was down a bit.

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.Overall this quarter, we achieved performance",509,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.
Overall this quarter, we achieved performance in line with the prior year in both revenue at $1.3 billion, excluding the impact of foreign currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.55. We, like others, have seen an uneven recovery in the global economic environment, which has been characterized by low job growth and lingering weakness in consumer confidence and spending. This quarter however, we did see some signs of improvement in certain segments of our customer base. 
We experienced 10% increases in both equipment sales and in software revenues. The growth in equipment sales included a 5% increase in U.S. Mailing equipment, which was the first year-over-year increase in 7 quarters. Double-digit equipment sales growth in Production Mail also included the installation of some of our advanced systems in several accounts in the Enterprise customer segment. 
The positive equipment sales performance in this segment of our business that serves small- to medium-sized businesses was led by placements of Connect+, our latest generation of mailing solutions. We recently launched Connect+ in the U.K. and will continue its global rollout in phases over the next few quarters. Connect+ provides full-color, process printing on the envelope, as well as web-based functionality. We expect this innovative system to be a key component in driving future mailing equipment sales. 
During the quarter, our software revenue growth was driven by increased demand for data management, analytics and CRM solutions. We also saw continuing demand and growth in our presort operations, driven in part by a greater participation in the standard mail market. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in this segment of the mail stream.
The equipment sales and software revenue growth drivers represent important early milestones in returning our total revenue to growth. It is important to remember however, as we have discussed in previous calls, our recurring revenue streams of financing, rental and supplies will lag in growth because of the lower equipment sales in prior quarters. 
During quarter, we continue to see benefits from our actions to reduce costs and enhance productivity, which resulted in improved EBIT in International Mailing, Production Mail, Management Services and Marketing Services. Software EBIT grew at a double-digit rate when the cost associated with the acquisition of Portraits Software are excluded. Increased shipping cost related to our growth and participation in the international e-commerce parcel market reduced EBIT in our mail services operation. We continue the implementation and acceleration of our strategic transformation program. As a result, we achieved net benefits of more than $35 million during the third quarter and approximately $65 million year-to-date.
Given the benefits we've been able to achieve year-to-date, we now target net benefits from our transformation program of about $100 million this year. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the third quarter financial results. Mike?"
297018,114716739,163227,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year in unchanged, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and",883,"Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year in unchanged, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 1%. Outside the U. S., revenue was relatively flat versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 3%. Non-U.S. operations represented 29% of total revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $228 million, which was about 1.5% lower than last year. During the quarter, EBIT benefited from a favorable adjustment related to the leverage lease portfolio in Canada, but was impacted by costs related to the acquisition of Portrait Software, higher international shipping costs in Mail Services and higher personnel and pension-related costs. Because of our ongoing productivity initiatives, we were able to reduce our costs as a percentage of revenue in the quarter for equipment sales, software, rentals and support services when compared with the prior year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, costs were flat when compared with the prior year on a reported basis and declined by about $5 million on an organic basis despite the reinstatement this year of certain employee-related costs.
Excluding the acquisition cost that Murray noted earlier, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 6 of our 7 business segments. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments.
While we've clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we remain committed to doing even more to our Strategic Transformation program, especially in the current environment. Strategic transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus, we're putting in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $303 million or $1.47 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including finance interest, was $51 million, flat when compared with prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4.2%, about 10 basis points higher than the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.1%. This was lower than the tax rate in adjusted earnings last year, which was 34.3%, but lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of favorable tax planning transactions.
We expect the tax rate in adjusted earnings could vary during the course of the year depending on the timing and mix of business and other factors, but we still expect the average tax rate should be within a range of 34% to 35% for the year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.8%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.55, which was equal to our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rate did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter.
GAAP earnings per share included pretax restructuring charges that totaled $34 million or $0.10 per share in the quarter. GAAP EPS in the quarter also included a $0.01 per share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions associated with our former Capital Services business. Free cash flow was $221 million for the quarter and $673 million year-to-date.
During the quarter, free cash flow benefited from the unwinding of an interest rate swap position, which generated $32 million, and also from lower finance receivables. 
During the quarter, we returned $77 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Also based on the strength of our free cash flow and the price of our stock, we opportunistically purchased about 4.7 million shares during the quarter for $100 million. We have $50 million in share repurchase authorization remaining. 
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the second quarter by about $12 million to $132 million. About 84% of our total debt is fixed rate and 16% is floating rate.
Now let me highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continue to implement initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that will implement throughout 2010 and 2011. 
During the third quarter, our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 370 positions across the company. Since the program's inception, we have eliminated about 1,700 positions. We're achieving net savings identified by our Strategic Transformation program more quickly than was originally anticipated, as a result of disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved net benefits of approximately $65 million year-to-date and now expect to realize net benefits of about $100 million in 2010.
We're still targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011, and we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012. 
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We also now expect to be at or above the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow. These changes reflect our results for the first 3 quarters of the year and our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
The global economy and business environment appear to be stabilizing in some areas, but still remains uncertain in other areas such as small business. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we continue to expect revenue for the year will be in the range of flat to a 3% decline when compared with the prior year. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.69. Our guidance range for GAAP earnings per share includes tax charges of $0.13 per diluted share related to out-of-the-money stock options, certain capital lease transactions outside the U.S. and the impact of healthcare legislation enacted in the beginning of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we have accelerated some of our actions related to the transformation program and have generated more benefits and costs than were originally targeted. Therefore, we have narrowed our range for estimated restructuring and asset impairment charges for the year to $0.40 to $0.48, which are included in our range of estimated GAAP EPS for the year. We now anticipate generating free cash flow for 2010 at or above the high end of our stated range of $700 million to $800 million. 
We continue to take actions that will position us for long-term growth while navigating uneven business and economic conditions in the near term. That is why we remain focused on investing in growth and driving innovation, while streamlining our business operations and creating more flexibility in our cost structure.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

Or maybe can you provide some color on maybe the dislocation between equipment sales and financing?"

There's a natural lag between lower equipment sales and the impact on financing revenues. So as the asset base has come off and we've not put an equivalent amount of sales on, keep in mind that what comes off the base of the average lease is 4 years long will be sales activity that we had 4 years ago. So because we had lower sales activity, particularly the tail-end of '08, in 2009, and then obviously, in the first half of '10, that had the effect of reducing the asset base as the earlier sales roll off. But it's on a lag basis. So as we talked about back in May at our Analyst Day, that's going to be a year-plus lag before we see the turn in the financing come, if we see continuing growth in the sales side. We did see that the rate of decline in financing income came down quarter-to-quarter. And your other question was about supplies. Supplies really has 2 components to it. One is obviously our traditional ink supplies. And that is basically volume-related, related to mail volumes in terms of the number of indices generated. So that is tied to that. The other piece is non-ink supplies that we sell across our business was down a bit."

While this is an early indicator of improving business conditions in parts of our customer base, growth in recurring revenue streams will lag the trends in equipment sales.
Six of our 7 business segments had improved EBIT margins, excluding the acquisition costs related to Portrait. We achieved adjusted EPS of $0.55, which was equal to the prior year, and we now expect to realize net benefits from our Strategic Transformation of about $100 million in 2010 as a result of our disciplined focus on implementation.
So I want to thank you for your time this afternoon. And have a good quarter."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.Overall this quarter, we achieved performance",510,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.
Overall this quarter, we achieved performance in line with the prior year in both revenue at $1.3 billion, excluding the impact of foreign currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.55. We, like others, have seen an uneven recovery in the global economic environment, which has been characterized by low job growth and lingering weakness in consumer confidence and spending. This quarter however, we did see some signs of improvement in certain segments of our customer base.
We experienced 10% increases in both equipment sales and in software revenues. The growth in equipment sales included a 5% increase in U.S. Mailing equipment, which was the first year-over-year increase in 7 quarters. Double-digit equipment sales growth in Production Mail also included the installation of some of our advanced systems in several accounts in the enterprise customer segment. 
The positive equipment sales performance in the segment of our business that serves small- to medium-sized businesses was led by placements of Connect+, our latest generation of mailing solutions. We recently launched Connect+ in the U.K. and will continue its global rollout in phases over the next few quarters. Connect+ provides full-color, process printing on the envelope, as well as web-based functionality. We expect this innovative system to be a key component in driving future mailing equipment sales. 
During the quarter, our software revenue growth was driven by increased demand for data management, analytics and CRM solutions. We also saw continuing demand and growth in our presort operations, driven in part by a greater participation in the standard mail market. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in this segment of the mail stream.
The equipment sales and software revenue growth drivers represent important early milestones in returning our total revenue to growth. It is important to remember however, as we have discussed in previous calls, our recurring revenue streams of financing, rental and supplies will lag in growth because of the lower equipment sales in prior quarters.
During the quarter, we continued to see benefits from our actions to reduce costs and enhance productivity, which resulted in improved EBIT in International Mailing, Production Mail, Management Services and Marketing Services. Software EBIT grew at a double-digit rate when the cost associated with the acquisition of Portraits Software are excluded. 
Increased shipping cost related to our growth and participation in the international e-commerce parcel market reduced EBIT in our Mail Services operation. We continue the implementation and acceleration of our strategic transformation program. As a result, we achieved net benefits of more than $35 million during the third quarter and approximately $65 million year-to-date.
Given the benefits we've been able to achieve year-to-date, we now target net benefits from our transformation program of about $100 million this year.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the third quarter financial results. Mike?"
297018,114716739,163275,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and",884,"Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 1%. Outside the U. S., revenue was relatively flat versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 3%. Non-U.S. operations represented 29% of total revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $228 million, which was about 1.5% lower than last year. During the quarter, EBIT benefited from a favorable adjustment related to the leveraged lease portfolio in Canada, but was impacted by costs related to the acquisition of Portrait Software, higher international shipping costs in Mail Services and higher personnel- and pension-related costs. Because of our ongoing productivity initiatives, we were able to reduce our costs as a percentage of revenue in the quarter for equipment sales, software, rentals and support services when compared with the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A costs, were flat when compared with the prior year on a reported basis, and declined by about $5 million on an organic basis despite the reinstatement this year of certain employee-related costs.
Excluding the acquisition costs that Murray noted earlier, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 6 of our 7 business segments. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments.
While we've clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we remain committed to doing even more to our Strategic Transformation program, especially in the current environment. Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus, we are putting in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $303 million or $1.47 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including finance interest, was $51 million, flat when compared with prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4.2%, about 10 basis points higher than the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.1%. This was lower than the tax rate in adjusted earnings last year, which was 34.3%, but lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of favorable tax planning transactions.
We expect the tax rate on adjusted earnings could vary during the course of the year depending on the timing and mix of business and other factors, but we still expect the average tax rate should be within a range of 34% to 35% for the year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.8%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.55, which was equal to our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rate did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter.
GAAP earnings per share included pretax restructuring charges that totaled $34 million or $0.10 per share in the quarter. GAAP EPS in the quarter also included a $0.01 per share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions associated with our former Capital Services business. Free cash flow was $221 million for the quarter and $673 million year-to-date.
During the quarter, free cash flow benefited from the unwinding of an interest rate swap position, which generated $32 million, and also from lower finance receivables. 
During the quarter, we returned $77 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Also based on the strength of our free cash flow and the price of our stock, we opportunistically purchased about 4.7 million shares during the quarter for $100 million. We have $50 million in share repurchase authorization remaining.
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the second quarter by about $12 million to $132 million. About 84% of our total debt is fixed rate and 16% is floating rate.
Now let me highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continue to implement initiatives identified by our project team, and have added other initiatives that will implement throughout 2010 and 2011. 
During the third quarter, our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 370 positions across the company. Since the program's inception, we have eliminated about 1,700 positions. We're achieving net savings identified by our Strategic Transformation program more quickly than was originally anticipated, as a result of disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved net benefits of approximately $65 million year-to-date and now expect to realize net benefits of about $100 million in 2010.
We're still targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011, and we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012.
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We also now expect to be at or above the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow. These changes reflect our results for the first 3 quarters of the year and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
The global economy and business environment appear to be stabilizing in some areas, but still remain uncertain in other areas, such as small business. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we continue to expect revenue for the year will be in the range of flat to a 3% decline when compared with the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.69. Our guidance range for GAAP earnings per share includes tax charges of $0.13 per diluted share related to out-of-the-money stock options, certain capital lease transactions outside the U.S. and the impact of healthcare legislation enacted in the beginning of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we have accelerated some of our actions related to the transformation program, and have generated more benefits and costs than were originally targeted. Therefore, we have narrowed our range for estimated restructuring and asset impairment charges for the year to $0.40 to $0.48, which are included in our range of estimated GAAP EPS for the year. We now anticipate generating free cash flow for 2010 at or above the high end of our stated range of $700 million to $800 million. 
We continue to take actions that will position us for long-term growth while navigating uneven business and economic conditions in the near term. That is why we remain focused on investing in growth and driving innovation, while streamlining our business operations and creating more flexibility in our cost structure.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

So as the asset base has come off and we've not put an equivalent amount of sales on, keep in mind that what comes off the base of the average lease is 4 years long will be sales activity that we had 4 years ago. So because we had lower sales activity, particularly the tail-end of '08, in 2009, and then obviously, in the first half of '10, that had the effect of reducing the asset base as the earlier sales roll off. But it's on a lag basis. So as we talked about back in May at our Analyst Day, that's going to be a year-plus lag before we see the turn in the financing come, if we see continuing growth in the sales side. We did see that the rate of decline in financing income came down quarter-to-quarter. And your other question was about supplies. Supplies really has 2 components to it. One is, obviously, our traditional ink supplies. And that is basically volume-related, they're related to mail volumes in terms of the number of indices [ph] generated, so that is tied to that.

So we're seeing more and more adoption in Standard. If you recall, we were primarily First-Class mail. But now the Standard Mail is accelerating. So it's been very positive for us. Even while some of the segments of mail have shrunk over the last 3 years, we've continued to grow volume in that space and we expect to continue to do that."

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.Overall this quarter, we achieved performance",510,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.
Overall this quarter, we achieved performance in line with the prior year in both revenue at $1.3 billion excluding the impact of foreign currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.55. We, like others, have seen an uneven recovery in the global economic environment, which has been characterized by low job growth and lingering weakness in consumer confidence and spending. This quarter, however, we did see some signs of improvement in certain segments of our customer base.
We experienced 10% increases in both equipment sales and in software revenues. The growth in equipment sales included a 5% increase in U.S. Mailing equipment, which was the first year-over-year increase in 7 quarters. Double-digit equipment sales growth in Production Mail also included the installation of some of our advanced systems in several accounts in the enterprise customer segment. 
The positive equipment sales performance in the segment of our business that serves small- to medium-size businesses was led by placement of Connect+, our latest generation of mailing solutions. We recently launched Connect+ in the U.K. and will continue its global rollout in phases over the next few quarters. Connect+ provides full-color process printing on the envelope as well as web-based functionality. We expect this innovative system to be a key component in driving future mailing equipment sales. 
During the quarter, our software revenue growth was driven by increased demand for data management, analytics and CRM solutions. We also saw continuing demand and growth in our presort operations, driven in part by a greater participation in the standard mail market. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in this segment of the mail stream.
The equipment sales and software revenue growth drivers represent important early milestones in returning our total revenue to growth. It is important to remember, however, as we have discussed in previous calls, our recurring revenue streams of financing, rental and supplies will lag in growth because of the lower equipment sales in prior quarters.
During the quarter, we continued to see benefits from our actions to reduce costs and enhance productivity, which resulted in improved EBIT in International Mailing, Production Mail, Management Services and Marketing Services. Software EBIT grew at a double-digit rate when the costs associated with the acquisition of Portrait Software are excluded. 
Increased shipping cost related to our growth and participation in the international e-commerce parcel market reduced EBIT in our Mail Services operation. We continued the implementation and acceleration of our strategic transformation program. As a result, we achieved net benefits of more than $35 million during the third quarter and approximately $65 million year-to-date.
Given the benefits we've been able to achieve year-to-date, we now target net benefits from our transformation program of about $100 million this year.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the third quarter financial results. Mike?"
297018,114716739,163321,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged excluding the impact of foreign currency. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and",881,"Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 1%. Outside the U. S., revenue was relatively flat versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 3%. Non-U.S. operations represented 29% of total revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $228 million, which was about 1.5% lower than last year. During the quarter, EBIT benefited from a favorable adjustment related to the leveraged lease portfolio in Canada but was impacted by costs related to the acquisition of Portrait Software, higher international shipping costs in Mail Services and higher personnel- and pension-related costs. Because of our ongoing productivity initiatives, we were able to reduce our costs as a percentage of revenue in the quarter for equipment sales, software, rentals and support services when compared with the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A costs, were flat when compared with the prior year on a reported basis and declined by about $5 million on an organic basis despite the reinstatement this year of certain employee-related costs.
Excluding the acquisition costs that Murray noted earlier, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 6 of our 7 business segments. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments.
While we've clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we remain committed to doing even more through our Strategic Transformation program, especially in the current environment. Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus, we are putting in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $303 million, or $1.47 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including finance interest was $51 million, flat when compared with prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4.2%, about 10 basis points higher than the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.1%. This was lower than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 34.3%, but lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of favorable tax planning transactions.
We expect the tax rate on adjusted earnings could vary during the course of the year depending on the timing and mix of business and other factors, but we still expect the average tax rate should be within a range of 34% to 35% for the year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.8%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.55, which was equal to our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rate did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter.
GAAP earnings per share included pretax restructuring charges that totaled $34 million, or $0.10 per share, in the quarter. GAAP EPS in the quarter also included a $0.01-per-share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions associated with our former Capital Services business. Free cash flow was $221 million for the quarter and $673 million year-to-date.
During the quarter, free cash flow benefited from the unwinding of an interest rate swap position, which generated $32 million, and also from lower finance receivables. 
During the quarter, we returned $77 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Also, based on the strength of our free cash flow and the price of our stock, we opportunistically purchased about 4.7 million shares during the quarter for $100 million. We have $50 million in share repurchase authorization remaining.
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the second quarter by about $12 million to $132 million. About 84% of our total debt is fixed-rate, and 16% is floating rate.
Now let me highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that will implement throughout 2010 and 2011. 
During the third quarter, our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 370 positions across the company. Since the program's inception, we have eliminated about 1,700 positions. We're achieving net savings identified by our Strategic Transformation program more quickly than was originally anticipated as a result of disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved net benefits of approximately $65 million year-to-date and now expect to realize net benefits of about $100 million in 2010.
We're still targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011, and we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012.
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We also now expect to be at or above the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow. These changes reflect our results for the first 3 quarters of the year and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
The global economy and business environment appear to be stabilizing in some areas but still remain uncertain in other areas, such as small business. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we continue to expect revenue for the year will be in the range of flat to a 3% decline when compared with the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.69. Our guidance range for GAAP earnings per share includes tax charges of $0.13 per diluted share related to out-of-the-money stock options, certain capital lease transactions outside the U.S. and the impact of healthcare legislation enacted in the beginning of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we have accelerated some of our actions related to the transformation program and have generated more benefits and costs than were originally targeted. Therefore, we have narrowed our range for estimated restructuring and asset impairment charges for the year to $0.40 to $0.48, which are included in our range of estimated GAAP EPS for the year. We now anticipate generating free cash flow for 2010 at or above the high end of our stated range of $700 million to $800 million. 
We continue to take actions that will help position us for long-term growth while navigating uneven business and economic conditions in the near term. That is why we remain focused on investing in growth and driving innovation while streamlining our business operations and creating more flexibility in our cost structure.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

There is a natural lag between lower equipment sales and the impact on financing revenue. So as the asset base has come off and we've not put an equivalent amount of sales on, keep in mind that what comes off the base if the average lease is 4 years long will be sales activity that we had 4 years ago. So because we had lower sales activity, particularly the tail end of '08, into '09, and then, obviously, in the first half of '10, that had the effect of reducing the asset base as the earlier sales roll off. But it's on a lag basis. So as we talked about back in May at our Analyst Day, that's going to be a year-plus lag before we see the turn in the financing come if we see continuing growth in the sales side. We did see that the rate of decline in financing income came down quarter-to-quarter. And your other question was about supplies. Supplies really has 2 components to it. One is, obviously, our traditional ink supplies. And that is basically volume-related, they're related to mail volumes in terms of the number of indices [ph] generated, so that is tied to that.

Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.Overall this quarter, we achieved performance",510,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our performance. Mike will follow with the details of our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.
Overall this quarter, we achieved performance in line with the prior year in both revenue at $1.3 billion excluding the impact of foreign currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.55. We, like others, have seen an uneven recovery in the global economic environment, which has been characterized by low job growth and lingering weakness in consumer confidence and spending. This quarter, however, we did see some signs of improvement in certain segments of our customer base.
We experienced 10% increases in both equipment sales and in software revenues. The growth in equipment sales included a 5% increase in U.S. Mailing equipment, which was the first year-over-year increase in 7 quarters. Double-digit equipment sales growth in Production Mail also included the installation of some of our advanced systems in several accounts in the enterprise customer segment. 
The positive equipment sales performance in the segment of our business that serves small- to medium-size businesses was led by placement of Connect+, our latest generation of mailing solutions. We recently launched Connect+ in the U.K. and will continue its global rollout in phases over the next few quarters. Connect+ provides full-color process printing on the envelope as well as web-based functionality. We expect this innovative system to be a key component in driving future mailing equipment sales. 
During the quarter, our software revenue growth was driven by increased demand for data management, analytics and CRM solutions. We also saw continuing demand and growth in our presort operations, driven in part by a greater participation in the standard mail market. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in this segment of the mail stream.
The equipment sales and software revenue growth drivers represent important early milestones in returning our total revenue to growth. It is important to remember, however, as we have discussed in previous calls, our recurring revenue streams of financing, rental and supplies will lag in growth because of the lower equipment sales in prior quarters.
During the quarter, we continued to see benefits from our actions to reduce costs and enhance productivity, which resulted in improved EBIT in International Mailing, Production Mail, Management Services and Marketing Services. Software EBIT grew at a double-digit rate when the costs associated with the acquisition of Portrait Software are excluded. 
Increased shipping cost related to our growth and participation in the international e-commerce parcel market reduced EBIT in our Mail Services operation. We continued the implementation and acceleration of our strategic transformation program. As a result, we achieved net benefits of more than $35 million during the third quarter and approximately $65 million year-to-date.
Given the benefits we've been able to achieve year-to-date, we now target net benefits from our transformation program of about $100 million this year.
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion of the third quarter financial results. Mike?"
297018,114716739,165310,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged excluding the impact of foreign currency. Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and",883,"Thank you, Murray. As Murray noted, revenue was $1.3 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% when compared with the prior year and unchanged excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 1%. Outside the U. S., revenue was relatively flat versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside the U.S. increased 3%. Non-U.S. operations represented 29% of total revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the quarter was $228 million, which was about 1.5% lower than last year. During the quarter, EBIT benefited from a favorable adjustment related to the leveraged lease portfolio in Canada but was impacted by costs related to the acquisition of Portrait Software, higher international shipping costs in Mail Services and higher personnel- and pension-related costs. Because of our ongoing productivity initiatives, we were able to reduce our costs as a percentage of revenue in the quarter for equipment sales, software, rentals and support services when compared with the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A costs, were flat when compared with the prior year on a reported basis and declined by about $5 million on an organic basis despite the reinstatement this year of certain employee-related costs.
Excluding the acquisition costs that Murray noted earlier, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 6 of our 7 business segments. These improvements in EBIT margins were a result of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure and increasing our operating efficiency across all of our business segments.
While we've clearly done a lot to improve our productivity, we remain committed to doing even more through our Strategic Transformation program, especially in the current environment. Strategic Transformation is enabling us to improve the way we go to market and interact with our customers. Plus, we are putting in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and profitable, allowing us to better leverage future revenue growth.
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $303 million, or $1.47 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including finance interest was $51 million, flat when compared with prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was about 4.2%, about 10 basis points higher than the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 33.1%. This was lower than the tax rate on adjusted earnings last year, which was 34.3%, but lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of favorable tax planning transactions.
We expect the tax rate on adjusted earnings could vary during the course of the year depending on the timing and mix of business and other factors, but we still expect the average tax rate should be within a range of 34% to 35% for the year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.8%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.55, which was equal to our adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period last year. Currency exchange rate did not have a significant impact on earnings for the quarter.
GAAP earnings per share included pretax restructuring charges that totaled $34 million, or $0.10 per share, in the quarter. GAAP EPS in the quarter also included a $0.01 per share loss for discontinued operations, which is related primarily to interest on uncertain tax positions associated with our former Capital Services business. Free cash flow was $221 million for the quarter and $673 million year-to-date.
During the quarter, free cash flow benefited from the unwinding of an interest rate swap position, which generated $32 million, and also from lower finance receivables. 
During the quarter, we returned $77 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Also, based on the strength of our free cash flow and the price of our stock, we opportunistically purchased about 4.7 million shares during the quarter for $100 million. We have $50 million in share repurchase authorization remaining.
We reduced our commercial paper balances this quarter versus the second quarter by about $12 million to $132 million. About 84% of our total debt is fixed-rate, and 16% is floating rate.
Now let me highlight a few points about our Strategic Transformation program. In the third quarter, we continued to implement initiatives identified by our project team and have added other initiatives that will implement throughout 2010 and 2011. 
During the third quarter, our restructuring charges were largely for severance costs related to the elimination of about 370 positions across the company. Since the program's inception, we have eliminated about 1,700 positions. We're achieving net savings identified by our Strategic Transformation program more quickly than was originally anticipated as a result of disciplined implementation. Therefore, we have achieved net benefits of approximately $65 million year-to-date and now expect to realize net benefits of about $100 million in 2010.
We're still targeting annualized net benefits for the full program in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2011, and we expect to achieve the full annualized run rate of benefits in 2012.
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance."

We also now expect to be at or above the high end of our guidance range for free cash flow. These changes reflect our results for the first 3 quarters of the year and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
The global economy and business environment appear to be stabilizing in some areas but still remain uncertain in other areas, such as small business. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we continue to expect revenue for the year will be in the range of flat to a 3% decline when compared with the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22. And GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.69. Our guidance range for GAAP earnings per share includes tax charges of $0.13 per diluted share related to out-of-the-money stock options, certain capital lease transactions outside the U.S. and the impact of healthcare legislation enacted in the beginning of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we have accelerated some of our actions related to the transformation program and have generated more benefits and costs than were originally targeted. Therefore, we have narrowed our range for estimated restructuring and asset impairment charges for the year to $0.40 to $0.48, which are included in our range of estimated GAAP EPS for the year. We now anticipate generating free cash flow for 2010 at or above the high end of our stated range of $700 million to $800 million. 
We continue to take actions that will help position us for long-term growth while navigating uneven business and economic conditions in the near term. That is why we remain focused on investing in growth and driving innovation while streamlining our business operations and creating more flexibility in our cost structure.
Thank you. Now let's open the line for questions."

There is a natural lag between lower equipment sales and the impact on financing revenue. So as the asset base has come off and we've not put an equivalent amount of sales on, keep in mind that what comes off the base if the average lease is 4 years long will be sales activity that we had 4 years ago. So because we had lower sales activity, particularly the tail end of '08, into '09, and then, obviously, in the first half of '10, that had the effect of reducing the asset base as the earlier sales roll off. But it's on a lag basis. So as we talked about back in May at our Analyst Day, that's going to be a year-plus lag before we see the turn in the financing come if we see continuing growth in the sales side. We did see that the rate of decline in financing income came down quarter-to-quarter. And your other question was about supplies. Supplies really has 2 components to it. One is, obviously, our traditional ink supplies. And that is basically volume-related, they're related to mail volumes in terms of the number of indices [ph] generated, so that is tied to that.
