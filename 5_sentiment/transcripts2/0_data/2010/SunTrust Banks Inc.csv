Again, I'd like to join with Steve in thanking you for being with us this morning. As has been the case for several quarters now, our results were affected by the challenging economic environment. We reported a $0.64 per share loss for the f",1019,"Good morning. Again, I'd like to join with Steve in thanking you for being with us this morning. As has been the case for several quarters now, our results were affected by the challenging economic environment. We reported a $0.64 per share loss for the fourth quarter, and a $3.98 loss for the full year. As you would expect in this type of operating environment, revenue was soft, loan demand was down and asset quality was weak. So like last quarter, there were certain positive operating trends. The most notable positive in the fourth quarter was an improved credit trends from the prior quarter. Both credit losses in early-stage delinquencies declined and non-performing loans were stable. Further, deposit growth and the positive mixed shift continue. The net interest margin significantly expanded in certain businesses, delivered very solid revenue growth.Now before we provide detail on the results, I want to point out that our optimism is certainly tempered in doing those positive trends especially those related to credit. The economy remains far from strong and there is more uncertainty than clarity in the outlook. And as I've said before, the beginning of a recovery is just at its beginning. History tells us that it will take some time before economic stabilization meaningfully translates in the bottom-line results. Asset quality revenues and ultimately, earnings improvement will need time to gain traction. And that timing is largely dependent on the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery.Now taking a closer look at the overall results. Revenue remained soft with stable net interest income and a small increase in non-interest income over the same quarter last year. Unchanged net interest income was a result of a significantly improved net interest margin, which was offset by the reduction in average earning assets. An increase in client deposits, improved mix and lower rates paid, enabled a reduction in higher cost sources of funding, and pushed the margin higher while loans and earning assets declined more rapidly, offsetting that benefit.What we're seeing is that sustained economic weakness has reduced demand for loans as clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction. And many have also accessed the debt markets in lieu of bank loans. Additionally, overall fee revenue remains cyclically soft. Reduced consumer spending was evident in the decline in many fee-related sources of income throughout the year. Though, as I mentioned, there were selected positive trends that emerged. For instance, investment banking income improved significantly over 2008 to a record level. Capital markets activity was higher in 2009 and as the year progressed, our numbers reflected the improved operating environment for our Corporate and Investment Banking businesses.In Commercial banking, we've been able to improve loan spreads despite the fact that the appetite for loans has been weak during the recession. Further, while deposit growth was cyclical in the industry-wide, there are strong indications that a part of the increase was SunTrust-specific. We are improving client satisfaction in getting to the drivers that build loyalty by understanding individual preferences and aligning our business models to respond. As a result, we've increased client satisfaction and it showed up in our deposit numbers in 2009. This reflects favorably on the tremendous effort being put forth by our team to improve client retention and acquisition capabilities. The results of disciplined expense management was evident again across controllable operating expenses this quarter. As you've heard me emphasize before, we continue to capitalize upon the strength we have built in this area, and we remain focused on continuously uncovering efficiency and improvement opportunities. Cyclical costs including other real estate, FDIC, pension and credit and collection costs remain high. On the asset quality front, we are quite pleased with the lower charge-offs and improved metrics, generally. However, as I alluded to earlier, we're not ready to declare a victory. In fact, we believe charge-offs will increase modestly the next quarter. Tom Freeman will provide more commentary on credit expectations later on.What it all comes down to is that although some things, notably the economic and regulatory environment are ultimately out of our control, I believe we are doing a very good job of controlling the things that we can control. We are laser focused on improved credit- and risk-related results. At the same time, we are also acutely focused on the client on improving service quality and frontline execution while controlling the expenses and managing risk. The positive results of our efforts are reflected in various aspects of our core performance over the last few quarters. Our continued success in these areas will permit us to deliver steadily improving results as the credit operating environment improves.Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to talk a little bit about our capital position before turning the call over to Mark. Slide 4 illustrates our significant capital position and our book value per share. We maintain a solid capital position with an estimated Tier 1 common ratio of 7.65%, and a Tier 1 ratio of 12.90%. Capital ratio has increased as the decline in risk-weighted assets more than offset the reduction of capital due to the earnings loss in the fourth quarter. We continue to have substantial liquidity as the aforementioned inflow of deposits have been largely retained in cash and investment in high quality government-backed securities. Book value was $35.29 and tangible common was $22.59 at the close of the year. A final note on capital, given a 9.5% Tier 1 ratio excluding TARP and our current capital and liquidity, we are well positioned to repay TARP when regulatory approval is received. I'll conclude by underscoring a point that is as true today as it has been throughout 2009. SunTrust continues to operate from a position of strength and we are focused on growing revenue, improving expense efficiency, increasing the profitability of the balance sheet, investing for the future and prudently managing credit.Our strong foundation coupled with our client-focused execution, broad risk mitigation capabilities and the long-term economic prospects of our markets, all position us to deliver improving financial performance as we move beyond this cycle. Now I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark?"

I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, with the summary income statement.  For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $316 million, or $0.64 per share. As has been t",2782,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, with the summary income statement.  For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $316 million, or $0.64 per share. As has been the case in recent quarters, our financial results continue to be dominated by credit losses. Cyclically sensitive expenses and to a lesser extent, soft revenue generation in certain units. In particular for the quarter, loan demand remained weak and mortgage production income was negatively impacted by the costs associated with the potential repurchase of mortgage loans originated and sold to government agencies in prior periods. On the other hand, there are some positive operating trends that I will also point out. Most notably is the decline in provision, primarily driven by lower charge-offs. Additionally, margin and net interest income increased as the deposit mix continue to improve while core client deposits grew. I'll cover this quarter's results in more detail in just a minute.For the full year 2009, the loss of common shareholders was $3.98 per share, and $2.34 per share if you exclude the impact of $750 million in goodwill impairment reported in the first quarter. In addition to the impact of goodwill impairment on expenses, there were several areas driving a net loss in 2009 compared to a profit in 2008. The biggest impact, of course, was credit quality. Provision for credit losses increased by $1.6 billion as charge-offs roughly doubled to $3.2 billion, and we increased the allowance for loan losses by one-third to $3.1 billion. Non-interest income declined by $760 million compared to 2008's level and while overall fee generation was somewhat impacted by recessionary pressures, the decline was largely due to the absence of gains associated with the Coke stock transactions that were completed during 2008.The final item of note is the full year cost of dividends on the TARP preferred securities, which increased to $266 million. So with that brief summary of 2009, I'll now provide more detail on the fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 6 with the balance sheet summary. Overall, average loan balances excluding non-accruals declined 4% and 12% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. Decline in balances in our higher-risk categories continued, but we also experienced a decline in certain of our higher quality categories. On the higher risk side, construction balances continued their rapid decline, down another 12% in the current quarter, and down 47% compared to last year. The residential mortgage and home equity line portfolios also continued their downward trend.On the higher quality side, commercial and industrial loans declined 8% sequentially and are down 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This reduction resulted primarily from a continued trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid-sized and larger corporate clients, due to lower working capital needs and enhanced access to the capital markets during the quarter, which resulted in loan pay downs. However, the pace of decline did slow during the quarter. And In the financial tables we've published today, you can see evidence of this in the roughly equal year end and fourth quarter average balance figures. And in the lower period and sequential quarter decline of 3% versus the 8% on average. While we are pleased that the pace of decline slowed, it is too early to tell whether or not this trend will be sustained as we move into the first quarter of 2010.Now relative to loan volumes, please note that we expect an increase of approximately $2 billion in loans and loans held for sale, as a result of implementing FAS 167 in the first quarter. This consolidation is expected to have minimal impact on capital ratios and net interest margin, and there is a slide in the appendix that provides some additional information on this topic for your review.Now moving on to deposits at the bottom of the slide, where you can see that lower-cost deposits continued to grow while higher-cost deposits continued to shrink. We noted last quarter that the pace of growth in deposits had moderated. While growth picked back up this quarter, it is primarily a seasonal increase. Nonetheless, overall average consumer and commercial deposits increased 2% sequentially this quarter and remained up 14% on a year-over-year basis.While maintaining competitive pricing in our markets, CD balances declined in the quarter as we have continued to carefully manage the trade-off between price and volume given our increased liquidity position. Finally, while there wasn't much change on a sequential quarter basis, please note that brokered and foreign deposits have been reduced by over $7 billion or nearly 60% compared to the same quarter last year.Our current liquidity position has enabled us to take actions I've just mentioned, to refund and lower the cost of our funding profile. In addition to these actions, we have also increased our securities portfolio, so please turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of the available for sale portfolio securities. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in higher quality and very liquid securities. Government and agency securities in the first four rows of the table comprise over 85% of the portfolio and as a reminder, the other equity holdings are largely Coke stock, Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.During the quarter, we increased our holdings of U.S. Treasury securities to over $5 billion . These securities are held at holding company levels, specifically in anticipation of ultimate TARP repayment upon regulatory approval. The agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio increased by over $3 billion. This increase along with a net gain of roughly $70 million realized during the quarter, represents a continuation of the portfolio repositioning begun at the end of the third quarter and continued in the fourth quarter. Given the growth in the securities portfolio during 2009 and where we are in the rate cycle, let me take a minute to describe how we are thinking about managing this portfolio in 2010. The significant 2009 portfolio growth was driven by two key factors: Strong inflow of deposits and declining loan demand. We expect both of these trends to moderate and potentially reverse course in 2010. And as a result, we do not anticipate continued portfolio growth.That being said, we will continue our strategy of maintaining the vast majority of our portfolio in highly liquid U.S. government and agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. We believe that this approach allows us to generate returns on our excess liquidity while retaining maximum flexibility to respond to changes in the environment.I'll now take a minute to cover the margin on Slide 8. Margin expanded again this quarter, increasing by a better-than-expected 17 basis points to 327. We are very pleased with this result as we were able to reduce deposit pricing more than expected, while at the same time, growing core deposits faster than anticipated. Additionally, increased liquidity from deposit growth, coupled with declining loans, facilitated a reduction in higher cost debt and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.Our current expectation for the margin in the first quarter is for modest compression. The Full quarter impact of holding $5 billion in treasury securities and the first quarter consolidation of Three Pillars, which is our off-balance-sheet conduit, are both expected to have a small negative impact on margin. Additionally, we expect to experience a seasonal decline in deposits. However, even as these items place some downward pressure on margin, we expect continued progress on loan and deposit pricing to partially mitigate the extent of compression.Moving to Slide 9 in provision expense. Tom will cover credit in detail in just a minute, so I'm going to be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was 974 million, down 160 million from the third quarter. Now beginning in the fourth quarter, we have combined the traditional provision for loan losses with the provision for unfunded commitments into a total provision for credit losses. The provision for unfunded commitments was included in other non-interest expense in prior periods. Provision for loan losses actually declined over $200 million versus the third quarter, excluding the provision for unfunded commitment reserves. And this reduction was driven by 185 million or 18% decrease in charge-offs and a slower pace of reserve building. The allowance for loan and lease losses was increased $96 million to $3.1 billion, or 276 as a percentage of loans, while the unfunded commitment reserve increased $57 million to $115 million.Now moving on to non-interest income on Slide 10. Reported non-interest income growth in the quarter was down 4% and up 3% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. After adjustments for a number of items in each quarter, non-interest income declined by 16% and 11%, respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks, securities gains, and impairment and recovery mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market. And as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation.In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are for securities gains of $73 million related to the repositioning of the securities portfolio, I discussed a minute ago, and of $38 million valuation loss on our fair value debt and related hedges. During the third quarter, the loss associated with the fair value debt was $131 million as SunTrust credit spreads continued to improve during both periods. The primary reason for the decline in adjusted non-interest income is increased mortgage repurchase cost, that I'm going to talk about more in detail on the next slide. Excluding this driver produces adjusted growth of 8% on a year-over-year basis and a 5% decline on a sequential quarter basis. The sequential quarter decline was due to lower investment banking and core trading revenue, and lower mortgage production and servicing income. The sequential decline in investment banking revenue was due to lower equity origination and syndicated finance volumes, coming off of a very strong second and third quarter performances. Core trading declined sequentially primarily due to lower revenues from fixed income and equity derivatives. Mortgage production revenue declined sequentially due to a 27% decrease in closed volume and an 11% decrease in application volume. Mortgage servicing revenue declined, given a reduction in the outperformance of our fair value MSR hedge.Now please turn to Slide 11. I'm going to provide more detail on the mortgage repurchase trends. This slide depicts the 2009 trends experienced with mortgage repurchases. Before I get into the details, let me remind you that these loans and reserves are for representation and warranty claims associated with mortgages originated by SunTrust, and then sold to government-sponsored agencies with servicing rights retained by us. Reserves for this repurchased liability are originally established by vintage when the loans are sold, and are accounted for as a reduction in mortgage production income.As credit losses associated with these loans have exceeded the original estimates at the time of sale, we are now reporting higher losses and increasing reserves for loans sold in prior periods. Another thing to note is that while these are called repurchase requests, more often than not, we settle the claim with a make-whole payment to the investor in lieu of actually repurchasing the mortgage. To the extent we do repurchase the loan is reflected in our non-performing loan categories.Now the top left portion of this slide shows the increasing impact on earnings and growth in the reserve during 2009. To the right is a graph that illustrates the underlying reasons for the increased impact, indexing new repurchase requests and the period-end inventory of pending requests to fourth quarter 2008 levels. As you can see, after dipping in the first quarter, new repurchase claims from the agencies have steadily increased. On the other line, you can see that in spite of increasing requests, SunTrust has made significant progress in the second half of 2009 in reducing the backlog of pending requests.Given the rising level of requests, we had more information available to us to use in our analysis, and we have significantly augmented the granularity of our analytics during the second half of 2009. By analyzing the population of sold loans by vintage and product in relation to our recent repurchase experience, we believe that we have increased the precision of the current reserve estimate. In addition, some underlying trends give us reason to be cautiously optimistic about future losses and reserves.Specifically, on the bottom left of this slide, you can see that the vintage of repurchase requests has shifted from older to newer vintage loans. On the right-hand side, you can see that the risk profile of the newer vintages is significantly lower. For example, the original loan-to-value declines with newer production, even as home prices were continuing to decline. This suggests significantly lower loss severity as the repurchase requests shift to newer vintages. Also, in addition to the statistics presented, we tightened credit and underwriting guidelines, added enhanced fraud detection tools and implemented a whole host of process improvements that cause us to believe that the rate of successful requests will decline over time.In conclusion, the increased demand activity has allowed us to re-calibrate and refine the precision of our estimate of incurred losses and as a result, we have more confidence that the reserve should not increase significantly from here. As for charge-offs, fourth request volumes and vintage composition suggest that losses are likely to remain elevated for over at least the next quarter or two. Declining charge-offs and reserves during 2010 are dependent primarily upon a shift in request volume to newer loan vintages, and no significant deterioration in the overall asset quality of all the loans within agency securities.Now turning to Slide 12 for a review of expenses. Non-interest expense declined 8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 2% compared to last quarter. On this slide, we have adjusted for some items that are relatively modest in amount. They are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation. The largest adjustment in the quarter is a net $24 million in debt extinguishment cost, primarily related to the early termination fees associated with home loan bank advances that were repaid during the quarter. These advanced terminations were a component of the steps we took during the quarter to repay wholesale funding and improve margin, due to the strong liquidity position we currently enjoy. Excluding adjustments, expenses are down 10% compared to the same quarter last year and up only 1% compared to last quarter. Now even though these numbers are positive at face value, there are a few items impacting the comparisons that warrant additional explanation and are listed in the lower section of the slide.Now let me explain the schedule. The total year-over-year decrease in adjusted expense is $157 million. As you can see, the sum of the expense items under the expense analysis is a decrease of $181 million and therefore, the expense change net of these items is an increase of $24 million, noted at the very bottom. What this means is that the large decline in expenses is driven by the decrease in credit-related costs associated with fraud and mortgage reinsurance losses, and partially offset by higher FDIC premium and pension expenses. The net of all the remaining expense increases for $24 million was only 1.5% of our adjusted fourth quarter 2008 base. The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is similar, with declines in other real estate expense and unfunded commitment reserves, partially offset by increased FDIC premiums. The remaining sequential quarter increase in expenses is largely due to personnel and marketing expenses. Personnel expenses increased for incentive compensation, primarily related to improved performance in certain businesses as headcount remained relatively constant. Advertising and marketing expense was also stepped up in support of our client acquisition and retention efforts.So let me sum up the company's financial results during the fourth quarter. SunTrust capital ratios and liquidity position improved. Our deposit levels increased and the mix was further enhanced, and net interest margin expanded. Provision expense declined on lower charge-offs and a smaller addition to the reserve. However, the operating environment continues to be challenging for revenue and cyclical expenses. Loan demand remains weak and certain fee income categories continue be soft while expenses associated with asset quality continue to weigh on performance.It goes without saying that 2009 was a difficult year. However, while the pace and strength of the economic recovery remains uncertain, we are encouraged by emerging asset quality trends and by elements within our operating performance. And as such, we are looking forward to improving financial results in 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."
305901,83242998,46561,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2010",2010-01-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. This morning, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 13. As Jim mentioned earlier in the call, we noted some asset quality stabilization this quarter. Short-term delinquencies, 90-day plus delinquencies and charge-offs a",2048,"Thank you, Mark. This morning, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 13. As Jim mentioned earlier in the call, we noted some asset quality stabilization this quarter. Short-term delinquencies, 90-day plus delinquencies and charge-offs all continued to decline, along with entrance into the foreclosure queues. Non-performing assets remained flat for the quarter. This is notable as of fourth quarter, particularly for consumers who seasonally expected to show increases in default and delinquencies. In fact, charge-offs declined in every category with the sole exception of construction, where we continue to make progress in the workout of our residential construction book. Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio review of asset quality illustrates our fourth quarter improvement in both charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies. While trends showed improvement, absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real-estate-related portfolios, including residential mortgages, home equity products and residential construction. The commercial portfolio continues to perform reasonably well, overall. Commercial loan charge-offs, early stage delinquency and non-performing loans all declined in the quarter.We continue to see some stress in more cyclically-sensitive industries on our small business portfolio, with improvement in large corporate. We expect that we could continue to see variability in asset quality in the C&I portfolio from quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of the investment rate portfolio. The commercial real estate portfolio, including owner-occupied and income-producing properties has performed satisfactorily, overall. The charge-off ratio in the quarter declined to single-digit basis points where it was during the first half of the year, while early stage delinquency improved slightly. As a reminder, the majority of charge-offs last quarter related to one loan secured by an owner-occupied property to a manufacturer supplying the auto industry. Non-performing commercial real estate loan increased in the quarter to just under $400 million or 2.6% of the portfolio. The increase incurred in a variety of property types including office and hotel. Additionally, all of the increase was from smaller loans with the largest being $7 million.Given conditions in the commercial real estate market, we expect stress and credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also expect it to perform relatively well given its composition and underwrite. We continue to monitor this portfolio closely and are proactively working with clients to strengthen loan structures and to address future maternity is less appropriate.Asset quality in the consumer portfolio has held up well in the quarter, especially given that the fourth quarter is a typically seasonally weak time of the year. Charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies were stable to declining in almost all of our non-residential secured consumer portfolios. The only exception was in the consumer direct portfolio, which is largely comprised of federally-guaranteed or privately-insured loans that caused the increase. Excluding student loans, the early stage delinquency ratio for the consumer direct portfolio was 107 basis points.I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now, I will summarize. Home equity performance improved slightly as charge-offs declined, while early-stage delinquency rolled back to the second quarter level. Charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio dropped 14% on declining frequency and stable severity, while early-stage delinquencies continued to decline. Construction charge-offs trended up again after nearly doubling in the fourth quarter, as we continue to aggressively work through the problem credits in our residential construction portfolio.Next, I'm going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail, beginning with the residential portfolio on Slide 15.The residential mortgage portfolio continued to show signs of stabilization during the fourth quarter, although on an absolute basis, this portfolio continues to perform poorly. Annualized charge-offs in the fourth quarter were 4.4% and non-accrual loans continue to increase. However, charge-offs declined in the quarter. Non-accruals increased at a slower pace and 60-day plus delinquencies remained stable.The trends we've noted in past quarters continued this quarter. Specifically, Florida-based loans comprised roughly a third of the portfolio and contribute to well over half of the asset quality issuance. Also, balances in most of the higher-risk portfolios continue to run off.Overall, deterioration continued to slow, with fourth quarter results augmenting last quarter's perspective that asset quality may be stabilizing, at least from a frequency perspective. However, we continue to expect sustained softness in jobs across our markets and weakness in home values, particularly in Florida. These expectations suggest that loss severities may increase, while frequency of loss declines. Our outlook for charge-offs in this portfolio is in expectation that the level of charge-offs will remain elevated for at least the next two quarters and may increase depending upon home-price stability and unemployment levels.Moving to home equity lines on Slide 16. Over two-thirds of the home-equity line portfolio, the core portfolio is performing relatively well. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by the highest-risk 30% of the portfolio: Third-party originated, Florida and higher loan-to-value in general. These higher-risk segments continued to decline as  there ain't [ph] run-off with little line availability and no new production. Overall, this portfolio displayed stable or better asset metrics for all segments. However, this continues to be a portfolio on distress, and we believe losses will remain elevated, at least in the short run.Now if you will turn to Slide 17, I will talk about our construction portfolio. As expected in continuing a multi-quarter's trend, balances declined by 10% again this quarter to $6.6 billion or 6% of our total loan portfolio. Construction perm loan portfolio balances and non-performers continued to wind down as new production remained minimal and workouts continued on the non-performers. Residential builder charge-offs increased again this quarter, as we continued to manage the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. As a result, non-performing loans declined somewhat again this quarter. Perhaps more importantly, 30-days-plus delinquency declined significantly again this quarter. This means that the inflow of new problem loans declined and as further evidence of progress in resolving the risk in the residential builder portfolio.At this point, we believe that the residential builder portfolio, non-performing loans are at or near their peak. The vast majority of the problem loans in the portfolio been identified and are in the workout process. We expect that related charge-offs will remain elevated but declining over the next two or three quarters. Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined, charge-offs and non-performers increased modestly, and delinquency declined significantly in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 18 for an update on allowance to non-performing loans.  While non-performing loan levels are not an input into our allowance process, the ratio of allowance to non-performers is a commonly-used metric in assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. We provide this disclosure again this quarter as our coverage ratio is below some other banks. This is due to our asset quality issues being skewed towards consumer loans affected [ph] by residential real estate in the judicial foreclosure state of Florida. Given the extended time lines to be foreclosed in Florida, on average, 18 to 24 months, we expect that our NPL levels will remain elevated throughout 2010. As a reminder, this slide incorporates the analysis of residential mortgage NPLs that is included in the appendix of today's presentation into a framework that includes our FAS 114 reserves. The result of this analysis is that our allowance coverage of non-performing loans increases from 59% to 113% when you factor in the impact of mortgages that have been through the write-down process and loans with specific reserves. The base coverage ratio has improved each of the last two quarters.A table of the FAS 114 reserves for commercial loans via business segment is also included on this slide. We've included this detail to provide you some perspective on the level of specific reserves and implied severities on our larger impaired loans. While overall implied severity varies by business segment, the average is 34%.Please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting troubled-debt restructures or TDRs. First, I'd like to note that 97% of these TDRs are first and second-lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, not commercial or commercial real estate loans. Also, as a reminder from last quarter, we are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that a modification will allow the client to continue to remain in their home. When there has been a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we are strongly encouraging short sales and even [indiscernible] arrangements and relocation to more affordable housing.Dollar growth and total TDRs in the fourth quarter was roughly equivalent for the growth in the third quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, accruing TDRs totaled $1.6 billion, up $330 million or 22% for the third quarter. Non-accruing TDRs were $913 million, up $236 million or 35% from the third quarter. While three-fourths of the growth in TDRs last quarter was accruing TDRs, this quarter, 45% of the increase was in the accruing category.We've chosen to provide more detail on our modification efforts and results this quarter, so please turn to Slide 20 for more on this topic. The table on this slide shows that 70% of our TDRs are current, an additional 14% on early-stage delinquency. Note that accruing TDRs consist of TDRs where the account was accruing at the time of the modification or where the account was non-accruing at the time of the modification and the account has completed its secure period. New mortgage and consumer TDRs during the fourth quarter totaled roughly $545 million, of which 55% were for seriously delinquent loans in non-accrual status. These TDRs will continue to be reported as non-accruing until they go through a six-month secure period.22% of modifications in the quarter were for clients who are current on principal and interest payments, while the remaining accounts were in early-stage delinquency. In the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our new mortgaged TDRs included both reduced rates and term extensions.The final discussion point on this topic relates to the requirement to establish specific FAS 114 reserves for TDRs. Our FAS 114 reserves at 12/31 for TDRs was $343 million. In addition, we have already recorded $140 million in charge-offs on the non-accruing TDRs, and also have $86 million mark-to-market adjustment on TDRs credited for a value. The sum of these amounts is already run through the income statement and equates to 20% of the original balance of all TDRs and nearly 75% of the non-current TDR balances. With this level of reserves and write-down on a largely current portfolio that is predominantly first-lien residential real estate, we believe the potential for future incremental loss is low.I'll summarize the key points from various credit update before turning this call back over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 21. Overall, asset quality is beginning to stabilize, albeit at relatively high levels of non-performing loans and charge-offs. During the quarter, net charge-offs, non-performing loans and early-stage delinquencies all declined. Improvement in charge-offs and delinquencies were broad-based among the portfolios. The allowance for loan losses increased to $3.1 billion or 2.76% of loans. We continued to work through the risk inherent in the residential mortgage, home equity and builder portfolios. We're making progress on these higher-risk portfolios as balances decline and asset quality metrics stabilize. Our view of allowance coverage of non-performing loans continued to improve as the level of non-performing loans was stable while the allowance increased.Pace of mortgage modifications continued in the fourth quarter, and at the end of the quarter, over two-thirds of the modified loans were current or principal in interest. Although fourth quarter charge-offs came in at the low end of our loss forecast, our overall outlook for credit losses remains consistent with the view expressed last quarter. But the current time, we expect charge-offs to increase in the first quarter from the fourth quarter levels, but we do not expect it to reach third quarter 2009 levels. Further, we believe charge-offs will vary around this level in the second quarter, with the possibility that improvement will begin at some point in the second half of 2010, depending upon the strength and pace of economic recovery. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

As has been the case for several quarters now, our results were affected by the challenging economic environment. We reported a $0.64 per share loss for the fourth quarter, and a $3.98 loss for the full year. As you would expect in this type of operating environment, revenue was soft, loan demand was down and asset quality was weak. So like last quarter, there were certain positive operating trends. The most notable positive in the fourth quarter was an improved credit trends from the prior quarter. Both credit losses in early-stage delinquencies declined and non-performing loans were stable. Further, deposit growth and the positive mixed shift continue. The net interest margin significantly expanded in certain businesses, delivered very solid revenue growth.Now before we provide detail on the results, I want to point out that our optimism is certainly tempered in doing those positive trends especially those related to credit. The economy remains far from strong and there is more uncertainty than clarity in the outlook. And as I've said before, the beginning of a recovery is just at its beginning. History tells us that it will take some time before economic stabilization meaningfully translates in the bottom-line results. Asset quality revenues and ultimately, earnings improvement will need time to gain traction. And that timing is largely dependent on the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery.Now taking a closer look at the overall results. Revenue remained soft with stable net interest income and a small increase in non-interest income over the same quarter last year. Unchanged net interest income was a result of a significantly improved net interest margin, which was offset by the reduction in average earning assets. An increase in client deposits, improved mix and lower rates paid, enabled a reduction in higher cost sources of funding, and pushed the margin higher while loans and earning assets declined more rapidly, offsetting that benefit.What we're seeing is that sustained economic weakness has reduced demand for loans as clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction. And many have also accessed the debt markets in lieu of bank loans. Additionally, overall fee revenue remains cyclically soft. Reduced consumer spending was evident in the decline in many fee-related sources of income throughout the year. Though, as I mentioned, there were selected positive trends that emerged. For instance, investment banking income improved significantly over 2008 to a record level. Capital markets activity was higher in 2009 and as the year progressed, our numbers reflected the improved operating environment for our Corporate and Investment Banking businesses.In Commercial banking, we've been able to improve loan spreads despite the fact that the appetite for loans has been weak during the recession. Further, while deposit growth was cyclical in the industry-wide, there are strong indications that a part of the increase was SunTrust-specific. We are improving client satisfaction in getting to the drivers that build loyalty by understanding individual preferences and aligning our business models to respond. As a result, we've increased client satisfaction and it showed up in our deposit numbers in 2009. This reflects favorably on the tremendous effort being put forth by our team to improve client retention and acquisition capabilities. The results of disciplined expense management was evident again across controllable operating expenses this quarter. As you've heard me emphasize before, we continue to capitalize upon the strength we have built in this area, and we remain focused on continuously uncovering efficiency and improvement opportunities. Cyclical costs including other real estate, FDIC, pension and credit and collection costs remain high. On the asset quality front, we are quite pleased with the lower charge-offs and improved metrics, generally. However, as I alluded to earlier, we're not ready to declare a victory. In fact, we believe charge-offs will increase modestly the next quarter. Tom Freeman will provide more commentary on credit expectations later on.What it all comes down to is that although some things, notably the economic and regulatory environment are ultimately out of our control, I believe we are doing a very good job of controlling the things that we can control. We are laser focused on improved credit- and risk-related results. At the same time, we are also acutely focused on the client on improving service quality and frontline execution while controlling the expenses and managing risk. The positive results of our efforts are reflected in various aspects of our core performance over the last few quarters. Our continued success in these areas will permit us to deliver steadily improving results as the credit operating environment improves.Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to talk a little bit about our capital position before turning the call over to Mark. Slide 4 illustrates our significant capital position and our book value per share. We maintain a solid capital position with an estimated Tier 1 common ratio of 7.65%, and a Tier 1 ratio of 12.90%. Capital ratio has increased as the decline in risk-weighted assets more than offset the reduction of capital due to the earnings loss in the fourth quarter. We continue to have substantial liquidity as the aforementioned inflow of deposits have been largely retained in cash and investment in high quality government-backed securities. Book value was $35.29 and tangible common was $22.59 at the close of the year. A final note on capital, given a 9.5% Tier 1 ratio excluding TARP and our current capital and liquidity, we are well positioned to repay TARP when regulatory approval is received. I'll conclude by underscoring a point that is as true today as it has been throughout 2009. SunTrust continues to operate from a position of strength and we are focused on growing revenue, improving expense efficiency, increasing the profitability of the balance sheet, investing for the future and prudently managing credit.Our strong foundation coupled with our client-focused execution, broad risk mitigation capabilities and the long-term economic prospects of our markets, all position us to deliver improving financial performance as we move beyond this cycle. Now I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark?"

I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, with the summary income statement.  For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $316 million, or $0.64 per share. As has been t",2784,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, with the summary income statement.  For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $316 million, or $0.64 per share. As has been the case in recent quarters, our financial results continue to be dominated by credit losses. Cyclically sensitive expenses and, to a lesser extent, soft revenue generation in certain units. In particular for the quarter, loan demand remained weak and mortgage production income was negatively impacted by the costs associated with the potential repurchase of mortgage loans originated and sold to government agencies in prior periods. On the other hand, there are some positive operating trends that I will also point out. Most notably is the decline in provision, primarily driven by lower charge-offs. Additionally, margin and net interest income increased as the deposit mix continue to improve while core client deposits grew. I'll cover this quarter's results in more detail in just a minute.For the full year 2009, the loss of common shareholders was $3.98 per share, and $2.34 per share if you exclude the impact of $750 million in goodwill impairment reported in the first quarter. In addition to the impact of goodwill impairment on expenses, there were several areas driving a net loss in 2009 compared to a profit in 2008. The biggest impact, of course, was credit quality. Provision for credit losses increased by $1.6 billion as charge-offs roughly doubled to $3.2 billion, and we increased the allowance for loan losses by one-third to $3.1 billion. Non-interest income declined by $760 million compared to 2008's level and while overall fee generation was somewhat impacted by recessionary pressures, the decline was largely due to the absence of gains associated with the Coke stock transactions that were completed during 2008.The final item of note is the full year cost of dividends on the TARP preferred securities, which increased to $266 million. So with that brief summary of 2009, I'll now provide more detail on the fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 6 with the balance sheet summary. Overall, average loan balances excluding non-accruals declined 4% and 12% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. Decline in balances in our higher-risk categories continued, but we also experienced a decline in certain of our higher quality categories. On the higher risk side, construction balances continued their rapid decline, down another 12% in the current quarter, and down 47% compared to last year. The residential mortgage and home equity line portfolios also continued their downward trend.On the higher quality side, commercial and industrial loans declined 8% sequentially and are down 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This reduction resulted primarily from a continued trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid-sized and larger corporate clients, due to lower working capital needs and enhanced access to the capital markets during the quarter, which resulted in loan pay downs. However, the pace of decline did slow during the quarter. And In the financial tables we've published today, you can see evidence of this in the roughly equal year end and fourth quarter average balance figures. And in the lower period and sequential quarter decline of 3% versus the 8% on average. While we are pleased that the pace of decline slowed, it is too early to tell whether or not this trend will be sustained as we move into the first quarter of 2010.Now relative to loan volumes, please note that we expect an increase of approximately $2 billion in loans and loans held for sale, as a result of implementing FAS 167 in the first quarter. This consolidation is expected to have minimal impact on capital ratios and net interest margin, and there is a slide in the appendix that provides some additional information on this topic for your review.Now moving on to deposits at the bottom of the slide, where you can see that lower-cost deposits continued to grow while higher-cost deposits continued to shrink. We noted last quarter that the pace of growth in deposits had moderated. While growth picked back up this quarter, it is primarily a seasonal increase. Nonetheless, overall average consumer and commercial deposits increased 2% sequentially this quarter and remained up 14% on a year-over-year basis.While maintaining competitive pricing in our markets, CD balances declined in the quarter as we have continued to carefully manage the trade-off between price and volume given our increased liquidity position. Finally, while there wasn't much change on a sequential quarter basis, please note that brokered and foreign deposits have been reduced by over $7 billion or nearly 60% compared to the same quarter last year.Our current liquidity position has enabled us to take actions I've just mentioned, to refund and lower the cost of our funding profile. In addition to these actions, we have also increased our securities portfolio, so please turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of the available for sale portfolio securities. The portfolio continues to be concentrated in higher quality and very liquid securities. Government and agency securities in the first four rows of the table comprise over 85% of the portfolio. And as a reminder, the other equity holdings are largely Coke stock, Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.During the quarter, we increased our holdings of U.S. Treasury securities to over $5 billion. These securities are held at the holding company levels, specifically in anticipation of ultimate TARP repayment upon regulatory approval. The agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio increased by over $3 billion. This increase, along with a net gain of roughly $70 million realized during the quarter, represents a continuation of the portfolio repositioning begun at the end of the third quarter and continued in the fourth quarter. Given the growth in the securities portfolio during 2009 and where we are in the rate cycle, let me take a minute to describe how we are thinking about managing this portfolio in 2010. The significant 2009 portfolio growth was driven by two key factors: Strong inflow of deposits and declining loan demand. We expect both of these trends to moderate and potentially reverse course in 2010. And as a result, we do not anticipate continued portfolio growth.That being said, we will continue our strategy of maintaining the vast majority of our portfolio in highly liquid U.S. government and agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. We believe that this approach allows us to generate returns on our excess liquidity, while retaining maximum flexibility to respond to changes in the environment.I'll now take a minute to cover the margin on Slide 8. Margin expanded again this quarter, increasing by a better-than-expected 17 basis points to 3.27%. We are very pleased with this result as we were able to reduce deposit pricing more than expected, while at the same time growing core deposits faster than anticipated. Additionally, increased liquidity from deposit growth, coupled with declining loans, facilitated a reduction in higher cost debt and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.Our current expectation for the margin in the first quarter is for modest compression. The full quarter impact of holding $5 billion in treasury securities and the first quarter consolidation of Three Pillars, which is our off-balance sheet conduit, are both expected to have a small negative impact on margin. Additionally, we expect to experience a seasonal decline in deposits. However, even as these items place some downward pressure on margin, we expect continued progress on loan and deposit pricing to partially mitigate the extent of compression.Moving to Slide 9 in provision expense. Tom will cover credit in detail in just a minute, so I'm going to be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $974 million, down $160 million from the third quarter. Now beginning in the fourth quarter, we have combined the traditional provision for loan losses with the provision for unfunded commitments into a total provision for credit losses. The provision for unfunded commitments was included in other non-interest expense in prior periods. Provision for loan losses actually declined over $200 million versus the third quarter, excluding the provision for unfunded commitment reserves. And then this reduction was driven by $185 million or 18% decrease in charge-offs and a slower pace of reserve building. The allowance for loan and lease losses was increased $96 million to $3.1 billion, or 2.76% as a percentage of loans, while the unfunded commitment reserve increased $57 million to $115 million.Now moving on to non-interest income on Slide 10. Reported non-interest income growth in the quarter was down 4% and up 3% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. After adjustments for a number of items in each quarter, non-interest income declined by 16% and 11%, respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks, securities gains, and impairment and recovery of mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market. And as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation.In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are for securities gains of $73 million related to the repositioning of the securities portfolio, I discussed a minute ago, and a $38 million valuation loss on our fair value debt and related hedges. During the third quarter, the loss associated with the fair value debt was $131 million as SunTrust credit spreads continued to improve during both periods. The primary reason for the decline in adjusted non-interest income is increased mortgage repurchase cost. I'm going to talk about more in detail on the next slide. Excluding this driver, produces adjusted growth of 8% on a year-over-year basis and a 5% decline on a sequential quarter basis. The sequential quarter decline was due to lower investment banking and core trading revenue and lower mortgage production and servicing income. The sequential decline in investment banking revenue was due to lower equity origination and syndicated finance volumes, coming off of a very strong second and third quarter performances. Core trading declined sequentially primarily due to lower revenues from fixed income and equity derivatives. Mortgage production revenue declined sequentially due to a 27% decrease in closed volume and an 11% decrease in application volume. Mortgage servicing revenue declined, given a reduction in the outperformance of our fair value MSR hedge.Now please turn to Slide 11. I'm going to provide more detail on the mortgage repurchase trends. This slide depicts the 2009 trends experienced with mortgage repurchases. Before I get into the details, let me remind you that these loans and reserves are for representation and warranty claims associated with mortgages originated by SunTrust and then sold to government-sponsored agencies with servicing rights retained by us. Reserves for this repurchased liability are originally established via vintage when the loans are sold and are accounted for as a reduction in mortgage production income.As credit losses associated with these loans have exceeded the original estimates at the time of sale, we are now recording higher losses and increasing reserves for loans sold in prior periods. Another thing to note is that while these are called repurchase requests, more often than not, we settle the claim with a make-whole payment to the investor in lieu of actually repurchasing the mortgage. To the extent we do repurchase the loan is reflected in our non-performing loan categories.Now the top left portion of this slide shows the increasing impact on earnings and growth in the reserve during 2009. To the right is a graph that illustrates the underlying reasons for the increased impact, indexing new repurchase requests and the period-end inventory of pending requests to fourth quarter 2008 levels. As you can see, after dipping in the first quarter, new repurchase claims from the agencies have steadily increased. On the other line, you can see that in spite of increasing requests, SunTrust has made significant progress in the second half of 2009 in reducing the backlog of pending requests.Given the rising level of requests, we had more information available to us to use in our analysis, and we have significantly augmented the granularity of our analytics during the second half of 2009. By analyzing the population of sold loans by vintage and product in relation to our recent repurchase experience, we believe that we have increased the precision of the current reserve estimate. In addition, some underlying trends give us reason to be cautiously optimistic about future losses and reserves.Specifically, on the bottom left of this slide, you can see that the vintage of repurchase requests has shifted from older to newer vintage loans. On the right-hand side, you can see that the risk profile of the newer vintages is significantly lower. For example, the original loan-to-value declines with newer production, even as home prices were continuing to decline. This suggests significantly lower loss severity as the repurchase requests shift to newer vintages. Also, in addition to the statistics presented, we tightened credit and underwriting guidelines, added enhanced fraud detection tools and implemented a whole host of process improvements that cause us to believe that the rate of successful requests will decline over time.In conclusion, the increased demand activity has allowed us to re-calibrate and refine the precision of our estimate of incurred losses and, as a result, we have more confidence that the reserve should not increase significantly from here. As for charge-offs, fourth quarter request volumes and vintage composition suggest that losses are likely to remain elevated for over at least the next quarter or two. Declining charge-offs and reserves during 2010 are dependent primarily upon a shift in request volume to newer loan vintages, and no significant deterioration in the overall asset quality of all loans within agency securities.Now turning to Slide 12 for a review of expenses. Non-interest expense declined 8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 2% compared to last quarter. On this slide, we have adjusted for some items that are relatively modest in amount. They are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation. The largest adjustment in the quarter is a net $24 million in debt extinguishment cost, primarily related to the early termination fees associated with home loan bank advances that were repaid during the quarter. These advanced terminations were a component of the steps we took during the quarter to repay wholesale funding and improve margin, due to the strong liquidity position we currently enjoy. Excluding adjustments, expenses are down 10% compared to the same quarter last year and up only 1% compared to last quarter. Now even though these numbers are positive at face value, there are a few items impacting the comparisons that warrant additional explanation and are listed in the lower section of the slide.Now let me explain the schedule. The total year-over-year decrease in adjusted expense is $157 million. As you can see, the sum of the expense items under the expense analysis is a decrease of $181 million and therefore, the expense change net of these items is an increase of $24 million, noted at the very bottom. What this means is that the large decline in expenses is driven by the decrease in credit-related costs associated with fraud and mortgage reinsurance losses, and partially offset by higher FDIC premium and pension expenses. The net of all the remaining expense increases for $24 million was only 1.5% of our adjusted fourth quarter 2008 base. The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is similar, with declines in other real estate expense and unfunded commitment reserves, partially offset by increased FDIC premiums. The remaining sequential quarter increase in expenses is largely due to personnel and marketing expenses. Personnel expenses increased for incentive compensation, primarily related to improved performance in certain businesses as headcount remained relatively constant. Advertising and marketing expense was also stepped up in support of our client acquisition and retention efforts.So let me sum up the company's financial results during the fourth quarter. SunTrust capital ratios and liquidity position improved. Our deposit levels increased and the mix was further enhanced, and net interest margin expanded. Provision expense declined on lower charge-offs and a smaller addition to the reserve. However, the operating environment continues to be challenging for revenue and cyclical expenses. Loan demand remains weak and certain fee income categories continue be soft while expenses associated with asset quality continue to weigh on performance.It goes without saying that 2009 was a difficult year. However, while the pace and strength of the economic recovery remains uncertain, we are encouraged by emerging asset quality trends and by elements within our operating performance. And as such, we are looking forward to improving financial results in 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."

This morning I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 13. As Jim mentioned earlier in the call, we noted some asset quality stabilization this quarter.

As Jim mentioned earlier in the call, we noted some asset quality stabilization this quarter. Short-term delinquencies, 90-day plus delinquencies and charge-offs all continued to decline, along with entrance into the foreclosure queues. Non-performing assets remained flat for the quarter. This is notable as of fourth quarter, particularly for consumers who seasonally expected to show increases in default and delinquencies. In fact, charge-offs declined in every category with the sole exception of construction, where we continue to make progress in the workout of our residential construction book. Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio review of asset quality illustrates our fourth quarter improvement in both charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies. While trends showed improvement, absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real-estate-related portfolios, including residential mortgages, home equity products and residential construction. The commercial portfolio continues to perform reasonably well, overall. Commercial loan charge-offs, early stage delinquency and non-performing loans all declined in the quarter.We continue to see some stress in more cyclically-sensitive industries on our small business portfolio, with improvement in large corporate. We expect that we could continue to see variability in asset quality in the C&I portfolio from quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of the investment rate portfolio. The commercial real estate portfolio, including owner-occupied and income-producing properties has performed satisfactorily, overall. The charge-off ratio in the quarter declined to single-digit basis points where it was during the first half of the year, while early stage delinquency improved slightly. As a reminder, the majority of charge-offs last quarter related to one loan secured by an owner-occupied property to a manufacturer supplying the auto industry. Non-performing commercial real estate loan increased in the quarter to just under $400 million or 2.6% of the portfolio. The increase incurred in a variety of property types including office and hotel. Additionally, all of the increase was from smaller loans with the largest being $7 million.Given conditions in the commercial real estate market, we expect stress and credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also expect it to perform relatively well given its composition and underwrite. We continue to monitor this portfolio closely and are proactively working with clients to strengthen loan structures and to address future maternity is less appropriate.Asset quality in the consumer portfolio has held up well in the quarter, especially given that the fourth quarter is a typically seasonally weak time of the year. Charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies were stable to declining in almost all of our non-residential secured consumer portfolios. The only exception was in the consumer direct portfolio, which is largely comprised of federally-guaranteed or privately-insured loans that caused the increase. Excluding student loans, the early stage delinquency ratio for the consumer direct portfolio was 107 basis points.I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now, I will summarize. Home equity performance improved slightly as charge-offs declined, while early-stage delinquency rolled back to the second quarter level. Charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio dropped 14% on declining frequency and stable severity, while early-stage delinquencies continued to decline. Construction charge-offs trended up again after nearly doubling in the fourth quarter, as we continue to aggressively work through the problem credits in our residential construction portfolio.Next, I'm going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail, beginning with the residential portfolio on Slide 15. The residential mortgage portfolio continued to show signs of stabilization during the fourth quarter, although on an absolute basis, this portfolio continues to perform poorly. Annualized charge-offs in the fourth quarter were 4.4% and non-accrual loans continue to increase. However, charge-offs declined in the quarter. Non-accruals increased at a slower pace and 60-day plus delinquencies remained stable.The trends we've noted in past quarters continued this quarter. Specifically, Florida-based loans comprised roughly a third of the portfolio and contribute to well over half of the asset quality issuance. Also, balances in most of the higher-risk portfolios continue to run off.Overall, deterioration continued to slow, with fourth quarter results augmenting last quarter's perspective that asset quality may be stabilizing, at least from a frequency perspective. However, we continue to expect sustained softness in jobs across our markets and weakness in home values, particularly in Florida. These expectations suggest that loss severities may increase, while frequency of loss declines. Our outlook for charge-offs in this portfolio is in expectation that the level of charge-offs will remain elevated for at least the next two quarters and may increase depending upon home-price stability and unemployment levels.Moving to home equity lines on Slide 16. Over two-thirds of the home-equity line portfolio, the core portfolio is performing relatively well. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by the highest-risk 30% of the portfolio: Third-party originated, Florida and higher loan-to-value in general. These higher-risk segments continued to decline as they're in run-off with little line availability and no new production. Overall, this portfolio displayed stable or better asset metrics for all segments. However, this continues to be a portfolio on distress, and we believe losses will remain elevated, at least in the short run.Now if you will turn to Slide 17, I will talk about our construction portfolio. As expected in continuing a multi-quarter's trend, balances declined by 10% again this quarter to $6.6 billion or 6% of our total loan portfolio. Construction perm loan portfolio balances and non-performers continued to wind down as new production remained minimal and workouts continued on the non-performers. Residential builder charge-offs increased again this quarter, as we continued to manage the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. As a result, non-performing loans declined somewhat again this quarter. Perhaps more importantly, 30-days-plus delinquency declined significantly again this quarter. This means that the inflow of new problem loans declined and as further evidence of progress in resolving the risk in the residential builder portfolio.At this point, we believe that the residential builder portfolio, non-performing loans are at or near their peak. The vast majority of the problem loans in the portfolio been identified and are in the workout process. We expect that related charge-offs will remain elevated but declining over the next two or three quarters. Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined, charge-offs and non-performers increased modestly, and delinquency declined significantly in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 18 for an update on allowance to non-performing loans. While non-performing loan levels are not an input into our allowance process, the ratio of allowance to non-performers is a commonly-used metric in assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. We provide this disclosure again this quarter as our coverage ratio is below some other banks. This is due to our asset quality issues being skewed towards consumer loans secured by residential real estate in the judicial foreclosure state of Florida. Given the extended time lines to be foreclosed in Florida, on average, 18 to 24 months, we expect that our NPL levels will remain elevated throughout 2010. As a reminder, this slide incorporates the analysis of residential mortgage NPLs that is included in the appendix of today's presentation into a framework that includes our FAS 114 reserves. The result of this analysis is that our allowance coverage of non-performing loans increases from 59% to 113% when you factor in the impact of mortgages that have been through the write-down process and loans with specific reserves. The base coverage ratio has improved each of the last two quarters.A table of the FAS 114 reserves for commercial loans via business segment is also included on this slide. We've included this detail to provide you some perspective on the level of specific reserves and implied severities on our larger impaired loans. While overall implied severity varies by business segment, the average is 34%.Please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting troubled-debt restructures or TDRs. First, I'd like to note that 97% of these TDRs are first and second-lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, not commercial or commercial real estate loans. Also, as a reminder from last quarter, we are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that a modification will allow the client to continue to remain in their home. When there has been a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we are strongly encouraging short sales and even [indiscernible] arrangements and relocation to more affordable housing.Dollar growth and total TDRs in the fourth quarter was roughly equivalent for the growth in the third quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, accruing TDRs totaled $1.6 billion, up $330 million or 22% for the third quarter. Non-accruing TDRs were $913 million, up $236 million or 35% from the third quarter. While three-fourths of the growth in TDRs last quarter was accruing TDRs, this quarter, 45% of the increase was in the accruing category.We've chosen to provide more detail on our modification efforts and results this quarter, so please turn to Slide 20 for more on this topic. The table on this slide shows that 70% of our TDRs are current, an additional 14% on early-stage delinquency. Note that accruing TDRs consist of TDRs where the account was accruing at the time of the modification or where the account was non-accruing at the time of the modification and the account has completed its secure period. New mortgage and consumer TDRs during the fourth quarter totaled roughly $545 million, of which 55% were for seriously delinquent loans in non-accrual status. These TDRs will continue to be reported as non-accruing until they go through a six-month secure period.22% of modifications in the quarter were for clients who are current on principal and interest payments, while the remaining accounts were in early-stage delinquency. In the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our new mortgaged TDRs included both reduced rates and term extensions.The final discussion point on this topic relates to the requirement to establish specific FAS 114 reserves for TDRs. Our FAS 114 reserves at 12/31 for TDRs was $343 million. In addition, we have already recorded $140 million in charge-offs on the non-accruing TDRs, and also have $86 million mark-to-market adjustment on TDRs credited for a value. The sum of these amounts is already run through the income statement and equates to 20% of the original balance of all TDRs and nearly 75% of the non-current TDR balances. With this level of reserves and write-down on a largely current portfolio that is predominantly first-lien residential real estate, we believe the potential for future incremental loss is low.I'll summarize the key points from various credit update before turning this call back over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 21. Overall, asset quality is beginning to stabilize, albeit at relatively high levels of non-performing loans and charge-offs. During the quarter, net charge-offs, non-performing loans and early-stage delinquencies all declined. Improvements in charge-offs and delinquencies were broad-based among the portfolios. The allowance for loan losses increased to $3.1 billion or 2.76% of loans. We continue to work through the risk inherent in the residential mortgage, home equity and builder portfolios. We're making progress on these higher-risk portfolios as balances decline and asset quality metrics stabilize. Our view of allowance coverage of non-performing loans continued to improve as the level of non-performing loans was stable while the allowance increased.Pace of mortgage modifications continued in the fourth quarter. And at the end of the quarter, over two-thirds of the modified loans were current or principal in interest. Although fourth quarter charge-offs came in at the low end of our loss forecast, our overall outlook for credit losses remains consistent with the view expressed last quarter. But the current time, we expect charge-offs to increase in the first quarter from the fourth quarter levels, but we do not expect it to reach third quarter 2009 levels. Further, we believe charge-offs will vary around this level in the second quarter, with the possibility that improvement will begin at some point in the second half of 2010, depending upon the strength and pace of economic recovery. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

Glad you are with us this morning. Our first quarter results improved to a loss of $0.46 versus a loss of $0.64 last quarter as earnings continued to be impacted by elevated credit costs. While overall home price depreciation slo",904,"Good morning, everyone. Glad you are with us this morning. Our first quarter results improved to a loss of $0.46 versus a loss of $0.64 last quarter as earnings continued to be impacted by elevated credit costs. 
While overall home price depreciation slowed uncertainty remains around the direction of future home prices, especially in certain markets. Revenue remains soft driven by a decline in mortgage production volume coupled with mark to market losses on our fair value, publically held debt. Also, loan demand has yet to pick up as clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction and have accessed the debt markets in lieu of bank loans. 
However, as the economy has shown signs of improvement and so have our results. The most notable sign of improvement was in asset quality which resulted in the significant decrease in credit related costs compared to last quarter. Charge offs remain stable compared to the fourth quarter though if you exclude the actions that Tom Freeman will detail later in the call charge offs would have declined sequentially. Additionally, nonperforming assets, the allowance for loan losses and 90 plus delinquencies were all stable quarter to quarter while provision expense for nonperforming loans and early stage delinquencies all decreased. 
We believe this marks a continuation of improved asset quality trends as the improvements in charge offs and delinquencies were broad based among the portfolios and we experienced the second sequential quarter of overall positive asset quality metrics. In addition the apparent beginning of economic improvement, our client focused strategies, lower cost deposit mix and expense management discipline also contributed to encouraging operating trends. 
Favorable deposit mix trends continued this quarter with growth in money market balances and a decrease in higher cost time deposits. After an extended period of growth consumer and commercial deposits were stable, a trend one would expect with economic improvement. However, we are improving client satisfaction in getting to the drivers that build loyalty by understanding individual preferences and aligning our business model to respond in a fashion that is improving client satisfaction and retention. 
The net interest margin increased due largely to our ability to shift our funding mix to lower cost deposits and to improve loan pricing. Stable client deposits and improved mix enabled the reduction in higher cost sources of funding and that, along with lower rates paid, pushed the margin higher. The result of disciplined expense management was evident across controlling operating expenses again this quarter. We continue to capitalize on the strength we have built and remain focused on continually covering efficiency improvement opportunities. And those cycle costs including other real estate and credit and collection costs are collectively high they are down significantly from the prior quarter as from the same quarter of last year. 
What this all comes down to is the positive results from improved economic conditions and our continuing efforts are reflected in various aspects of core performance. Notable examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, the impact of asset liability management actions on margin and expense management. We remain focused on uncovering opportunities to improve execution across the organization as we seek to increase client satisfaction to grow our core business. 
Turning to slide four I will spend a moment discussing our capital position before turning the call over to Mark. As you can see, slide four depicts our current estimated capital ratios and book value per share. We maintain a solid capital position with an estimated Tier 1 common rate of 7.65% and a Tier 1 ratio exceeding 13%. We continue to have substantial liquidity as deposit inflows have been largely retained in cash and invested in high quality, government-backed securities. Book value was $35.40 and tangible common was $22.76 at the close of the quarter. 
Our position on TARP repayment remains unchanged. We are well positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time. Separately, last week we announced we are exploring options relating to RidgeWorth. We are simply continuing our longstanding practice of evaluating ways to manage our business mix to maximize value for our shareholders. This evaluation does not apply to the majority of our wealth management business and is not tied to any movement on our part to repay TARP. Even if we do move forward with the transaction the impact would not be material enough to have a significant effect on our capital planning or our financial results. 
To conclude we believe that as economic recovery continues to gain traction our strong capital position and level of liquidity will enable us to operate from a position of strength to capitalize on opportunities in the markets and businesses in which we compete and to drive improved shareholder value. We are increasingly encouraged by current operating trends and our outlook for the future. 
There are a number of factors, some internal and some external, that cause us to believe the worst is behind us. As economic recovery seems certain, the remaining uncertainty relates primarily to the pace and strength of the economic improvement and its lingering impact on home prices. Our positive asset quality and operating trends give us reason to be optimistic about our performance as 2010 progresses. Our strong foundation coupled with our client focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities and the long-term economic prospects of our markets position us to deliver improving financial performance. 
I would like to turn the call over to Mark now.

305901,100326016,56851,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Jim and good morning everybody. I will begin my comments today on slide five of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter we posted a loss for common shareholders of $229 million or $0.46 per share. As has been th",2367,"Thanks Jim and good morning everybody. I will begin my comments today on slide five of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. 
For the quarter we posted a loss for common shareholders of $229 million or $0.46 per share. As has been the case in recent quarters the loss was driven by elevated charge offs, cyclically sensitive expenses and to a lesser extent soft revenue generation in certain units. The effects of the recession also continued to impact our results. Loan demand remained weak. Mortgage production volume declined significantly versus 2009 levels and noninterest income declined sequentially in a number of our larger line items. 
However, the amount of the reported loss declined significantly compared to last quarter. Improved results were largely due to lower provision and noninterest expenses, lower mortgage repurchase reserves and a stable net interest margin. Overall, the improvement in our results is occurring coincident with the recovering economy and some of the positive trends are primarily related to the environment. On the other hand we are directly driving the improvement in many areas. 
Notable and visible examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, expense management and the impact of asset liability management actions on net interest margin. Less noticeable now but critically important to our future is our increasing success in attracting and retaining clients with improved service and innovative products and services. 
So with that brief summary of first quarter results I will now shift to slide 6 and a balance sheet review. Overall, average loan balances excluding nonaccruals declined 1% and 11% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. The decline in balances in our higher risk categories continue. Construction balances continued their rapid decline, down another 14% in the current quarter and down 45% compared to last year. The resident mortgage and home equity line portfolios also continued their downward trends. 
Commercial and industrial loans reversed trend and increased slightly. However, the increase was due to bringing an average of $1.4 billion back on the balance sheet as a result of FAS 167. Excluding this impact, C&I continued this downward trend although the pace of decline slowed considerably. Line of credit utilization among our larger corporate and mid-sized clients now averages 21% for our largest clients and 33% for our midsized clients. 
While these utilization rates are down over 10 percentage points and 5 percentage points respectively the decline in this quarter was only 2 percentage points for larger clients and was stable for our mid-sized clients. We are hopeful that borrowing by credit worthy clients will stabilize soon and then pick back up in the second half of the year but our belief at this point is based largely on the slowing pace of decline and anecdotal information from dialogue with our clients. 
Now moving onto deposits at the bottom of the slide you can see core deposits declined slightly. However, please note the positive shift in mix continued. Lower cost deposit volumes increased as the small declines in DDA and NOW driven by seasonal commercial client activity were more than offset by growth in money market balances. The overall reduction in deposit balances was driven by CD balances which similar to last quarter were allowed to decline. We also reduced average broker and foreign deposits by $1.7 billion in the quarter or 33%. 
Our current liquidity position has enabled us to take the actions I just mentioned to refine and lower the cost of our funding profile. We also took actions with our securities portfolio so please turn to slide 7 for a brief review of the available for sale portfolio securities. 
The portfolio continues to be concentrated in higher quality and very liquid assets. Government and agency securities in the first four rows are the bulk of the portfolio with the Treasuries being held in anticipation of ultimate TARP repayment. The other equity holdings are largely [Coke], Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.  
During the quarter we decreased our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities and increased our asset backed securities position. The overall portfolio grew significantly in 2009 due to the strong inflow of deposits and declining loan demand. Given what appears to be an improving economy and a higher probability we are moving closer to an increasing rate environment we began to take action to reduce our longer term securities exposure. 
Specifically we sold $2 billion in mortgage backed securities during the quarter. Additionally, for similar purposes and in order to better diversify our portfolio we sold U.S. agency debt and purchased asset backed securities. The new ABS securities are high quality and are backed by newly originated consumer automobile loans. We will continue to take actions that best balance our excess liquidity against returns while retaining maximum flexibility to respond to changes in the market environment. 
I will now take a moment to talk about the margin on slide 8. Net interest margin expanded slightly this quarter increasing by five basis points to 3.32%. We had originally expected some margin compression in the quarter driven by off balance sheet consolidations, the full impact of the relatively low yielding U.S. Treasury securities and an expectation of declining deposits. However, deposit volume, mix and pricing combined with improved loan pricing largely offset the negative impacts such that day count was the largest driver of margin expansion during the quarter. 
As we look out into the second quarter and beyond we do not expect additional margin expansion in the near-term. In fact, day count benefit reversal combined with scenario analysis around some of the key variables such as loan and deposit volumes, pricing and market interest rates suggests margin could trend down slightly in the second quarter. For the second quarter and the remainder of the year we are currently expecting margin to be relatively stable within a range around 3.25%. 
Moving to slide 9 and provision expense, Tom will cover credit in detail in just a minute so I am going to be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $862 million, down $112 million from the fourth quarter. Charge offs of $821 million in the quarter are approximately equal to the fourth quarter level. Please note the increase in the charge off ratio is therefore purely driven by lower outstanding loan balances. Charge offs this quarter include two actions totaling $182 million that Tom will review in detail in a few minutes. The reason I mention it now is to make the point that if these additional steps had not been taken during the quarter net charge offs would have declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. 
The increase in the allowance for loan losses was $56 million in the quarter compared to $96 million in the fourth quarter which brings the allowance to $3.2 billion and 2.8% of loans. The reserve was relatively stable including a reduction in the reserve for unfunded commitments. Despite the notable improvement in asset quality the allowance remained relatively stable for the time being as the outlook for economic improvement and home values remains uncertain. 
Now moving onto noninterest income on slide 10, noninterest income in the quarter was down 6% and down 38% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. After adjustments for certain items in each quarter noninterest income actually increased by 4% and then declined 28% respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains and as in prior quarters we have provided the underlying detail for those adjustments in the appendix of today’s presentation. 
In the quarter the largest adjustments are for fair value securities marks and a $20 million loss associated with our fair value debt and related hedges as SunTrust’s credit spread continued to tighten. The primary reason for the adjusted year-over-year decline in noninterest income is a roughly $280 million reduction in mortgage production income driven by a nearly 60% decline in origination volume. Income was also negatively affected by $100 million increase in mortgage, rep and warranty costs on a year-over-year basis. 
On a sequential basis the increase in noninterest income is mostly due to mortgage related revenues. Rep and warranty costs which are included in mortgage production income declined by $92 million and mortgage servicing income increased primarily due to the performance of the NSR asset and our related hedges. Additionally, core trading income improved sequentially driven by increased fixed income sales and trading client revenues and improved performance in corporate treasury. 
Sequential revenue declines were reported in Trust and Investment Management income and in service charges on deposit accounts. Trust income declined primarily due to annual performance fees reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in service charge revenue was driven by a lower rate of NSF OD incidences in the quarter. We are actively engaged in analyzing and preparing to implement required changes to our service charge practices as required by Reg E on July 1st. 
Based on different scenarios for client opt-in we could see a reduction in our overall service and charge income of 10-20% during the second half of this year. We also believe the initial reduction in fee income will be greater in the first quarter or two after implementation as clients continue to opt-in and as we in the industry develop new and enhanced products and services. 
Now please turn to slide 11 and more detail around the mortgage rep and warranty repurchase trends we provide. This slide depicts the mortgage rep and warranty related trends. This is the same information presented last quarter, updated with first quarter results. The top left portion of this slide highlights the increasing impact on earnings and growth in the reserve during 2009. In the first quarter of 2010 the reserve increased only slightly but charge offs declined significantly. 
Specifically, the line item labeled “Additions” represents the cost reported as a reduction to mortgage production income in the quarter and you can see the cost declined to $128 million in the first quarter as compared to $220 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The charge offs recognized in the first quarter declined to $118 million or $10 million less than the additions to the reserve. This resulted in a modest increase in the overall reserve to $210 million. 
The graph on the right illustrates why losses declined and reserves were stable. New request volume declined in the quarter and the inventory of pending requests continued its decline. While we are pleased that new request volume declined it is not clear to us how much of the decline may be related to seasonality, sustainable cyclical factors or simply agency work flows. 
As a result, we are not expecting new request volumes to decline significantly in the near-term. On the bottom left of this slide you can see the vintage of repurchase requests was basically stable on a sequential basis with most of the volume coming from higher loss vintages in 2007 and prior. We do expect that normal, seasoning patterns for origination vintages will continue to shift new request volume to newer vintages over time. 
On the bottom right are some key statistics that illustrate the lower risk profile of the newer vintages. Lower levels of Alt-A, higher FICO and the higher percentage of full doc loans in newer vintages suggests lower frequency of losses. Newer vintages exhibit lower LTVs and were originated during and after a period of significant home price depreciation. This suggests that in addition to lower frequency of loss new vintages will experience lower loss severity as well. 
In conclusion, near-term losses and reserve levels will largely be driven by the volume of new repurchase requests. While new request volumes are difficult to predict if they stabilize at first quarter levels we expect charge offs and reserves to decline gradually over the remainder of 2010 as the shift to newer vintages naturally occurs. However, if new request volumes increase and/or older vintage request volumes remain high charge offs and reserves could remain at current levels of even higher. 
Now turning to slide 12 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense declined 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2009 and 6% compared to last quarter. On this slide we have adjusted for some items that are detailed in the appendix of today’s presentation. There were no large adjustments during the current quarter. A large adjustment in the first quarter of last year was primarily related to goodwill impairment. 
Excluding certain adjustments expenses were down 5% compared to last year and down 4% compared to last quarter. We have included an analysis of the key items impacting the comparison. The total year-over-year decrease in adjusted expenses is approximately $64 million. Reductions in credit related and pension expenses contributed to the positive expense performance as they declined year-over-year while FDIC related expenses clearly increased. The net of these three items is a $54 million decrease in expenses and the expense change net of these items is a decrease of $10 million noted at the bottom. 
This means that excluding special items and cyclically sensitive expenses the net of all other expenses is down slightly on a year-over-year basis. The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is exactly the same. 
So the highlights of what I have discussed this morning are that; one, our earnings loss has narrowed. Two, the provision expense declined due to improved asset quality. Three, margin increased despite weak loan demand driven by a continued shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits. Four, noninterest income remains soft though improved versus last quarter in part due to a decline in mortgage rep and warranty costs. Finally, noninterest expenses have declined as cyclically sensitive expenses are lower and we have managed all other expenses tightly. 
We are encouraged by current operating and operating trends. The remaining questions are related to how quickly and strongly the economy recovers and where home prices will trend from here. At this time we are looking forward to continued improvement in our results as 2010 progresses. 
With that I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality.

As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early state delinquencies all decreased. Additionally, charge offs, the allowance for loan losses and 90 plus delinquencies were all stable quarter to quarter. 
A couple of numbers on this slide were influenced by actions we took in the quarter related to nonperforming loans. While overall charge offs were flat quarter-over-quarter at $821 million the base level of charge offs was lower. Added to this lower base were incremental charge offs on aged residential mortgage nonperformers resulting from a change in policy. We also decided to sell a portfolio of mortgage loans and as a result reduced nonperforming loans and recorded an incremental charge off. I will address these actions in more detail later in the presentation. 
Please turn to slide 14 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio review of asset quality illustrates broad based improvement in early stage delinquencies among the consumer portfolios. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement in early stage delinquencies. Overall, charge offs remain stable at $821 million with the charge off ratio increasing due purely to a reduction in loan balances. As in past quarter absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real estate related portfolios including residential mortgages, home equity products, land and residential construction. 
The commercial portfolio continues to perform well overall. Commercial loan charge offs and early stage delinquencies were stable in the quarter and nonperforming loans declined by over $100 million for the third quarter in a row. We continue to see some potential for volatility in more cyclically sensitive industries. However, our view is that overall C&I asset quality is stable and improving at this point in the cycle. 
Overall commercial real estate portfolio including owner occupied and income producing properties is performing well. The charge off ration in the quarter remained in the single digits and early stage delinquencies were stable. While commercial real estate nonperforming loans increased in the quarter to $464 million they represent a relatively low 3% of the portfolio. 
Given the conditions in the commercial real estate market we expect additional stress and credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also believe our portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition and the way it was underwritten. As noted a moment ago asset quality improved in the consumer portfolios. Early stage delinquencies declined across most portfolios and charge off ratios were stable to down. 
The only exceptions were in the residential 1-4 family and credit card portfolios. The 1-4 family charge off ratio increased due to actions we took related to nonperforming loans. The dollar increase in credit card charge offs were $7 million due to one-time timing adjustments associated with bringing credit card servicing in-house. 
I am going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now I will summarize. Overall home equity performance has been stable as charge offs were generally flat while early stage delinquency declined. Early stage delinquencies declined meaningfully in the mortgage portfolio and the increase in charge offs was entirely related to our decision to sell assets and a change in accounting policy. Construction charge offs declined by almost one-half. We expect more charge offs in this portfolio with uneven quarter to quarter results due to the nature of the workout process. However, I can assure you we are aggressively pursuing a resolution of nonperformers in this portfolio. 
Next I am going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail beginning with the residential mortgage portfolio on slide 15. Asset quality in the residential mortgage portfolio continued to show improvement in the first quarter although this portfolio continues to perform poorly on an absolute basis. The key point this quarter is that balances were flat and asset quality in the large core portfolio improved. 
Please note that overall core balances were flat as a result of the repurchase of nearly $500 million in government-guaranteed Ginnie Mae mortgages. In addition, while higher risk segment balances continue to decline asset quality metrics for these portfolios were stable. The impact of our decision to sell assets and a change in our charge off accounting policy on long-dated foreclosures is evident in the asset quality metrics on this slide. However, the improvement in early stage delinquencies noted earlier was not impacted by our actions and as a result our outlook for this portfolio has improved. 
Early stage delinquency trends indicate a lower frequency of default in the future. Additionally, home price deterioration appears to be slowing in a number of our markets. There remain risks to this outlook. First, sustained softness in jobs among our markets could impact the frequency of loss. Second, loss severity could be negatively impacted by weakness in home values resulting from an influx of foreclosed homes into the market, higher mortgage rates and the elimination of government subsidies for homebuyers. 
This dynamic is particularly true in Florida. The net result is that while we are optimistic about the future there are market headwinds outside of our control that could negatively impact asset quality. However, even with those risks in mind our outlook for charge offs in the residential mortgage portfolio has improved.  
Moving to home equity lines on slide 16, overall the home equity portfolio performance has been relatively stable. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by higher risk segments of the portfolio. Loans that were originated by third-parties, loans in Florida and loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Values in these segments continue to decline due to runoff and charge offs with no new production and little line availability. 
Core portfolio balances which represent approximately 70% of the HELOC portfolio were basically stable. The core portfolio performed better than the higher risk segments but showed a sequential increase in charge offs in the first quarter of roughly $10 million due to higher losses related to consumer bankruptcies. 
Now if you turn to slide 17 I will talk about our construction portfolio. Construction balances declined over 13% in the quarter or nearly $900 million. To put this in context, construction balances in 2007 exceeded $14 billion and are now down nearly $9 billion or 60%. Construction to perm portfolio balances and nonperformers continue to run down as new production remains minimal and workout efforts continue on the nonperformers. 
Residential builder charge offs decreased significantly this quarter due to the uneven nature of timing in the workout process. We continue to aggressively manage the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. As a result and due to continued variability in land values we expect charge offs in this portfolio to increase next quarter. However, as I just mentioned the basic nature of the process particularly in the judicial foreclosure state of Florida renders timing difficult to gauge with accuracy. 
This is truly a timing issue, not an income issue, since we continue to be comfortable with the reserves on this portfolio. It is also important to note that 30 days plus delinquency declined significantly again this quarter in the largest portfolios while the [A&D] portfolio segments and the overall portfolio showed increases. In fact, this increase in the overall delinquency ratio was purely a denominator issue since the dollars delinquent declined by $8 million. 
The [A&D] delinquency increase stands out but the higher ratios are driven by lower balances combined with a small dollar increase in delinquencies. In the [legacy builder A&D] segment delinquent dollars increased by $7 million while the commercial [A&D] increase was due to 15 loans totaling $12 million. Construction related nonperforming loans increased somewhat this quarter. However, we continue to believe that nonperforming loans in the builder portfolio are at or near their peak. 
The majority of loans in the portfolio that are going to have problems have been identified and are in the workout process. As these workouts progress we expect the related charge offs to increase next quarter and remain elevated and uneven over the remainder of 2010. Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined significantly, charge offs declined and nonperformers increased only modestly. 
Please turn to slide 18 where I will cover our nonperforming loan actions we took this quarter. As I noted earlier, we took actions this quarter that impacted the level of nonperforming loans and charge offs. In the table on the left you can see the impact of these actions was to increase charge offs by $182 million over base charge offs of $639 million that we would have reported otherwise. Nonperforming loan balances were reduced by $342 million as a result of these actions. This represents the sum of the held-for-sale carrying balance of $160 million plus $182 million charge off. 
Let me describe the two actions we took in more detail including our rationale. The first action was a change in our process for reporting charge offs on residential mortgage nonperforming loans. Specifically, we reported $131 million in incremental charge offs on first lien residential mortgage loans that have been in the foreclosure process for more than 12 months. Our previous practice was to charge the loan down to an average of 85% of market value and 180 days past due and not record further charge offs until the final foreclosure. 
Given the extended foreclosure timeframes particularly in Florida and the decline in value that occurred in collateral values we determined it would be appropriate to record an additional adjustment 12 months after the initial charge off. Our original charge off policy did not envision that foreclosure timeframes would extend well beyond 12 months. Additionally, it makes more sense to make this change now that property values in many markets appear to be stabilized. This action accelerates the timing of when we recognize the potential additional charge offs resulting from foreclosure. 
The $131 million brings forward charge offs that we would have reported later. We do not believe the impact of this policy adjustment in future quarters will be material. One final note on this topic, the change applies only to residential first lien mortgages primarily held in Florida. 
The second action in the quarter was the decision to sell $211 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. As a result, we recorded an incremental charge off of $51 million in the quarter and classified these loans as held-for-sale. We are actively marketing this portfolio and intend to complete the sale in the second quarter. We have chosen to take this action now as liquidity and market pricing for nonperforming mortgage loans has improved as the decline in underlying home values has slowed. 
The improvement in the market is evidenced by the relatively small additional charge off especially when viewed in light of the concentration of loans in this portfolio that are located in Florida and California. In addition, the size of the portfolio is rather small and allows us to test the market appetite and pricing for various geographic and product profiles. The sale also allows us to better allocate default management resources and avoid the time and expense of long foreclosure timeframes for selected loans. 
Please turn to slide 19 for a review of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting troubled debt restructures (TDRs). The key point to take away from this slide are that the pace of mortgage modifications has slowed and that 95% of the growth in TDRs in the quarter was in the accruing category. TDRs increased by less than $300 million in the current quarter as compared to over $500 million in each of the previous three quarters. The slower pace of growth is primarily related to a lower inflow of newly delinquent loans and also peer modifications of more seriously delinquent. 
Non-accruing TDRs increased by $14 million in the quarter as compared to $236 million in the fourth quarter. The last point I would like to make here is that TDRs continue to be almost exclusively first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Additional detail on the performance of our modified loans is included in the next slide. This table shows 73% of the TDRs are current on all principle and interest payments and an additional 13% are in early stage delinquency. To put this payment status in context, accruing TDR balances totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter as opposed to $1.9 billion today. This means that over 2/3 of the accruing TDRs have aged at least six months and as you can see on this slide 88% of the accruing TDRs are current on principle and interest payments at the end of March. 
Our primary means by which these accruing residential TDRs exit the portfolio is through payoff or refinance. The $400 million of current but non-accruing TDRs will continue to be reported as non-accruing until they go through a six month cure period after which they will move into an accruing TDR status. Accruing TDRs that become 120 days past due are moved to a non-accrual TDR status. 
Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs is continuing to exceed our expectations for the first quarter with 95% of the accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio was much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than it is to a restructured portfolio. Obviously performance on this portfolio could deteriorate, however we are pleased with the performance to date. 
I will summarize the key points from today’s credit update before turning the call back over to Steve. Please turn to slide 21. Overall, asset quality has improved. However, nonperforming loans and charge offs remain high. During the quarter early stage delinquencies, base charge offs and nonperforming loans all declined. The nonperforming assets were stable. Improvements in base charge offs and delinquencies were broad based among the portfolios. Balances continue to decline and asset quality metrics continued to improve in our consumer residential real estate portfolios. 
$182 million in incremental charge offs were reported in the quarter for a change in internal policy for aged first mortgage NPLs and for a small portfolio of nonperforming loans that was transferred to held-for-sale. The pace of mortgage modifications slowed considerably in the fourth quarter and the proportion that is current on principle and interest payments increased slightly from last quarter to 73%. 
At the current time we expect overall second quarter charge offs to be stable to down versus the first quarter. The run rate of base charge offs of roughly $640 million is expected to be stable to slightly up depending on the status of residential construction workouts and the pace of improvement in the consumer portfolios. Of course, if we were to decide to sell additional nonperforming loans that would also influence where we fall within the overall expected range of targets. With that, I will turn it back over to Steve.

As you know the impact of the recession on our asset quality and earnings will take awhile to recede. However, the process of improvement now appears to have clearly begun. Asset quality improved again this quarter and leading indicators suggest further improvement during the remainder of the year. Our capital position remains solid. We believe that we have strong capital today and enough capital to leverage for growth as the economy strengthens tomorrow. Liquidity and funding have been well managed as have expenses. Perhaps most importantly we have made a lot of little changes that have improved daily execution, increased accountability and enhanced products and services. 
We have more work to do here but these actions are gaining momentum and improving client satisfaction. Taken all together these things give us confidence that our earnings power is well leveraged to economic recovery. We are ready to begin taking questions now. In order to accommodate as many as possible I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, we are ready for the first question.

Glad you're with us this morning. Our first quarter results improved to a loss of $0.46 versus a loss of a $0.64 last quarter as earnings continue to be impacted by all the credit costs.

Our first quarter results improved to a loss of $0.46 versus a loss of a $0.64 last quarter as earnings continue to be impacted by all the credit costs. Our overall home price depreciation slowed as uncertainty remains around the direction of future home prices especially in certain markets. revenue remains soft driven by the decline in mortgage production volume coupled with a mark to market losses on our fair value publicly held debt. 
Also, loan demand is yet to pick up as clients are focused on capital preservation and debt reduction have accessed the debt  markets in lieu of the bank loans. However, as the economy has shown signs of improvement so have our results. The most notable sign of improvement was an asset quality, which resulted in a significant decrease in credit-related costs compared to last quarter. 
Charge-offs remain stable compared to the fourth quarter, though if you exclude the actions that Tom Freeman will detail later in the call, charge-offs would have declined sequentially. Additionally, nonperforming assets, the allowance for loan losses in 90 plus delinquencies, were all stable quarter to quarter, while provision expenses, nonperforming loans and early stage delinquencies all decreased. We believe this marks a continuation of improved asset quality trends as the improvements in charge-offs and delinquencies were broad-based among the portfolios, and we experienced in the second sequential quarter of overall positive asset quality metrics. 
In addition to the apparent beginning of economic improvement, our client-focused strategies, lower cost deposit mix and expense management discipline also contributed to encouraging operating trends.  Favorable deposit mixed trends continue this quarter with growth in money market balances and a decrease in higher cost time deposits. 
After an extended period of growth, consumer and commercial deposits were stable, the trend one would expect with the economic improvement. However, we are improving client satisfaction in getting to the drivers  that build loyalty by understanding individual preferences and aligning our business model to respond in a fashion that is improving client satisfaction and retention. 
The net interest margin increased due largely to our ability to shift our funding mix to lower cost deposits and to improved loan pricing. Stable client deposits and improvements enabled  a reduction in higher cost sources of funding and that, along with lower rates paid, pushed the margin higher. 
The result of this disciplined expense management was evident across controlling operating expenses again this quarter. We continue to capitalize upon the strength we have built and remain focused on continually covering efficiency improvement opportunities. And those cycle costs, including other real estate and credit and collection costs, are collectively high. They are down significantly from the prior quarter from the same quarter of last year.
What this all comes down to is that the positive results from improved economic conditions and our continuing efforts are reflected in various aspects of core performance. Notable examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, the impact of asset liability management actions on margin and expense management. We remain focused on uncovering opportunities to improve execution across the organization as we seek to increase client satisfaction to grow our core business.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll spend a moment discussing our capital position before turning the call over to Mark. As you can see, Slide 4 depicts our current estimated capital ratios and book value per share. We maintained a solid capital position with an estimated Tier 1 common ratio of 7.65% and a Tier 1 ratio exceeding 13%. We continue to have substantial liquidity as deposit inflows have been largely retained in cash and invested in high-quality government-backed securities. Book value was $35.40 and tangible common was $22.76 at the close of the quarter. 
 Our position on TARP repayment remains unchanged. We are well-positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time. Secondly, last week we announced that we are exploring options relating to RidgeWorth. We are simply continuing our long-standing practice of evaluating ways to manage our business mix, to maximize value for our shareholders. This evaluation does not apply to the majority of our Wealth Management business and is not tied to any eminent  move on our part to repay TARP. Even if we do move forward with the transaction, the impact would not be material enough to have a significant effect on our capital planning or our financial results. 
To conclude, we believe that as economic recovery continues to gain traction, our strong capital position and level of liquidity will enable us to operate from a position of strength to capitalize on opportunities in the markets and businesses in which we compete and to drive improved shareholder value. We are increasingly encouraged by current operating trends and our outlook for the future. There are a number of factors, some internal, some external, that  cause us to believe that the worst is behind us. 
As economic recovery seems certain, remaining  uncertainty relates primarily to the pace and  the strength of the economic improvement and it's lingering impact on home prices. There are positive asset quality and operating trends give us reason to be optimistic about our performance as 2010 progresses. A strong foundation, coupled with our client-focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities, and the long-term economic prospects of our markets, position us to deliver improving financial performance. So I'd like to turn the call over to Mark now."
305901,100326016,56863,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss of common shareholders of $229 million or $0.46 per share. As has been the ca",2344,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss of common shareholders of $229 million or $0.46 per share. As has been the case in recent quarters, the loss was driven by elevated charge-offs, cyclically sensitive expenses, and to a lesser extent, soft revenue generation in certain units. 
The effects of the recession also continued to impact our results. Loan demand remained weak, mortgage production volume declined significantly versus 2009 levels, and non-interest income declined sequentially in a number of our larger line items. However, the amount of the reported loss declined significantly compared to last quarter. Improved results were largely due to lower provision and noninterest expenses, lower mortgage repurchase reserves and a stable net interest margin. 
Overall, the improvement in our results is occurring coincident with the recovering economy and some of the positive trends are primarily related to the environment. But, on the other hand, we are directly driving improvement in many areas. 
Notable and visible examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, expense management and the impact of asset liability management actions on net interest margin. Less noticeable now, but critically important to our future, is our increasing success in attracting and retaining clients with improved service and innovative products and services. 
So with that brief summary of first quarter results, I will now shift to slide 6 and a balance sheet review.  Overall, average loan balances, excluding non-accruals, declined 1% and 11% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. The decline in balances in our higher risk categories continued. Construction balances continued their rapid decline, down another 14% in the current quarter and down 45% compared to last year. The residential mortgage and home equity line portfolios also continued their downward trend. 
Commercial and industrial loans reversed trend and increased slightly. However, the increase was due to bringing an average of $1.4 billion back on the balance sheet as a result of the FAS 167. Excluding this impact, C&I continued its downward trend although the pace of decline slowed considerably. 
Line of credit utilization among our larger corporate and midsized clients now averages 21% for our largest clients and 33% for our midsize clients. While these utilization rates are down over 10 percentage points and five percentage points, respectively the decline in this quarter was only two percentage points for larger clients and was stable for our midsize clients. We are hopeful that borrowing by creditworthy clients will stabilize soon and then pick back up in the second half of the year. But our belief at this point is based largely on the slowing pace of decline in anecdotal information from dialogue with our clients. 
Now moving on to deposits at the bottom of the slide. You can see the core deposits declined slightly. However, please note that the positive shift in mix continued. Lower cost deposit volumes increased as the small declines in DDA and NOW driven by seasonal commercial client activity were more than offset by growth in money market balances. The overall reduction in deposit balances was driven by CD balances which, similar to last quarter, were allowed to decline. 
We also reduced average broker and foreign deposits by $1.7 billion in the quarter or 33%. Our current liquidity position has enabled us to take the actions I just mentioned to refine and lower the cost of our funding profile. We also took actions with our securities portfolio, so please turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of the available-for-sale portfolio securities.
The portfolio continues to be concentrated in higher quality and very liquid assets. Government and agency securities in the first four rows are the bulk of the portfolio, with the treasuries being held  in anticipation of ultimate TARP repayment. The other equity holdings are largely Coke, Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.
During the quarter, we decreased our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and increased our asset-backed securities position. The overall portfolio grew significantly in 2009 due to the strong inflow of deposits and declining loan demand.  Given what appears to be an improving economy, and the higher probability that we are moving closer to an increasing rate  environment, we began to take action to reduce our longer-term securities exposure. Specifically, we sold $2 billion in mortgage-backed securities during the quarter.  Additionally, for similar purposes, and in order to better diversify our portfolio, we sold U.S. agency debt and purchased asset-backed securities. The new ABS securities are high quality and are backed by newly-originated consumer automobile loans. 
We will continue to take actions that best balance our excess liquidity against returns while retaining maximum flexibility to respond to changes in the market environment.  
I'll now take a moment to talk about the margin on Slide 8.  Net interest margin expanded slightly this quarter, increasing by five basis points to 3.32%. We had originally expected some margin compression in the quarter driven by off-balance sheet consolidations, the full impact of the relatively low-yielding U.S. Treasury Securities and an expectation of decline in deposits. However, deposit volume, mix and pricing combined with improved loan pricing largely offset the negative impacts such that day count was the largest driver of margin expansion during the quarter. 
As we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we do not expect additional margin expansion in the near-term. In fact, day count benefit reversal combined with the scenario analysis around some of the key variables such as loan and deposit volumes, pricing and market interest rates, suggest margin can trend down slightly in the second quarter. 
For the second quarter and the remainder of the year, we are currently expecting margin to be relatively stable within a range around 3.25%. 
Moving to Slide 9, in provision expense. Now Tom will cover credit in detail in just a minute so I'm going to be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $862 million, down $112 million from the fourth quarter. Charge-offs of $821 million in the quarter approximately equaled the fourth quarter level. Please note the increase in charge-off ratio is therefore purely driven by lower outstanding loan balances. 
Charge-offs  this quarter include two actions totaling $182 million that  Tom will review in detail in a few minutes. The reason I mention it now is to make the point that if these additional steps had not been taken during the quarter, net charge-offs would have declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. 
The increase in the allowance for loan losses was $56 million in the quarter compared to $96 million in the fourth quarter, which brings the allowance to $3.2 billion and 2.8% of loans. The reserve was relatively stable, including a reduction in the reserve on unfunded commitments. Despite the notable improvement in asset quality, the allowance remained relatively stable for the time being as the outlook for economic improvement and home values remains uncertain.
Now moving on to non-interest income on Slide 10. Non-interest income in the quarter was down 6% and down 38% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. After adjustments for certain items in each quarter, non-interest income actually increased by 4% and then declined 28%, respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains and, as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail for those adjustments in the appendix of today's presentation.
In the quarter the largest adjustments are for fair value securities marks and the $20 million loss associated with our fair value debt and related hedges as SunTrust's credit spread continued to tighten. The primary reason for the adjusted year-over-year decline in noninterest income is a roughly $280 million reduction in mortgage production income, driven by a nearly 60% decline in origination volume. Income was also negatively affected by $100 million increase in mortgage, rep and warrant costs on a year-over-year basis. 
On a sequential basis, the increase in noninterest income is mostly due to mortgage-related revenues. Rep and warranty costs, which are included in mortgage production income, declined by $92 million mortgage-servicing income increased primarily due to the performance of the MSR asset and our related hedges.  Additionally, core trading income improved sequentially driven by increased fixed income sales and trading client revenues and improved performance in corporate treasury. 
Sequential revenue declines were recorded in Trust and Investment Management income and service charges on deposit accounts. Trust income declined primarily due to annual performance fees reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in service charge revenue was driven by a lower rate of NSF OD incidences in the quarter. 
We are actively engaged in analyzing and preparing to implement required changes to our service charge practices as required by Reg E on July 1. Based on different scenarios for client opt-in, we could see a reduction in our overall service charge income of 10% to 20% during the second half of this year. We also believe that the initial reduction of fee income will be greater in the first quarter or two after implementation as clients continue to opt in and as we in the industry develop new and enhanced products and services. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, and more detail around  the mortgage rep and warranty repurchase trends will be provided. This slide depicts the mortgage rep and warranty related trends. This is the same information presented last quarter updated with the first quarter results. The top left portion of this slide highlights the increasing impact on earnings and growth in the reserve during 2009. 
In the first quarter of 2010, the reserve increased only slightly, but charge-offs declined significantly. Specifically, the line item labeled ""Additions"" represents the cost reported as a reduction to mortgage production income in the quarter, and you can see that the cost declined to $128 million in the first quarter as compared to $220 million in the fourth quarter of last year. 
The charge-offs recognized in the first quarter declined to $118 million or $10 million less than the additions to the reserve. This resulted in a modest increase in the overall reserve to $210 million.
The graph on the right illustrates why losses declined and reserves were stable. New request volume declined in the quarter and the inventory of pending requests continued its decline. While we are pleased that new request volume declined, it is not clear to us how much of the decline may be related to seasonality, sustainable cyclical factors or simply agency workflows. As a result, we are not expecting new request volumes to decline significantly in the near-term. 
On the bottom left of the slide, you can see that the vintage of repurchase request was basically stable on sequential basis, with most of the volume coming from higher loss vintages in 2007 and prior. We do expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination of vintages will continue to shift new request volume to newer vintages over time. 
On the bottom right are some key statistics that illustrate the lower risk profile of the newer vintages. Lower levels of Alt-A, higher FICO and the higher percentage of full doc loans and newer vintages suggest lower frequency of  losses. Newer vintages exhibit lower LTVs and were originated during and after a period of significant home price depreciation. This suggests that in addition to lower frequency of loss, new vintages will experience lower loss severity as well. 
In conclusion, near-term losses and reserve levels will largely be driven by the volume of new repurchase requests. While new request volumes are difficult to predict, if they stabilize at first quarter levels, we expect charge-offs and reserves to decline gradually over the remainder of 2010 as the shift to newer vintages naturally occurs. However, if new request volumes increase and/or older vintage request volumes remain high, charge-offs and reserves could remain at current levels or even higher.
Now turning to Slide 12 for review of expenses. Noninterest expense declined 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2009, and 6% compared to last quarter. On this slide, we have adjusted for some items that are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation. 
There were no large adjustments during the current quarter. The large adjustment in the first quarter of last year was primarily related to goodwill impairment. Excluding certain adjustments, expenses were down 5% compared to last year and down 4% compared to last quarter. We've included an analysis of key items impacting the comparison. 
The total year-over-year decrease in adjusted expenses is approximately $64 million. Reductions in credit-related and pension expenses contributed to the positive expense performance as they declined year-over-year, while FDIC-related expenses clearly increased. 
The net of these three items is a $54 million decrease in expenses, and the expense changed net of these items is a decrease of $10 million noted at the bottom. This means that excluding special items and cyclically sensitive expenses, the net of all other expenses is down slightly on a year-over-year basis. 
The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is exactly the same. So the highlights of what I've discussed this morning are that, one, our earnings losses narrowed; two, the provision expense declined due to improved asset quality; three, margin increased despite weak loan demand driven by continued shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits; four, noninterest income remains soft, though improved, versus last quarter, in part due to a decline in mortgage and warranty costs; and, finally, noninterest expenses have declined as cyclically  sensitive expenses are lower and we have managed all other expenses tightly. 
We are encouraged by current operating and economic trends. The remaining questions are related to how quickly and strongly the economy recovers and where home prices will trend from here. At this time, we are looking forward to continued improvement in our results our 2010 progresses. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."

As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early state delinquencies all decreased. Additionally, charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses and 90 plus delinquencies were all stable quarter-to-quarter.
A couple of numbers on the slide were influenced by actions we took in the quarter related to nonperforming loans. While overall charge-offs were flat quarter-over-quarter at $821 million, the base level of charge-offs was lower. Added to this lower base were incremental charge-offs on aged residential mortgage nonperformers, resulting from a change in policy. We also decided to sell a portfolio of mortgage loans and, as a result, reduced nonperforming loans and recorded an incremental charge-off. I will address these actions in more detail later in the presentation.
Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio view of asset quality illustrates broad-based improvement in early-stage delinquencies among the consumer portfolios. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of the improvement in early state delinquencies. Overall, charge-offs remain stable at $821 million, with the charge-off ratio increasing due purely to a reduction in loan balances. As in past quarters, absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real estate related portfolios, including residential mortgages, home equity products, land and residential construction. 
The commercial portfolio continues to perform well overall. Commercial loan charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies were stable in the quarter and nonperforming loans declined by over $100 million for the third quarter in a row. We continue to see some potential for volatility in more cyclically sensitive industries. However, our view is that overall C&I asset quality is stable and improving at this point in the cycle.
Overall, the commercial real estate portfolio, including owner occupied and income producing properties, is performing well. The charge-off ratio in the quarter remained in the single digits and early-stage delinquencies were stable. While commercial real estate nonperforming loans increased in the quarter to $464 million, they represent a relatively low 3% of the portfolio. 
Given the conditions in the commercial real estate market, we expect additional stress and credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also believe our portfolio will perform comparatively well given this composition and the way it was underwritten. 
As noted a moment ago, asset quality improved in consumer portfolios. Early-stage delinquencies declined across most portfolios and charge-off ratios were stable to down. The only exception were in the residential 1-4 family and credit card portfolios.
The 1-4 family charge-off ratio increased due to actions we took related to nonperforming loans. The dollar increase in credit card charge-offs was $7 million due to one-time timing adjustment associated with bringing credit card servicing in-house.
I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now I will summarize. 
Overall, home equity performance has been stable as charge-offs were generally flat while early-stage delinquencies declined. Early-stage delinquencies declined meaningfully in the mortgage portfolio and the increase in charge-offs was entirely related to our decision to sell assets and a change in accounting policy. 
Construction charge-offs declined by almost one half. We expect more charge-offs in this portfolio with uneven quarter-to-quarter results due to the nature of the workout process. However, I can assure you that we are aggressively pursuing a resolution of nonperformers in this portfolio.
Next, I'm going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail beginning with the residential mortgage portfolio on Slide 15. Asset quality in the residential mortgage portfolio continued to show improvement in the first quarter, although this portfolio continues to perform poorly on an absolute basis. 
The key point this quarter is that balances were flat and asset quality in the large portfolio improved. Please note that overall core balances were flat as a result of the repurchase of nearly $500 million in government-guaranteed Ginnie Mae mortgages.  In addition, while higher risk segment balances continued to decline, asset quality metrics for these portfolios were stable. The impact of our decision to sell assets and the change in our charge-off accounting policy on long-dated foreclosures is evident in the asset quality metrics on the slide.  However, the improvement in early stage delinquencies noted earlier was not impacted by our actions and, as a result, our outlook for this portfolio is improved. Early-stage delinquencies trends indicate a lower frequency of default in the future. 
Additionally, home price deterioration appears to be slowing in a number of our markets. There remains risk to this outlook. First, sustained softness in jobs among our markets could impact the frequency of loss.  Second, loss severity could be negatively impacted by weakness in home values resulting from an influx of foreclosed homes into the market, higher mortgage rates and the elimination of government subsidies for homebuyers. This dynamic is particularly true in Florida. 
The net result is that while we are optimistic about the future, there are market headwinds outside of our control that could negatively impact asset quality. However, even with those risks in mind, our outlook for charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio has improved.
Moving to home equity lines on Slide 16. Overall, the home equity portfolio performance has been relatively stable. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by higher risk segments of the portfolio, loans that were originated to third parties, loans in Florida, and loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Balances in these segments continue to decline due to run off and charge-offs, with no new production and little line availability. 
Core portfolio balances, which represent approximately 70% of the HELOC portfolio, were basically stable. The core portfolio performed better than the higher risk segments but showed a sequential increase in charge-offs in the first quarter of roughly $10 million due to higher losses  related to consumer bankruptcies. 
Now if you turn to Slide 17, I will talk about our construction portfolio.  Construction balances declined over 13% in the quarter or nearly $900 million. To put this in context, construction balances in 2007 exceeded $14 billion and are now down nearly $9 billion or 60%. Construction to perm portfolio balances and nonperformers continued to wind down as new production remains minimal and work-out efforts continue on the nonperformers. 
Residential builder charge-offs decreased significantly this quarter due to the uneven nature of timing in the workout process. We continue to aggressively manage the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. As a result, and due to continued variability on land values, we expect charge-offs in this portfolio to increase next quarter.  However, as I just mentioned, the basic metric of the process particularly in the judicial foreclosure state of Florida renders timing difficult to gauge with accuracy. 
This is truly a timing issue, not an income issue since we continue to be comfortable with the reserves on this portfolio.  It is also important to note that 30 days plus delinquency declined significantly again this quarter in the largest portfolios while the A&D portfolio segments and the overall portfolio showed increases.  In fact, this increase in the overall delinquency ratio was purely a denominator issue since the dollars delinquent declined by $8 million. 
The A&D delinquency increase stands out that the higher ratios are driven by lower balances combined with a small dollar increase in delinquencies. In the legacy builder A&D segment, delinquent dollars increased by $7 million while the commercial A&D increase was due to 15 loans totaling $12 million. 
Construction-related nonperforming loans increased somewhat this quarter. However, we continue to believe that nonperforming loans in the builder portfolio are at or near their peak.
The majority of loans in the portfolio that are going to have problems have been identified and are in the workout process. As these workouts progress, we expect that related charge-offs will increase next quarter and remain elevated and uneven in the remainder of 2010.  Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined significantly, charge-offs declined and nonperformers increased only modestly. 
Please turn to Slide 18, where I will cover the nonperforming loan actions we took this quarter. As I noted earlier, we took actions this quarter that impacted the level of nonperforming loans and charge-offs. In the table on the left, you can see that the impact of these actions was to increase charge-offs by $182 million over base charge-offs of $639 million that we would have reported otherwise. 
Nonperforming loan balances were reduced by $342 million as a result of these actions. This represents the sum of the health for sale carrying balance of $116 million plus $182 million charge-off. 
Let me describe the two actions we took in more detail including our rationale.  The first action was a change in our process of recording charge-offs on residential mortgage nonperforming loans. Specifically, we recorded $131 million in incremental charge-offs on first-lien residential mortgage loans that have been in the foreclosure process for more than 12 months. Our previous practice was to charge the loan down to an average of 85% of market value and 180 days past due and not record for the charge-offs until the time of foreclosure. 
In the extent of foreclosure timeframe, particularly in Florida, and the decline in value that occurred in collateral values, we determined it would be appropriate to record an additional adjustment 12 months after the initial charge-off.  Our original charge-off policy did not envision that foreclosure timeframes would extend well beyond 12 months. 
Additionally, it makes more sense to make this change now that property values in many markets appear to be stabilizing. This action accelerates the timing of when we recognize the potential additional charge-offs resulting from foreclosure. 
The $131 million brings forward charge-offs that we would have reported later. We do not believe the impact of this policy adjustment in future quarters will be material. One final note on this topic. The change applies only to residential first-lien mortgages primarily held in Florida.
The second action in the quarter was the decision to sell $211 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. As a result, we recorded an incremental charge-off of $51 million in the quarter and classified these loans as held for sale. We are actively marketing this portfolio and intend to complete the sale in the second quarter. We have chosen to take this action now as liquidity and market pricing for nonperforming mortgage loans has improved as the decline in underlying home values has slowed. 
The improvement in the market is evidenced by the relatively small additional charge-off, especially when viewed in light of the concentration of loans in this portfolio that are located in Florida and California. In addition, the size of the portfolio is rather small and allows us to test market appetite in pricing for various geographic and product profiles.
The sale also allows us to better allocate default management resources and believe the time and expense of long foreclosure time frames for selected loans.
Please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting troubled-debt restructures or TDRs.
The key point to take away from this slide are that the pace of mortgage modifications has slowed and that 95% of the growth in TDRs in the quarter was a new growing category. TDRs increased by less than $300 million in the current quarter as compared to over $500 million in each of the previous two quarters. The slower pace of growth is primarily related to a lower inflow of newly delinquent loans and, also, fewer modifications of more seriously vulnerable ones.  Non-accruing TDRs increased by $14 million in the quarter as compared to $236 million in the fourth quarter. 
The last point I'd like to make here is that TDRs continue to be almost exclusively first and second lien residential mortgages and home-equity lines of credit. Additional detail on the performance of our modified loans is included on the next slide. This table shows that 73% of the TDRs are current on all principal and interest payments.  An additional 13% are in early stage delinquency. To put this payment status in context, accruing TDR balances totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $1.9 billion today. This means that over 2/3 of the accruing TDRs have aged at least six months. And as you can see on the slide, 88% of the accruing TDRs are current on principal and interest payments at the end of March. The primary means by which these accruing residential TDRs exit the portfolio is to pay off or refinance. 
The $400 million of current but not accruing TDRs will continue to be reported as non-accruing until they go through a six-month period, after which they will move into an accruing TDRs status. Accruing TDRs that become 120 days past due are moved to a non-accrual TDR status.
Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs has continued to exceed our expectations during the first quarter. With 95% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio is much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than it is to a restructured portfolio. Obviously, performance on this portfolio could deteriorate, however, we are pleased with the performance today. 
I will summarize the keypoints from today's credit update before turning the call back over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 21.
Overall, asset quality has improved, however, nonperforming loans and charge-offs remain high. During the quarter, early stage delinquencies, base charge-offs and nonperforming loans all declined, while nonperforming assets were stable. 
Improvements in base charge-offs and delinquencies were broad-based among the portfolios. Balances continue to decline and asset quality metrics can continue to improve in our consumer residential real estate portfolios. $182 million in incremental charge-offs were recorded in the quarter for a change in internal policy for aged first mortgage NPLs and for a small portfolio of nonperforming loans that was transferred to held-for-sale. 
The pace of mortgage modifications slowed considerably in the fourth quarter, and the proportion that is current on principal and interest payments increased slightly from last quarter to 73%. At the current time, we expect overall second quarter charge-offs to be stable to down versus the first quarter. The run rate of base charge-offs of roughly $640 million is expected to be stable to slightly up, depending on the status of residential construction workouts and the pace of improvement in consumer portfolios. 
Of course, if we were to decide to sell additional nonperforming loans, that would also influence where we fall within the overall expected range of charge-offs. With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Before we take questions, I'm going to wrap up from key takeaways from today's call. We posted a loss in the quarter driven largely by elevated credit cost and soft revenue generation, specifically related to loan demand and certain non-interest income items. As you know, the impact of the recession on our asset quality and earnings will take awhile to recede. However, the process of improvement now appears to have clearly begun. 
Asset quality improved again this quarter and leading indicators suggest further improvement during the remainder of the year. Our capital position remains solid. We believe that we have strong capital today and enough capital to leverage for growth as the economy strengthens tomorrow. Liquidity and funding have been well managed as have expenses.  Perhaps most importantly, we've made a lot of little changes that have improved daily execution, increased accountability and enhanced products and services. 
We have more work to do here, but these actions are gaining momentum in improving client satisfaction.

Glad you're with us this morning. Our first quarter results improved to a loss of $0.46 versus a loss of a $0.64 last quarter as earnings continue to be impacted by all the credit costs.

Our first quarter results improved to a loss of $0.46 versus a loss of a $0.64 last quarter as earnings continue to be impacted by all the credit costs. Our overall home price depreciation slowed as uncertainty remains around the direction of future home prices especially in certain markets. revenue remains soft driven by the decline in mortgage production volume coupled with a mark to market losses on our fair value publicly held debt. 
Also, loan demand is yet to pick up as clients are focused on capital preservation and debt reduction have accessed the debt  markets in lieu of the bank loans. However, as the economy has shown signs of improvement so have our results. The most notable sign of improvement was an asset quality, which resulted in a significant decrease in credit-related costs compared to last quarter. 
Charge-offs remain stable compared to the fourth quarter, though if you exclude the actions that Tom Freeman will detail later in the call, charge-offs would have declined sequentially. Additionally, nonperforming assets, the allowance for loan losses in 90 plus delinquencies, were all stable quarter to quarter, while provision expenses, nonperforming loans and early stage delinquencies all decreased. We believe this marks a continuation of improved asset quality trends as the improvements in charge-offs and delinquencies were broad-based among the portfolios, and we experienced in the second sequential quarter of overall positive asset quality metrics. 
In addition to the apparent beginning of economic improvement, our client-focused strategies, lower cost deposit mix and expense management discipline also contributed to encouraging operating trends.  Favorable deposit mixed trends continue this quarter with growth in money market balances and a decrease in higher cost time deposits. 
After an extended period of growth, consumer and commercial deposits were stable, the trend one would expect with the economic improvement. However, we are improving client satisfaction in getting to the drivers  that build loyalty by understanding individual preferences and aligning our business model to respond in a fashion that is improving client satisfaction and retention. 
The net interest margin increased due largely to our ability to shift our funding mix to lower cost deposits and to improved loan pricing. Stable client deposits and improvements enabled  a reduction in higher cost sources of funding and that, along with lower rates paid, pushed the margin higher. 
The result of this disciplined expense management was evident across controlling operating expenses again this quarter. We continue to capitalize upon the strength we have built and remain focused on continually covering efficiency improvement opportunities. And those cycle costs, including other real estate and credit and collection costs, are collectively high. They are down significantly from the prior quarter from the same quarter of last year.
What this all comes down to is that the positive results from improved economic conditions and our continuing efforts are reflected in various aspects of core performance. Notable examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, the impact of asset liability management actions on margin and expense management. We remain focused on uncovering opportunities to improve execution across the organization as we seek to increase client satisfaction to grow our core business.
Turning to Slide 4, I'll spend a moment discussing our capital position before turning the call over to Mark. As you can see, Slide 4 depicts our current estimated capital ratios and book value per share. We maintained a solid capital position with an estimated Tier 1 common ratio of 7.65% and a Tier 1 ratio exceeding 13%. We continue to have substantial liquidity as deposit inflows have been largely retained in cash and invested in high-quality government-backed securities. Book value was $35.40 and tangible common was $22.76 at the close of the quarter. 
 Our position on TARP repayment remains unchanged. We are well-positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time. Secondly, last week we announced that we are exploring options relating to RidgeWorth. We are simply continuing our long-standing practice of evaluating ways to manage our business mix, to maximize value for our shareholders. This evaluation does not apply to the majority of our Wealth Management business and is not tied to any eminent  move on our part to repay TARP. Even if we do move forward with the transaction, the impact would not be material enough to have a significant effect on our capital planning or our financial results. 
To conclude, we believe that as economic recovery continues to gain traction, our strong capital position and level of liquidity will enable us to operate from a position of strength to capitalize on opportunities in the markets and businesses in which we compete and to drive improved shareholder value. We are increasingly encouraged by current operating trends and our outlook for the future. There are a number of factors, some internal, some external, that  cause us to believe that the worst is behind us. 
As economic recovery seems certain, remaining  uncertainty relates primarily to the pace and  the strength of the economic improvement and it's lingering impact on home prices. There are positive asset quality and operating trends give us reason to be optimistic about our performance as 2010 progresses. A strong foundation, coupled with our client-focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities and the long-term economic prospects of our markets, position us to deliver improving financial performance. So I'd like to turn the call over to Mark now."
305901,100326016,57144,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $229 million or $0.46 per share. As has been the ca",2339,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $229 million or $0.46 per share. As has been the case in recent quarters, the loss was driven by elevated charge-offs, cyclically sensitive expenses, and to a lesser extent, soft revenue generation in certain units. 
The effects of the recession also continued to impact our results. Loan demand remained weak, mortgage production volume declined significantly versus 2009 levels, and non-interest income declined sequentially in a number of our larger line items. However, the amount of the reported loss declined significantly compared to last quarter. Improved results were largely due to lower provision and non-interest expenses, lower mortgage repurchase reserves and a stable net interest margin. 
Overall, the improvement in our results is occurring coincident with the recovering economy and some of the positive trends are primarily related to the environment. But, on the other hand, we are directly driving improvement in many areas. 
Notable and visible examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, expense management and the impact of asset/liability management actions on net interest margin. Less noticeable now, but critically important to our future, is our increasing success in attracting and retaining clients with improved service and innovative products and services. 
So with that brief summary of first quarter results, I'll now shift to Slide 6 and a balance sheet review.  Overall, average loan balances, excluding non-accruals, declined 1% and 11% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. The decline in balances in our higher-risk categories continued. Construction balances continued their rapid decline, down another 14% in the current quarter and down 45% compared to last year. The residential mortgage and home equity line portfolios also continued their downward trend. 
Commercial and industrial loans reversed trend and increased slightly. However, the increase was due to bringing an average of $1.4 billion back on the balance sheet as a result of FAS 167. Excluding this impact, C&I continued its downward trend, although the pace of decline slowed considerably. 
Line of credit utilization among our larger corporate and mid-size clients now averages 21% for our largest clients and 33% for our mid-size clients. While these utilization rates are down over 10 percentage points and five percentage points, respectively, the decline in this quarter was only two percentage points for larger clients and was stable for our mid-size clients. We are hopeful that borrowing by creditworthy clients will stabilize soon and then pick back up in the second half of the year. But our belief at this point is based largely on the slowing pace of decline in anecdotal information from dialogue with our clients. 
Now moving on to deposits at the bottom of the slide. You can see that core deposits declined slightly. However, please note that the positive shift in mix continued. Lower-cost deposit volumes increased as the small declines in DDA and NOW driven by seasonal commercial client activity were more than offset by growth in money market balances. The overall reduction in deposit balances was driven by CD balances which, similar to last quarter, were allowed to decline. 
We also reduced average broker and foreign deposits by $1.7 billion in the quarter or 33%. Our current liquidity position has enabled us to take the actions I just mentioned to refine and lower the cost of our funding profile. We also took actions with our securities portfolio, so please turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of the available-for-sale portfolio securities.
The portfolio continues to be concentrated in higher quality and very liquid assets. Government and agency securities in the first four rows are the bulk of the portfolio, with the treasuries being held  in anticipation of ultimate TARP repayment. The other equity holdings are largely Coke, Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.
During the quarter, we decreased our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and increased our asset-backed securities position. The overall portfolio grew significantly in 2009 due to the strong inflow of deposits and declining loan demand.  Given what appears to be an improving economy, and the higher probability that we are moving closer to an increasing rate environment, we began to take action to reduce our longer-term securities exposure. Specifically, we sold $2 billion in mortgage-backed securities during the quarter.  Additionally, for similar purposes, and in order to better diversify our portfolio, we sold U.S. agency debt and purchased asset-backed securities. The new ABS securities are high quality and are backed by newly-originated consumer automobile loans. 
We will continue to take actions that best balance our excess liquidity against returns while retaining maximum flexibility to respond to changes in the market environment.  
I'll now take a moment to talk about the margin on Slide 8.  Net interest margin expanded slightly this quarter, increasing by five basis points to 3.32%. We had originally expected some margin compression in the quarter driven by off-balance sheet consolidations, the full impact of the relatively low-yielding U.S. Treasury Securities and an expectation of decline in deposits. However, deposit volume, mix and pricing combined with improved loan pricing largely offset the negative impacts such that day count was the largest driver of margin expansion during the quarter. 
As we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we do not expect additional margin expansion in the near-term. In fact, day count benefit reversal combined with the scenario analysis around some of the key variables such as loan and deposit volumes, pricing and market interest rates, suggest margin can trend down slightly in the second quarter. 
For the second quarter and the remainder of the year, we are currently expecting margin to be relatively stable within a range around 3.25%. 
Moving to Slide 9, in provision expense. Now Tom will cover credit in detail in just a minute so I'm going to be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $862 million, down $112 million from the fourth quarter. Charge-offs of $821 million in the quarter approximately equaled the fourth quarter level. Please note the increase in charge-off ratio is therefore purely driven by lower outstanding loan balances. 
Charge-offs  this quarter include two actions totaling $182 million that  Tom will review in detail in a few minutes. The reason I mention it now is to make the point that if these additional steps had not been taken during the quarter, net charge-offs would have declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. 
The increase in the allowance for loan losses was $56 million in the quarter compared to $96 million in the fourth quarter, which brings the allowance to $3.2 billion and 2.8% of loans. The reserve was relatively stable, including a reduction in the reserve on unfunded commitments. Despite the notable improvement in asset quality, the allowance remained relatively stable for the time being as the outlook for economic improvement and home values remains uncertain.
Now moving on to non-interest income on Slide 10. Non-interest income in the quarter was down 6% and down 38% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. After adjustments for certain items in each quarter, non-interest income actually increased by 4% and then declined 28%, respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains and, as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail for those adjustments in the appendix of today's presentation.
In the quarter the largest adjustments are for fair value securities marks and the $20 million loss associated with our fair value debt and related hedges as SunTrust's credit spread continued to tighten. The primary reason for the adjusted year-over-year decline in non-interest income is a roughly $280 million reduction in mortgage production income, driven by a nearly 60% decline in origination volume. Income was also negatively affected by $100 million increase in mortgage, rep and warrant costs on a year-over-year basis. 
On a sequential basis, the increase in non-interest income is mostly due to mortgage-related revenues. Rep and warranty costs, which are included in mortgage production income, declined by $92 million mortgage-servicing income increased primarily due to the performance of the MSR asset and our related hedges.  Additionally, core trading income improved sequentially driven by increased fixed income sales and trading client revenues and improved performance in corporate treasury. 
Sequential revenue declines were recorded in Trust and Investment Management income and service charges on deposit accounts. Trust income declined primarily due to annual performance fees reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in service charge revenue was driven by a lower rate of NSF OD incidences in the quarter. 
We are actively engaged in analyzing and preparing to implement required changes to our service charge practices as required by Reg E on July 1. Based on different scenarios for client opt-in, we could see a reduction in our overall service charge income of 10% to 20% during the second half of this year. We also believe that the initial reduction of fee income will be greater in the first quarter or two after implementation as clients continue to opt in and as we in the industry develop new and enhanced products and services. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, and more detail around  the mortgage rep and warranty repurchase trends will be provided. This slide depicts the mortgage rep and warranty related trends. This is the same information presented last quarter updated with the first quarter results. The top left portion of this slide highlights the increasing impact on earnings and growth in the reserve during 2009. 
In the first quarter of 2010, the reserve increased only slightly, but charge-offs declined significantly. Specifically, the line item labeled ""Additions"" represents the cost reported as a reduction to mortgage production income in the quarter, and you can see that the cost declined to $128 million in the first quarter as compared to $220 million in the fourth quarter of last year. 
The charge-offs recognized in the first quarter declined to $118 million or $10 million less than the additions to the reserve. This resulted in a modest increase in the overall reserve to $210 million.
The graph on the right illustrates why losses declined and reserves were stable. New request volume declined in the quarter and the inventory of pending requests continued its decline. While we are pleased that new request volume declined, it is not clear to us how much of the decline may be related to seasonality, sustainable cyclical factors or simply agency workflows. As a result, we are not expecting new request volumes to decline significantly in the near-term. 
On the bottom left of the slide, you can see that the vintage of repurchase request was basically stable on sequential basis, with most of the volume coming from higher loss vintages in 2007 and prior. We do expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination of vintages will continue to shift new request volume to newer vintages over time. 
On the bottom right are some key statistics that illustrate the lower risk profile of the newer vintages. Lower levels of Alt-A, higher FICO and the higher percentage of full doc loans and newer vintages suggest lower frequency of  losses. Newer vintages exhibit lower LTVs and were originated during and after a period of significant home price depreciation. This suggests that in addition to lower frequency of loss, new vintages will experience lower loss severity as well. 
In conclusion, near-term losses and reserve levels will largely be driven by the volume of new repurchase requests. While new request volumes are difficult to predict, if they stabilize at first quarter levels, we expect charge-offs and reserves to decline gradually over the remainder of 2010 as the shift to newer vintages naturally occurs. However, if new request volumes increase and/or older vintage request volumes remain high, charge-offs and reserves could remain at current levels or even higher.
Now turning to Slide 12 for review of expenses. Non-interest expense declined 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2009, and 6% compared to last quarter. On this slide, we have adjusted for some items that are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation. 
There were no large adjustments during the current quarter. The large adjustment in the first quarter of last year was primarily related to goodwill impairment. Excluding certain adjustments, expenses were down 5% compared to last year and down 4% compared to last quarter. We've included an analysis of key items impacting the comparison. 
The total year-over-year decrease in adjusted expenses is approximately $64 million. Reductions in credit-related and pension expenses contributed to the positive expense performance as they declined year-over-year, while FDIC-related expenses clearly increased. 
The net of these three items is a $54 million decrease in expenses, and the expense changed net of these items is a decrease of $10 million noted at the bottom. This means that excluding special items and cyclically sensitive expenses, the net of all other expenses is down slightly on a year-over-year basis. 
The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is exactly the same. So the highlights of what I've discussed this morning are that, one, our earnings losses narrowed; two, the provision expense declined due to improved asset quality; three, margin increased despite weak loan demand driven by continued shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits; four, non-interest income remains soft, though improved, versus last quarter, in part due to a decline in mortgage and warranty costs; and, finally, non-interest expenses have declined as cyclically  sensitive expenses are lower and we have managed all other expenses tightly. 
We are encouraged by current operating and economic trends. The remaining questions are related to how quickly and strongly the economy recovers and where home prices will trend from here. At this time, we are looking forward to continued improvement in our results our 2010 progresses. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."

As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early state delinquencies all decreased. Additionally, charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses and 90 plus delinquencies were all stable quarter-to-quarter.
A couple of numbers on the slide were influenced by actions we took in the quarter related to nonperforming loans. While overall charge-offs were flat quarter-over-quarter at $821 million, the base level of charge-offs was lower. Added to this lower base were incremental charge-offs on aged residential mortgage non-performers, resulting from a change in policy. We also decided to sell a portfolio of mortgage loans and, as a result, reduced nonperforming loans and recorded an incremental charge-off. I will address these actions in more detail later in the presentation.
Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio view of asset quality illustrates broad-based improvement in early-stage delinquencies among the consumer portfolios. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of the improvement in early state delinquencies. Overall, charge-offs remain stable at $821 million, with the charge-off ratio increasing due purely to a reduction in loan balances. As in past quarters, absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real estate related portfolios, including residential mortgages, home equity products, land and residential construction. 
The commercial portfolio continues to perform well overall. Commercial loan charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies were stable in the quarter and nonperforming loans declined by over $100 million for the third quarter in a row. We continue to see some potential for volatility in more cyclically sensitive industries. However, our view is that overall C&I asset quality is stable and improving at this point in the cycle.
Overall, the commercial real estate portfolio, including owner occupied and income producing properties, is performing well. The charge-off ratio in the quarter remained in the single digits and early-stage delinquencies were stable. While commercial real estate nonperforming loans increased in the quarter to $464 million, they represent a relatively low 3% of the portfolio. 
Given the conditions in the commercial real estate market, we expect additional stress and credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also believe our portfolio will perform comparatively well given this composition and the way it was underwritten. 
As noted a moment ago, asset quality improved in consumer portfolios. Early-stage delinquencies declined across most portfolios and charge-off ratios were stable to down. The only exception were in the residential 1-4 family and credit card portfolios.
The 1-4 family charge-off ratio increased due to actions we took related to nonperforming loans. The dollar increase in credit card charge-offs was $7 million due to one-time timing adjustment associated with bringing credit card servicing in-house.
I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now I will summarize. 
Overall, home equity performance has been stable as charge-offs were generally flat while early-stage delinquencies declined. Early-stage delinquencies declined meaningfully in the mortgage portfolio and the increase in charge-offs was entirely related to our decision to sell assets and a change in accounting policy. 
Construction charge-offs declined by almost one half. We expect more charge-offs in this portfolio with uneven quarter-to-quarter results due to the nature of the workout process. However, I can assure you that we are aggressively pursuing a resolution of non-performers in this portfolio.
Next, I'm going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail beginning with the residential mortgage portfolio on Slide 15. Asset quality in the residential mortgage portfolio continued to show improvement in the first quarter, although this portfolio continues to perform poorly on an absolute basis. 
The key point this quarter is that balances were flat and asset quality in the large portfolio improved. Please note that overall core balances were flat as a result of the repurchase of nearly $500 million in government-guaranteed Ginnie Mae mortgages.  In addition, while higher risk segment balances continued to decline, asset quality metrics for these portfolios were stable. The impact of our decision to sell assets and the change in our charge-off accounting policy on long-dated foreclosures is evident in the asset quality metrics on the slide.  However, the improvement in early stage delinquencies noted earlier was not impacted by our actions and, as a result, our outlook for this portfolio is improved. Early-stage delinquencies trends indicate a lower frequency of default in the future. 
Additionally, home price deterioration appears to be slowing in a number of our markets. There remains risk to this outlook. First, sustained softness in jobs among our markets could impact the frequency of loss.  Second, loss severity could be negatively impacted by weakness in home values resulting from an influx of foreclosed homes into the market, higher mortgage rates and the elimination of government subsidies for homebuyers. This dynamic is particularly true in Florida. 
The net result is that while we are optimistic about the future, there are market headwinds outside of our control that could negatively impact asset quality. However, even with those risks in mind, our outlook for charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio has improved.
Moving to home equity lines on Slide 16. Overall, the home equity portfolio performance has been relatively stable. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by higher risk segments of the portfolio, loans that were originated to third parties, loans in Florida, and loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Balances in these segments continue to decline due to run off and charge-offs, with no new production and little line availability. 
Core portfolio balances, which represent approximately 70% of the HELOC portfolio, were basically stable. The core portfolio performed better than the higher risk segments but showed a sequential increase in charge-offs in the first quarter of roughly $10 million due to higher losses  related to consumer bankruptcies. 
Now if you turn to Slide 17, I will talk about our construction portfolio.  Construction balances declined over 13% in the quarter or nearly $900 million. To put this in context, construction balances in 2007 exceeded $14 billion and are now down nearly $9 billion or 60%. Construction to perm portfolio balances and non-performers continued to wind down as new production remains minimal and work-out efforts continue on the non-performers. 
Residential builder charge-offs decreased significantly this quarter due to the uneven nature of timing in the workout process. We continue to aggressively manage the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. As a result, and due to continued variability on land values, we expect charge-offs in this portfolio to increase next quarter.  However, as I just mentioned, the basic metric of the process particularly in the judicial foreclosure state of Florida renders timing difficult to gauge with accuracy. 
This is truly a timing issue, not an income issue since we continue to be comfortable with the reserves on this portfolio.  It is also important to note that 30 days plus delinquency declined significantly again this quarter in the largest portfolios while the A&D portfolio segments and the overall portfolio showed increases.  In fact, this increase in the overall delinquency ratio was purely a denominator issue since the dollars delinquent declined by $8 million. 
The A&D delinquency increase stands out that the higher ratios are driven by lower balances combined with a small dollar increase in delinquencies. In the legacy builder A&D segment, delinquent dollars increased by $7 million while the commercial A&D increase was due to 15 loans totaling $12 million. 
Construction-related nonperforming loans increased somewhat this quarter. However, we continue to believe that nonperforming loans in the builder portfolio are at or near their peak.
The majority of loans in the portfolio that are going to have problems have been identified and are in the workout process. As these workouts progress, we expect that related charge-offs will increase next quarter and remain elevated and uneven in the remainder of 2010.  Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined significantly, charge-offs declined and non-performers increased only modestly. 
Please turn to Slide 18, where I will cover the nonperforming loan actions we took this quarter. As I noted earlier, we took actions this quarter that impacted the level of nonperforming loans and charge-offs. In the table on the left, you can see that the impact of these actions was to increase charge-offs by $182 million over base charge-offs of $639 million that we would have reported otherwise. 
Nonperforming loan balances were reduced by $342 million as a result of these actions. This represents the sum of the health for sale carrying balance of $116 million plus $182 million charge-off. 
Let me describe the two actions we took in more detail including our rationale.  The first action was a change in our process of recording charge-offs on residential mortgage nonperforming loans. Specifically, we recorded $131 million in incremental charge-offs on first-lien residential mortgage loans that have been in the foreclosure process for more than 12 months. Our previous practice was to charge the loan down to an average of 85% of market value and 180 days past due and not record for the charge-offs until the time of foreclosure. 
In the extent of foreclosure time frame, particularly in Florida, and the decline in value that occurred in collateral values, we determined it would be appropriate to record an additional adjustment 12 months after the initial charge-off.  Our original charge-off policy did not envision that foreclosure time frames would extend well beyond 12 months. 
Additionally, it makes more sense to make this change now that property values in many markets appear to be stabilizing. This action accelerates the timing of when we recognize the potential additional charge-offs resulting from foreclosure. 
The $131 million brings forward charge-offs that we would have reported later. We do not believe the impact of this policy adjustment in future quarters will be material. One final note on this topic. The change applies only to residential first-lien mortgages primarily held in Florida.
The second action in the quarter was the decision to sell $211 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. As a result, we recorded an incremental charge-off of $51 million in the quarter and classified these loans as held for sale. We are actively marketing this portfolio and intend to complete the sale in the second quarter. We have chosen to take this action now as liquidity and market pricing for nonperforming mortgage loans has improved as the decline in underlying home values has slowed. 
The improvement in the market is evidenced by the relatively small additional charge-off, especially when viewed in light of the concentration of loans in this portfolio that are located in Florida and California. In addition, the size of the portfolio is rather small and allows us to test market appetite in pricing for various geographic and product profiles.
The sale also allows us to better allocate default management resources and believe the time and expense of long foreclosure time frames for selected loans.
Please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting troubled-debt restructures or TDRs.
The key point to take away from this slide are that the pace of mortgage modifications has slowed and that 95% of the growth in TDRs in the quarter was a new growing category. TDRs increased by less than $300 million in the current quarter as compared to over $500 million in each of the previous two quarters. The slower pace of growth is primarily related to a lower inflow of newly delinquent loans and, also, fewer modifications of more seriously vulnerable ones.  Non-accruing TDRs increased by $14 million in the quarter as compared to $236 million in the fourth quarter. 
The last point I'd like to make here is that TDRs continue to be almost exclusively first and second lien residential mortgages and home-equity lines of credit. Additional detail on the performance of our modified loans is included on the next slide. This table shows that 73% of the TDRs are current on all principal and interest payments.  An additional 13% are in early stage delinquency. To put this payment status in context, accruing TDR balances totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $1.9 billion today. This means that over 2/3 of the accruing TDRs have aged at least six months. And as you can see on the slide, 88% of the accruing TDRs are current on principal and interest payments at the end of March. The primary means by which these accruing residential TDRs exit the portfolio is to pay off or refinance. 
The $400 million of current but not accruing TDRs will continue to be reported as non-accruing until they go through a six-month period, after which they will move into an accruing TDRs status. Accruing TDRs that become 120 days past due are moved to a non-accrual TDR status.
Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs has continued to exceed our expectations during the first quarter. With 95% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio is much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than it is to a restructured portfolio. Obviously, performance on this portfolio could deteriorate, however, we are pleased with the performance today. 
I will summarize the key points from today's credit update before turning the call back over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 21.
Overall, asset quality has improved, however, nonperforming loans and charge-offs remain high. During the quarter, early stage delinquencies, base charge-offs and nonperforming loans all declined, while nonperforming assets were stable. 
Improvements in base charge-offs and delinquencies were broad-based among the portfolios. Balances continue to decline and asset quality metrics can continue to improve in our consumer residential real estate portfolios. $182 million in incremental charge-offs were recorded in the quarter for a change in internal policy for aged first mortgage NPLs and for a small portfolio of nonperforming loans that was transferred to held-for-sale. 
The pace of mortgage modifications slowed considerably in the fourth quarter, and the proportion that is current on principal and interest payments increased slightly from last quarter to 73%. At the current time, we expect overall second quarter charge-offs to be stable to down versus the first quarter. The run rate of base charge-offs of roughly $640 million is expected to be stable to slightly up, depending on the status of residential construction workouts and the pace of improvement in consumer portfolios. 
Of course, if we were to decide to sell additional nonperforming loans, that would also influence where we fall within the overall expected range of charge-offs. With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Before we take questions, I'm going to wrap up from key takeaways from today's call. We posted a loss in the quarter driven largely by elevated credit cost and soft revenue generation, specifically related to loan demand and certain non-interest income items. As you know, the impact of the recession on our asset quality and earnings will take awhile to recede. However, the process of improvement now appears to have clearly begun. 
Asset quality improved again this quarter and leading indicators suggest further improvement during the remainder of the year. Our capital position remains solid. We believe that we have strong capital today and enough capital to leverage for growth as the economy strengthens tomorrow. Liquidity and funding have been well managed as have expenses.  Perhaps most importantly, we've made a lot of little changes that have improved daily execution, increased accountability and enhanced products and services. 
We have more work to do here, but these actions are gaining momentum in improving client satisfaction.

I think in the mortgage business, there are several other places that are longer-time consumers than some of the shorter-term things we've done in the last year or so.  So there's a fair amount of that. We've also done a lot of research and product development sort of work that's going on that we think will enhance revenues. The basic issue, obviously, is whether or not C&I loan growth or any other sort of loan growth shows up and when does it show up. But as a general proposition, we've been investing all the way through this thing both in the expense side in terms of cutting costs and increasing productivity as well as in the revenue side in new products and training and those kinds of things. So, actually, the answer is both."

305901,106631818,68469,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Good morning again, everyone. I'm glad you're with us this morning. Our loss significantly narrowed to $0.11 this quarter versus a $0.46 per share loss last quarter, as our operating trends gained momentum. Specifically, asset quality continued to improve",1182,"Good morning again, everyone. I'm glad you're with us this morning. Our loss significantly narrowed to $0.11 this quarter versus a $0.46 per share loss last quarter, as our operating trends gained momentum. Specifically, asset quality continued to improve. We had substantial revenue growth over last quarter, and we maintained favorable deposit volumes and mix. Furthermore, the pace of the loan balance decline has clearly slowed.
As we've been articulating for some time, we've been focused on positioning our businesses for growth as we come out of this cycle, and we're starting to see the benefits of those efforts. And though macro economic indicators are mixed, and there are uncertainty in our operating environment as it relates to financial regulation and the potential impact from the Gulf oil spill, we are increasingly encouraged by the operating trends that we're seeing. 
Revenue grew compared to last quarter with growth across our core fee income category. We find this broad-based growth positive and believe that while the operating environment remains challenging, some economic traction coupled with our client-focused strategies generated these favorable results. We also had some non-core gains related to the sale of securities and fair value adjustments that Mark will detail shortly. 
Net interest income and net interest margin were stable compared to last quarter but grew significantly compared to the prior year, up 8% and 39 basis points, respectively. The net interest margin increased due largely to the continued shifts in our funding mix to lower-cost deposits. Client deposit growth and improved mix enabled the reduction in higher-cost sources of funding and that, along with the lower rates pace, has had a significant impact on margin over the last year. Overall, we continue to make progress in our efforts to improve client satisfaction and our focus on the drivers that build loyalty. We're confident that this approach is having an impact.
Our core expenses remain tightly managed as we continue to capitalize upon the strength that we've built. This will remain focused on recovering efficiency improvement opportunities. This was evident in our personnel-related expenses, which were down compared to last year. Cyclical costs do remain high, and we also incurred debt extinguishment costs during the quarter, and Mark will provide more detail around those items, which drove the overall expense number higher this quarter. 
Asset quality trends continue to improve. Non-performing assets, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses all declined this quarter. Though early-stage delinquencies were up slightly, more than all of that increase was due to government guaranteed loan delinquencies. Excluding such loans, early-stage delinquencies were down six basis points. While Construction charge-offs increased as we expected, there was broad-based improvement in the remainder of the portfolio. 
Consistent with our efforts to align our businesses and services for the long-term satisfaction of our targeted clients, last week, we announced the completion of our strategic review of RidgeWorth, we reached definitive agreement for Federated to acquire approximately $17 billion of managed liquidity assets. We expect to record a relatively small gain in the fourth quarter that includes an upfront payment plus the estimated present value of a five-year earn-out. We believe RidgeWorth's core fixed income and equity asset management businesses offer future attractive growth opportunities for SunTrust.
In summary, we believe that modestly improving economic conditions are positively reflecting results and our efforts to position ourselves for growth beyond the cycle are evidencing themselves in our core performance. We are well positioned and with solid capital and liquidity, we operate from a position of strength. We're committed to investing in growth businesses, managing expenses prudently and returning the company to profitability. 
And though lingering operating environment uncertainties certainly exist, we remain encouraged by improving results and prospects. Two particular items that we're all interested in and obviously, have been topical in recent months include the Gulf oil spill and financial regulation. I'll first address the oil spill on Slide 4. 
While we realize that there is no way to predict the ultimate economic impact of the oil spill and the effect that it could have on asset quality, I wanted to provide some color on our exposure to areas currently being affected. Specifically, this slide shows our loan exposure on the Florida Panhandle region. We have a relatively small presence in this area with $1.3 billion in loans outstanding, and when you consider commercial loans to borrowers and industries that are particularly susceptible to the impact of the oil spill, the gray shaded parts of the chart, our outstanding balances are just $93 million. Though we have a small exposure, we are on top of it. We sent lenders and senior management into the affected markets to monitor the overall climate and the needs, and we continue to assess our risks and our responses. At this time, we have taken no broad actions but we are working individually with clients that have been affected.
Our entire Gulf Coast exposure, which for us, constitutes the Gulf Coast of Florida and a small amount of Alabama, is understandably larger. However, it too is well diversified with less than $1 billion in commercial loans and those industries that would be particularly vulnerable: Real estate, consumer products and services and retailing. Recent forecast suggests that there is a very high likelihood that much of this region will not be impacted by the spill. 
While we believe that our relative exposure in the area currently most impacted by the oil spill is minimal, we know that in no way diminishes the impact on our clients and teammates living and working there. It's clear that the ultimate impact of this environmental tragedy has yet to be determined and we are committed to helping the region and its residents recover.
In that same vein, we're obviously closely monitoring changes to financial regulation. While some of the uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform has been resolved, it remains unclear what material effects the changes will have in terms of the economic recovery, in terms of consumer confidence and the global competitiveness of our industry. The real work of translating legislative policies into laws, regulations, rules, practices and procedures, that will directly affect our industry is just now beginning and will take time to complete. Some of our regulations once written, will have little to no impact on our results, the Volcker rule, for instance. Conversely, other items will have a quantifiable effect in the near term such as Regulation E and the new regulations regarding debit interchange fees. Mark Chancy will provide some additional commentary on these topics.
I'd like to conclude here by saying that we have a process in place for evaluating these items, we will actively engage in development of these rules and regulations, and we will react accordingly as clarity is provided. 
To conclude, I will reiterate that we are encouraged by recent operating trends. The strong foundation we have created, coupled with our client-focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities and a long-term economic prospects in our markets, position SunTrust well for the future. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?"

I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $56 million or $0.11 per share. The net effect of",2763,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. 
For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $56 million or $0.11 per share. The net effect of securities gains, debt extinguishment cost and mark-to-market gains on our debt contributed a positive $0.07 per share to the quarter. And even after adjusting for these items, the earnings per share loss narrowed significantly from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $0.46 and $0.41 per share, respectively. Also, the company did generate positive earnings before preferred dividends this quarter. 
As in prior quarters, the net earnings losses driven by the recessionary environment with elevated net charge-offs, high cyclical expenses and tepid loan demand. Despite these impacts, there were a number of positive trends that drove continued improvement in our financials. The recovering, albeit, uneven economy contributed to a portion of our improved results. This improvement was most notable in the $200 million decline in our provision expense from the first quarter, which was driven by continued favorable credit trends. 
Additionally, we also saw the positive benefits from actions that we have been taking to drive better performance. This improvement was especially evident in higher sequential fee income across a broad range of categories. We also saw continued favorable shifts in our deposit mix, which together with our proactive asset liability management actions, drove stable net interest income and margin on a sequential basis, as well as 8% net interest income growth and 39 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year.
With that brief summary of our second quarter results, I'll now shift to Slide 6, which provides a summary balance sheet. Average loan balances, excluding non-accruals, were down 1% and 10% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. Overall demand remain muted but we did see a continued slowing in the pace of balance declines and slight growth in certain categories. 
Overall, balance declines continue to be driven by our higher risk categories, most notably Construction, which was down 20% from the prior quarter and accounted for over 1/2 of our sequential decline in total loan balances. Increases in consumer loans essentially offset declines in the commercial loan category. Consumer direct and indirect loans grew 6% and 4%, respectively versus the prior quarter, with growth primarily driven by student and auto loans. 
Commercial Loans were down 2%. The balance decline in this category was the smallest since the fourth quarter of 2008, which is the last time that we saw core growth in this portfolio. Now you will recall that we reported growth in this loan category last quarter but it was entirely driven by the impact of the implementation of FAS 167. 
Line of credit utilization rates stabilized somewhat in the second quarter, down about 150 basis points for our larger corporate clients and flat for our midsized clients. We continue to remain hopeful that loan demand from credit-worthy borrowers will increase, and that loan growth will return in the second half of the year. While the slowing pace of loan decline provides some optimism that this could occur in 2010, we continue to remain uncertain of the exact magnitude and timing of a pick up in demand.
Now moving onto deposits at the bottom of the slide. You can see that core deposits increased, and that the positive shift in mix continued. Balance increases were driven by lower-cost deposits, specifically DDA [demand deposit account] and money market, which both grew 4% sequentially or about $2.4 billion combined. Other CD balances declined $1 billion in the quarter as we continue to allow run-off in this portfolio, particularly single-service CDs. 
We also further reduced our brokered and foreign deposits, which were down approximately $760 million this quarter and 60% year-over-year. Overall, we have significantly enhanced our liquidity position during this past year, primarily via the growth of lower-cost deposits. This increase in deposits has enabled us to take a series of actions to reduce our higher-cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our cost of funds.
Not depicted on this slide, but one such additional action in this regard that occurred toward the end of the quarter was the early termination of $900 million in debt. This debt carried a coupon of approximately 5% and had about two years to maturity, and the cost associated with this termination of $63 million is included in the quarter's expenses. We also took actions with our securities portfolio, so let's turn to Slide 7.
Our total available for sale portfolio stood at $27.6 billion at the end of the quarter. In an effort to manage our interest rate risk profile, as well as to reposition the portfolio in areas where we saw relative value, we executed a series of transactions during the quarter. 
Most notably, we extended our U.S. Treasury position and grew the MBS portfolio via purchasing $2.5 billion of mortgage-backed agency securities. The MBS purchase was funded via $1 billion sale of bullet U.S. agencies, as well as from our deposit growth. The collective actions taken during the quarter yielded $57 million in securities gains. 
The portfolio continues to be concentrated in high quality and very liquid securities. Government and agency securities, which are the first four rows on the slide, constitute the vast majority of balances, and the other equity securities are largely Coca-Cola, Federal Reserve and FHLB stock. 
Going forward, we continue to have the flexibility to respond to changes in the environment and to take actions that best balance our excess liquidity position against current investment returns. I'll now take a moment to cover the margin on Slide 8.
Lower funding costs more than offset slightly lower asset yields in the quarter, contributing to a one basis point sequential improvement in net interest margin to 3.33%. Margin exceeded our prior expectations and guidance due primarily to better-than-expected deposit pricing and mix, and the effects of the aforementioned securities portfolio transactions. 
Relative to the prior year, margin is up 39 basis points. This improvement is driven primarily by the lower funding costs discussed earlier. In 2009 and early 2010, we also extended the duration of our Commercial Loan portfolio through a series of interest rate swaps, which have contributed a meaningful amount of net interest income in 2010, given the very low rate environment that has persisted throughout the year. 
Finally, we have improved our loan pricing discipline across the company, and this effort is evident in our loan yields. You will note that we have modified our expectations somewhat regarding the margin for the remainder of the year, as we now expect it to be within a range of 3.25% to 3.35%. This modification reflects the fact that the benefits that we are currently experiencing related to deposit pricing, the favorable deposit mix, our interest rate swap position and the early debt termination are likely to continue for the next couple of quarters. As a final comment on this slide, I will note that we remained modestly asset sensitive at the end of the quarter.
Let's now move to provision on Slide 9. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter were $662 million, down $200 million from the first quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Provision was $60 million less than charge-offs with $40 million of this differential coming from a reduction in the unfunded commitments reserve due to improved equity related to certain commercial and large corporate clients. 
Charge-offs were $722 million, a decrease of almost $100 million from the first quarter. Now you may recall that a move of certain non-performing loans to held for sale and a charge-off policy change increased first quarter charge-offs by a combined $182 million. When normalizing for these items, charge-offs in the second quarter were up $83 million sequentially, which was consistent with our expectations and driven as anticipated primarily by construction loans. Despite the notable improvement in asset quality in the quarter, the allowance ratio was held stable at 2.81%, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the direction of the economy and home values at this time. Now moving to non-interest income on Slide 10.
On a reported basis, non-interest income was up 36% sequentially and down 11% from the prior year. After adjusting for a number of items in each quarter, non-interest income increased by 12% and declined by 10%, respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains, and as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation. 
In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are the aforementioned $57 million in securities gains, as well as a $63 million gain associated with our fair value debt and related hedges. The primary drivers of the adjusted year-over-year decline are mortgage related. Production volumes declined roughly 60% from the prior year as refinancing activity waned. Mortgage repurchase losses were higher in the current quarter and the prior year quarter included a large MSR [Mortgage Servicing Rights] recovery. 
Focusing on the sequential quarter comparison, we posted increases across all major categories. Specifically, mortgage-related income was up $31 million due to the MSR hedge performance and higher production volumes, which more than offset a $20 million increase in repurchase losses. 
We also saw increases in key consumer and commercial fee-based categories. The company has been placing significant focus on servicing and growing our client base, and we believe the increases in these categories, which include mid to high single-digit sequential growth in service charges, card fees, trust income and retail investment services, are all evidence of our success. And importantly, much of this growth was from underlying drivers like an increase in the number of accounts, expanded client relationships and an increase in product usage.
I'll shift gears for a minute to provide you some additional color on the potential impact to SunTrust of regulatory reform. As you all know, and Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, the situation is fluid, and we are in the process of thoroughly evaluating the possible implications and the mitigating actions. To assist you in your own estimation process, we wanted to provide a little more color on three of our fee income streams that are amongst the most obvious items that could be impacted by the reform. 
First, I'll focus on deposit service charges. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected that Reg E could cause a 10% to 20% reduction in service charges. To date, the number of clients opting in, those that would be electing to continue their participation in overdraft coverage, has been well above our expectations. As such, we currently believe that the annualized impact to overdraft income will fall toward the lower end of our original range. 
Second, I'll turn to interchange. Consumer and small business debit card interchange contributed about $250 million in fee income during 2009. Now for clarity, that is our full year interchange revenue, not the impact that we expect Dodd-Frank to have on this fee income category, and we continue to develop our expectations around that matter. 
Third, I'll provide some color on derivatives. Derivatives contributed about $100 million in revenue in 2009, most of which was generated from end users. We do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes on derivatives will have a material impact on this revenue category for SunTrust. 
Finally, it's also obvious that regulatory costs will increase significantly, although the amount is difficult to quantify at this time. So let's now turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends.
This quarter, we increased the reserve for mortgage repurchases by $46 million. Mortgage repurchase costs, which are recorded as a reduction to mortgage production income, increased from $128 million in the first quarter to $148 million this quarter, while charge-offs declined by $16 million to $102 million. And despite this decline in charge-offs, we increased the reserve because new repurchase request volume was up during the quarter, though the request varied significantly by month. For example, April and May were relatively low months, while June was specially high. And while we have seen a significant decline in request volume month-to-date in July, it is too early in the third quarter to suggest that this reflects anything other than normal monthly volatility. 
The key points from the bottom part of this slide remain the same as we have discussed last quarter. Most of our current request volume is currently coming from the higher loss of vintages of 2007 and prior. We expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination of vintages over time will shift new request volume to newer vintages. As that occurs, we expect both lower loss frequencies and severities, as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics such as higher FICOs and lower original LTVs, and they were originated during or after the periods they experienced the most significant home price depreciation. 
In conclusion and consistent with what we told you last quarter, near-term losses and reserve levels will largely be driven by the volume of new repurchase requests, which are difficult to predict. If new request volume begins to taper off during the second half of the year, we expect charge-offs and reserves to likewise decline. However, if new request volumes increase or the expected shift towards newer vintages does not occur, then charge-offs and reserves could remain at current levels or higher. I'll now turn to Slide 12 for a review of expenses.
Non-interest expense declined 2% when compared to the second quarter of 2009 and increased 10% compared to last quarter. However, there were certain unusual items that warrant discussion and on this slide, we have adjusted for items that are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation. 
On an adjusted basis, expenses are up 3% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially. You will note at the bottom of the slide, the three primary drivers of the increases, which include credit-related costs, marketing and outside processing. These three categories explain almost the entirety of the year-over-year expense and all the $25 million of the sequential quarter increase. 
For both the year-over-year and sequential quarter comparisons, the drivers of growth in these particular categories are similar. Credit-related costs increased as a result of other real estate expenses. Marketing expenses were from planned promotional and advertising spending supporting our brand, and outside processing was largely due to investments aimed in enhancing our clients' banking experience and from higher volumes. 
I'll also provide you a little color on our personnel-related expenses as they evidence our continued focus on expense management. Employee compensation and benefits declined $21 million or 3% from the prior year and $9 million or 1% from the prior quarter. The reduction from the first quarter was driven largely by the approximate $25 million seasonal decline in FICA [Federal Insurance Contributions Act] and 401(k)expenses, partially offset by modest merit increases that took effect this quarter and higher incentive compensation associated with higher revenues. Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a brief discussion of capital.
Capital ratios remain solid this quarter and increased from first quarter levels. As a few selected highlights, Tier 1 Capital increased by an estimated 27 basis points from the first quarter to 13.4%. Tier 1 Common improved by an estimated 15 basis points to 7.85%, and tangible common equity increased 30 basis points to 7.18%, driven primarily by unrealized securities gains increasing other comprehensive income, which was also the cause for the expansion in our book and tangible book values per share. Given the continued strength in our capital position, our view that we are well positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time remains unchanged. Before concluding, I'll briefly summarize some of the key points I've discussed today.
We significantly narrowed our earnings loss this quarter and we're profitable before prepayment of preferred dividends. Provision declined due to improved asset quality without any reduction in the allowance as a percentage of loans. Favorable deposit trends continued. Net interest margin remained stable from the prior quarter and was up substantially from the prior year, primarily due to lower funding costs. Non-interest income grew sequentially across a broad range of categories, evidencing success in our client-centric initiatives. And non-interest expenses continue to be closely managed. We are encouraged by the trends in our performance, and despite continued uncertainty in the environment, we remain focused on continuing to drive improvements in our results. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality. Tom?"
305901,106631818,68469,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Today, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 14. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing assets al",1684,"Thanks, Mark. Today, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 14. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing assets all decreased significantly. Delinquencies and loan balances were stable to down, particularly in certain higher risk portfolio. Despite improved asset quality metrics in the current quarter, the Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses, as a percent of loans had been maintained at the prior quarter level in light of continued uncertainty regarding the strength of the economic recovery and trends in home values.
Aggregate loan balances continued to decline in the face of lower loan demand and line usage, as well as targeted actions taken regarding higher risk portfolios such as Construction. This modest decline matched the amount of new loan originations in the portfolio, particularly in commercial lending. Through the first six months of 2010, we have originated $6.9 billion in new C&I loan commitments and leases, which is a 32% increase over the first six months of 2009. 
Early-stage delinquencies represent 1.26% of the portfolio, up from 1.19% in the first quarter. This increase was driven by higher delinquencies in Federally-guaranteed student loans. After removing portfolios with Federal government guarantees for both quarters, the ratio improved to 98 basis points from 104 basis points last quarter, a six basis points improvement. We believe that the pace of improvement in delinquencies in some portfolios may slow as they approach historic numbers.
Other portfolios, such as Consumer and Commercial Real Estate are more closely aligned with the general economy and employment trends. We expect delinquencies in these portfolios to remain at elevated levels until conditions improve. 
Non-performing loans declined during the quarter by over $485 million, which represented the fourth consecutive quarterly decline. Non-performing assets declined by $580 million. Inflows into non-performing are trending down, which when coupled with our aggressive problem asset resolution efforts resulted in lower balances. 
Charge-offs of $722 million during the second quarter were in line with our expectations. The net charge-off ratio declined from 2.91% to 2.57%, with all portfolio showing improvement, except Commercial Real Estate and Construction. Charge-off activity continues to be centered in residential real estate-related portfolios, including residential mortgages, land and residential construction.
Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio view of asset quality illustrates generally improving credit quality. Charge-offs declined broadly among the portfolios. Early-stage delinquencies were stable to down, and balances in some of the highest risk portfolios continued to decline. The longer-term reduction in balances in higher risk portfolio is positive. For example, over the past 12 months, construction balances, including land, have gone nearly 40%. Alt-A balances have declined nearly 18% and higher risk home equity lines have declined 12%.
Commercial portfolios continues to perform satisfactorily overall. Commercial early-stage delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs were down quarter-over-quarter. Our view remains that overall C&I asset quality should improve. 
While the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, consisting of owner-occupied and investor-owned properties continues to perform reasonably well. Charge-offs, early-stage delinquencies and non-performing loans increased slightly from very low basis. In fact, the increase in charge-off ratio represents only a $10 million increase in charge-offs, while the increase in NPLs was only $51 million. Given the conditions in the Commercial Real Estate market, we expect additional stress in credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also continue to believe our portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition and the way it was underwritten.
Asset quality improved in the consumer portfolios, with lower early-stage delinquencies when Federally-guaranteed loans are excluded and charge-off ratios that were stable to down. I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and Construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now, I will summarize. 
Overall, Home Equity performance has been stable as balances and charge-offs declined, while early-stage delinquencies and non-performing loans were flat. Residential Mortgage charge-offs and delinquencies declined, while balances increased modestly. As noted last quarter, we expect the Construction charge-offs to increase, and in fact, was to level similar to what we experienced in the second half of 2009. We continue to expect the elevated charge-offs in this portfolio as problem loans move through the workout process. Next, I'm going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail, beginning with the Residential Mortgage portfolio on Slide 16.
Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of non-performing loans and delinquencies, driven in large part by the core portfolio. Growth in the core mortgage portfolio was predominantly tied to the originations of mortgages that have Federal government guarantees. Dollar delinquencies and non-performing loans in this portfolio improved by $15 million and $303 million, respectively. Non-performing balances declined in every segment of the portfolio. 
Delinquency trends in this portfolio imply a lower frequency of future loss and home price deterioration appears to be slowing in many of our markets. While our outlook for this portfolio is generally stable to improving, the pace of the economic recovery, covered with elevated unemployment rates and variability in housing prices could continue to negatively impact credit quality and the level and frequency of charge-offs.
I will now move to Slide 17 to discuss Home Equity loans. Home Equity portfolio balances and charge-offs continue to decline, while non-accruals were relatively low and stable. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by the higher risk segments of the portfolio, such as loans, which were originated by third parties, loans in Florida and loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Balances in these segments continue to decline but no new production and little line availability. Now if you will turn to Slide 18, I'll talk about our Construction portfolio.
We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to higher risk construction loans. Construction balances continued to decline rapidly, dropping 13% over the quarter. To put this in context, Construction balances in 2007 exceeded $14 billion and are now down by nearly $9 billion or 64%. The Construction Perm portfolio and non-accrual loan balances continue to wind down, as new production remains slow. Issues in this portfolio have been identified and work-out efforts related to older product continue. Construction non-performing loans decreased by 14% quarter-over-quarter, and we believe that residential non-performing loans will be stable to down in the future.
Construction delinquencies declined overall. The Residential Construction segment will remain problematic, with most of the portfolio being actively worked out. We expect delinquencies and losses related to Residential Construction to remain elevated, as we continue to resolve problem loans. While the timing of charge-offs is difficult to predict, we believe that this portfolio is appropriately reserved, and the problems have been aggressively addressed. 
Credit performance in the Commercial Construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined significantly, while charge-off ratios and non-performers increased only modestly. Please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our loan modification efforts and resulting troubled debt restructurings or TDRs.
TDRs increased by $360 million in the current quarter as compared to roughly $300 million last quarter and $500 million in each of the prior two quarters. Growth in consumer residential restructured loans, was about $260 million in the second quarter and was similar to the volume in the first quarter. Residential TDRs began slowing in the first quarter due to fewer newly delinquent loans and fewer modifications of more seriously delinquent loans. There's been an increase in commercial TDRs, primarily within non-accrual, income property loans. 
Commercial-related TDRs account for 8% of total TDRs and only 2% of accruing TDRs. We expect moderate growth in Commercial Real Estate TDRs over the near term. Accruing TDR balances totaled $2.3 billion at June 30. Accruing TDRs comprised 70% of total TDRs and 87% are current for interest and principal payments. Approximately 73% of accruing and non-accruing TDRs are current. Non-accruing TDRs have the potential to move to accrual status, if payment performance is sustained for a defined period of time. 
Overall, performance of the accruing TDRs continues to exceed our expectations during the second quarter. With 94% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio is much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than it is to a restructured portfolio. I'll summarize the key points from today's credit update before turning the call back over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 20. 
Overall, asset quality continue to improve in the quarter. Delinquencies were stable to down in most of the portfolios. Compared to the first quarter, non-performing loans and assets and charge-offs declined significantly. Significant progress has been made in reducing balances in higher risk portfolios over the past 12 to 18 months. We believe that the pace of improvement in delinquencies will slow, as delinquencies in certain portfolios approach historic norms. Other portfolios that are more closely aligned with the general economy and employment trends will remain elevated until conditions improve. Consumer and mortgage asset quality metrics generally improved. Construction charge-offs increased significantly and balances declined as we continue to aggressively work through the risk in this portfolio. 
The level of Residential Mortgage modifications were stable during the second quarter. There was an increase in commercial restructures, particularly in Commercial Real Estate. We expect modest increases in Commercial Real Estate TDRs for the near term. The proportion of TDRs that are current interest in principal and interest and payments improved from last quarter to 73%. Approximately 87% of all accruing TDRs are current on interest and principal payments.
At the current time, we expect overall charge-offs to be stable to down from the third quarter. Factors which could affect general asset quality and charge-offs levels include macro or regional economic volatility and trends within specific sectors, such as Commercial Real Estate. 
Finally, assuming no further material deterioration in the economy or asset quality metrics, the Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses likely peak from the first quarter. However, we maintain reserve levels for the time being, in light of continued economic and real estate value uncertainty. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'm glad you're with us this morning. Our loss significantly narrowed to $0.11 this quarter versus a $0.46 per share loss last quarter, as our operating trends gained momentum. Specifically, asset quality continued to improve",1185,"Good morning again, everyone. I'm glad you're with us this morning. Our loss significantly narrowed to $0.11 this quarter versus a $0.46 per share loss last quarter, as our operating trends gained momentum. Specifically, asset quality continued to improve. We had substantial revenue growth over last quarter, and we maintained favorable deposit volumes and mix. Furthermore, the pace of the loan balance decline has clearly slowed.
As we've been articulating for some time, we've been focused on positioning our businesses for growth as we come out of this cycle, and we're starting to see the benefits of those efforts. And though macro economic indicators are mixed, and there are uncertainty in our operating environment as it relates to financial regulation and the potential impact from the Gulf oil spill, we are increasingly encouraged by the operating trends that we're seeing. 
Revenue grew compared to last quarter with growth across our core fee income category. We find this broad-based growth positive and believe that though the operating environment remains challenging, some economic traction coupled with our client-focused strategies generated these favorable results. We also had some non-core gains related to the sale of securities and fair value adjustments that Mark will detail shortly. 
Net interest income and net interest margin were stable compared to last quarter, but grew significantly compared to the prior year, up 8% and 39 basis points, respectively. The net interest margin increased due largely to the continued shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits. Client deposit growth and improved mix enabled the reduction in higher cost sources of funding and that, along with the lower rates pace, has had a significant impact on margin over the last year. Overall, we continue to make progress in our efforts to improve client satisfaction and are focused on the drivers that build loyalty. We're confident that this approach is having an impact.
Our core expenses remain tightly managed as we continue to capitalize upon the strength that we've built. This will remain focused on recovering efficiency improvement opportunities. This was evident in our personnel-related expenses, which were down compared to last year. Cyclical costs do remain high, and we also incurred debt extinguishment costs during the quarter, and Mark will provide more detail around those items, which drove the overall expense number higher this quarter. 
Asset quality trends continue to improve. Non-performing assets, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses all declined this quarter. Though early-stage delinquencies were up slightly, more than all of that increase was due to government guaranteed loan delinquencies. Excluding such loans, early-stage delinquencies were down six basis points. While Construction charge-offs increased as we expected, there was broad-based improvement in the remainder of the portfolio. 
Consistent with our efforts to align our businesses and services for the long-term satisfaction of our targeted clients, last week, we announced the completion of our strategic review of RidgeWorth. We reached a definitive agreement for Federated to acquire approximately $17 billion of managed liquidity assets. We expect to record a relatively small gain in the fourth quarter that includes an upfront payment plus the estimated present value of a five-year earn-out. We believe RidgeWorth's core fixed income and equity asset management businesses offer future attractive growth opportunities for SunTrust.
In summary, we believe that modestly improving economic conditions are positively reflecting results and our efforts to position ourselves for growth beyond the cycle are evidencing themselves in our core performance. We are well positioned and with solid capital and liquidity, we operate from a position of strength. We're committed to investing in growth businesses, managing expenses prudently and returning the company to profitability. 
And though lingering operating environment uncertainties certainly exist, we remain encouraged by improving results and prospects. Two particular items that we're all interested in and obviously, have been topical in recent months include the Gulf oil spill and financial regulation. I'll first address the oil spill on Slide 4. 
While we realize that there is no way to predict the ultimate economic impact of the oil spill and the effect that it could have on asset quality, I wanted to provide some color on our exposure to areas currently being affected. Specifically, this slide shows our loan exposure on the Florida Panhandle region. We have a relatively small presence in this area with $1.3 billion in loans outstanding, and when you consider commercial loans to borrowers in industries that are particularly susceptible to the impact of the oil spill, the gray shaded parts of the chart, our outstanding balances are just $93 million. Though we have a small exposure, we are on top of it. We sent lenders and senior management into the affected markets to monitor the overall climate and the needs, and we continue to assess our risks and our responses. At this time, we have taken no broad actions but we are working individually with clients that have been affected.
Our entire Gulf Coast exposure, which for us, constitutes the Gulf Coast of Florida and a small amount of Alabama, is understandably larger. However, it too is well diversified with less than $1 billion in commercial loans in those industries that would be particularly vulnerable: Real estate, consumer products and services and retailing. Recent forecast suggests that there is a very high likelihood that much of this region will not be impacted by the spill. 
While we believe that our relative exposure in the area currently most impacted by the oil spill is minimal, we know that in no way diminishes the impact on our clients and teammates living and working there. It's clear that the ultimate impact of this environmental tragedy has yet to be determined and we are committed to helping the region and its residents recover.
In that same vein, we're obviously closely monitoring changes to financial regulation. While some of the uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform has been resolved, it remains unclear what material effects the changes will have in terms of the economic recovery, in terms of consumer confidence and the global competitiveness of our industry. The real work of translating legislative policies into laws, regulations, rules, practices and procedures, that will directly affect our industry is just now beginning and will take time to complete. Some of our regulations once written, will have little to no impact on our results, the Volcker rule, for instance. Conversely, other items will have a quantifiable effect in the near term such as Regulation E and the new regulations regarding debit interchange fees. Mark Chancy will provide some additional commentary on these topics.
I'd like to conclude here by saying that we have a process in place for evaluating these items, we will actively engage in development of these rules and regulations, and we will react accordingly as clarity is provided. 
To conclude, I will reiterate that we are encouraged by recent operating trends. The strong foundation we have created, coupled with our client-focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities and a long-term economic prospects in our markets, position SunTrust well for the future. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?"
305901,106631818,68627,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $56 million or $0.11 per share. The net effect of",2763,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. 
For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $56 million or $0.11 per share. The net effect of securities gains, debt extinguishment cost and mark-to-market gains on our debt contributed a positive $0.07 per share to the quarter. And even after adjusting for these items, the earnings per share loss narrowed significantly from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $0.46 and $0.41 per share, respectively. Also, the company did generate positive earnings before preferred dividends this quarter. 
As in prior quarters, the net earnings losses driven by the recessionary environment with elevated net charge-offs, high cyclical expenses and tepid loan demand. Despite these impacts, there were a number of positive trends that drove continued improvement in our financials. The recovering, albeit, uneven economy contributed to a portion of our improved results. This improvement was most notable in the $200 million decline in our provision expense from the first quarter, which was driven by continued favorable credit trends. 
Additionally, we also saw the positive benefits from actions that we have been taking to drive better performance. This improvement was especially evident in higher sequential fee income across a broad range of categories. We also saw continued favorable shifts in our deposit mix, which together with our proactive asset liability management actions, drove stable net interest income and margin on a sequential basis, as well as 8% net interest income growth and 39 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year.
With that brief summary of our second quarter results, I'll now shift to Slide 6, which provides a summary balance sheet. Average loan balances, excluding non-accruals, were down 1% and 10% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. Overall demand remain muted but we did see a continued slowing in the pace of balance declines and slight growth in certain categories. 
Overall, balance declines continue to be driven by our higher risk categories, most notably Construction, which was down 20% from the prior quarter and accounted for over 1/2 of our sequential decline in total loan balances. Increases in consumer loans essentially offset declines in the commercial loan category. Consumer direct and indirect loans grew 6% and 4%, respectively versus the prior quarter, with growth primarily driven by student and auto loans. 
Commercial Loans were down 2%. The balance decline in this category was the smallest since the fourth quarter of 2008, which is the last time that we saw core growth in this portfolio. Now you will recall that we reported growth in this loan category last quarter but it was entirely driven by the impact of the implementation of FAS 167. 
Line of credit utilization rates stabilized somewhat in the second quarter, down about 150 basis points for our larger corporate clients and flat for our midsized clients. We continue to remain hopeful that loan demand from credit-worthy borrowers will increase, and that loan growth will return in the second half of the year. While the slowing pace of loan decline provides some optimism that this could occur in 2010, we continue to remain uncertain of the exact magnitude and timing of a pick up in demand.
Now moving onto deposits at the bottom of the slide. You can see that core deposits increased, and that the positive shift in mix continued. Balance increases were driven by lower-cost deposits, specifically DDA [demand deposit account] and money market, which both grew 4% sequentially or about $2.4 billion combined. Other CD balances declined $1 billion in the quarter as we continue to allow run-off in this portfolio, particularly single-service CDs. 
We also further reduced our brokered and foreign deposits, which were down approximately $760 million this quarter and 60% year-over-year. Overall, we have significantly enhanced our liquidity position during this past year, primarily via the growth of lower-cost deposits. This increase in deposits has enabled us to take a series of actions to reduce our higher-cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our cost of funds.
Not depicted on this slide, but one such additional action in this regard that occurred toward the end of the quarter was the early termination of $900 million in debt. This debt carried a coupon of approximately 5% and had about two years to maturity, and the cost associated with this termination of $63 million is included in the quarter's expenses. We also took actions with our securities portfolio, so let's turn to Slide 7.
Our total available for sale portfolio stood at $27.6 billion at the end of the quarter. In an effort to manage our interest rate risk profile, as well as to reposition the portfolio in areas where we saw relative value, we executed a series of transactions during the quarter. 
Most notably, we extended our U.S. Treasury position and grew the MBS portfolio via purchasing $2.5 billion of mortgage-backed agency securities. The MBS purchase was funded via $1 billion sale of bullet U.S. agencies, as well as from our deposit growth. The collective actions taken during the quarter yielded $57 million in securities gains. 
The portfolio continues to be concentrated in high quality and very liquid securities. Government and agency securities, which are the first four rows on the slide, constitute the vast majority of balances, and the other equity securities are largely Coca-Cola, Federal Reserve and FHLB stock. 
Going forward, we continue to have the flexibility to respond to changes in the environment and to take actions that best balance our excess liquidity position against current investment returns. I'll now take a moment to cover the margin on Slide 8.
Lower funding costs more than offset slightly lower asset yields in the quarter, contributing to a one basis point sequential improvement in net interest margin to 3.33%. Margin exceeded our prior expectations and guidance due primarily to better-than-expected deposit pricing and mix, and the effects of the aforementioned securities portfolio transactions. 
Relative to the prior year, margin is up 39 basis points. This improvement is driven primarily by the lower funding costs discussed earlier. In 2009 and early 2010, we also extended the duration of our Commercial Loan portfolio through a series of interest rate swaps, which have contributed a meaningful amount of net interest income in 2010, given the very low rate environment that has persisted throughout the year. 
Finally, we have improved our loan pricing discipline across the company, and this effort is evident in our loan yields. You will note that we have modified our expectations somewhat regarding the margin for the remainder of the year, as we now expect it to be within a range of 3.25% to 3.35%. This modification reflects the fact that the benefits that we are currently experiencing related to deposit pricing, the favorable deposit mix, our interest rate swap position and the early debt termination are likely to continue for the next couple of quarters. As a final comment on this slide, I will note that we remained modestly asset sensitive at the end of the quarter.
Let's now move to provision on Slide 9. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter were $662 million, down $200 million from the first quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Provision was $60 million less than charge-offs with $40 million of this differential coming from a reduction in the unfunded commitments reserve due to improved equity related to certain commercial and large corporate clients. 
Charge-offs were $722 million, a decrease of almost $100 million from the first quarter. Now you may recall that a move of certain non-performing loans to held for sale and a charge-off policy change increased first quarter charge-offs by a combined $182 million. When normalizing for these items, charge-offs in the second quarter were up $83 million sequentially, which was consistent with our expectations and driven as anticipated primarily by construction loans. Despite the notable improvement in asset quality in the quarter, the allowance ratio was held stable at 2.81%, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the direction of the economy and home values at this time. Now moving to non-interest income on Slide 10.
On a reported basis, non-interest income was up 36% sequentially and down 11% from the prior year. After adjusting for a number of items in each quarter, non-interest income increased by 12% and declined by 10%, respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains, and as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation. 
In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are the aforementioned $57 million in securities gains, as well as a $63 million gain associated with our fair value debt and related hedges. The primary drivers of the adjusted year-over-year decline are mortgage related. Production volumes declined roughly 60% from the prior year as refinancing activity waned. Mortgage repurchase losses were higher in the current quarter and the prior year quarter included a large MSR [Mortgage Servicing Rights] recovery. 
Focusing on the sequential quarter comparison, we posted increases across all major categories. Specifically, mortgage-related income was up $31 million due to the MSR hedge performance and higher production volumes, which more than offset a $20 million increase in repurchase losses. 
We also saw increases in key consumer and commercial fee-based categories. The company has been placing significant focus on servicing and growing our client base, and we believe the increases in these categories, which include mid to high single-digit sequential growth in service charges, card fees, trust income and retail investment services, are all evidence of our success. And importantly, much of this growth was from underlying drivers like an increase in the number of accounts, expanded client relationships and an increase in product usage.
I'll shift gears for a minute to provide you some additional color on the potential impact to SunTrust of regulatory reform. As you all know, and Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, the situation is fluid, and we are in the process of thoroughly evaluating the possible implications and the mitigating actions. To assist you in your own estimation process, we wanted to provide a little more color on three of our fee income streams that are amongst the most obvious items that could be impacted by the reform. 
First, I'll focus on deposit service charges. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected that Reg E could cause a 10% to 20% reduction in service charges. To date, the number of clients opting in, those that would be electing to continue their participation in overdraft coverage, has been well above our expectations. As such, we currently believe that the annualized impact to overdraft income will fall toward the lower end of our original range. 
Second, I'll turn to interchange. Consumer and small business debit card interchange contributed about $250 million in fee income during 2009. Now for clarity, that is our full year interchange revenue, not the impact that we expect Dodd-Frank to have on this fee income category, and we continue to develop our expectations around that matter. 
Third, I'll provide some color on derivatives. Derivatives contributed about $100 million in revenue in 2009, most of which was generated from end users. We do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes on derivatives will have a material impact on this revenue category for SunTrust. 
Finally, it's also obvious that regulatory costs will increase significantly, although the amount is difficult to quantify at this time. So let's now turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends.
This quarter, we increased the reserve for mortgage repurchases by $46 million. Mortgage repurchase costs, which are recorded as a reduction to mortgage production income, increased from $128 million in the first quarter to $148 million this quarter, while charge-offs declined by $16 million to $102 million. And despite this decline in charge-offs, we increased the reserve because new repurchase request volume was up during the quarter, though the request varied significantly by month. For example, April and May were relatively low months, while June was specially high. And while we have seen a significant decline in request volume month-to-date in July, it is too early in the third quarter to suggest that this reflects anything other than normal monthly volatility. 
The key points from the bottom part of this slide remain the same as we have discussed last quarter. Most of our current request volume is currently coming from the higher loss of vintages of 2007 and prior. We expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination of vintages over time will shift new request volume to newer vintages. As that occurs, we expect both lower loss frequencies and severities, as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics such as higher FICOs and lower original LTVs, and they were originated during or after the periods they experienced the most significant home price depreciation. 
In conclusion and consistent with what we told you last quarter, near-term losses and reserve levels will largely be driven by the volume of new repurchase requests, which are difficult to predict. If new request volume begins to taper off during the second half of the year, we expect charge-offs and reserves to likewise decline. However, if new request volumes increase or the expected shift towards newer vintages does not occur, then charge-offs and reserves could remain at current levels or higher. 
I'll now turn to Slide 12 for a review of expenses.
Non-interest expense declined 2% when compared to the second quarter of 2009 and increased 10% compared to last quarter. However, there were certain unusual items that warrant discussion and on this slide, we have adjusted for items that are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation. 
On an adjusted basis, expenses are up 3% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially. You will note at the bottom of the slide, the three primary drivers of the increases, which include credit-related costs, marketing and outside processing. These three categories explain almost the entirety of the year-over-year expense and all but $25 million of the sequential quarter increase. 
For both the year-over-year and sequential quarter comparisons, the drivers of growth in these particular categories are similar. Credit-related costs increased as a result of other real estate expenses. Marketing expenses were from planned promotional and advertising spending supporting our brand, and outside processing was largely due to investments aimed at enhancing our clients' banking experience and from higher volumes. 
I'll also provide you a little color on our personnel-related expenses as they evidence our continued focus on expense management. Employee compensation and benefits declined $21 million or 3% from the prior year and $9 million or 1% from the prior quarter. The reduction from the first quarter was driven largely by the approximate $25 million seasonal decline in FICA [Federal Insurance Contributions Act] and 401(k)expenses, partially offset by modest merit increases that took effect this quarter and higher incentive compensation associated with higher revenues. 
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a brief discussion of capital.  Capital ratios remain solid this quarter and increased from first quarter levels. As a few selected highlights, Tier 1 Capital increased by an estimated 27 basis points from the first quarter to 13.4%. Tier 1 Common improved by an estimated 15 basis points to 7.85%, and tangible common equity increased 30 basis points to 7.18%, driven primarily by unrealized securities gains increasing other comprehensive income, which was also the cause for the expansion in our book and tangible book values per share. Given the continued strength in our capital position, our view that we are well positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time remains unchanged. 
Before concluding, I'll briefly summarize some of the key points I've discussed today.  We significantly narrowed our earnings loss this quarter and we're profitable before prepayment of preferred dividends. Provision declined due to improved asset quality without any reduction in the allowance as a percentage of loans. Favorable deposit trends continued. Net interest margin remained stable from the prior quarter and was up substantially from the prior year, primarily due to lower funding costs. Non-interest income grew sequentially across a broad range of categories, evidencing success in our client-centric initiatives, and non-interest expenses continue to be closely managed. We are encouraged by the trends in our performance, and despite continued uncertainty in the environment, we remain focused on continuing to drive improvements in our results. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality. Tom?"

Today, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 14. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing assets al",1684,"Thanks, Mark. Today, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 14. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing assets all decreased significantly. Delinquencies and loan balances were stable to down, particularly in certain higher risk portfolio. Despite improved asset quality metrics in the current quarter, the Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses, as a percent of loans had been maintained at the prior quarter level in light of continued uncertainty regarding the strength of the economic recovery and trends in home values.
Aggregate loan balances continued to decline in the face of lower loan demand and line usage, as well as targeted actions taken regarding higher risk portfolios such as Construction. This modest decline matched the amount of new loan originations in the portfolio, particularly in commercial lending. Through the first six months of 2010, we have originated $6.9 billion in new C&I loan commitments and leases, which is a 32% increase over the first six months of 2009. 
Early-stage delinquencies represent 1.26% of the portfolio, up from 1.19% in the first quarter. This increase was driven by higher delinquencies in Federally-guaranteed student loans. After removing portfolios with Federal government guarantees for both quarters, the ratio improved to 98 basis points from 104 basis points last quarter, a six basis points improvement. We believe that the pace of improvement in delinquencies in some portfolios may slow as they approach historic numbers.
Other portfolios, such as Consumer and Commercial Real Estate are more closely aligned with the general economy and employment trends. We expect delinquencies in these portfolios to remain at elevated levels until conditions improve. 
Non-performing loans declined during the quarter by over $485 million, which represented the fourth consecutive quarterly decline. Non-performing assets declined by $580 million. Inflows into non-performing are trending down, which when coupled with our aggressive problem asset resolution efforts resulted in lower balances. 
Charge-offs of $722 million during the second quarter were in line with our expectations. The net charge-off ratio declined from 2.91% to 2.57%, with all portfolio showing improvement, except Commercial Real Estate and Construction. Charge-off activity continues to be centered in residential real estate-related portfolios, including residential mortgages, land and residential construction.
Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio view of asset quality illustrates generally improving credit quality. Charge-offs declined broadly among the portfolios. Early-stage delinquencies were stable to down, and balances in some of the highest risk portfolios continued to decline. The longer-term reduction in balances in higher risk portfolio is positive. For example, over the past 12 months, construction balances, including land, have gone nearly 40%. Alt-A balances have declined nearly 18% and higher risk home equity lines have declined 12%.
Commercial portfolios continues to perform satisfactorily overall. Commercial early-stage delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs were down quarter-over-quarter. Our view remains that overall C&I asset quality should improve. 
While the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, consisting of owner-occupied and investor-owned properties continues to perform reasonably well. Charge-offs, early-stage delinquencies and non-performing loans increased slightly from very low basis. In fact, the increase in charge-off ratio represents only a $10 million increase in charge-offs, while the increase in NPLs was only $51 million. Given the conditions in the Commercial Real Estate market, we expect additional stress in credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also continue to believe our portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition and the way it was underwritten.
Asset quality improved in the consumer portfolios, with lower early-stage delinquencies when Federally-guaranteed loans are excluded and charge-off ratios that were stable to down. I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and Construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now, I will summarize. 
Overall, Home Equity performance has been stable as balances and charge-offs declined, while early-stage delinquencies and non-performing loans were flat. Residential Mortgage charge-offs and delinquencies declined, while balances increased modestly. As noted last quarter, we expect the Construction charge-offs to increase, and in fact, was to level similar to what we experienced in the second half of 2009. We continue to expect the elevated charge-offs in this portfolio as problem loans move through the workout process. Next, I'm going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail, beginning with the Residential Mortgage portfolio on Slide 16.
Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of non-performing loans and delinquencies, driven in large part by the core portfolio. Growth in the core mortgage portfolio was predominantly tied to the originations of mortgages that have Federal government guarantees. Dollar delinquencies and non-performing loans in this portfolio improved by $15 million and $303 million, respectively. Non-performing balances declined in every segment of the portfolio. 
Delinquency trends in this portfolio imply a lower frequency of future loss and home price deterioration appears to be slowing in many of our markets. While our outlook for this portfolio is generally stable to improving, the pace of the economic recovery, covered with elevated unemployment rates and variability in housing prices could continue to negatively impact credit quality and the level and frequency of charge-offs.
I will now move to Slide 17 to discuss Home Equity loans. Home Equity portfolio balances and charge-offs continue to decline, while non-accruals were relatively low and stable. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by the higher risk segments of the portfolio, such as loans, which were originated by third parties, loans in Florida and loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Balances in these segments continue to decline but no new production and little line availability. Now if you will turn to Slide 18, I'll talk about our Construction portfolio.
We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to higher risk construction loans. Construction balances continued to decline rapidly, dropping 13% over the quarter. To put this in context, Construction balances in 2007 exceeded $14 billion and are now down by nearly $9 billion or 64%. The Construction Perm portfolio and non-accrual loan balances continue to wind down, as new production remains slow. Issues in this portfolio have been identified and work-out efforts related to older product continue. Construction non-performing loans decreased by 14% quarter-over-quarter, and we believe that residential non-performing loans will be stable to down in the future.
Construction delinquencies declined overall. The Residential Construction segment will remain problematic, with most of the portfolio being actively worked out. We expect delinquencies and losses related to Residential Construction to remain elevated, as we continue to resolve problem loans. While the timing of charge-offs is difficult to predict, we believe that this portfolio is appropriately reserved, and the problems have been aggressively addressed. 
Credit performance in the Commercial Construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined significantly, while charge-off ratios and non-performers increased only modestly. Please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our loan modification efforts and resulting troubled debt restructurings or TDRs.
TDRs increased by $360 million in the current quarter as compared to roughly $300 million last quarter and $500 million in each of the prior two quarters. Growth in consumer residential restructured loans, was about $260 million in the second quarter and was similar to the volume in the first quarter. Residential TDRs began slowing in the first quarter due to fewer newly delinquent loans and fewer modifications of more seriously delinquent loans. There's been an increase in commercial TDRs, primarily within non-accrual, income property loans. 
Commercial-related TDRs account for 8% of total TDRs and only 2% of accruing TDRs. We expect moderate growth in Commercial Real Estate TDRs over the near term. Accruing TDR balances totaled $2.3 billion at June 30. Accruing TDRs comprised 70% of total TDRs and 87% are current for interest and principal payments. Approximately 73% of accruing and non-accruing TDRs are current. Non-accruing TDRs have the potential to move to accrual status, if payment performance is sustained for a defined period of time. 
Overall, performance of the accruing TDRs continues to exceed our expectations during the second quarter. With 94% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio is much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than it is to a restructured portfolio. I'll summarize the key points from today's credit update before turning the call back over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 20. 
Overall, asset quality continue to improve in the quarter. Delinquencies were stable to down in most of the portfolios. Compared to the first quarter, non-performing loans and assets and charge-offs declined significantly. Significant progress has been made in reducing balances in higher risk portfolios over the past 12 to 18 months. We believe that the pace of improvement in delinquencies will slow, as delinquencies in certain portfolios approach historic norms. Other portfolios that are more closely aligned with the general economy and employment trends will remain elevated until conditions improve. Consumer and mortgage asset quality metrics generally improved. Construction charge-offs increased significantly and balances declined as we continue to aggressively work through the risk in this portfolio. 
The level of Residential Mortgage modifications were stable during the second quarter. There was an increase in commercial restructures, particularly in Commercial Real Estate. We expect modest increases in Commercial Real Estate TDRs for the near term. The proportion of TDRs that are current interest in principal and interest and payments improved from last quarter to 73%. Approximately 87% of all accruing TDRs are current on interest and principal payments.
At the current time, we expect overall charge-offs to be stable to down from the third quarter. Factors which could affect general asset quality and charge-offs levels include macro or regional economic volatility and trends within specific sectors, such as Commercial Real Estate. 
Finally, assuming no further material deterioration in the economy or asset quality metrics, the Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses likely peak from the first quarter. However, we maintain reserve levels for the time being, in light of continued economic and real estate value uncertainty. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

They have a belief that there are some issues that the loop current in the Gulf will feed into the Gulfstream and that there maybe some issues in South Florida. But as it goes on and as the Gulfstream separates from the North American continent, they predict much less, the farther the north you go. And our experience basically so far is not bad. Of course, the devastation right on the shoreline and some parts of our footprint, are less actually than if further west on the Gulf coast. So we are obviously concerned about it. Floridians are concerned about it. We haven't seen a meaningful economic impact on the west coast of the peninsula but obviously, the tourism issue and valuations and loss of tenant rental income and all those kinds of things in the Panhandle, particularly the western part of the Florida Panhandle are worst, if that's a useful update."

Glad you're with us this morning. Financial results improved significantly this quarter as we earned $84 million or $0.17 per share. Strong revenue coupled with lower credit costs drove significantly increased pr",1203,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everybody. Glad you're with us this morning. Financial results improved significantly this quarter as we earned $84 million or $0.17 per share. Strong revenue coupled with lower credit costs drove significantly increased profitability. As you're all aware, throughout this economic cycle, we have been positioning our businesses for growth. Those efforts are gaining traction and resulting in improved performance. Though macroeconomic indicators are mixed and there remains uncertainty in regard  to regulation, we are increasingly encouraged by the improvement in our operating results. 
Revenue growth in the quarter was particularly strong in mortgage-related revenues as we benefited from the lower interest rates. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also had a terrific quarter posting record investment banking revenues. Partially offsetting the performance of these core businesses was the decrease in service charges, largely related to Reg E and $81 million mark-to-market losses on debt and Index Linked CDs. 
Net interest income and net interest margin increased compared to last quarter, up 5% and eight basis points, respectively. Net interest margin increased largely due to the improved funding mix of the lower rate paid on deposits. Additionally, the securities and loan portfolios increased, borrowing asset yield to remain stable. 
Total expenses were flat compared to last quarter while core expenses increased, largely driven by revenue-related compensation and legal-related expenses. Mark will provide more detail on this momentarily. However, I will reiterate that we continue to manage expenses tightly across the organization, while making what we believe are appropriate investments in our business to facilitate growth.
Asset quality trends continue to improve with nonperforming asset, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses all declining this quarter. As anticipated, early stage delinquencies were stable overall. We made a significant stride toward our goal to improve the client experience and thereby increase client satisfaction and loyalty. These efforts are beginning to manifest themselves in revenue growth. 
While it's still a challenging operating environment, we are moving the needle in several key areas of the business. At the same time, we're aware of lingering operating environmental uncertainties such as regulatory and legislative matters. We move to Slide 4 where we

service charges. Last quarter, we indicated that the impact of Reg E on service charges was expected to be at the low end of the previously provided 10% to 20% range. That expectation remains. However, additional clarity is probably necessary. 
Clients continue to opt in and we expect them to do so over the next two to three quarters. Therefore, we expect to see a more substantial negative impact of service charges now, but as clients continue to opt in, the impact will trend down. We expect the impact from Reg E to stabilize to a low double-digit figure as we approach mid-2011. In the meantime, it will probably be a little more elevated. 
We also chose to make changes outside of Reg E that were designed to improve client satisfaction. We decided to stop charging overdraft fees on individual transactions with a value of less than $5, and to reduce the number of maximum daily overdraft fees. These changes were effective July 1 and are expected to reduce service charges by an additional 5% to 6% annually. I'll also point out that these estimates do not include any mitigating effects of household retention, household growth or any changes to products or pricing. 
Derivatives contributed about $100 million in revenue in 2009, most of which was generated from clients. This is an area where we do not currently believe that the legislative and revelatory changes will have a material impact on the revenue for SunTrust.
Consumer and small business debit card interchange contributed about $250 million in fee income during 2009. We expect some impact to this revenue stream obviously. However, the ultimate amount will remain unknown until final regulations are written. This is a higher growth opportunity area and is driven by household growth, higher product penetration and increasing consumer usage pattern, which will help to offset the potential impact of lower interchange rates.
We had anticipated an increase in FDIC deposit insurance costs as a result of the change in assessment base from deposits to assets. However, based on the FDIC's recent announcement, it appears that the impact will be less than originally anticipated though the amount is still not known at this time. 
The final item of note is the columns and the effect it will have on Tier 1 capital. With $2.3 billion in outstanding instruments, expect a cumulative reduction in the Tier 1 ratio of approximately 175 basis points. This is on an incremental basis and obviously will not include all the other factors that affect capital over time. This reduction will occur over three years beginning in 2013 and with our solid capital position, this is another completely manageable outcome. For the time being, we view these instruments as reasonably attractive capital, though we will continue to evaluate whether to call these securities by weighing their costs against the capital benefits.
And now turning to Slide 5 and a review of our capital position. Virtually all of our key capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have each quarter depicted on the slide. During the third quarter, Tier 1 capital increased to an estimated 13.6%, while estimated Tier 1 common increased to 8%. The total capital ratio declined in the current quarter as a result of the tender for subordinated debt that we completed in the third quarter. We'd like to take a moment before I turn the call over to Mark to give some context to our estimated 8% Tier 1 common ratio in light of the recently announced Basel III requirement. 
So if you'll turn to Slide 6. The Tier 1 common capital ratio of 8%, which I mentioned represents $10.7 billion of capital. That ratio is well above the announced Basel III regulatory standard. SunTrust's estimated Tier 1 ratio of 8% is a full 1% of $1.3 billion above the threshold of 4.5% plus the 2.5% conservation buffer, which is not scheduled to become effective fully until 2019.
SunTrust's capital position today is particularly strong especially when you consider our improving credit risk profile. We've reduced our higher risk portfolios by 10% to 50% since the end of 2008. And furthermore, we have relatively low market and operating risk and high liquidity. And with strong capital, more clarity on capital standards, lower risk, high liquidity and improved earnings, we believe that we are well positioned to repay TARP. And I've said, we will repay it at the appropriate time and in a fashion that makes the most sense for both our shareholder and regulatory prospectives. 
The efforts being made to position SunTrust for growth beyond the cycle are translating into improved core performance. We are investing to grow the business. We are managing expenses prudently, and we've return the company to profitability. And though modestly improving economic conditions are helping performance, we remain encouraged by our emerging operating results. There are certainly still quite a lot of work to be done, but we're making strides in the right direction. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more detail."
305901,113941651,80734,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation with a review of the summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $84 million or $0.17 per share.",2823,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation with a review of the summary income statement. 
For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $84 million or $0.17 per share. This is $140 million improvement from the loss to common shareholders of $56 million that we posted in the second quarter. The improvement was largely attributable to strong core revenue performance, which increased $153 million, sequentially. 
Net interest income increased 5%, noninterest income increased 10% with the combined result of 7% increase in revenues. Our key revenue drivers included increased earning assets, expanded net interest margin, significant increases in mortgage production and servicing revenue and a very strong quarter for investment banking. Further, a $47 million decline in provision for credit losses and flat noninterest expenses supported the sequential improvement in earnings. Provision for taxes increased $63 million to a small tax liability of $14 million, with no material discrete items impacting tax provision in the quarter.
The net effect of securities gains, debt extinguishment of costs and mark-to-market gains and losses contributed $47 million to pretax income. And we've adjusted for these items when representing SunTrust's core noninterest income for the quarter. In addition, third quarter results included $59 million in mark-to-market losses and an increase in legal-related cost that we've not adjusted for.  I'll talk more about these puts and takes in just a minute. However, the overall take away that this was a solid quarter of earnings for SunTrust. Now with that said, I'll also acknowledge that the sustainable earnings of the company are still not  where we want them to be. 
While we are very pleased with the revenue performance of our investment in Mortgage Banking businesses, we recognize that these revenue sources are subject to seasonal and cyclical variability. However, there are areas that we believe we'll drive sustained improvement in our financial results. While the economy remains weak, we expect that gradual, continued improvement in economic conditions will result in lower charge-offs and reserves, reduced credit-related expenses and increase client demands for loans and financial services in general. 
In terms of things that we have greater control over, we are encouraged by our continued success in improving client satisfaction and loyalty. Deposit growth, mix and rates paid and our investment banking performance are tangible examples where we believe this success is driving revenue.
Additionally, we remain vigilant in managing expense growth to a proper balance between current income and investment for future profits. Now with that brief summary of our third quarter results, I'll now shift to Slide 8 and a review of loans and deposits.
Average loan balances, again excluding nonaccruals, we're flat and down 6% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. The story here hasn't changed much since last quarter. Consumer loan categories continued to increase with commercial loan categories flat to down. However, there are some things I'd like to call to your attention starting with the commercial loan category. Average commercial loan balances stabilized, breaking a declining trend that started in early 2009, excluding the impact that we have from the FAS 167 consolidation in the first quarter of 2010.
Revolving line of credit utilization and rates were stable during the quarter overall. Large corporate utilization was basically stable, while middle market and smaller client utilization declined marginally. Average balances stabilized and period end balances increased due to higher term loan balances and growth in the balances of Three Pillars, which you'll remember is our asset-backed commercial paper conduit.
Average construction loan balances increased roughly 1/2 of 1%, which is an anomaly relative to recent trends. However, if you refer to the period end balance sheet in the press release tables, you'll see that construction loans actually declined $565 million or 11% as compared to June 30. 
Residential 1-4 family mortgages increased in the quarter, driven exclusively by increased holdings of federally guaranteed loans. With weak overall loan demand and high liquidity, we have chosen to retain some agency-eligible mortgage loan production on balance sheet. Specifically, we increased our holdings of guaranteed mortgage loans by roughly $1.2 billion during the quarter, and these loans are guaranteed by Fannie Mae under its long-term standby commitment program. 
While we have been growing consumer loans fairly consistently over the past year, growth in the current quarter was robust. In the current quarter, organic growth remained and was augmented significantly by two actions. While did not impact the average balance significantly, period end consumer direct growth includes the consolidation of a previously off-balance sheet student loan securitization of just under $500 million. Growth in the consumer and direct category also includes the purchase of approximately $740 million in high-quality consumer auto loans.
We continue to expect that broad-based commercial loan growth will return with an improving economy. However, the evidence to date suggests that improvement will occur gradually. As this occurs, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow commercial loans in client segments and products that offer opportunity, and to originate and acquire high-quality consumer loans. 
Now moving on to deposits bottom of the slide. You can see that core deposits increased and that the positive shift in mix to lower cost deposits continued. Balance increases were driven by DDA and Money Market Accounts, which sequentially increased 4% and 6%, respectively. These categories combined provided over $3 billion in deposit growth.
Now partially offsetting this growth were NOW and CD balances, which declined roughly $2.4 billion in the quarter. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the enhanced liquidity and lower cost funding that deposit growth has provided during this past year. This increase in deposits has enabled us to take a series of actions to reduce our higher cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our cost of funds and improvement in our net interest margin. Actions in the quarter taken to reduce higher cost funding sources include the repayment of banks' subdebt via a tender offer and additional home loan bank repayments, the combination of which was approximately $1 billion. We also continued during the quarter to reposition the securities portfolio. So let's turn to Slide 9.
Our total available for-sale portfolio stood at $30.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $2.7 billion from the end of the second quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, we developed a view that rates will decline due to the weakening economic indicators. That, coupled with high liquidity, caused us to take the opportunity to increase our holdings of high-quality liquid Treasury and agency securities early in the third quarter. More specifically, we rebalanced the agency portion of our portfolios slightly lengthening the duration and netting securities gains of $69 million. 
With the decline in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to approximately $830 million from $680 million at the end of the second quarter. We continue to regularly review this portfolio and so far in October, we've sold $1.5 billion in securities primarily to reduce our exposure to certain tranches of mortgage-backed securities that had increased in value during the quarter.
As we look forward over a longer timeframe, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. With a basically stable cash position, we expect to decrease the securities portfolio in response to increasing loans and/or decreasing deposits. 
Now I'll take a moment to cover the margin on Slide 10. As I mentioned, lower cost funding drove an 8 basis point improvement in the margin to 3.41% as earning asset yields were basically stable. Margin exceeded our prior expectations and guidance due primarily to better than expected deposit, pricing and mix and the effects of the previously mentioned securities portfolio transactions. 
Relative to the prior year, margin is up 31 basis points. And this improvement is driven primarily by the lower funding cost discussed earlier. We currently expect margins to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. And the risk and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide. 
So let's move on to provision on Slide 11. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $615 million, down $47 million from the second quarter as credit trends continue to improve. Provision expense was $75 million less than charge-offs, with $5 million of this differential coming from the reduction in the unfunded commitments reserve that we hold due to the improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate clients. Charge-offs were $690 million, a decrease of $32 million or 4% compared to last quarter.
The decline occurred in most product categories and was partially offset by an anticipated increase in commercial real estate and a very small increase in residential mortgage. The allowance ratio declined from 2.81% to 2.69% as a result of both the decrease in the allowance, as well as the increase in period end loan balances. 
As I mentioned earlier, the increase in loans is the result of increases in high-quality consumer, commercial and government guaranteed mortgage loans partially offset by declines in the higher risk categories, including construction and home equity. 
Tom will cover asset quality in more detail in a few minutes, so let's move on to noninterest income on Slide 12. On a reported basis, noninterest income was up 10% sequentially and 35% from the prior year. We've adjusted for a number of items in each quarter and after the adjustments, noninterest income increased by 19% and 17%, respectively.
The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains. And as in prior quarters, we've provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation. In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are for $69 million in securities gains and a net of $10 million in mark-to-market losses on securities in our fair value debt and related hedges. 
As mentioned previously, the main drivers of the sequential quarter increase in noninterest income relates to our Investment Banking and Mortgage businesses. And key items of note in this quarter's noninterest income results include Investment Banking income increasing by 66% or $38 million to a record level of $96 million in the quarter. This result was driven by strong syndication, bond origination and merger and acquisition revenues. 
Mortgage production income increased $150 million, driven by an increase in application volume of over 25%, increased production margins and a $53 million decrease in the cost of mortgage repurchases, which I'll cover in more detail in just a minute. Mortgage servicing income increased to $44 million or 51% as compared to the prior quarter due almost entirely to hedge performance.
Trading income actually declined $130 million in the quarter, which needs a little more explanation. The majority of the decline was caused by mark-to-market losses on our publicly-traded debt and related hedges of $22 million in the current quarter, as compared to gains of $63 million in the second quarter. Not included in the adjustments on this page is an additional mark-to-market loss of $59 million on index linked certificates of deposits. In prior quarters, the marks on these deposits, which total about $1.2 billion, have been relatively insignificant and mostly positive.
Tightening of SunTrust credit spreads and the decline in interest rates in the current quarter resulted in a $59 million loss this period. A view, excluding the impact of the mark on Index Linked CDs and the items included in the appendix, reflects an increase in trading income, driven largely by fixed income and derivatives trading. 
Now the final item I will note is the decline in service charges on deposit accounts of $24 million or 11%. This reduction is related to the implementation of the required Reg E changes, and the voluntary changes that we have made to our fee schedules that Jim talked about earlier. Our voluntary changes were in place for the entire quarter, and the Reg E changes we're effective August 15. As a result, we expect a full quarter of Reg E to have a negative sequential quarter impact going into the fourth quarter, with some mitigating impact from increased client opt in a typical seasonal increase.
Let's now turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. The noninterest income impact of mortgage repurchases decreased $53 million this quarter. The reduction was primarily due to lower charge-offs, coupled with a smaller increase in reserves. Repurchased losses, declined in part due to the implementation in the quarter of an enhanced review process and in part due to a decline in the average loan size of the volume processed. 
In addition, new request volumes declined back to the levels more consistent with the first quarter and resulted in a basically stable population of pending requests. However, new request volume remains volatile from month to month and as such, future results are difficult to estimate with precision. 
If third quarter trends continue, and they have so far in October, our current expectation is that fourth quarter charge-offs will increase back closer to the second quarter level. However, if, and I want to emphasize if, new request volumes remain stable, our current view is that reserve additions in the fourth quarter will be roughly stable with the third quarter despite this expected increase in charge-offs. Now said another way, we expect the income statement impact in the fourth quarter to remain relatively stable with that realized the third quarter at this time. Now of course, all of this is related to the assumption that I've just walked you through.
The key points from the bottom part of this slide are slightly altered from prior quarters. Most of our current running volume is coming from the higher loss vintages of 2007 and prior years. And this has continued longer than we originally expected. We continue to expect however, the normal seasoning patterns or origination of vintages over time will shift new request volume to newer vintages.  
As that occurs, we expect lower request volumes and lower lost frequencies and severities as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics as depicted on the bottom right of Slide 13. The last point I'll make on this topic does not have a reference point on this slide. The topic is the recent speculation regarding repurchase liability for non-agency loan sales. So first, let me put the numbers into prospective. 
The timeframe we should focus on is 2005 to 2007, as we had very few of such sales in 2008. The total sales volume of non-agency product during this time frame is approximately $30 billion, and the remaining unpaid balance today is roughly $17 billion.
In addition, the composition of our non-agency sales is dramatically different than what the industry produced over this time frame. For example, our percentage of prime, non-agency production sold was approximately 56% with the balance being generally high-quality, low-doc production. By contrast, external data sources showed the total industry with a much lower composition of prime product loan sales. Finally, we have not had a material of volume of repurchase request on non-agency sales to date, nor have we sustained losses of a substantial nature.
So with that, let me turn to Slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was flat when compared to last quarter, and increased 5% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Adjusting for a few items that are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation, expenses increased 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
At the bottom of the slide, we've included the three primary drivers of the sequential quarter increase, which combined drove the majority of the change. Personnel-related expenses are the biggest contributor. And the majority of the growth is associated with improved revenue generation. Incentive compensation associated with mortgage and investment banking performance increased as you would expect. Further, of the increase in headcount of approximately 350, the majority is related to mortgage production. The remaining increase is largely related to investment in personnel and our technology area and revenue producers in other lines of business.
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeking to balance current expenses against investment in future revenue, and this is an example. The area of growth is embedded within other noninterest expense. And on the slide, we've removed credit-related expenses and adjustments from the appendix of the presentation to highlight this embedded increase. 
The reconciliation for this line is in the appendix as well. The increase of $17 million you see on the slide is more than 100% associated with legal-related costs. And while future litigation-related expenses are never certain, our current expectation is that these costs will not recur the next quarter. So with that overview of our third quarter results, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality in more detail. Tom?"
305901,113941651,80734,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. This morning, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 15. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans and nonperforming asse",1805,"Thanks, Mark. This morning, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 15. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets all decreased. Loan balances increased and overall delinquencies were basically stable.
Net charge-offs during the second quarter were $690 million, down $32 million from last quarter. Charge-offs continued to be heavily concentrated in the residential real estate-related portfolios, including residential mortgages, construction and home equity. The net charge-off ratio declined from 2.57% to  2.42% with most portfolios showing improvement.
Stable mortgage and higher commercial real estate charge-offs were the exceptions to this declining trend. And I'll talk about this more in a moment. Provision expense declined as a result of lower charge-offs. In addition, with improved asset quality metrics in the current quarter and an outlook for continued gradual improvement, the allowance for loan losses was reduced by a modest $70 million.
The allowance to loan ratio declined to 2.69% of loans or 12 basis points with roughly half the decline related to lower reserves. The other half of the decline was related to higher loan balances. As Mark mentioned earlier, the portfolio of mix continued to improve with higher risk portfolio balances like construction continuing to decline and growth occurring in both higher quality and federally guaranteed portfolios. 
Nonperforming loans declined in the quarter by over $325 million or 7%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of declining nonperforming loans. Real estate also decline, resulting in nonperforming assets declining by nearly $400 million dollars.
Aggressive problem asset resolution, coupled with continuing trending of lower inflows into nonperforming, drove the decline in the current quarter. Early stage delinquencies remained basically stable during the quarter. Delinquencies are currently below 1% after excluding government guaranteed loans. Early stage delinquencies have declined significantly since the beginning of 2009, while the economic and employment environment have remained sluggish. As a result, we do not expect significant further improvement in overall early stage delinquencies until general economic conditions improve.
Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of loan portfolios. This slide provides a net charge-off in early stage delinquency metrics per loan type. It illustrates at a more granular level that overall asset quality has improved, net asset quality issues remain concentrated in the Residential Real Estate portfolios. 
Charge-offs decline broadly among the portfolios. Early stage delinquencies were stable to down, and balances in some of the higher risk portfolios continue to decline. Commercial portfolio continues to perform well, with early stage delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs stable to down in the quarter. Charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio increased to just over 1% of loans on an annualized basis.
While a significant increase in the annualized charge-off rate, the actual dollars involved were relatively slow with charge-offs in the segment totaling $40 million. We expect some additional stress in charge-offs in this portfolio as the economic cycle plays out. However, the timing of problem resolution in Commercial Real Estate can be varied. 
Overall, we continue to believe that this portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition, the quality of underwriting and our ongoing management disciplines. Evidence of this can be seen in the relatively low and stable levels of nonperforming loans and delinquencies. As a reminder, this portfolio is largely owner-occupied and has an average loan size of about $700,000 overall. The average loan size of Investor Real Estate loans is about $1.1 million. 
Asset quality is generally improved in the consumer portfolios with stable to lower early stage delinquencies and charge-offs. We've provided additional detail this quarter on the Consumer Direct portfolio to highlight the relatively high delinquency and the relatively low losses contained from the Student Loan portfolio. Student loans comprise 2/3 of the Consumer Direct portfolio. And roughly 90% of the student loans are government guaranteed.
I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk Residential Real Estate, Secured and Construction portfolios in the next few slides. In general, balances in these portfolios continue to decline and they're displaying generally stable to improving performance, with Construction continuing to show some variability. Mortgage charge-offs increased slightly this quarter, but our outlook for charge-offs in the Residential Mortgage portfolio continues to be stable to improved. Next, I'm going to briefly review a more detailed presentation of our Residential Mortgage portfolio on Slide 17.
Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of nonperforming loans and delinquencies driven in large part by performance in the core portfolio. Growth in the core Mortgage portfolio was due to the origination and retention of mortgages that have federal government guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA. 
This government guaranteed subset of the core portfolio increased by over $1.2 billion during the quarter and now stands at over $3 billion. The non-core portion of the portfolio continued its declining trend during the quarter, dropping by over $300 million. Nonperforming balances declined in every segment of this portfolio during the quarter. Total delinquencies declined 7 basis points overall, driven down by small decrease in the core portfolio and larger declines in Home Equity Loan and Lot Loan portfolio segments. 
Despite stable sequential charge-offs, delinquency trends in this portfolio continue to point to reduced frequency of delinquency during the next quarter. We expect home prices to remain soft overall, trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in others. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to declining nonperforming loan and charge-off levels over the next quarter or two.
There are some risks to this generally improving outlook. The first is the pace of economic recovery and more specifically unemployment rates and housing prices. The second risk relates to the foreclosure process. SunTrust is reviewing pending foreclosures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and practices. We take this issue very seriously and we're pursuing it aggressively. 
While technical issues may arise in the preparation of any legal document, we are taking this opportunity to resolve any issues which are uncovered. We have completed this review of process for the states of Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. These states accounts for approximately 80% of the unit volume in our portfolio. 
To provide some contact regarding the impact of SunTrust, in Florida, which represents about 70% of our foreclosure activity, we have less than 300 loans scheduled for hearings in the next 60 to 90 days. As a result, we do not expect any required rescheduling to have a material impact on the resolution of our mortgage nonaccruals. 
We'll now move to Slide 18 to discuss home equity lines. Home equity portfolio of balances and charge-offs continue to decline, while nonaccruals were relatively stable. Over 2/3 of the portfolio is labeled as core and is performing reasonably well. The rest of the portfolio is running off with no new production and little to no line availability. 
As you would expect, elevated credit metrics are largely driven by these higher risk segments. These include lines originated by third parties, lines in Florida and other states with the high loan-to-value ratios. 
Now if you turn to Slide 19, I will talk about our Construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce our exposure to higher risk construction loans, with balances dropping another 11% during the third quarter. Balances are down 40% on a year-over-year basis. While overall charge-offs were down sequentially, they remain elevated and uneven. 
The amount and timing of construction charge-offs are variable to the nature of the work out process. In addition, Commercial Construction Loans are typically larger and more complex than Consumer Construction Loans and introduce another element of variability. As you can see on the slide, Residential Construction has been the most problematic construction portfolio. We expect that charge-offs related to these loans will remain elevated and somewhat variable over the next few quarters as we continue to work through this rapidly declining portfolio.
Commercial construction balances continue to decline, and this portfolio has generally performed better than its residential counterpart. But it, too, demonstrated elevated and somewhat variable charge-offs. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased from the second straight quarter but expected to remain elevated. We believe that residential construction nonperforming loans will be stable to down, with modest increases in nonperforming commercial construction loans. The overall construction delinquency ratio increased quarter-over-quarter. However, this was driven by lower portfolio balances rather than increase as the dollars delinquent, which remain stable. 
Next I'm going to review loan modification results on Slide 20 of today's presentation. Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. And performance continue to be at an acceptable level with 86% of accruing restructured loan remaining current on principal and interest payments. 
Balances of current TDRs increased by roughly $250 million during the current quarter, as compared to approximately $360 million last quarter. The vast majority, about 97%, of accruing TDRs are consumer residential-related loans. The slowing growth trends in residential TDRs continue, and the pace of newly delinquent loans eligible for restructuring decreased. 
Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs continue to exceed our expectations during the third quarter. Accruing TDRs have a weighted average age of 12 months, evidencing a level of sustained performance. With 94% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio remain much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than a restructured portfolio.
Before turning the call back over to Steve, I'm going to provide a brief summary of today's asset quality review on Slide 21. Overall, asset quality continued to improve in the quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined.  Delinquencies were stable to down in most of the portfolios. However, we do not expect significant additional improvements in overall early stage delinquencies until economic conditions strengthen. 
Charge-offs declined modestly overall with most portfolios stable to down. Commercial Real Estate charge-offs increased as specific problem loans were resolved. Given continuing stress in this segment, the timing and amount of future commercial real estate charge-offs will remain variable and elevated. Mortgage asset quality metrics were stable to improved. We continue to aggressively and successful reduce the risk in the Construction portfolio as evidenced by additional balanced reduction, lower nonperforming loans and elevated charge-off levels. 
Accruing TDRs remain predominantly centered around consumer mortgages. Balances increased modestly in  the quarter and solid payment performance continued. At the current time, we expect overall credit quality to improve again in the fourth quarter with total net charge-offs stable to slightly down and nonperformers declining much.
Finally, at this point in the cycle, we expect the allowance for loan losses to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with the improvement in credit quality. With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve."

What we noted in the call was that 56% of that $30 billion was prime-related product, including prime jumbo loans with the remaining 44% high-quality, low-doc loans. The non-agency product is included in our reserve process, but we've had few requests to date and few losses. And the bulk of the reserves that we've been talking about and that we showed in our presentation materials relate to the agency product, you recall that total reserve is around $270 million, which was up $14 million.

Financial results improved significantly this quarter as we earned $84 million or $0.17 per share. Strong revenue coupled with lower credit costs grew significantly increased profitability.
As you’re all aware throughout this economic cycle we have been positioning our businesses for growth. Those efforts are gaining traction and resulting in improved performance. Until macroeconomic indicators are mixed and there remains uncertainty in regard to regulation we are increasingly encouraged by the improvement in our operating results.
Revenue growth in the quarter was particularly strong in mortgage related revenues as we benefited from the lower interest rate. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also had a terrific quarter posting report investment banking revenues. Partially offsetting the performance of these core businesses, excuse me, was a decrease in service charges, largely related to Reg E and $81 million of mark-to-market losses on debt and indexed linked CDs.
Net interest income and net interest margin increased compared to last quarter, up 5% and 8 basis points, respectively. Net interest margin increased largely due to the improved funding mix and lower rate paid on deposits.
Additionally, the securities and loan portfolios increased, while earning asset yields remained stable. Total expenses were flat compared to last quarter while core expenses increased mostly driven by revenue related compensation and legal related expenses. Mark will provide more detail on this momentarily, however, I will reiterate that we continue to manage expenses tightly across the organization while making what we believe are appropriate investments in our business to facilitate growth.
Asset quality trends continue to improve with non-performing asset, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses all declining this quarter. As anticipated, early stage delinquencies were stable overall.
We made a significant stride toward our goal to improve the client experience and thereby increase client satisfaction and loyalty. These efforts are beginning to manifest themselves in revenue growth. There’s still a challenging operating environment, we are moving the needle in several key areas of the business.
At the same time, we’re aware of lingering operating environmental uncertainties such as regulatory and legislative matters. We’ll move to slide four where we’ve provided some information to add some clarity on that topic.
It is clear that the financial regulation will impact our financial results, but we believe that for us it will be manageable. The information on slide four highlights selected items of interest though it is not intended to be all inclusive. Certain changes are expected to have little impact on SunTrust such as the Card Act while others such as the impact of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are simply not predictable at this time.
First, I’ll focus on deposit service charges. Last quarter we indicated that the impact of Reg E on service charges was expected to be at the low end of the previously provided 10% to 20% range. That expectation remains. However, additional clarity is probably necessary.
Clients continue to opt in and we expect them to do so over the next two to three quarters. Therefore, we expect to see a more substantial negative impact on service charges now but as clients continue to opt in the impact will trend down. We expect the impact from Reg E to stabilize to a low double-digit figure as we approach mid 2011. In the meantime it will probably be a little more elevated.
We also chose to make changes outside of Reg E that were designed to improve client satisfaction. We decided to stop charging overdraft fees on individual transactions with a value of less than $5 and to reduce the number of maximum daily overdraft fees.
These changes were effective July 1st and are expected to reduce service charges by an additional 5% to 6% annually. I’ll also point out that these estimates do not include any mitigating effects of household retention, household growth or any changes to products or pricing.
Derivatives contributed about $100 million in revenue in 2009, most of which was generated from clients. This is an area where we do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes will have a material impact on the revenue for SunTrust.
Consumer and small business debit card interchange contributed about $250 million in fee income during 2009. We expect some impact to this revenue stream, obviously. However, the ultimate amount will remain unknown until final regulations are written. This is a higher growth opportunity area and is driven by household growth, higher product penetration and increasing consumer usage pattern, which will help to offset the potential impact of lower interchange rates.
We had anticipated an increase in FDIC deposit insurance costs as a result of the change in assessment base from deposits to assets. However, based on the FDIC’s recent announcement, it appears that the impact will be less than originally anticipated though the amount is still not known at this time.
The final item of note is the Collins Amendment and the effect it will have on Tier 1 capital. With $2.3 billion in outstanding instruments we expect a cumulative reduction in the Tier 1 ratio approximately 175 basis points. This is on an incremental basis and obviously will not include all the other factors that affect capital overtime. This reduction will occur over three years beginning in 2013 and with our solid capital position this is another completely manageable outcome.
The time being, we view these instruments as reasonably attractive capital though we’ll continue to valuate whether to call these securities by weighing their costs against the capital benefits.
Now, turning to slide five an review of our capital position, virtually all of our key capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have each quarter depicted on the slide. During the third quarter Tier 1 capital increased to an estimated 13.6%, while estimated Tier 1 common increased to 8%. The total capital ratio declined in the current quarter as a result of the tender for subordinated debt that we completed in the third quarter.
I’d like to take a moment before I turn the call over to Mark to give some context to our estimated 8% Tier 1 common ratio in light of the recently announced Basel III requirements, so if you turn to slide six, the Tier 1 common capital ratio of 8%, which I mentioned, represents $10.7 billion of capital. That ratio is well above the announced Basel III regulatory standard.
SunTrust estimated Tier 1 ratio of 8% is a full 1% of $1.3 billion above the threshold of 4.5% plus the 2.5% conservation buffer, which is not scheduled to become effective fully until 2019.
SunTrust’s capital position today is particularly strong, especially when you consider our proven credit risk profile. We reduced our higher risk portfolios by 10% to 15% since the end of 2008 and further more we have relatively low market and operating risk and high liquidity.
And with strong capital, more clarity on capital standards, lower risk, high liquidity and improved earnings, we believe that we are well positioned to repay TARP. As I said, we will repay at the appropriate time and in a fashion that makes the most sense from both our shareholder and regulatory perspectives.
The efforts being made to position SunTrust for growth beyond the cycle are translating into improved core performance. We are investing to grow the business. We are managing expenses prudently and we returned the company to profitability. And though modestly improving economic conditions are helping performance, we remain encouraged by our emerging operating results, there are certainly still quite a lot of work to be done, but we’re making strides in the right direction.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mark to provide more detail.

I’ll begin my comments today on slide seven of the earnings presentation with a review of the summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $84 million or $0.17 per shar",2823,"Thanks, Jim and good morning everybody. I’ll begin my comments today on slide seven of the earnings presentation with a review of the summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $84 million or $0.17 per share. This is $140 million improvement from the loss to common shareholders of $56 million that we posted in the second quarter. The improvement was largely attributable to strong core revenue performance, which increased $153 million sequentially.
Net interest income increased 5%, non-interest income increased 10%, with a combined result of 7% increase in revenues. Now the key revenue drivers included increased earning assets, expanded net interest margin, significant increases in mortgage production and servicing revenue and a very strong quarter for investment banking.
Further, a $47 million decline in provision for credit losses and flat non-interest expenses supported the sequential improvement in earnings. Provision for taxes increased $63 million to a small tax liability of $14 million with no material discrete items impacting tax provision in the quarter.
The net effect of securities gains, debt extinguishment costs and mark-to-market gains and losses contributed $47 million to pre-tax income and we’ve adjusted for these items when presenting SunTrust’s core non-interest income for the quarter.
In addition, third quarter results included $59 million in mark-to-market losses and an increase in legal related cost that we’ve not adjusted for. I’ll talk more about these puts and takes in just a minute. However, the overall takeaway was that this was a solid quarter of earnings for SunTrust.
Now, with that said, I’ll also acknowledge that the sustainable earnings of the company are still not where we want them to be. While we are very pleased with the revenue performance of our investment in mortgage banking businesses, we recognize that these revenue sources are subject to seasonal and cyclical variability.
However, there are areas that we believe will drive sustained improvement in our financial results, while the economy remains weak, we expect that gradual continued improvement in economic conditions will result in lower charge-offs and reserves, reduced credit related expenses and increased client demand for loans and financial services in general.
In terms of things that we have greater control over, we are encouraged by our continued success in improving client satisfaction and loyalty. Deposit growth, mix and rates paid and our investment banking performance are tangible examples where we believe this success is driving revenue. Additionally, we remain vigilant in managing expense growth to a proper balance between current income and investments for future profits.
Now, with that brief summary of our third quarter results, I’ll now shift to slide eight a review of loans and deposits. Average loan balances again excluding non-accruals were flat and down 6% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. The story here hasn’t changed much since last quarter.
Consumer loan categories continued to increase with commercial loan categories flat to down. However, there are some things I’d like to call to your attention starting with the commercial loan category. Average commercial loan balances stabilized, breaking a declining trend that started in early 2009, excluding the impact that we had from the FAS 167 consolidation in the first quarter of 2010.
Revolving line of credit utilization rates were stable during the quarter overall. Large corporate utilization was basically stable, while middle market and smaller client utilization declined marginally.
Average balances stabilized and period end balances increased due to higher term loan balances and growth in the balances of three pillars, which you’ll remember is our asset back commercial paper conduit.
Average construction loan balances increased roughly one-half of 1%, which is an anomaly relative to recent trends. However, if you refer to the period end balance sheet in the press release tables, you’ll see that construction loans actually declined $565 million or 11%, as compared to June 30th.
Residential one to four family mortgages increased in the quarter, driven exclusively by increased holdings of federally guaranteed loans. With weak overall loan demand and high liquidity, we have chosen to retain some agency eligible mortgage loan production on balance sheet.
Specifically, we increased our holdings of guaranteed mortgage loans by roughly $1.2 billion during the quarter and these loans are guaranteed by Fannie Mae under its long-term standby commitment program. While we have been growing consumer loans fairly consistently over the past year, growth in the current quarter was robust.
In the current quarter organic growth remained and was augmented significantly by two actions. While it did not impact the average balance significantly, period end consumer direct growth concludes the consolidation of a previously off-balance sheet student loan securitization of just under $500 million.
Growth in the consumer indirect category also includes the purchase of approximately $740 million in high quality consumer auto loans. We continue to expect that broad-based commercial loan growth will return with an improving economy. However, the evidence to date suggests that improvement will occur gradually. As this occurs, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow commercial loans and client segments and products that offer opportunity and to originate and acquire high-quality consumer loans.
Now, moving on to deposits at the bottom of the slide, you can see that core deposits increased and the positive shift in mix to lower cost deposits continued. Balance increases were driven by DDA and money market accounts which sequentially increased four and 6% respectively. These categories combined provided over $3 billion in deposit growth.
Now, partially offsetting this growth were now and CD balances which declined roughly $2.4 billion in the quarter. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the enhanced liquidity and lower cost funding that deposit growth has provided during this past year. This increase in deposits has enabled us to take a series of actions to reduce our higher cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our cost of funds and improvement in our net interest margin.
Actions in the quarter taken to reduce higher cost funding sources include the repayment of bank sub-debt via a tender offer and additional home loan bank repayments, the combination of which was approximately $1 billion. We also continued during the quarter to reposition the securities portfolio. So let’s turn to slide nine.
Our total available for sale portfolio stood at $30.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $2.7 billion from the end of the second quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, we developed a view that rates would decline due to the weakening economic indicators, that coupled with high liquidity caused us to take the opportunity to increase our holdings of high quality, liquid treasury and agency securities early in the third quarter.
More specifically, we rebalanced the agency portion of our portfolio slightly lengthening the duration and netting securities gains of $69 million. With the decline in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to approximately $830 million from $680 million at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to regularly review this portfolio and so far in October, we’ve sold $1.5 billion in securities, primarily to reduce our exposure to certain tranches of mortgage-backed securities that had increased in value during the quarter. As we look forward, over a longer time frame, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. With a basically stable cash position, we expect to decrease the securities portfolio in response to increasing loans and/or decreasing deposits.
Now, I’ll take a moment to cover the margin on slide 10. As I mentioned, lower cost funding drove an eight-basis point improvement in the margin to 3.41%, as earning asset yields were basically stable. Margin exceeded our prior expectations and guidance due primarily to better than expected deposit pricing and mix and the effects of the previously mentioned securities portfolio transactions.
Relative to the prior year, margin is up 31 basis points and this improvement is driven primarily by the lower funding cost discussed earlier. We currently expect margin to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter and the risk and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide.
So let’s move on to provision on slide 11. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $615 million, down $47 million from the second quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Provision expense was $75 million less than charge-offs with $5 million of this differential coming from a reduction in the unfunded commitments reserve that we hold due to the improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate clients.
Charge-offs were $690 million, a decrease of $32 million or 4%, compared to last quarter. The decline occurred in most product categories and was partially offset by an anticipated increase in commercial real estate and a very small increase in residential mortgage.
The allowance ratio declined from 2.81% to 2.69%, as a result of both the decrease in the allowance as well as the increase in period-end loan balances. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in loans is the result of increases in high-quality consumer, commercial and government guaranteed mortgage loans, partially offset by declines in the higher risk categories including construction and home equity. Tom will cover asset quality in more detail in a few minutes, so let’s move on to noninterest income on slide 12.
On a reported basis, noninterest income was up 10% sequentially and 35% from the prior year. We’ve adjusted for a number of items in each quarter and after the adjustments, noninterest income increased by 19 and 17% respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains and as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today’s presentation.
In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are for $69 million in securities gains and a net of $10 million in mark-to-market losses on securities and our fair value debt and related hedges. As mentioned previously, the main drivers of the sequential quarter increase in noninterest income relates to our investment banking and mortgage businesses and key items of note in this quarter’s noninterest income results include investment banking income increasing by 66% or $38 million to a record level of $96 million in the quarter.
This result was driven by strong syndication, bond origination and merger and acquisition revenues. Mortgage production income increased $150 million, driven by an increase in application volume of over 25%, increased production margins and a $53 million decrease in the cost of mortgage repurchases which I’ll cover in more detail in just a minute.
Mortgage servicing income increased $44 million or 51% as compared to the prior quarter, due almost entirely to hedge performance. Trading income actually declined $130 million in the quarter, which needs a little more explanation. The majority of the decline was caused by mark-to-market losses on our publicly traded debt and related hedges of $22 million in the current quarter as compared to gains of $63 million in the second quarter.
Not included in the adjustments on this page is an additional mark-to-market loss of $59 million on index-linked certificates of deposit. In prior quarters, the marks on these deposits which total about $1.2 billion, have been relatively insignificant and mostly positive.
Tightening of SunTrust credit spreads and the declining interest rates in the current quarter resulted in a $59 million loss this period. A view excluding the impact of the mark on index-linked CDs and the items included in the appendix reflected increase in trading income driven largely by fixed income and derivatives trading.
Now, the final item, I will note is the decline in service charges on deposit accounts of $24 million or 11%. This reduction is related to the implementation of the required Reg E changes and the voluntary changes that we have made to our fee schedules that Jim talked about earlier.
Our voluntary changes were in place for the entire quarter and the Reg E changes were effective August 15th. As a result, we expect a full quarter of Reg E to have a negative sequential quarter impact going into the fourth quarter, with some mitigating impact from increased client opt-in and a typical seasonal increase.
Let’s now turn to slide 13 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. The noninterest income impact of mortgage repurchases decreased $53 million this quarter. The reduction was primarily due to lower charge-offs, coupled with a smaller increase in reserves.
Repurchase losses declined in part due to the implementation in the quarter of an enhanced review process and in part due to a decline of the average loan size of the volume process. In addition, new request volumes declined back to the levels more consistent with the first quarter and resulted in a basically stable population of pending requests. However, new request volume remains volatile from month-to-month and as such, future results are difficult to estimate with precision.
If third quarter trends continue and they have so far in October, our current expectation is that fourth quarter charge-offs will increase back closer to the second quarter levels. However, if -- and I want to emphasize if, new request volumes remain stable, our current view is that reserve additions in the fourth quarter will be roughly stable with the third quarter, despite the expected increase in charge-offs.
Now, said another way, we expect the income statement impact in the fourth quarter to remain relatively stable with that realized in the third quarter at this time. Now, of course, all of this is related to the assumptions that I’ve just walked you through.
The key points from the bottom part of this slide are slightly altered from prior quarters. Most of our current request volume is coming from the higher loss vintages of 2007 and prior years and this has continued longer than we originally expected. We continue to expect, however, that normal seasoning patterns for origination vintages overtime will shift new request volume to newer vintages.
As that occurs, we expect lower request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics as depicted on the bottom right of slide 13. The last point I’ll make on this topic does not have a reference point on the slide.
The topic is the recent speculation regarding repurchase liability for non-agency loan sales. So first, let me put the numbers into perspective. The timeframe we should focus on is 2005 through 2007 as we had very few of such sales in 2008. The total sales volume of non-agency product during this timeframe is approximately $30 billion and the remaining unpaid balance today is roughly $17 billion.
In addition, the composition of our non-agency sales is dramatically different than from the industry produced over this time frame. For example, our percentage of prime non-agency productions sold was approximately 56%, with the balance being generally high quality, low doc production.
By contrast, external data sources show the total industry with a much lower composition of prime product loan sales. Finally, we have not had a material volume of repurchase requests on non-agency sales to date, nor have we sustained losses of a substantial nature.
So with that, let me turn to slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was flat when compared to last quarter and increased 5% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Adjusting for a few items that are detailed in the appendix of today’s presentation, expenses increased 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the third quarter of last year.
At the bottom of the slide, we’ve included the three primary drivers of the sequential quarter increase which combined drove the majority of the change. Personnel-related expenses are the biggest contributor and the majority of the growth is associated with improved revenue generation.
Incentive compensation associated with mortgage, investment banking performance increased as you would expect. Further, of the increase in headcount of approximately 350, the majority is related to mortgage production. The remaining increase is largely related to investment in personnel in our technology area and revenue producers in other lines of business.
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeking to balance current expenses against investment in future revenue and this is an example. The other area of growth is embedded within other noninterest expense and on the slide we’ve removed credit-related expenses and adjustments from the appendix of the presentation to highlight this embedded increase.
The reconciliation for this line is in the appendix as well. The increase of $17 million you see on the slide is more than 100% associated with legal-related costs. And while future litigation-related expenses are never certain, our current expectation is that these costs will not recur next quarter.
So with that overview of our third quarter results, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality in more detail. Tom?

305901,113941651,80784,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Mark. This morning, I’m going to review our asset quality beginning on slide 15. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing a",1810,"Thanks Mark. This morning, I’m going to review our asset quality beginning on slide 15. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing assets all decreased.
Loan balances increased and overall delinquencies were basically stable. Net charge-offs during the second quarter were $690 million, down $32 million from last quarter. Charge-offs continued to be heavily concentrated in the residential real estate related portfolios, including residential mortgages, construction and home equity.
The net charge-off ratio declined from 2.57% to 2.42% with most portfolios showing improvement. Stable mortgage and higher commercial real estate charge-offs were the exceptions to this declining trend and I’ll talk about these more in a moment.
Provision expense declined as a result of lower charge-offs. In addition, with improved asset quality metrics in the current quarter and an outlook for continued gradual improvement, the allowance for loan losses was reduced by a modest $70 million. The allowance to loan ratio declined to 2.69% of loans or 12 basis points.
With roughly half the decline related to lower reserves, the other half of the decline is related to higher loan balances. As Mark mentioned earlier, the portfolio mix continued to improve, with higher risk portfolio balances like construction continuing to decline and growth occurring in both higher quality and federally guaranteed portfolios.
Nonperforming loans declined during the quarter by over $325 million or 7%. This is a fifth consecutive quarter of declining nonperforming loans. Owned real estate also declined resulting in nonperforming assets declining by nearly $400 million.
Aggressive problem asset resolution coupled with continuing trending of lower inflows into nonperforming drove the decline in the current quarter. Early stage delinquencies remained basically stable during the quarter. Delinquencies are currently below 1% after excluding government guaranteed loans.
The early stage delinquencies have declined significantly since the beginning of 2009. While the economic and employment environments have remained sluggish. As a result, we do not expect significant further improvement in overall early stage delinquencies until general economic conditions improve.
Please turn to slide 16 for review of loan portfolios. This slide provides a net charge-off and early stage delinquency metric by loan type. It illustrates on a more granular level that overall asset quality has improved and that asset quality issues remain concentrated in the residential real estate portfolios.
Charge-offs declined broadly among the portfolios. Early stage delinquencies were stable to down and balances in some of the higher risk portfolios continue to decline. Commercial portfolio continues to perform well with early stage delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs stable to down in the quarter.
Charge-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio increased to just over 1% of loans on an annualized basis. While a significant increase in the annualized charge-off rate, the actual dollars involved were relatively low, with charge-offs in the segment totaling $40 million.
We expect some additional stress and charge-offs in this portfolio as the economic cycle plays out. However, the timing of problem resolution in commercial real estate can be varied. Overall, we continue to believe that this portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition, the quality of underwriting and our ongoing management disciplines. Evidence of this can be seen in the relatively low and stable levels of non-performing loans and delinquencies.
As a reminder, this portfolio is largely owner occupied and has an average loan size of about $700,000 overall. The average loan size of investor real estate loans is about $1.1 million. Asset quality is generally improved in the consumer portfolios with stable-to-lower early stage delinquencies and charge-offs.
We provided additional detail this quarter on the consumer direct portfolio, to highlight the relatively high delinquency and relatively low losses contained in the student loan portfolio. Student loans comprise two-thirds of the consumer direct portfolio and roughly 90% of the student loans are government guaranteed.
I’m going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in the next few slides. In general, balances in these portfolios continue to decline and they are disciplined generally stable to improving performance with construction continuing to show some variability.
Mortgage charge-offs increased slightly this quarter but our outlook for charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio continues to be stable to improve. Next I’m going to briefly review a more detailed presentation of our residential mortgage portfolio on slide 17.
Asset quality in the residential mortgage portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of nonperforming loans and delinquencies driven in large part by performance in the core portfolio. Growth in the core mortgage portfolio was due to the origination and retention of mortgages that have Federal Government guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA.
This government guaranteed subset of the core portfolio increased by over $1.2 billion during the quarter and now stands at over $3 billion. A non-core portion of the portfolio continued its declining trend during the quarter, dropping by over $300 million.
Non-performing balances declined in every segment of this portfolio during the quarter. Total delinquencies declined seven basis points overall, driven down by small decrease in the core portfolio and larger declines in the home equity loan and lot loan portfolio segments.
Despite stable sequential charge-offs, delinquency trends in this portfolio continued to point to reduced frequency of over the next quarter or two. We expect home prices to remain soft overall, trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in others.
We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to declining non-performing loan and charge-off levels over the next quarter or two. There are some risks to this generally improving outlook.
The first is the pace of economic recovery and more specifically unemployment rates and housing prices. The second risk relates to the foreclosure process. SunTrust is reviewing pending foreclosures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and practices. We take this issue very seriously and we’re pursuing it aggressively.
While technical issues may arise in the preparation of any legal document, we are taking this opportunity to resolve any issues which are uncovered. We have completed this review process for the states of Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. These states account for approximately 85 or 80% of the unit volume in our portfolio.
To provide some context regarding the impact to SunTrust, in Florida which represents about 70% of our foreclosure activity, we have less than 300 loans scheduled for hearings in the next 60 to 90 days. As a result, we do not expect any required rescheduling to have a material impact on the resolution of our mortgage non-accruals.
We’ll now move to slide 18 to discuss home equity lines. Home equity portfolio balances and charge-offs continued to decline, while nonaccruals were relatively stable. Over two-thirds of the portfolio is labeled as core and is performing reasonably well. The rest of the portfolio is running off with no new production and little to no line availability.
As you would expect, elevated credit metrics are largely driven by these higher risk segments. These include lines originated by third parties, lines in Florida and other states with high loan to value ratios.
Now, if you turn to slide 19, I’ll talk about our construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce our exposure to higher risk construction loans with balances dropping another 11% during the third quarter. Balances are down 40% on a year-over-year basis while overall charge-offs were down sequentially, they remain elevated and uneven.
The amount and timing of construction charge-offs are variable due to the nature of the workout process. In addition, commercial construction loans are typically larger and more complex than consumer construction loans and introduce another element of variability.
As you can see on this slide, residential construction has been the most problematic construction portfolio. We expect that charge-offs related to these loans will remain elevated and somewhat variable over the next few quarters as we continue to work through this rapidly declining portfolio.
Commercial construction balances continue to decline and this portfolio has generally performed better than its residential counterpart but it too has demonstrated, elevated and somewhat variable charge-offs. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased for the second straight quarter but are expected to remain elevated. We believe that residential construction nonperforming levels will be stable to down with modest increases in nonperforming commercial construction loans.
The overall construction delinquency ratio increased quarter-over-quarter. However, this was driven by lower portfolio balances rather than by an increase in the dollars delinquent which remains stable.
Next, I’m going to review loan modification results on slide 20 of today’s presentation. Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter and performance continued to be at an acceptable level with 86% of accruing restructured loans remaining current on principal and interest payments.
Balances of accruing TDRs increased by roughly $250 million during the current quarter as compared to approximately $360 million last quarter. The vast majority, 97%, of accruing TDRs are consumer, residential-related loans. The slowing growth trends in residential TDRs continued and the pace of newly delinquent loans eligible for restructure decreased.
Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs continued to exceed our expectations during the third quarter. Accruing TDRs have a weighted average age of 12 months, evidencing a level of sustained performance. With 94% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio remained much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than our restructured portfolio.
Before turning the call back over to Steve, I’m going to provide a brief summary of today’s asset quality review on slide 21. Overall, asset quality continued to improve in the quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined. Delinquencies were stable to down in most of the portfolios. However, we do not expect significant additional improvements in overall early stage delinquencies until economic conditions strengthen.
Charge-offs declined modestly overall, with most portfolios stable to down. Commercial real estate charge-offs increased as specific problem loans were resolved. Given continuing stress in this segment, the timing and amount of future commercial real estate charge-offs will remain variable and elevated.
Mortgage asset quality metrics were stable or improved. We continue to aggressively and successfully reduce the risk in the construction portfolio as evidenced by additional balance reductions, lower non-performing loans and elevated charge-off levels. Accruing TDRs remain predominantly centered around consumer mortgages. Balances increased modestly in the quarter and solid payment performance continued.
At the current time, we expect overall credit quality to improve again in the fourth quarter, with total net charge-offs stable to slightly down and nonperformers declining modestly. Finally, at this point in the cycle, we expect the allowance for loan losses to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with the improvement in credit quality.

The non-agency product is included in our reserve process but we’ve had few requests to date and few losses and the bulk of the reserves that we’ve been talking about and that we show in our presentation materials relate to the agency products. You’ll recall that total reserve is around $270 million, which was up $14 million.

So it’s certainly something to take into consideration as you’re looking on a forward basis at both our improving credit trends as well as the de-risking that’s taken place in the higher risk portfolio and where the growth has come is on the margin in some of these government guaranteed areas as well as the consumer book that we outlined during the presentation.

Financial results improved significantly this quarter as we earned $84 million, or $0.17 per share. Strong revenue coupled with lower credit costs drove significantly increased profitability. As you're all aware, throughout this economic cycle we have been positioning our businesses for growth. Those efforts are gaining traction and resulting in improved performance. Though macroeconomic indicators are mixed, and there remains uncertainty in regard to regulation, we are increasingly encouraged by the improvement in our operating results. 
Revenue growth in the quarter was particularly strong in mortgage-related revenues as we benefited from the lower interest rates. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also had a terrific quarter posting record investment banking revenues. Partially offsetting the performance of these core businesses was the decrease in service charges, largely related to Reg E and $81 million of mark-to-market losses on debt and Index Linked CDs. 
Net interest income and net interest margin increased compared to last quarter, up 5% and eight basis points, respectively. Net interest margin increased largely due to the improved funding mix of the lower rates paid on deposits. Additionally, the securities and loan portfolios increased. Borrowing asset yields remain stable. 
Total expenses were flat compared to last quarter while core expenses increased, largely driven by revenue-related compensation and legal-related expenses. Mark will provide more detail on this momentarily. However, I will reiterate that we continue to manage expenses tightly across the organization, while making what we believe are appropriate investments in our business to facilitate growth.
Asset quality trends continue to improve with nonperforming assets, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses all declining this quarter. As anticipated, early stage delinquencies were stable overall. We made a significant stride toward our goal to improve the client experience and thereby increase client satisfaction and loyalty. These efforts are beginning to manifest themselves in revenue growth. 
While it's still a challenging operating environment, we are moving the needle in several key areas of the business. At the same time we're aware of lingering operating environmental uncertainties such as regulatory and legislative matters. We’ll move to Slide 4 where we provided some information to add some clarity on that topic.
It is clear that financial regulation will impact our financial results, but we believe for us it will be manageable. The information on Slide 4 highlights selected items of interest, although it is not intended to be all-inclusive. Certain changes are expected to have little impact on SunTrust, such as the Card Act. While others such as the impact of the consumer financial protection bureau are simply not predictable at this time.
First I’ll focus on deposit service charges. Last quarter we indicated that the impact of Reg E on service charges was expected to be at the low end of the previously provided 10% to 20% range. That expectation remains. However, additional clarity is probably necessary. 
Clients continue to opt in and we expect them to do so over the next two to three quarters. Therefore, we expect to see a more substantial negative impact of service charges now, but as clients continue to opt in, the impact will trend down. We expect the impact from Reg E to stabilize to a low double-digit figure as we approach mid-2011. In the meantime, it will probably be a little more elevated. 
We also chose to make changes outside of Reg E that were designed to improve client satisfaction. We decided to stop charging overdraft fees on individual transactions with a value of less than $5, and to reduce the number of maximum daily overdraft fees. These changes were effective July 1 and are expected to reduce service charges by an additional 5% to 6% annually. I'll also point out that these estimates do not include any mitigating effects of household retention, household growth or any changes to products or pricing. 
Derivatives contributed about $100 million in revenue in 2009, most of which was generated from clients. This is an area where we do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes will have a material impact on the revenue for SunTrust.
Consumer and small business debit card interchange contributed about $250 million in fee income during 2009. We expect some impact to this revenue stream obviously. However, the ultimate amount will remain unknown until final regulations are written. This is a higher growth opportunity area and is driven by household growth, higher product penetration and increasing consumer usage patterns, which will help to offset the potential impact of lower interchange rates.
We had anticipated an increase in FDIC deposit insurance costs as a result of the change in assessment base from deposits to assets. However, based on the FDIC's recent announcement it appears that the impact will be less than originally anticipated, though the amount is still not known at this time. 
The final item of note is the Collins Amendment and the effect it will have on Tier 1 capital. With $2.3 billion in outstanding instruments we expect a cumulative reduction in the Tier 1 ratio of approximately 175 basis points. This is on an incremental basis and obviously will not include all the other factors that affect capital over time. This reduction will occur over three years beginning in 2013, and with our solid capital position this is another completely manageable outcome. For the time being, we view these instruments as reasonably attractive capital, although we will continue to evaluate whether to call these securities by weighing their costs against the capital benefits.
And now turning to Slide 5 and a review of our capital position. Virtually all of our key capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have each quarter depicted on the slide. During the third quarter, Tier 1 capital increased to an estimated 13.6%, while estimated Tier 1 common increased to 8%. The total capital ratio declined in the current quarter as a result of the tender for subordinated debt that we completed in the third quarter. We'd like to take a moment before I turn the call over to Mark to give some context to our estimated 8% Tier 1 common ratio in light of the recently announced Basel III requirements. 
So if you'll turn to Slide 6. The Tier 1 common capital ratio of 8%, which I mentioned, represents $10.7 billion of capital. That ratio is well above the announced Basel III regulatory standard. SunTrust's estimated Tier 1 ratio of 8% is a full 1% of $1.3 billion above the threshold of 4.5% plus the 2.5% conservation buffer, which is not scheduled to become effective fully until 2019.
SunTrust's capital position today is particularly strong especially when you consider our improving credit risk profile. We've reduced our higher risk portfolios by 10% to 50% since the end of 2008. And furthermore, we have relatively low market and operating risk and high liquidity. And with strong capital, more clarity on capital standards, lower risk, high liquidity and improved earnings, we believe that we are well positioned to repay TARP. As I've said, we will repay it at the appropriate time and in a fashion that makes the most sense for both our shareholder and regulatory prospectives. 
The efforts being made to position SunTrust for growth beyond the cycle are translating into improved core performance. We are investing to grow the business. We are managing expenses prudently, and we've return the company to profitability. And though modestly improving economic conditions are helping performance, we remain encouraged by our emerging operating results. There are certainly still quite a lot of work to be done, but we're making strides in the right direction. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more detail."
305901,113941651,81082,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation with a review of the summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $84 million, or $0.17 per share",2827,"Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation with a review of the summary income statement. 
For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $84 million, or $0.17 per share. This is a $140 million improvement from the loss to common shareholders of $56 million that we posted in the second quarter. The improvement was largely attributable to strong core revenue performance, which increased $153 million, sequentially. 
Net interest income increased 5%. Noninterest income increased 10%, with the combined result of 7% increase in revenues. The key revenue drivers included increased earning assets, expanded net interest margin, significant increases in mortgage production and servicing revenue and a very strong quarter for investment banking. Further, a $47 million decline in provision for credit losses and flat noninterest expenses supported the sequential improvement in earnings. Provision for taxes increased $63 million to a small tax liability of $14 million, with no material discrete items impacting tax provision in the quarter.
The net effect of securities gains, debt extinguishment costs and mark-to-market gains and losses contributed $47 million to pretax income. And we've adjusted for these items when representing SunTrust's core noninterest income for the quarter. In addition, third quarter results included $59 million in mark-to-market losses and an increase in legal-related costs that we've not adjusted for.  I'll talk more about these puts and takes in just a minute. However, the overall take away was that this was a solid quarter of earnings for SunTrust. Now with that said, I'll also acknowledge that the sustainable earnings of the company are still not where we want them to be. 
While we are very pleased with the revenue performance of our investment in Mortgage Banking businesses, we recognize that these revenue sources are subject to seasonal and cyclical variability. However, there are areas that we believe we'll drive sustained improvement in our financial results. While the economy remains weak, we expect that gradual, continued improvement in economic conditions will result in lower charge-offs and reserves, reduced credit-related expenses and increased client demands for loans and financial services in general. 
In terms of things that we have greater control over, we are encouraged by our continued success in improving client satisfaction and loyalty. Deposit growth, mix and rates paid and our investment banking performance are tangible examples where we believe this success is driving revenue.
Additionally, we remain vigilant in managing expense growth to a proper balance between current income and investment for future profits. Now with that brief summary of our third quarter results, I'll now shift to Slide 8 and a review of loans and deposits.
Average loan balances, again excluding nonaccruals, we're flat and down 6% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. The story here hasn't changed much since last quarter. Consumer loan categories continued to increase with commercial loan categories flat to down. However, there are some things I'd like to call to your attention starting with the commercial loan category. Average commercial loan balances stabilized, breaking a declining trend that started in early 2009, excluding the impact that we have from the FAS 167 consolidation in the first quarter of 2010.
Revolving line of credit utilization rates were stable during the quarter overall. Large corporate utilization was basically stable, while middle market and smaller client utilization declined marginally. Average balances stabilized and period end balances increased due to higher term loan balances and growth in the balances of Three Pillars, which you'll remember is our asset-backed commercial paper conduit.
Average construction loan balances increased roughly 1/2 of 1%, which is an anomaly relative to recent trends. However, if you refer to the period end balance sheet in the press release tables, you'll see that construction loans actually declined $565 million, or 11% as compared to June 30. 
Residential 1-4 family mortgages increased in the quarter, driven exclusively by increased holdings of federally guaranteed loans. With weak overall loan demand and high liquidity, we have chosen to retain some agency-eligible mortgage loan production on the balance sheet. Specifically, we increased our holdings of guaranteed mortgage loans by roughly $1.2 billion during the quarter, and these loans are guaranteed by Fannie Mae under its long-term standby commitment program. 
While we have been growing consumer loans fairly consistently over the past year, growth in the current quarter was robust. In the current quarter, organic growth remained and was augmented significantly by two actions. While it did not impact the average balance significantly, period end consumer direct growth includes the consolidation of a previously off-balance sheet student loan securitization of just under $500 million. Growth in the consumer and direct category also includes the purchase of approximately $740 million in high-quality consumer auto loans.
We continue to expect that broad-based commercial loan growth will return with an improving economy. However, the evidence to date suggests that improvement will occur gradually. As this occurs we will continue to look for opportunities to grow commercial loans in client segments and products that offer opportunity, and to originate and acquire high-quality consumer loans. 
Now moving on to deposits. At the bottom of the slide you can see that core deposits increased and that the positive shift in mix to lower cost deposits continued. Balance increases were driven by DDA and Money Market Accounts, which sequentially increased 4% and 6%, respectively. These categories combined provided over $3 billion in deposit growth.
Now partially offsetting this growth were NOW and CD balances, which declined roughly $2.4 billion in the quarter. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the enhanced liquidity and lower cost funding that deposit growth has provided during this past year. This increase in deposits has enabled us to take a series of actions to reduce our higher cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our cost of funds and improvement in our net interest margin. Actions in the quarter taken to reduce higher cost funding sources include the repayment of bank sub-debt via a tender offer and additional home loan bank repayments, the combination of which was approximately $1 billion. We also continued during the quarter to reposition the securities portfolio. So let's turn to Slide 9.
Our total available for-sale portfolio stood at $30.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $2.7 billion from the end of the second quarter. At the beginning of the quarter we developed a view that rates would decline due to the weakening economic indicators. That, coupled with high liquidity, caused us to take the opportunity to increase our holdings of high-quality liquid Treasury and agency securities early in the third quarter. More specifically, we rebalanced the agency portion of our portfolios slightly lengthening the duration and netting securities gains of $69 million. 
With the decline in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to approximately $830 million from $680 million at the end of the second quarter. We continue to regularly review this portfolio and so far in October we've sold $1.5 billion in securities, primarily to reduce our exposure to certain tranches of mortgage-backed securities that had increased in value during the quarter.
As we look forward over a longer timeframe, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. With a basically stable cash position, we expect to decrease the securities portfolio in response to increasing loans and/or decreasing deposits. 
Now I'll take a moment to cover the margin on Slide 10. As I mentioned, lower cost funding drove an 8 basis point improvement in the margin to 3.41% as earning asset yields were basically stable. Margin exceeded our prior expectations and guidance due primarily to better than expected deposit pricing and mix, and the effects of the previously mentioned securities portfolio transactions. 
Relative to the prior year, margin is up 31 basis points. And this improvement is driven primarily by the lower funding costs discussed earlier. We currently expect margins to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. And the risk and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide. 
So let's move on to provision on Slide 11. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $615 million, down $47 million from the second quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Provision expense was $75 million less than charge-offs, with $5 million of this differential coming from the reduction in the unfunded commitments reserve that we hold, due to the improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate clients. Charge-offs were $690 million, a decrease of $32 million or 4% compared to last quarter.
The decline occurred in most product categories and was partially offset by an anticipated increase in commercial real estate and a very small increase in residential mortgage. The allowance ratio declined from 2.81% to 2.69% as a result of both the decrease in the allowance, as well as the increase in period end loan balances. 
As I mentioned earlier, the increase in loans is the result of increases in high-quality consumer, commercial and government guaranteed mortgage loans, partially offset by declines in the higher risk categories, including construction and home equity. 
Tom will cover asset quality in more detail in a few minutes, so let's move on to noninterest income on Slide 12. On a reported basis, noninterest income was up 10% sequentially and 35% from the prior year. We've adjusted for a number of items in each quarter and after the adjustments, noninterest income increased by 19% and 17%, respectively.
The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains. And as in prior quarters, we've provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation. In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are for $69 million in securities gains, and a net of $10 million in mark-to-market losses on securities in our fair value debt and related hedges. 
As mentioned previously, the main drivers of the sequential quarter increase in noninterest income relates to our Investment Banking and Mortgage businesses. And key items of note in this quarter's noninterest income results include Investment Banking income increasing by 66%, or $38 million, to a record level of $96 million in the quarter. This result was driven by strong syndication, bond origination and merger and acquisition revenues. 
Mortgage production income increased $150 million, driven by an increase in application volume of over 25%, increased production margins and a $53 million decrease in the cost of mortgage repurchases, which I'll cover in more detail in just a minute. Mortgage servicing income increased to $44 million, or 51%, as compared to the prior quarter due almost entirely to hedge performance.
Trading income actually declined $130 million in the quarter, which needs a little more explanation. The majority of the decline was caused by mark-to-market losses on our publicly-traded debt and related hedges of $22 million in the current quarter, as compared to gains of $63 million in the second quarter. Not included in the adjustments on this page is an additional mark-to-market loss of $59 million on index linked certificates of deposits. In prior quarters, the marks on these deposits, which total about $1.2 billion, have been relatively insignificant and mostly positive.
Tightening of SunTrust’s credit spreads and the decline in interest rates in the current quarter resulted in a $59 million loss this period. A view, excluding the impact of the mark on Index Linked CDs and the items included in the appendix, reflects an increase in trading income, driven largely by fixed income and derivatives trading. 
Now the final item I will note is the decline in service charges on deposit accounts of $24 million, or 11%. This reduction is related to the implementation of the required Reg E changes, and the voluntary changes that we have made to our fee schedules that Jim talked about earlier. Our voluntary changes were in place for the entire quarter, and the Reg E changes we're effective August 15. As a result, we expect a full quarter of Reg E to have a negative sequential quarter impact going into the fourth quarter, with some mitigating impact from increased client opt-in and a typical seasonal increase.
Let's now turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. The noninterest income impact of mortgage repurchases decreased $53 million this quarter. The reduction was primarily due to lower charge-offs, coupled with a smaller increase in reserves. Repurchased losses declined in part due to the implementation in the quarter of an enhanced review process, and in part due to a decline in the average loan size of the volume processed. 
In addition, new request volumes declined back to the levels more consistent with the first quarter, and resulted in a basically stable population of pending requests. However, new request volume remains volatile from month to month and as such, future results are difficult to estimate with precision. 
If third quarter trends continue, and they have so far in October, our current expectation is that fourth quarter charge-offs will increase back closer to the second quarter level. However, if, and I want to emphasize if, new request volumes remain stable, our current view is that reserve additions in the fourth quarter will be roughly stable with the third quarter despite the expected increase in charge-offs. Now said another way, we expect the income statement impact in the fourth quarter to remain relatively stable with that realized the third quarter at this time. Now of course, all of this is related to the assumption that I've just walked you through.
The key points from the bottom part of this slide are slightly altered from prior quarters. Most of our current request volume is coming from the higher loss vintages of 2007 and prior years. And this has continued longer than we originally expected. We continue to expect however, the normal seasoning patterns, or origination of vintages over time, will shift new request volume to newer vintages.  
As that occurs, we expect lower request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics as depicted on the bottom right of Slide 13. The last point I'll make on this topic does not have a reference point on this slide. The topic is the recent speculation regarding repurchase liability for non-agency loan sales. So first, let me put the numbers into prospective. 
The timeframe we should focus on is 2005 to 2007, as we had very few of such sales in 2008. The total sales volume of non-agency product during this time frame is approximately $30 billion, and the remaining unpaid balance today is roughly $17 billion.
In addition, the composition of our non-agency sales is dramatically different than what the industry produced over this time frame. For example, our percentage of prime, non-agency production sold was approximately 56%, with the balance being generally high-quality, low-doc production. By contrast, external data sources showed the total industry with a much lower composition of prime product loan sales. Finally, we have not had a material of volume of repurchase requests on non-agency sales to date, nor have we sustained losses of a substantial nature.
So with that, let me turn to Slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was flat when compared to last quarter, and increased 5% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Adjusting for a few items that are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation, expenses increased 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
At the bottom of the slide, we've included the three primary drivers of the sequential quarter increase which combined drove the majority of the change. Personnel-related expenses are the biggest contributor. And the majority of the growth is associated with improved revenue generation. Incentive compensation associated with mortgage and investment banking performance increased as you would expect. Further, of the increase in headcount of approximately 350, the majority is related to mortgage production. The remaining increase is largely related to investment in personnel in our technology area and revenue producers in other lines of business.
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeking to balance current expenses against investment in future revenue, and this is an example. The area of growth is embedded within other noninterest expense. And on the slide, we've removed credit-related expenses and adjustments from the appendix of the presentation to highlight this embedded increase. 
The reconciliation for this line is in the appendix as well. The increase of $17 million you see on the slide is more than 100% associated with legal-related costs. And while future litigation-related expenses are never certain, our current expectation is that these costs will not recur the next quarter. So with that overview of our third quarter results, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality in more detail. Tom?"

As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets all decreased. Loan balances increased and overall delinquencies were basically stable.
Net charge-offs during the second quarter were $690 million, down $32 million from last quarter. Charge-offs continued to be heavily concentrated in the residential real estate-related portfolios, including residential mortgages, construction and home equity. The net charge-off ratio declined from 2.57% to 2.42%, with most portfolios showing improvement.
Stable mortgage and higher commercial real estate charge-offs were the exceptions to this declining trend. And I'll talk about these more in a moment. Provision expense declined as a result of lower charge-offs. In addition, with improved asset quality metrics in the current quarter and an outlook for continued gradual improvement, the allowance for loan losses was reduced by a modest $70 million.
The allowance to loan ratio declined to 2.69% of loans, or 12 basis points, with roughly half the decline related to lower reserves. The other half of the decline was related to higher loan balances. As Mark mentioned earlier, the portfolio mix continued to improve with higher risk portfolio balances like construction continuing to decline and growth occurring in both higher quality and federally guaranteed portfolios. 
Nonperforming loans declined in the quarter by over $325 million, or 7%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of declining nonperforming loans. Real estate also decline, resulting in nonperforming assets declining by nearly $400 million dollars.
Aggressive problem asset resolution, coupled with continuing trending of lower inflows into nonperforming, drove the decline in the current quarter. Early stage delinquencies remained basically stable during the quarter. Delinquencies are currently below 1% after excluding government guaranteed loans. Early stage delinquencies have declined significantly since the beginning of 2009, while the economic and employment environment have remained sluggish. As a result, we do not expect significant further improvement overall in our early stage delinquencies until general economic conditions improve.
Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of loan portfolios. This slide provides a net charge-off in early stage delinquency metric per loan type. It illustrates at a more granular level that overall asset quality has improved. Net asset quality issues remain concentrated in the Residential Real Estate portfolios. 
Charge-offs decline broadly among the portfolios. Early stage delinquencies were stable to down. And balances in some of the higher risk portfolios continue to decline. Commercial portfolio continues to perform well, with early stage delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs stable to down in the quarter. Charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio increased to just over 1% of loans on an annualized basis.
While a significant increase in the annualized charge-off rate, the actual dollars involved were relatively slow with charge-offs in the segment totaling $40 million. We expect some additional stress in charge-offs in this portfolio as the economic cycle plays out. However, the timing of problem resolution in Commercial Real Estate can be varied. 
Overall, we continue to believe that this portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition, the quality of underwriting and our ongoing management disciplines. Evidence of this can be seen in the relatively low and stable levels of nonperforming loans and delinquencies. As a reminder, this portfolio is largely owner-occupied, and has an average loan size of about $700,000 overall. The average loan size of Investor Real Estate loans is about $1.1 million. 
Asset quality is generally improved in the consumer portfolios with stable to lower early stage delinquencies and charge-offs. We've provided additional detail this quarter on the Consumer Direct portfolio to highlight the relatively high delinquency and the relatively low losses contained from the Student Loan portfolio. Student loans comprise 2/3 of the Consumer Direct portfolio. And roughly 90% of the student loans are government guaranteed.
I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk Residential Real Estate, Secured and Construction portfolios in the next few slides. In general, balances in these portfolios continue to decline and they're displaying generally stable to improving performance, with Construction continuing to show some variability. Mortgage charge-offs increased slightly this quarter, but our outlook for charge-offs in the Residential Mortgage portfolio continues to be stable to improved. Next, I'm going to briefly review a more detailed presentation of our Residential Mortgage portfolio on Slide 17.
Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of nonperforming loans and delinquencies driven in large part by performance in the core portfolio. Growth in the core Mortgage portfolio was due to the origination and retention of mortgages that have federal government guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA. 
This government guaranteed subset of the core portfolio increased by over $1.2 billion during the quarter and now stands at over $3 billion. The non-core portion of the portfolio continued its declining trend during the quarter, dropping by over $300 million. Nonperforming balances declined in every segment of this portfolio during the quarter. Total delinquencies declined 7 basis points overall, driven down by small decrease in the core portfolio and larger declines in Home Equity Loan and Lot Loan portfolio segments. 
Despite stable sequential charge-offs, delinquency trends in this portfolio continue to point to reduced frequency of delinquency during the next quarter. We expect home prices to remain soft overall, trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in others. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to declining nonperforming loan and charge-off levels over the next quarter or two.
There are some risks to this generally improving outlook. The first is the pace of economic recovery and more specifically unemployment rates and housing prices. The second risk relates to the foreclosure process. SunTrust is reviewing pending foreclosures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and practices. We take this issue very seriously and we're pursuing it aggressively. 
While technical issues may arise in the preparation of any legal document, we are taking this opportunity to resolve any issues which are uncovered. We have completed this review of process for the states of Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. These states accounts for approximately 80% of the unit volume in our portfolio. 
To provide some contact regarding the impact of SunTrust, in Florida, which represents about 70% of our foreclosure activity, we have less than 300 loans scheduled for hearings in the next 60 to 90 days. As a result, we do not expect any required rescheduling to have a material impact on the resolution of our mortgage nonaccruals. 
We'll now move to Slide 18 to discuss home equity lines. Home equity portfolio of balances and charge-offs continue to decline, while nonaccruals were relatively stable. Over 2/3 of the portfolio is labeled as core and is performing reasonably well. The rest of the portfolio is running off with no new production and little to no line availability. 
As you would expect, elevated credit metrics are largely driven by these higher risk segments. These include lines originated by third parties, lines in Florida and other states with the high loan-to-value ratios. 
Now if you turn to Slide 19, I will talk about our Construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce our exposure to higher risk construction loans, with balances dropping another 11% during the third quarter. Balances are down 40% on a year-over-year basis. While overall charge-offs were down sequentially, they remain elevated and uneven. 
The amount and timing of construction charge-offs are variable to the nature of the work out process. In addition, Commercial Construction Loans are typically larger and more complex than Consumer Construction Loans and introduce another element of variability. As you can see on the slide, Residential Construction has been the most problematic construction portfolio. We expect that charge-offs related to these loans will remain elevated and somewhat variable over the next few quarters as we continue to work through this rapidly declining portfolio.
Commercial construction balances continue to decline, and this portfolio has generally performed better than its residential counterpart. But it, too, demonstrated elevated and somewhat variable charge-offs. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased from the second straight quarter but expected to remain elevated. We believe that residential construction nonperforming loans will be stable to down, with modest increases in nonperforming commercial construction loans. The overall construction delinquency ratio increased quarter-over-quarter. However, this was driven by lower portfolio balances rather than increase as the dollars delinquent, which remain stable. 
Next I'm going to review loan modification results on Slide 20 of today's presentation. Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. And performance continue to be at an acceptable level with 86% of accruing restructured loan remaining current on principal and interest payments. 
Balances of current TDRs increased by roughly $250 million during the current quarter, as compared to approximately $360 million last quarter. The vast majority, about 97%, of accruing TDRs are consumer residential-related loans. The slowing growth trends in residential TDRs continue, and the pace of newly delinquent loans eligible for restructuring decreased. 
Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs continue to exceed our expectations during the third quarter. Accruing TDRs have a weighted average age of 12 months, evidencing a level of sustained performance. With 94% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio remain much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than a restructured portfolio.
Before turning the call back over to Steve, I'm going to provide a brief summary of today's asset quality review on Slide 21. Overall, asset quality continued to improve in the quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined.  Delinquencies were stable to down in most of the portfolios. However, we do not expect significant additional improvements in overall early stage delinquencies until economic conditions strengthen. 
Charge-offs declined modestly overall with most portfolios stable to down. Commercial Real Estate charge-offs increased as specific problem loans were resolved. Given continuing stress in this segment, the timing and amount of future commercial real estate charge-offs will remain variable and elevated. Mortgage asset quality metrics were stable to improved. We continue to aggressively and successful reduce the risk in the Construction portfolio as evidenced by additional balanced reduction, lower nonperforming loans and elevated charge-off levels. 
Accruing TDRs remain predominantly centered around consumer mortgages. Balances increased modestly in  the quarter and solid payment performance continued. At the current time, we expect overall credit quality to improve again in the fourth quarter with total net charge-offs stable to slightly down and nonperformers declining much.
Finally, at this point in the cycle, we expect the allowance for loan losses to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with the improvement in credit quality. With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve."

We have other aspects of the mortgage portfolio that have been at writing. And as a result, this is somewhat of an offset, if you will, to that attrition. We're not looking to grow the overall on-balance sheet mortgage portfolio significantly. We're trying to continue to de-risk our overall loan portfolio and add back quality assets, particularly in this case with the government guarantee. One of the things that you'll note in our earnings release is that we have over the course of the past couple of quarters both added mortgage loans with the guarantee, as well as certain student loans as well as other product that this government guaranteed, such that the total is now about 7% of our total book or about $8 billion. So it's certainly something to take into consideration as you're looking on a forward basis at both our improving credit trends, as well as the de-risking that's taking place in the higher risk portfolio and where the growth is coming on the margin in some of these government guaranteed areas, as well as consumer book that we outlined during the presentation. So you shouldn't expect to see that mortgage portfolio grow significantly over the course of the next couple of quarters."
