Going into the year, Apache de",998,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache's 2009 Year End Results Earnings Call. 2009 was obviously a difficult year for the industry due to the sharp drop in commodity prices and a weakening economy. Going into the year, Apache decided to reduce our investments to ensure that we live within our means without the need to tap the capital markets or dilute our portfolio. So we ended the year with drilling 53% fewer wells than we did a year before and investing 40% less capital. We have run cap activities somewhat towards the end of the year, but we really won't start seeing the benefits of that until in 2010.So in that context, we're very satisfied that the Apache's team, managed to increase production by 9% for 2009, and we came out of the year with more cash on our balance sheet than we had going into it. And we did this without diluting our shareholders ownership of our upstream portfolio.On the cost side, our cost management efforts during the year were successful, we managed to reduce lifting costs per boe by 20% during 2009. And overall, we had strong cash flow from operations after dismal first start. We generated over $5 billion and had adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion. This performance is a testament to the strength of our team and the quality of our portfolio around the world. Every Apache employee is focused on maximizing value and growth on every property. This is easy to claim but very difficult to actually do. It involves an awful lot of geoscience and optimization work, but every location, recompletion, workovers, all add real value and real growth, and you'll see that in our 2009 performance.I'd also like to highlight that in 2009, we replaced 101% of our production, improved reserve terms from drilling and modest acquisitions despite drilling less than 50% of the wells we've drilled in the previous year, and our finding cost for all of Apache globally was about $16 per boe. And the way we really look at that number is internally it's about $13.86 per boe for all regions, excluding the Gulf Coast. And the reason is that be Gulf Coast has a very unique profile of high cost, high cash flow business. I'll try to give you a little more flavor to that. At the end of the year, we ran the full project life internal rate of return on our Gulf of Mexico crude reserves which came out to be almost 30% on a before tax basis. Now that number includes all cash flows from the time we entered the properties and the future cash flows at strict prices. It included $1.1 billion of net hurricane costs and it also included $1.5 billion of future capital costs. Doesn't give any credit for new reserves, we will continue to add on these properties. So in the aggregate, it means we generated an internal rate of return of almost 30% on a go forward tax basis on more $10 billion of capital. If you look at it on a net present value basis, excess of 10% to $17.4 billion, and that's why our Gulf of Mexico portfolio is a great source of value generation for our shareholders.We also took meaningful strategic steps in 2009, including our entry into the global LNG business by our participation on the Wheatstone project in Australia and also, becoming the operator of the potential Kitimat LNG export project in Canada. LNG provides decades of stable cash flow which represents a very interesting contribution to our portfolio of assets for the long-term. We have received many inquiries since we became operator of the Kitimat LNG project in January, and I think all I'll say at this stage, is that it's a very promising concept, we believe it could work, can be very impactful. But at this point, we're simply conducting a FEED study. We have a long way to go before Kitimat potentially becomes a real expert asset on the ground. That sums up everything I'd like to say about 2009 and it's 2010 that matters. So I'd like to outline what we're planning to do for the year and what it means to us.We've been a growth company for 55 years and we focus on long-term growth projects, balanced across our commodities and geographies. We don't follow the latest market fashion because we've found that they tend to change and we're better off to sticking to fundamental principles of profitability and balance and 2010 is going to be no different. We expect another year of production growth in 2010, our international regions continue to deliver a visible pipeline of growth projects and deep drilling inventories. In North America, the aggregate will have another stable year similar to 2009, while our new growth plays aggregate [ph] and will gather some momentum.Overall, we expect Apache's net production for 2010 to grow between 5% and 10% over 2009 and due to projects and activity scheduling, we anticipate the first quarter of 2010 will be slightly up over the fourth quarter of 2009, and then it will accelerate after the first quarter.As you'll hear from John and Rod, we are executing on a broad and a strong portfolio of plays across our global acreage, that will sustain our growth and returns for the long-term. The 662 net wells we're planning to drill this year will advance 32 development plays and 25 exploration plays across our portfolio. To give you a piece of data, the development drilling we do in 2010 alone, will contribute 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent, net to Apache by 2011. The basis for this balanced growth portfolio is simple. The right critical mass of highly perspective acreage around the world, much of which, it is held by production, a good organization with real value and delivery focus and a creative application of technology. With that, let me pass it to John who will discuss North America."

Overall, we cut 2009 investment",1581,"Thank you, Steve. At the onset of 2009, Apache adopted a cautious approach in North American expenditures in order to allow time for cost to adjust downward, to levels reflecting the challenging commodity price environment. Overall, we cut 2009 investment in North America by near 50% from the 2008 level. We're very proud of the fact that our regional teams were able to hold production essentially flat, down 1.3%, while drilling 61% fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008. While I won't suggest that it will be available every year, our large base of HBP properties provided our teams with many opportunities to optimize production from existing wells. This production level was also achieved without any meaningful contribution from new growth plays, such as Horn River in the Granite Wash, which we will be ramping up significantly in 2010 and beyond. You will note that fourth-quarter North American gas production was down 4.4% from the third quarter, that's mostly due to severe weather in Canada where we had widespread freeze up problems.Just a few of the more important 2009 highlights include the startup of Geauxpher in May, eight months later, the two well field is still producing 78 million a day gross, that's 31 million net to Apache. The Horn River activity ramp up, we drilled a total of 42 gross wells, but only completed four. The four wells were completed last summer and continue to produce in excess of 4 million cubic feet per day each, and they confirmed our reserves per well in excess of 10 Bcf for each well. We hold a 50% working interest in that activity with partner in Canada. The horizontal Granite Wash activity, our first operated Granite Wash well, the Hostetter 1-23H in Wheeler County, Texas came on production in late September and continues to produce at a gross rate of 9.5 million and cubic feet of gas per day was 600 barrels of liquids. Additional drilling continues confirming the potential of our interest, covering over 200,000 acreage across the play. And then finally, the acquisition of the marathon interest in the Permian Basin gives us some 200 quality infill development locations for oil in a core area. Moving on to 2010, as we look at 2010, we're going to increase our activity level across North America, the benefit of our very deep portfolio of acreage across the continent, which is primary HBP, is that we can adjust our focus any number of plays as the circumstances dictate. I will now outline our current 2010 North American operating plans.It should be noted and I think this applies across our international regions as well, that while these are our current plans, we will continue to be a nimble value-driven organization that will adjust our plans as necessary through the year to maximize value creation for our shareholders.In 2010, we plan to run an average 26 drilling rigs in North America, nine in the central region, seven in the Gulf Coast region, and five each in the Permian and Canada regions. We currently plan to drill 413 net wells in North America for this year, that will be up from 282 in 2009. Of this 2010 total, 381 will be development wells and 32 exploration wells. On the development side, we expect to run 22 rigs, the top drivers of these activities will be in the following four programs: First, our development in the Horn River Basin in northeast British Columbia jointly with our 50/50 partner in Canada. As mentioned earlier, we drilled 42 gross wells in the Horn River Basin in 2009, while only competing four. With our pad style developments, we are significantly more efficient if we drill all of the wells on a pad before we start completion operations. The 2009 completed wells were the result of the last four wells on the EnCana operated 70-J pad. EnCana drilled an additional 11 wells on their 76-K pad and another five wells on their 63-K pad by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apache drilled 16 wells on our 70-K pad, and addition seven wells on the 52-L pad during the year. We began completion operations on the Apache operated 70-K pad of 16 wells in January.We are now approximate 1/3 of the way through our frac stimulation program, with more than 90 fractures complete. We expect to get another two pads done with 25 to 28 gross wells completed before the end of the year. So in all, we would expect to have 42 to 44 additional wells on production by the end of 2010.There is a little play in the timing as we continue to experiment with a number and sizes of fracs per well to optimize future development. Our efficiency continue to improve through the program, and we have completed as many as four fracs in a 24 hour period on several occasions. As our drilling activity continues, we expect to leave 2010 with more than 30 wells drilled and ready for completion in 2011. We are targeting a 2010 exit rate of more than 100 million cubic feet of gas per day, net from the Horn River, but most of those volumes will be coming on in the second half of 2010.As Steve mentioned, during 2010, we expect to conduct a FEED study for an LNG plant operated by Apache on the West Coast of Canada at Kitimat, British Columbia. This facility, if we decide to proceed with it, could allow export of significant gas volumes from the Horn River Basin, as well as other Apache plays in North America. Second, our continued development program in the Gulf of Mexico shelf. We currently plan to run an average of four rigs through the year on development plays, and drill 29 development wells here, up from 17 last year. Our activity in the Gulf this year is off to an excellent start with positive result on all eight wells drilled so far.For a perspective, the developments associated with those successes alone, will generate a net present value of over $120 million, with a 67% after-tax rate of return on some $95 million of expected capital invested. Third, our horizontal Granite Wash development program is expected to involve an average of five rigs during 2010, we have 29 gross wells, that's 17 net in our 2010 plan, up from seven net wells last year. With our success to date, we're already planning to increase activity to 25 net wells for 2010 and we're targeting at year end, net production rate of 75 million cubic feet of gas per day from the Granite Wash.And then finally, our oil focused Permian development drilling program will involve an average of five rigs for the year and 171 net wells, almost double the 87 net wells we drilled in 2009. The remainder of our development activity in North America will involve an average of eight rigs for the year, and 126 net wells across 12 programs ranging from East Texas, tight sand plays to oil targeted plays in Canada, Oklahoma and Kansas. Our activity levels in these 12 other programs will be somewhat reduced from the 133 net wells in 2009. These being primarily conventional plays, as we concentrate this year on the development of those top four programs I just outlined.To give you a sense of the materiality of the 2010 development program, we expected to provide a net contribution of 52,000 barrels per day in 2011, the first full year of production, with 83% of that volume coming from the top four programs.On the exploration front, we will be significantly increasing our North American exploration activity in 2010. We plan to run an average of seven drilling rigs on this activity during the year and drill 32 net wells, up from 12 in 2009. We will pursue eight different exploration programs representing a balanced range of continuing trend expiration in the Gulf of Mexico, to new place involving horizontal drilling in a number of offshore locations across the continent. We're not in a position to talk about most of these for now, due to commercial sensitivity. One development we can not is in Eastern Canada, where we have completed the transaction with Corridor Resources, under which Apache will fund the testing of potentially large unconventional resources in New Brunswick, close to the East Coast population, centers in Canada and in the U.S. We will drill and operate at least two wells in that play during 2010.We have good reason to believe that the exploration programs we're advancing in 2010, will have the resource scale equivalent to or greater than the plays we are now moving into development in the Horn River and Granite Wash. On an organizational front, as a final note, In North America, we have created a new regional unit for the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin has been part of our Tulsa based central region over the number of years. We are one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, the new regional organization will be based in Midland, Texas. We put these two regions together in 2002, but due to our growth over the years, that combined capital programs increase tenfold by the day. We think separating them will continue the growth in both regions.You will see the performance of these two regions reported separately starting in the first quarter of 2010. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod, who will discuss our international activity."

Apache's international regions reported excellent results in 2009, highlighted by outstanding exploration and development activity and by seeking out and entering into new markets to sell future production of natural gas in Australia and Argentina at more attractive prices. Production in our international regions grew by 21% in 2009, to a yearly average 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by drilling successes in significant increases in Egyptian oil and gas production, as well as significant increases in Australia gas production. Our Egypt region had another outstanding year. Net production averaged 152,600 barrels Of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 38% over 2008. For the year, Apache drilled 164 wells in the Western Desert, including 23 wildcats. Once again, making Apache the most active and successful operator. Fourth quarter drilling successes in the AEB at Phiops, and West Kalabsha 2-X and the Faghur Basin along with successful completions in the Matruh Concession and the Jay Field at Falcon help drive gross production to record high 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at year end.Apache's Australian region production in 2009 increased 40% to 40,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by the restoration of Varanus Island facilities. Apache took a large step forward in 2009, towards securing new to markets for its Australian natural gas, by agreeing to produce our estimated 2.1 Tcf of natural gas reserves in our Julimar discovery to the Wheatstone LNG facility operated by Chevron. We expect to complete the FEED study and make final investment decision in 2011. First production is scheduled for 2015.North Sea production averaged 61,400 barrels of oil per day in 2009, an increased of 2.5% over 2008 levels, due to increased production from several wells drilled in early 2009 and higher production efficiency for most of the year. During the fourth quarter, we experienced reduced production at Forties Field, due to pipeline and riser repairs on Bravo platform which have since been completed. Our North Sea region actually has a second consecutive year of production growth. This is a remarkable achievement in a 35-year-old oil field, the largest in the North Sea, which have seen declined for many years before Apache took over operations in 2003. We drilled 17 wells and added 9,200 barrels a day over the year. The Forties Charlie 6-3 wells completed in June has already recovered 1.3 million barrels of oil. In the Forties Alpha 4-5 well completed in January is still flowing water free at nearly 5,000 barrels of oil per day, and has reached cumulative production of 1.7 million barrels of oil. In Argentina, we drilled 32 wells with a 97% success rate. Net production for 2009 averaged 45,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 5% below 2008, due to a reduction in capital spending in 2009 and lower seasonal takes by customers in the fourth quarter. However, there were two important advance for Apache that occurred in Argentina in 2009. First, we successfully extended the life of all of our concessions in Neuquen Basin from 2017 to 2027. Secondly, we see the approval for four Gas Plus projects, which will allow Apache to sell significant quantities of natural gas, at higher prices in the future.Looking at 2010, we are forecasting a very active development and expiration programs across our international regions. We expect the to run an average of 28 drilling rigs in our core areas over the year. We plan to drill 299 gross or 249 net wells, which is up from 248 gross or 213 net wells in 2009. Of these 299 gross wells in 2010, 223, or 188 net, will be development and 76 gross wells, or 61 net wells, will be exploratory. In the developed area, I'd like to highlight four major program driving our drilling activity in 2010. Firstly, we'll continue the four field with element water flood programs in Egypt at the Heba and Asala Ridge fields and East NEAG, which will involve six rigs and 111 wells of which 55 are producing wells. We've currently produced about 70,000 barrels a day gross from our secondary recovery projects in Egypt. Secondly, we'll continue our Cretaceous and Jurassic oil and rich gas development projects at our Greater Khanda area in Egypt, employing six rigs fuel 33 wells. Thirdly, our Forties oil field development program in North Sea will employ two platform rigs and a jack up to drill 15 new wells. Among the new developments is our mall discovery from the fourth quarter of 2009, which we are progressing to achieve first production of 5000 barrels of oil per day by midyear. Lastly, our Gas Plus development programs in Argentina will average three rigs, drilling 21 wells in 2010. Gas plus developments will be our drilling focus in Neuquen Basin, as this will benefit from sales prices of $4.10 per million BTU on 10 million a day contracts for 2010 and $5 per million Btu on 50 million a day contracts beginning in 2011. Additionally, we are presently progressing the three new Gas Plus contracts for approval.I should note that the first three of these four largest development programs are all target oil. The remaining 43 development wells are spread over six different programs across our core areas and are also focused primarily on oil. We expect this development drilling program for the year to grow to contribute around 50,000 barrels of oil per day of new net production by its first full year of contribution in 2011.During 2010, we'll continue to progress other material projects in our longer-term growth pipeline. Projects that have resulted from exploration discoveries in the prior years. The first of these will be production for our Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects in Australia which are expected to contribute 40,000 barrels a day of net new oil production. As we reported earlier this week, Van Gogh has already started production. These volumes are incremental to the contribution from our development drilling program that I just outlined.Ongoing projects in Australia include the Reindeer, Halyard, Macedon and Julimar gas developments and the Coniston oil development. In Egypt, expansion of our oil gathering and transportation facilities as a result of our 2009 Faghur Basin discoveries at Phiops and West Kalabsha, will be complete by the fourth quarter. The capacity of these new facilities will allow to ramp up a production from the current gross 9,000 barrels of oil per day to 40,000 barrels per day of gross production. Additionally, construction of the fifth gas processing train in our Salam gas plant is expected to commence by year end.With this very active development and production infrastructure program, we expect 2010 to be another year of robust production growth for Apache's international regions. And the many ongoing projects represent significant sources of new production that will come on stream between 2011 and 2015.In international exploration, we expect to run an average of 10 rigs during 2010 and expect to drill 76 gross and 61 net wells. 39 of these wells will be in Egypt where we will benefit from a decade-long consistent new field discovery rate, that allows us to bring on production very quickly due to our wide operational reach across the Western Desert. In 2010, we are focusing our exploration drilling on the oil and rich gas condensate prospects of the AEB and Jurassic formations, in our concessions covering four western desert areas. The Faghur Basin, including the Phiops neath areas, the Matruh's rupture trend, the Abu Gharadig Basin and the Beni Suef Basin. Additionally, we are setting up future exploration drilling programs with the planned acquisition of 3,000 energy square kilometers of new 3D seismic, in five surveys covering 10 of our concessions, a 70% increase to our 3D acquisition to our 2009. Our proprietary 3D coverage of the western desert now exceed 30,000 square kilometers.In Australia, we expect to drill 19 exploration wells focusing on our significant offshore acreage holdings in the Carnarvon Basin of the Northwest Shelf. The program will be principally focused on new prospects with Julimar field trend, in support of our Wheatstone LNG project participation and the Varanus Island, Halyard, Harriet and Macedon areas in support of our domestic gas supply projects. Additionally, we expect to acquire 1,400 square kilometer of 3D seismic and five surveys, including a benchmark 4D survey in the Coniston Van Gogh field areas.In Argentina, while we did not drill any exploration wells last year, as we focused on building what is a very interesting portfolio of diverse plays across the country, our 10 well exploration drilling program this year will target impacted prospects for Pre-Cuyo, Cuyo and Springhill reservoirs in each of the Neuquen, Cuyo and Australia basins.In the North Sea, we will resume exploration drilling near the Forties Field complex with three wells, after two years of primary focus on development drilling. To summarize our international exploration program for 2010, we'll be conducting an impactive exploration drilling program across our core areas, that will target an aggregate of nearly 290 million barrels of oil equivalent of risk mean net reserves. We will acquire 5,500 square kilometers of proprietary 3D seismic and support a future exploration and development activities, and we will progress key infrastructure projects in Egypt, Australia and the North Sea, to provide continued production growth in 2010 and future years. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Roger."

Financial Armageddon followed by a recovery that surprised virtually everyone in the spring. What started out as a downright scary year ended with $1.9 billion of adjusted earnings or $5.59 a share for the year. First quarter adjusted earnings more than doubled to $664 million or $1.96 per share from the fourth quarter of '08. And there were the strongest earnings of the year, who would've thought it?Cash from operations were just shy of $5 billion for the year and over $1.4 billion for the quarter. Compared to our initial plan, the year's cash flow was 36% or $1.3 billion higher, enabling us to increase drilling capital by $350 million and acquire $300 million of properties while still living within cash flow. Our 9% production growth despite 40% less capital speaks to the benefit of our long-term approach. Clearly this growth could not have been achieved if not for first production from a number of significant long-term development projects.Exploration success continues to add to our pipeline of development projects, providing growth visibility that can really move the needle once brought online. Despite higher production and substantially reduced capital, Apache added 216 million barrels of oil equivalent through drilling and acquisitions, outpacing production of 213 million barrels of oil equivalent, at a cost of $3.5 billion. These additions were added at $16 per barrel of oil equivalent, and were quite economic at some 40% of our additions were oil. At $70 a barrel, oil sells at 14x the price of gas, leaving plenty of profit margin.This growing disparity between the value of oil and gas underscores Apache's advantageous product mix. Oil and NGLs comprise half of our production, but 72% of our 2009 revenue. We talk a lot about our balanced production mix, but I think it's often a lost just how valuable oil really is to us. Our 50/50 production mix generated last year, $8.6 billion in revenue. To get the same revenue, if we were all gas, we would have had to produce 2.3 Tcf, or twice what we actually produced. The point is, our oil production is incredibly valuable to us.Our international gas also held up quite well because it's not tied to volatile North American spot prices. In fact, while North American realizations declined by half in '09, our international gas price dropped less than 20%, coupled with 25% production growth, our international gas revenue actually climbed 5% to $770 million. Prospects are excellent for our international gas revenue to continue to grow, as once stranded gas, rises towards world prices.With international contributing 51% of our total production, Apache's the leading independent international producer in our peer group, and we think that gives us the competitive advantage, both in terms of finding more oil in the future and benefiting from rising international gas prices.Finally, in 2009, against our number one priority to live within cash flow, Apache ended the year with just over $2 billion of cash on the books, versus just under $2 billion in 2008. I would note that this was accomplished without having to issue equity, at or near the bottom of the market. That having been said, the real question is what's next? Now that the world economy is no longer dangling so close to the precipice of financial ruin, we're going to step it up a notch. We plan to increase the D&P capital by about half to $6 billion or $6.5 billion, which we figure roughly approximates to 2010 cash flow, assuming prices of around $700 per barrel, and $5 per Mcf. As usual, Apache will reassess our capital budget on a quarterly basis and adapt accordingly.Capital spending including for GTP facilities and P&A, is forecasted to be split evenly between North America and international. The significant increases in 2010 are in drilling, as activity ramps up to more typical levels. And in facilities, with our large projects progressing in Australia, Egypt, North Sea and Canada. The largest increases will occur in the U.S. after splitting our Central region and in Canada and Australia. You can find capital spending details by country on our website under the supplemental financial data section that Tom mentioned.Given our increased budget for 2010, we currently have hedged approximately 40% of our year end North American gas production. 225,000 MMBtu per day is hedged with swaps averaging around $5.80 and 84,000 MMBtu per day, it's hedged using collars with an average floors and ceilings of around $5.50 and $7. We've also hedged 100 gigajoules per day of our Canada gas production, with swaps at an average of around $5.35 in Canadian dollars in April.On the oil side, we haven't been quite as aggressive, we've hedged just over 10% of our worldwide liquids, or an average of 35,000 barrels per day for 2010, approximately 80% represents collars with average floors and ceilings of approximating $65 and $81 and a barrel. The balance is swapped at an average price of just under $69 a barrel.We're also actively screening acquisition opportunities, and while we we're not in hot pursuit at the moment, it is apparent that our industry's acquisition pipeline is fine. In addition to our $2 billion of cash, $2.3 billion of ongoing credit lines leave us the combined $4.3 billion of firepower, this in the low 24% debt to cap provides considerable flexibility to act on either incremental drilling, or acquisitions should attractive opportunities materialize.With respect to cost, we currently forecast slightly higher cash costs including taxes other than income but I would tell you, our goal is to get them flat with 2009 average of around $11 and a quarter for boe. With a strong financial position, solid oil prices, international gas prices turning higher, and projected production growth of 5% to 10%, the current outlook for 2010 is quite favorable. Steve?"

I'd like to close by summarizing what I think is the three main messages of all the information that all the gentlemen have shared today. The first is, 2009 was a good year for Apache. We had strong growth and a challenging environment with restricted capital and well capped. We really owe this to the performance and hard work of our team and their focus on generating growth and value.The second message Roger just mentioned is, we expect to have 5% or 10% net production growth in 2010. And I might add in addition, our development drilling program will deliver 100,000 of barrels of oil equivalent per day by the first full year of it's contribution in 2011. And third, we built a well-balanced global portfolio of growth areas for the long-term. The diversity of our 2010 operating plans outlined by John and Rod, I think reflect that. So 2010 is going to be a very busy year for Apache. And with the organization and opportunities set, there's much more in front of us in the years ahead. So before we go back to work, we'd be ready to take your questions."

Even though we completed our Salam gas train three and four last summer, would have continued drilling successes through 2009. We shall again find ourselves in a situation with the need to add more processing capacity into the Western Desert by building this fifth Salam gas train, which we intend to initiate construction by year-end, as I indicated. We have a lot of gas behind pipe, as well as oil and these are legit common safe [ph] rich gas zones that have yet to be produced. So it's a matter of when you want to get it out. We could live with current facilities and stretch it out for many, many years but we have a lot of near-term opportunity to increase with that present value of that gas by producing it sooner as oppose to later. Of course the government of Egypt is very interested in adding more process and capacity to accommodate the additional productional because of the almost sensational gas to man in the country of Egypt, which continues to grow about 11% to 12% annually. So we have a very robust inventory of prospects about drilling about 175 to 200 wells a year, and the exploration prospects continue to spot additional development drilling year-by-year. This has been kind of a consistent pattern to the last decade we've been drilling some 1,600 or 1,700 wells in the country and our success rate on exploration development is very consistent year-on-year."

Is that things aren't appear to be more oily there perhaps it's because it's cooler from a geological sense. Clearly the wells we're making there are oil wells and they are oil wells that are deeper than you'd normally see in that part of the desert. That backlog of our inventory, we are looking to continually evaluating and assessing prospects that have developed off of our very large 80s seismic inventory. And in fact, we've been reshooting some of the areas that are main producing area and we shot a decade ago and the data quality now is amazing and turning up even more and more ideas. Whether it's on exploration projects or production enhancement projects and workovers, we have -- every year we have this inventory and maybe like 300 production enhancement projects and then we do the jobs the next year we still have 300 production and have some projects to do. The work continue to span other ideas and other work, whether it's on the exploration side to exploration drilling or the development of production enhancement activity. And as far as horizontal applications, activities for horizontal exploitation of Egypt are really, not even touched. And we are beginning to investigate through horizontal drilling, certain formations, certain reservoirs of sequences and we think that we have to know the sanction. Like many times, these things have been done for years in North America and they're just now arriving onshore in Egypt. There are no known horizontal plays operating in the country but we're looking to see what we can do in that area, from what we know from North America activity. And we have four horizontal wells planned for 2010."

So most of our acreage, one of the reasons you don't see us as trendsetters a lot in North America is, most of our acreage is held by production, so we can let people do an awful lot of experimenting before the technology turns. Same reason we're starting to get in West Texas, now there's a lot of horizontal wells that you can look on the map, you can see that. But we have a tremendous acreage position out there that now allows us to go out there and really start exploring our base property."

Going into the year, Apache de",998,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache's 2009 Year End Results Earnings Call. 2009 was obviously a difficult year for the industry due to the sharp drop in commodity prices and a weakening economy. Going into the year, Apache decided to reduce our investments to ensure that we live within our means without the need to tap the capital markets or dilute our portfolio. So we ended the year with drilling 53% fewer wells than we did a year before and investing 40% less capital. We have run cap activities somewhat towards the end of the year, but we really won't start seeing the benefits of that until in 2010.So in that context, we're very satisfied that the Apache's team, managed to increase production by 9% for 2009, and we came out of the year with more cash on our balance sheet than we had going into it. And we did this without diluting our shareholders ownership of our upstream portfolio.On the cost side, our cost management efforts during the year were successful, we managed to reduce lifting costs per boe by 20% during 2009. And overall, we had strong cash flow from operations after dismal first start. We generated over $5 billion and had adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion. This performance is a testament to the strength of our team and the quality of our portfolio around the world. Every Apache employee is focused on maximizing value and growth on every property. This is easy to claim but very difficult to actually do. It involves an awful lot of geoscience and optimization work, but every location, recompletion, workovers, all add real value and real growth, and you'll see that in our 2009 performance.I'd also like to highlight that in 2009, we replaced 101% of our production, improved reserve terms from drilling and modest acquisitions despite drilling less than 50% of the wells we've drilled in the previous year, and our finding cost for all of Apache globally was about $16 per boe. And the way we really look at that number is internally it's about $13.86 per boe for all regions, excluding the Gulf Coast. And the reason is that be Gulf Coast has a very unique profile of high cost, high cash flow business. I'll try to give you a little more flavor to that. At the end of the year, we ran the full project life internal rate of return on our Gulf of Mexico crude reserves which came out to be almost 30% on a before tax basis. Now that number includes all cash flows from the time we entered the properties and the future cash flows at strict prices. It included $1.1 billion of net hurricane costs and it also included $1.5 billion of future capital costs. Doesn't give any credit for new reserves, we will continue to add on these properties. So in the aggregate, it means we generated an internal rate of return of almost 30% on a go forward tax basis on more $10 billion of capital. If you look at it on a net present value basis, excess of 10% to $17.4 billion, and that's why our Gulf of Mexico portfolio is a great source of value generation for our shareholders.We also took meaningful strategic steps in 2009, including our entry into the global LNG business by our participation on the Wheatstone project in Australia and also, becoming the operator of the potential Kitimat LNG export project in Canada. LNG provides decades of stable cash flow which represents a very interesting contribution to our portfolio of assets for the long-term. We have received many inquiries since we became operator of the Kitimat LNG project in January, and I think all I'll say at this stage, is that it's a very promising concept, we believe it could work, can be very impactful. But at this point, we're simply conducting a FEED study. We have a long way to go before Kitimat potentially becomes a real expert asset on the ground. That sums up everything I'd like to say about 2009 and it's 2010 that matters. So I'd like to outline what we're planning to do for the year and what it means to us.We've been a growth company for 55 years and we focus on long-term growth projects, balanced across our commodities and geographies. We don't follow the latest market fashion because we've found that they tend to change and we're better off to sticking to fundamental principles of profitability and balance and 2010 is going to be no different. We expect another year of production growth in 2010, our international regions continue to deliver a visible pipeline of growth projects and deep drilling inventories. In North America, the aggregate will have another stable year similar to 2009, while our new growth plays aggregate [ph] and will gather some momentum.Overall, we expect Apache's net production for 2010 to grow between 5% and 10% over 2009 and due to projects and activity scheduling, we anticipate the first quarter of 2010 will be slightly up over the fourth quarter of 2009, and then it will accelerate after the first quarter.As you'll hear from John and Rod, we are executing on a broad and a strong portfolio of plays across our global acreage, that will sustain our growth and returns for the long-term. The 662 net wells we're planning to drill this year will advance 32 development plays and 25 exploration plays across our portfolio. To give you a piece of data, the development drilling we do in 2010 alone, will contribute 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent, net to Apache by 2011. The basis for this balanced growth portfolio is simple. The right critical mass of highly perspective acreage around the world, much of which, it is held by production, a good organization with real value and delivery focus and a creative application of technology. With that, let me pass it to John who will discuss North America."

At the onset of 2009, Apache adopted a cautious approach in North American expenditures in order to allow time for cost to adjust downward, to levels reflecting the challenging commodity price environment. Overall, we cut 2009 investment",1575,"Thank you, Steve. At the onset of 2009, Apache adopted a cautious approach in North American expenditures in order to allow time for cost to adjust downward, to levels reflecting the challenging commodity price environment. Overall, we cut 2009 investment in North America by near 50% from the 2008 level. We're very proud of the fact that our regional teams were able to hold production essentially flat, down 1.3%, while drilling 61% fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008. While I won't suggest that it will be available every year, our large base of HBP properties provided our teams with many opportunities to optimize production from existing wells. This production level was also achieved without any meaningful contribution from new growth plays, such as Horn River in the Granite Wash, which we will be ramping up significantly in 2010 and beyond. You will note that fourth-quarter North American gas production was down 4.4% from the third quarter, that's mostly due to severe weather in Canada where we had widespread freeze up problems.Just a few of the more important 2009 highlights include the startup of Geauxpher in May, eight months later, the two well field is still producing 78 million a day gross, that's 31 million net to Apache. The Horn River activity ramp up, we drilled a total of 42 gross wells, but only completed four. The four wells were completed last summer and continue to produce in excess of 4 million cubic feet per day each, and they confirmed our reserves per well in excess of 10 Bcf for each well. We hold a 50% working interest in that activity with partner in Canada. The horizontal Granite Wash activity, our first operated Granite Wash well, the Hostetter 1-23H in Wheeler County, Texas came on production in late September and continues to produce at a gross rate of 9.5 million and cubic feet of gas per day was 600 barrels of liquids. Additional drilling continues confirming the potential of our interest, covering over 200,000 acreage across the play. And then finally, the acquisition of the marathon interest in the Permian Basin gives us some 200 quality infill development locations for oil in a core area. Moving on to 2010, as we look at 2010, we're going to increase our activity level across North America. The benefit of our very deep portfolio of acreage across the continent, which is primarily HBP, is that we can adjust our focus any number of plays as the circumstances dictate. I will now outline our current 2010 North American operating plans.It should be noted, and I think this applies across our international regions as well, that while these are our current plans, we will continue to be a nimble value-driven organization that will adjust our plans as necessary through the year to maximize value creation for our shareholders.In 2010, we plan to run an average 26 drilling rigs in North America, nine in the Central region, seven in the Gulf Coast region, and five each in the Permian and Canada regions. We currently plan to drill 413 net wells in North America for this year, that will be up from 282 in 2009. Of this 2010 total, 381 will be development wells and 32 exploration wells. On the development side, we expect to run 22 rigs. The top drivers of these activities will be in the following four programs: First, our development in the Horn River Basin in northeast British Columbia jointly with our 50-50 partner EnCana. As mentioned earlier, we drilled 42 gross wells in the Horn River Basin in 2009, while only completing four. With our pad-style developments, we are significantly more efficient if we drill all of the wells on a pad before we start completion operations. The 2009 completed wells were the result of the last four wells on the EnCana-operated 70-J pad. EnCana drilled an additional 11 wells on their 76-K pad and another five wells on their 63-K pad by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apache drilled 16 wells on our 70-K pad and an additional seven wells on the 52-L pad during the year. We began completion operations on the Apache-operated 70-K pad of 16 wells in January.We are now approximate 1/3 of the way through our frac stimulation program, with more than 90 fractures complete. We expect to get another two pads done, with 25 to 28 gross wells completed before the end of the year. So in all, we would expect to have 42 to 44 additional wells on production by the end of 2010.There is a little play in the timing, as we continue to experiment with the number and sizes of fracs per well to optimize future development. Our efficiency continue to improve through the program, and we have completed as many as four fracs in a 24-hour period on several occasions. As our drilling activity continues, we expect to leave 2010 with more than 30 wells drilled and ready for completion in 2011. We are targeting a 2010 exit rate of more than 100 million cubic feet of gas per day, net from the Horn River, but most of those volumes will be coming on in the second half of 2010.As Steve mentioned, during 2010, we expect to conduct a FEED study for an LNG plant operated by Apache on the West Coast of Canada at Kitimat, British Columbia. This facility, if we decide to proceed with it, could allow export of significant gas volumes from the Horn River Basin, as well as other Apache plays in North America. Second, our continued development program in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, we currently plan to run an average of four rigs through the year on development plays and drill 29 development wells here, up from 17 last year. Our activity in the Gulf this year is off to an excellent start with positive result on all eight wells drilled so far.For perspective, the developments associated with those successes alone, will generate a net present value of over $120 million, with a 67% after-tax rate of return on some $95 million of expected capital invested. Third, our horizontal Granite Wash development program is expected to involve an average of five rigs during 2010. We have 29 gross wells, that's 17 net, in our 2010 plan, up from seven net wells last year. With our success to date, we're already planning to increase activity to 25 net wells for 2010. And we're targeting at year end, net production rate of 75 million cubic feet of gas per day from the Granite Wash.And then finally, our oil-focused Permian development drilling program will involve an average of five rigs for the year and 171 net wells, almost double the 87 net wells we drilled in 2009. The remainder of our development activity in North America will involve an average of eight rigs for the year, and 126 net wells across 12 programs ranging from East Texas, tight sand plays to oil targeted plays in Canada, Oklahoma and Kansas. Our activity levels in these 12 other programs will be somewhat reduced from the 133 net wells in 2009. These being primarily conventional plays, as we concentrate this year on the development of those top four programs I just outlined.To give you a sense of the materiality of the 2010 development program, we expected to provide a net contribution of 52,000 barrels per day in 2011, the first full year of production, with 83% of that volume coming from the top four programs.On the exploration front, we will be significantly increasing our North American exploration activity in 2010. We plan to run an average of seven drilling rigs on this activity during the year and drill 32 net wells, up from 12 in 2009. We will pursue eight different exploration programs representing a balanced range of continuing trend expiration in the Gulf of Mexico, to new place involving horizontal drilling in a number of offshore locations across the continent. We're not in a position to talk about most of these for now, due to commercial sensitivity. One development we can not is in Eastern Canada, where we have completed the transaction with Corridor Resources, under which Apache will fund the testing of potentially large unconventional resources in New Brunswick, close to the East Coast population, centers in Canada and in the U.S. We will drill and operate at least two wells in that play during 2010.We have good reason to believe that the exploration programs we're advancing in 2010, will have the resource scale equivalent to or greater than the plays we are now moving into development in the Horn River and Granite Wash. On an organizational front, as a final note, In North America, we have created a new regional unit for the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin has been part of our Tulsa based central region over the number of years. We are one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, the new regional organization will be based in Midland, Texas. We put these two regions together in 2002, but due to our growth over the years, that combined capital programs increase tenfold by the day. We think separating them will continue the growth in both regions.You will see the performance of these two regions reported separately starting in the first quarter of 2010. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod, who will discuss our international activity."

Apache's international regions reported excellent results in 2009, highlighted by outstanding exploration and development activity and by seeking out and entering into new markets to sell future production of natural gas in Australia and Argentina at more attractive prices. Production in our international regions grew by 21% in 2009, to a yearly average 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by drilling successes in significant increases in Egyptian oil and gas production, as well as significant increases in Australia gas production. Our Egypt region had another outstanding year. Net production averaged 152,600 barrels Of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 38% over 2008. For the year, Apache drilled 164 wells in the Western Desert, including 23 wildcats. Once again, making Apache the most active and successful operator. Fourth quarter drilling successes in the AEB at Phiops, and West Kalabsha 2-X and the Faghur Basin along with successful completions in the Matruh Concession and the Jay Field at Falcon help drive gross production to record high 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at year end.Apache's Australian region production in 2009 increased 40% to 40,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by the restoration of Varanus Island facilities. Apache took a large step forward in 2009, towards securing new to markets for its Australian natural gas, by agreeing to produce our estimated 2.1 Tcf of natural gas reserves in our Julimar discovery to the Wheatstone LNG facility operated by Chevron. We expect to complete the FEED study and make final investment decision in 2011. First production is scheduled for 2015.North Sea production averaged 61,400 barrels of oil per day in 2009, an increased of 2.5% over 2008 levels, due to increased production from several wells drilled in early 2009 and higher production efficiency for most of the year. During the fourth quarter, we experienced reduced production at Forties Field, due to pipeline and riser repairs on Bravo platform which have since been completed. Our North Sea region actually has a second consecutive year of production growth. This is a remarkable achievement in a 35-year-old oil field, the largest in the North Sea, which have seen declined for many years before Apache took over operations in 2003. We drilled 17 wells and added 9,200 barrels a day over the year. The Forties Charlie 6-3 wells completed in June has already recovered 1.3 million barrels of oil. In the Forties Alpha 4-5 well completed in January is still flowing water free at nearly 5,000 barrels of oil per day, and has reached cumulative production of 1.7 million barrels of oil. In Argentina, we drilled 32 wells with a 97% success rate. Net production for 2009 averaged 45,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 5% below 2008, due to a reduction in capital spending in 2009 and lower seasonal takes by customers in the fourth quarter. However, there were two important advance for Apache that occurred in Argentina in 2009. First, we successfully extended the life of all of our concessions in Neuquen Basin from 2017 to 2027. Secondly, we see the approval for four Gas Plus projects, which will allow Apache to sell significant quantities of natural gas, at higher prices in the future.Looking at 2010, we are forecasting a very active development and expiration programs across our international regions. We expect the to run an average of 28 drilling rigs in our core areas over the year. We plan to drill 299 gross or 249 net wells, which is up from 248 gross or 213 net wells in 2009. Of these 299 gross wells in 2010, 223, or 188 net, will be development and 76 gross wells, or 61 net wells, will be exploratory. In the developed area, I'd like to highlight four major program driving our drilling activity in 2010. Firstly, we'll continue the four field with element water flood programs in Egypt at the Heba and Asala Ridge fields and East NEAG, which will involve six rigs and 111 wells of which 55 are producing wells. We've currently produced about 70,000 barrels a day gross from our secondary recovery projects in Egypt. Secondly, we'll continue our Cretaceous and Jurassic oil and rich gas development projects at our Greater Khanda area in Egypt, employing six rigs fuel 33 wells. Thirdly, our Forties oil field development program in North Sea will employ two platform rigs and a jack up to drill 15 new wells. Among the new developments is our mall discovery from the fourth quarter of 2009, which we are progressing to achieve first production of 5000 barrels of oil per day by midyear. Lastly, our Gas Plus development programs in Argentina will average three rigs, drilling 21 wells in 2010. Gas plus developments will be our drilling focus in Neuquen Basin, as this will benefit from sales prices of $4.10 per million BTU on 10 million a day contracts for 2010 and $5 per million Btu on 50 million a day contracts beginning in 2011. Additionally, we are presently progressing the three new Gas Plus contracts for approval.I should note that the first three of these four largest development programs are all target oil. The remaining 43 development wells are spread over six different programs across our core areas and are also focused primarily on oil. We expect this development drilling program for the year to grow to contribute around 50,000 barrels of oil per day of new net production by its first full year of contribution in 2011.During 2010, we'll continue to progress other material projects in our longer-term growth pipeline. Projects that have resulted from exploration discoveries in the prior years. The first of these will be production for our Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects in Australia which are expected to contribute 40,000 barrels a day of net new oil production. As we reported earlier this week, Van Gogh has already started production. These volumes are incremental to the contribution from our development drilling program that I just outlined.Ongoing projects in Australia include the Reindeer, Halyard, Macedon and Julimar gas developments and the Coniston oil development. In Egypt, expansion of our oil gathering and transportation facilities as a result of our 2009 Faghur Basin discoveries at Phiops and West Kalabsha, will be complete by the fourth quarter. The capacity of these new facilities will allow to ramp up a production from the current gross 9,000 barrels of oil per day to 40,000 barrels per day of gross production. Additionally, construction of the fifth gas processing train in our Salam gas plant is expected to commence by year end.With this very active development and production infrastructure program, we expect 2010 to be another year of robust production growth for Apache's international regions. And the many ongoing projects represent significant sources of new production that will come on stream between 2011 and 2015.In international exploration, we expect to run an average of 10 rigs during 2010 and expect to drill 76 gross and 61 net wells. 39 of these wells will be in Egypt, where we will benefit from a decade-long consistent new field discovery rate, that allows us to bring on production very quickly due to our wide operational reach across the Western Desert. In 2010, we are focusing our exploration drilling on the oil and rich gas condensate prospects of the AEB and Jurassic formations in our concessions covering four Western Desert areas. The Faghur Basin, including the Phiops neath areas, the Matruh structure trend, the Abu Gharadig Basin and the Beni Suef Basin. Additionally, we are setting up future exploration drilling programs with the planned acquisition of 3,000 energy square kilometers of new 3D seismic, in five surveys covering 10 of our concessions, a 70% increase to our 3D acquisition to our 2009. Our proprietary 3D coverage of the Western Desert now exceeds 30,000 square kilometers.In Australia, we expect to drill 19 exploration wells focusing on our significant offshore acreage holdings in the Carnarvon Basin of the Northwest Shelf. The program will be principally focused on new prospects with Julimar field trend, in support of our Wheatstone LNG project participation and the Varanus Island, Halyard, Harriet and Macedon areas in support of our domestic gas supply projects. Additionally, we expect to acquire 1,400 square kilometer of 3D seismic and five surveys, including a benchmark 4D survey in the Coniston, Van Gogh field areas.In Argentina, while we did not drill any exploration wells last year, as we focused on building what is a very interesting portfolio of diverse plays across the country, our 10 well exploration drilling program this year will target impacted prospects for Pre-Cuyo, Cuyo and Springhill reservoirs in each of the Neuquen, Cuyo and Australia basins. In the North Sea, we will resume exploration drilling near the Forties Field complex with three wells, after two years of primary focus on development drilling. To summarize our international exploration program for 2010, we'll be conducting an impactive exploration drilling program across our core areas, that will target an aggregate of nearly 290 million barrels of oil equivalent of risk mean net reserves. We will acquire 5,500 square kilometers of proprietary 3D seismic in support of future exploration and development activities, and we will progress key infrastructure projects in Egypt, Australia and the North Sea, to provide continued production growth in 2010 and future years. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Roger."
169838,98354084,50917,"Apache Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rod. And good afternoon, everyone. What a year, a tale of two cycles: Financial Armageddon, followed by a recovery that surprised virtually everyone in the spring.

What a year, a tale of two cycles: Financial Armageddon, followed by a recovery that surprised virtually everyone in the spring. What started out as a downright scary year ended with $1.9 billion of adjusted earnings or $5.59 a share for the year. First quarter adjusted earnings more than doubled to $664 million or $1.96 per share from the fourth quarter of '08. And they were the strongest earnings of the year. Who would've thought it?Cash from operations were just shy of $5 billion for the year and over $1.4 billion for the quarter. Compared to our initial plan, the year's cash flow was 36% or $1.3 billion higher, enabling us to increase drilling capital by $350 million and acquire $300 million of properties while still living within cash flow. Our 9% production growth despite 40% less capital speaks to the benefit of our long-term approach. Clearly, this growth could not have been achieved if not for first production from a number of significant long-term development projects.Exploration success continues to add to our pipeline of development projects, providing growth visibility that can really move the needle once brought on line. Despite higher production and substantially-reduced capital, Apache added 216 million barrels of oil equivalent through drilling and acquisitions, outpacing production of 213 million barrels of oil equivalent, at a cost of $3.5 billion. These additions were added at $16 per barrel of oil equivalent, and were quite economic as some 40% of our additions were oil. At $70 a barrel, oil sells at 14x the price of gas, leaving plenty of profit margin.This growing disparity between the value of oil and gas underscores Apache's advantageous product mix. Oil and NGLs comprise half of our production, but 72% of our 2009 revenue. We talk a lot about our balanced production mix, but I think it's often lost just how valuable oil really is to us. Our 50-50 production mix generated last year $8.6 billion in revenue. To get the same revenue, if we were all gas, we would have had to produce 2.3 Tcf, or twice what we actually produced. The point is, our oil production is incredibly valuable to us.Our international gas also held up quite well because it's not tied to volatile North American spot prices. In fact, while North American realizations declined by half in '09, our international gas price dropped less than 20%, coupled with 25% production growth, our international gas revenue actually climbed 5% to $770 million. Prospects are excellent for our international gas revenue to continue to grow, as once stranded gas, rises towards world prices.With international contributing 51% of our total production, Apache's the leading independent international producer in our peer group, and we think that gives us the competitive advantage, both in terms of finding more oil in the future and benefiting from rising international gas prices.Finally, in 2009, against our number one priority to live within cash flow, Apache ended the year with just over $2 billion of cash on the books, versus just under $2 billion in 2008. I would note that this was accomplished without having to issue equity, at or near the bottom of the market. That having been said, the real question is what's next? Now that the world economy is no longer dangling so close to the precipice of financial ruin, we're going to step it up a notch. We plan to increase the D&P capital by about half to $6 billion or $6.5 billion, which we figure roughly approximates to 2010 cash flow, assuming prices of around $700 per barrel, and $5 per Mcf. As usual, Apache will reassess our capital budget on a quarterly basis and adapt accordingly.Capital spending including for GTP facilities and P&A, is forecasted to be split evenly between North America and international. The significant increases in 2010 are in drilling, as activity ramps up to more typical levels. And in facilities, with our large projects progressing in Australia, Egypt, North Sea and Canada. The largest increases will occur in the U.S. after splitting our Central region and in Canada and Australia. You can find capital spending details by country on our website under the supplemental financial data section that Tom mentioned.Given our increased budget for 2010, we currently have hedged approximately 40% of our year end North American gas production. 225,000 MMBtu per day is hedged with swaps averaging around $5.80 and 84,000 MMBtu per day, it's hedged using collars with an average floors and ceilings of around $5.50 and $7. We've also hedged 100 gigajoules per day of our Canada gas production, with swaps at an average of around $5.35 in Canadian dollars in April.On the oil side, we haven't been quite as aggressive, we've hedged just over 10% of our worldwide liquids, or an average of 35,000 barrels per day for 2010, approximately 80% represents collars with average floors and ceilings of approximating $65 and $81 and a barrel. The balance is swapped at an average price of just under $69 a barrel.We're also actively screening acquisition opportunities, and while we we're not in hot pursuit at the moment, it is apparent that our industry's acquisition pipeline is fine. In addition to our $2 billion of cash, $2.3 billion of ongoing credit lines leave us the combined $4.3 billion of firepower, this in the low 24% debt to cap provides considerable flexibility to act on either incremental drilling, or acquisitions should attractive opportunities materialize.With respect to cost, we currently forecast slightly higher cash costs including taxes other than income but I would tell you, our goal is to get them flat with 2009 average of around $11 and a quarter for boe. With a strong financial position, solid oil prices, international gas prices turning higher, and projected production growth of 5% to 10%, the current outlook for 2010 is quite favorable. Steve?"

I'd like to close by summarizing what I think is the three main messages of all the information that all the gentlemen have shared today. The first is, 2009 was a good year for Apache. We had strong growth and a challenging environment with restricted capital and well capped. We really owe this to the performance and hard work of our team and their focus on generating growth and value.The second message Roger just mentioned is, we expect to have 5% or 10% net production growth in 2010. And I might add in addition, our development drilling program will deliver 100,000 of barrels of oil equivalent per day by the first full year of it's contribution in 2011. And third, we built a well-balanced global portfolio of growth areas for the long-term. The diversity of our 2010 operating plans outlined by John and Rod, I think reflect that. So 2010 is going to be a very busy year for Apache. And with the organization and opportunities set, there's much more in front of us in the years ahead.

Even though we completed our Salam gas train three and four last summer, would have continued drilling successes through 2009. We shall again find ourselves in a situation with the need to add more processing capacity into the Western Desert by building this fifth Salam gas train, which we intend to initiate construction by year-end, as I indicated. We have a lot of gas behind pipe, as well as oil and these are legit common safe [ph] rich gas zones that have yet to be produced. So it's a matter of when you want to get it out. We could live with current facilities and stretch it out for many, many years but we have a lot of near-term opportunity to increase with that present value of that gas by producing it sooner as oppose to later. Of course the government of Egypt is very interested in adding more process and capacity to accommodate the additional productional because of the almost sensational gas to man in the country of Egypt, which continues to grow about 11% to 12% annually. So we have a very robust inventory of prospects about drilling about 175 to 200 wells a year, and the exploration prospects continue to spot additional development drilling year-by-year. This has been kind of a consistent pattern to the last decade we've been drilling some 1,600 or 1,700 wells in the country and our success rate on exploration development is very consistent year-on-year."

Clearly the wells we're making there are oil wells and they are oil wells that are deeper than you'd normally see in that part of the desert. That backlog of our inventory, we are looking to continually evaluating and assessing prospects that have developed off of our very large 80s seismic inventory. And in fact, we've been reshooting some of the areas that are main producing area and we shot a decade ago and the data quality now is amazing and turning up even more and more ideas. Whether it's on exploration projects or production enhancement projects and workovers, we have -- every year we have this inventory and maybe like 300 production enhancement projects and then we do the jobs the next year we still have 300 production and have some projects to do. The work continue to span other ideas and other work, whether it's on the exploration side to exploration drilling or the development of production enhancement activity. And as far as horizontal applications, activities for horizontal exploitation of Egypt are really, not even touched. And we are beginning to investigate through horizontal drilling, certain formations, certain reservoirs of sequences and we think that we have to know the sanction. Like many times, these things have been done for years in North America and they're just now arriving onshore in Egypt.

So we have a little bit, not that we're anywhere near the quality and size of Exxon, but we have a little bit of the same. And the reason is, frankly, if you look across our portfolio and I'll give you four examples, let's take Nevasit [ph] was a little shallow gas play and all of the sudden we drill CPM wells on it and I thing we'd probably be still producing 80 million or 90 million a day out of the coalbed methane at Nevasit [ph] that we really didn't see. We're talking an awful lot about Granite Wash, we probably got Granite Wash 500 wells, we drilled our first Granite Wash probably in the 50s. And we're getting ready to come through there with a horizontal play that if we have HBP of 200,000 acres. Or if you look at some of the things we're doing in West Texas, horizontal wells and a water for us and all the sudden we are able to increase production. Owning acreage in real well-known hydrocarbon areas really give you an advantage especially if you're large, which is why you see us in large positions in most places that we're in."

Going into the year, Apache de",998,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache's 2009 Year End Results Earnings Call. 2009 was obviously a difficult year for the industry due to the sharp drop in commodity prices and a weakening economy. Going into the year, Apache decided to reduce our investments to ensure that we live within our means without the need to tap the capital markets or dilute our portfolio. So we ended the year with drilling 53% fewer wells than we did a year before and investing 40% less capital. We have run cap activities somewhat towards the end of the year, but we really won't start seeing the benefits of that until in 2010.So in that context, we're very satisfied that the Apache's team, managed to increase production by 9% for 2009, and we came out of the year with more cash on our balance sheet than we had going into it. And we did this without diluting our shareholders ownership of our upstream portfolio.On the cost side, our cost management efforts during the year were successful, we managed to reduce lifting costs per boe by 20% during 2009. And overall, we had strong cash flow from operations after dismal first start. We generated over $5 billion and had adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion. This performance is a testament to the strength of our team and the quality of our portfolio around the world. Every Apache employee is focused on maximizing value and growth on every property. This is easy to claim but very difficult to actually do. It involves an awful lot of geoscience and optimization work, but every location, recompletion, workovers, all add real value and real growth, and you'll see that in our 2009 performance.I'd also like to highlight that in 2009, we replaced 101% of our production, improved reserve terms from drilling and modest acquisitions despite drilling less than 50% of the wells we've drilled in the previous year, and our finding cost for all of Apache globally was about $16 per boe. And the way we really look at that number is internally it's about $13.86 per boe for all regions, excluding the Gulf Coast. And the reason is that be Gulf Coast has a very unique profile of high cost, high cash flow business. I'll try to give you a little more flavor to that. At the end of the year, we ran the full project life internal rate of return on our Gulf of Mexico crude reserves which came out to be almost 30% on a before tax basis. Now that number includes all cash flows from the time we entered the properties and the future cash flows at strict prices. It included $1.1 billion of net hurricane costs and it also included $1.5 billion of future capital costs. Doesn't give any credit for new reserves, we will continue to add on these properties. So in the aggregate, it means we generated an internal rate of return of almost 30% on a go forward tax basis on more $10 billion of capital. If you look at it on a net present value basis, excess of 10% to $17.4 billion, and that's why our Gulf of Mexico portfolio is a great source of value generation for our shareholders.We also took meaningful strategic steps in 2009, including our entry into the global LNG business by our participation on the Wheatstone project in Australia and also, becoming the operator of the potential Kitimat LNG export project in Canada. LNG provides decades of stable cash flow which represents a very interesting contribution to our portfolio of assets for the long-term. We have received many inquiries since we became operator of the Kitimat LNG project in January, and I think all I'll say at this stage, is that it's a very promising concept, we believe it could work, can be very impactful. But at this point, we're simply conducting a FEED study. We have a long way to go before Kitimat potentially becomes a real expert asset on the ground. That sums up everything I'd like to say about 2009 and it's 2010 that matters. So I'd like to outline what we're planning to do for the year and what it means to us.We've been a growth company for 55 years and we focus on long-term growth projects, balanced across our commodities and geographies. We don't follow the latest market fashion because we've found that they tend to change and we're better off to sticking to fundamental principles of profitability and balance and 2010 is going to be no different. We expect another year of production growth in 2010, our international regions continue to deliver a visible pipeline of growth projects and deep drilling inventories. In North America, the aggregate will have another stable year similar to 2009, while our new growth plays aggregate [ph] and will gather some momentum.Overall, we expect Apache's net production for 2010 to grow between 5% and 10% over 2009 and due to projects and activity scheduling, we anticipate the first quarter of 2010 will be slightly up over the fourth quarter of 2009, and then it will accelerate after the first quarter.As you'll hear from John and Rod, we are executing on a broad and a strong portfolio of plays across our global acreage, that will sustain our growth and returns for the long-term. The 662 net wells we're planning to drill this year will advance 32 development plays and 25 exploration plays across our portfolio. To give you a piece of data, the development drilling we do in 2010 alone, will contribute 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent, net to Apache by 2011. The basis for this balanced growth portfolio is simple. The right critical mass of highly perspective acreage around the world, much of which, it is held by production, a good organization with real value and delivery focus and a creative application of technology. With that, let me pass it to John who will discuss North America."

At the onset of 2009, Apache adopted a cautious approach in North American expenditures in order to allow time for cost to adjust downward, to levels reflecting the challenging commodity price environment. Overall, we cut 2009 investment",1575,"Thank you, Steve. At the onset of 2009, Apache adopted a cautious approach in North American expenditures in order to allow time for cost to adjust downward, to levels reflecting the challenging commodity price environment. Overall, we cut 2009 investment in North America by near 50% from the 2008 level. We're very proud of the fact that our regional teams were able to hold production essentially flat, down 1.3%, while drilling 61% fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008. While I won't suggest that it will be available every year, our large base of HBP properties provided our teams with many opportunities to optimize production from existing wells. This production level was also achieved without any meaningful contribution from new growth plays, such as Horn River in the Granite Wash, which we will be ramping up significantly in 2010 and beyond. You will note that fourth-quarter North American gas production was down 4.4% from the third quarter, that's mostly due to severe weather in Canada where we had widespread freeze up problems.Just a few of the more important 2009 highlights include the startup of Geauxpher in May, eight months later, the two well field is still producing 78 million a day gross, that's 31 million net to Apache. The Horn River activity ramp up, we drilled a total of 42 gross wells, but only completed four. The four wells were completed last summer and continue to produce in excess of 4 million cubic feet per day each, and they confirmed our reserves per well in excess of 10 Bcf for each well. We hold a 50% working interest in that activity with partner in Canada. The horizontal Granite Wash activity, our first operated Granite Wash well, the Hostetter 1-23H in Wheeler County, Texas came on production in late September and continues to produce at a gross rate of 9.5 million and cubic feet of gas per day was 600 barrels of liquids. Additional drilling continues confirming the potential of our interest, covering over 200,000 acreage across the play. And then finally, the acquisition of the marathon interest in the Permian Basin gives us some 200 quality infill development locations for oil in a core area. Moving on to 2010, as we look at 2010, we're going to increase our activity level across North America. The benefit of our very deep portfolio of acreage across the continent, which is primarily HBP, is that we can adjust our focus any number of plays as the circumstances dictate. I will now outline our current 2010 North American operating plans.It should be noted, and I think this applies across our international regions as well, that while these are our current plans, we will continue to be a nimble value-driven organization that will adjust our plans as necessary through the year to maximize value creation for our shareholders.In 2010, we plan to run an average 26 drilling rigs in North America, nine in the Central region, seven in the Gulf Coast region, and five each in the Permian and Canada regions. We currently plan to drill 413 net wells in North America for this year, that will be up from 282 in 2009. Of this 2010 total, 381 will be development wells and 32 exploration wells. On the development side, we expect to run 22 rigs. The top drivers of these activities will be in the following four programs: First, our development in the Horn River Basin in northeast British Columbia jointly with our 50-50 partner EnCana. As mentioned earlier, we drilled 42 gross wells in the Horn River Basin in 2009, while only completing four. With our pad-style developments, we are significantly more efficient if we drill all of the wells on a pad before we start completion operations. The 2009 completed wells were the result of the last four wells on the EnCana-operated 70-J pad. EnCana drilled an additional 11 wells on their 76-K pad and another five wells on their 63-K pad by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apache drilled 16 wells on our 70-K pad and an additional seven wells on the 52-L pad during the year. We began completion operations on the Apache-operated 70-K pad of 16 wells in January.We are now approximate 1/3 of the way through our frac stimulation program, with more than 90 fractures complete. We expect to get another two pads done, with 25 to 28 gross wells completed before the end of the year. So in all, we would expect to have 42 to 44 additional wells on production by the end of 2010.There is a little play in the timing, as we continue to experiment with the number and sizes of fracs per well to optimize future development. Our efficiency continue to improve through the program, and we have completed as many as four fracs in a 24-hour period on several occasions. As our drilling activity continues, we expect to leave 2010 with more than 30 wells drilled and ready for completion in 2011. We are targeting a 2010 exit rate of more than 100 million cubic feet of gas per day, net from the Horn River, but most of those volumes will be coming on in the second half of 2010.As Steve mentioned, during 2010, we expect to conduct a FEED study for an LNG plant operated by Apache on the West Coast of Canada at Kitimat, British Columbia. This facility, if we decide to proceed with it, could allow export of significant gas volumes from the Horn River Basin, as well as other Apache plays in North America. Second, our continued development program in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, we currently plan to run an average of four rigs through the year on development plays and drill 29 development wells here, up from 17 last year. Our activity in the Gulf this year is off to an excellent start with positive result on all eight wells drilled so far.For perspective, the developments associated with those successes alone, will generate a net present value of over $120 million, with a 67% after-tax rate of return on some $95 million of expected capital invested. Third, our horizontal Granite Wash development program is expected to involve an average of five rigs during 2010. We have 29 gross wells, that's 17 net, in our 2010 plan, up from seven net wells last year. With our success to date, we're already planning to increase activity to 25 net wells for 2010. And we're targeting at year end, net production rate of 75 million cubic feet of gas per day from the Granite Wash.And then finally, our oil-focused Permian development drilling program will involve an average of five rigs for the year and 171 net wells, almost double the 87 net wells we drilled in 2009. The remainder of our development activity in North America will involve an average of eight rigs for the year, and 126 net wells across 12 programs ranging from East Texas, tight sand plays to oil targeted plays in Canada, Oklahoma and Kansas. Our activity levels in these 12 other programs will be somewhat reduced from the 133 net wells in 2009. These being primarily conventional plays, as we concentrate this year on the development of those top four programs I just outlined.To give you a sense of the materiality of the 2010 development program, we expected to provide a net contribution of 52,000 barrels per day in 2011, the first full year of production, with 83% of that volume coming from the top four programs.On the exploration front, we will be significantly increasing our North American exploration activity in 2010. We plan to run an average of seven drilling rigs on this activity during the year and drill 32 net wells, up from 12 in 2009. We will pursue eight different exploration programs representing a balanced range of continuing trend expiration in the Gulf of Mexico, to new place involving horizontal drilling in a number of offshore locations across the continent. We're not in a position to talk about most of these for now, due to commercial sensitivity. One development we can not is in Eastern Canada, where we have completed the transaction with Corridor Resources, under which Apache will fund the testing of potentially large unconventional resources in New Brunswick, close to the East Coast population, centers in Canada and in the U.S. We will drill and operate at least two wells in that play during 2010.We have good reason to believe that the exploration programs we're advancing in 2010, will have the resource scale equivalent to or greater than the plays we are now moving into development in the Horn River and Granite Wash. On an organizational front, as a final note, In North America, we have created a new regional unit for the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin has been part of our Tulsa based central region over the number of years. We are one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, the new regional organization will be based in Midland, Texas. We put these two regions together in 2002, but due to our growth over the years, that combined capital programs increase tenfold by the day. We think separating them will continue the growth in both regions.You will see the performance of these two regions reported separately starting in the first quarter of 2010. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod, who will discuss our international activity."

Apache's international regions reported excellent results in 2009, highlighted by outstanding exploration and development activity and by seeking out and entering into new markets to sell future production of natural gas in Australia and Argentina at more attractive prices. Production in our international regions grew by 21% in 2009, to a yearly average 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by drilling successes in significant increases in Egyptian oil and gas production, as well as significant increases in Australia gas production. Our Egypt region had another outstanding year. Net production averaged 152,600 barrels Of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 38% over 2008. For the year, Apache drilled 164 wells in the Western Desert, including 23 wildcats. Once again, making Apache the most active and successful operator. Fourth quarter drilling successes in the AEB at Phiops, and West Kalabsha 2-X and the Faghur Basin along with successful completions in the Matruh Concession and the Jay Field at Falcon help drive gross production to record high 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at year end.Apache's Australian region production in 2009 increased 40% to 40,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by the restoration of Varanus Island facilities. Apache took a large step forward in 2009, towards securing new to markets for its Australian natural gas, by agreeing to produce our estimated 2.1 Tcf of natural gas reserves in our Julimar discovery to the Wheatstone LNG facility operated by Chevron. We expect to complete the FEED study and make final investment decision in 2011. First production is scheduled for 2015.North Sea production averaged 61,400 barrels of oil per day in 2009, an increased of 2.5% over 2008 levels, due to increased production from several wells drilled in early 2009 and higher production efficiency for most of the year. During the fourth quarter, we experienced reduced production at Forties Field, due to pipeline and riser repairs on Bravo platform which have since been completed. Our North Sea region actually has a second consecutive year of production growth. This is a remarkable achievement in a 35-year-old oil field, the largest in the North Sea, which have seen declined for many years before Apache took over operations in 2003. We drilled 17 wells and added 9,200 barrels a day over the year. The Forties Charlie 6-3 wells completed in June has already recovered 1.3 million barrels of oil. In the Forties Alpha 4-5 well completed in January is still flowing water free at nearly 5,000 barrels of oil per day, and has reached cumulative production of 1.7 million barrels of oil. In Argentina, we drilled 32 wells with a 97% success rate. Net production for 2009 averaged 45,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 5% below 2008, due to a reduction in capital spending in 2009 and lower seasonal takes by customers in the fourth quarter. However, there were two important advance for Apache that occurred in Argentina in 2009. First, we successfully extended the life of all of our concessions in Neuquen Basin from 2017 to 2027. Secondly, we see the approval for four Gas Plus projects, which will allow Apache to sell significant quantities of natural gas, at higher prices in the future.Looking at 2010, we are forecasting a very active development and expiration programs across our international regions. We expect the to run an average of 28 drilling rigs in our core areas over the year. We plan to drill 299 gross or 249 net wells, which is up from 248 gross or 213 net wells in 2009. Of these 299 gross wells in 2010, 223, or 188 net, will be development and 76 gross wells, or 61 net wells, will be exploratory. In the developed area, I'd like to highlight four major program driving our drilling activity in 2010. Firstly, we'll continue the four field with element water flood programs in Egypt at the Heba and Asala Ridge fields and East NEAG, which will involve six rigs and 111 wells of which 55 are producing wells. We've currently produced about 70,000 barrels a day gross from our secondary recovery projects in Egypt. Secondly, we'll continue our Cretaceous and Jurassic oil and rich gas development projects at our Greater Khanda area in Egypt, employing six rigs fuel 33 wells. Thirdly, our Forties oil field development program in North Sea will employ two platform rigs and a jack up to drill 15 new wells. Among the new developments is our mall discovery from the fourth quarter of 2009, which we are progressing to achieve first production of 5000 barrels of oil per day by midyear. Lastly, our Gas Plus development programs in Argentina will average three rigs, drilling 21 wells in 2010. Gas plus developments will be our drilling focus in Neuquen Basin, as this will benefit from sales prices of $4.10 per million BTU on 10 million a day contracts for 2010 and $5 per million Btu on 50 million a day contracts beginning in 2011. Additionally, we are presently progressing the three new Gas Plus contracts for approval.I should note that the first three of these four largest development programs are all target oil. The remaining 43 development wells are spread over six different programs across our core areas and are also focused primarily on oil. We expect this development drilling program for the year to grow to contribute around 50,000 barrels of oil per day of new net production by its first full year of contribution in 2011.During 2010, we'll continue to progress other material projects in our longer-term growth pipeline. Projects that have resulted from exploration discoveries in the prior years. The first of these will be production for our Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects in Australia which are expected to contribute 40,000 barrels a day of net new oil production. As we reported earlier this week, Van Gogh has already started production. These volumes are incremental to the contribution from our development drilling program that I just outlined.Ongoing projects in Australia include the Reindeer, Halyard, Macedon and Julimar gas developments and the Coniston oil development. In Egypt, expansion of our oil gathering and transportation facilities as a result of our 2009 Faghur Basin discoveries at Phiops and West Kalabsha, will be complete by the fourth quarter. The capacity of these new facilities will allow to ramp up a production from the current gross 9,000 barrels of oil per day to 40,000 barrels per day of gross production. Additionally, construction of the fifth gas processing train in our Salam gas plant is expected to commence by year end.With this very active development and production infrastructure program, we expect 2010 to be another year of robust production growth for Apache's international regions. And the many ongoing projects represent significant sources of new production that will come on stream between 2011 and 2015.In international exploration, we expect to run an average of 10 rigs during 2010 and expect to drill 76 gross and 61 net wells. 39 of these wells will be in Egypt, where we will benefit from a decade-long consistent new field discovery rate, that allows us to bring on production very quickly due to our wide operational reach across the Western Desert. In 2010, we are focusing our exploration drilling on the oil and rich gas condensate prospects of the AEB and Jurassic formations in our concessions covering four Western Desert areas. The Faghur Basin, including the Phiops neath areas, the Matruh structure trend, the Abu Gharadig Basin and the Beni Suef Basin. Additionally, we are setting up future exploration drilling programs with the planned acquisition of 3,000 energy square kilometers of new 3D seismic, in five surveys covering 10 of our concessions, a 70% increase to our 3D acquisition to our 2009. Our proprietary 3D coverage of the Western Desert now exceeds 30,000 square kilometers.In Australia, we expect to drill 19 exploration wells focusing on our significant offshore acreage holdings in the Carnarvon Basin of the Northwest Shelf. The program will be principally focused on new prospects with Julimar field trend, in support of our Wheatstone LNG project participation and the Varanus Island, Halyard, Harriet and Macedon areas in support of our domestic gas supply projects. Additionally, we expect to acquire 1,400 square kilometer of 3D seismic and five surveys, including a benchmark 4D survey in the Coniston, Van Gogh field areas.In Argentina, while we did not drill any exploration wells last year, as we focused on building what is a very interesting portfolio of diverse plays across the country, our 10 well exploration drilling program this year will target impacted prospects for Pre-Cuyo, Cuyo and Springhill reservoirs in each of the Neuquen, Cuyo and Australia basins. In the North Sea, we will resume exploration drilling near the Forties Field complex with three wells, after two years of primary focus on development drilling. To summarize our international exploration program for 2010, we'll be conducting an impactive exploration drilling program across our core areas, that will target an aggregate of nearly 290 million barrels of oil equivalent of risk mean net reserves. We will acquire 5,500 square kilometers of proprietary 3D seismic in support of future exploration and development activities, and we will progress key infrastructure projects in Egypt, Australia and the North Sea, to provide continued production growth in 2010 and future years. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Roger."
169838,98354084,54894,"Apache Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-18-2010",2010-02-18,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rod. And good afternoon, everyone. What a year, a tale of two cycles: Financial Armageddon, followed by a recovery that surprised virtually everyone in the spring.

What a year, a tale of two cycles: Financial Armageddon, followed by a recovery that surprised virtually everyone in the spring. What started out as a downright scary year ended with $1.9 billion of adjusted earnings or $5.59 a share for the year. First quarter adjusted earnings more than doubled to $664 million or $1.96 per share from the fourth quarter of '08. And they were the strongest earnings of the year. Who would've thought it?Cash from operations were just shy of $5 billion for the year and over $1.4 billion for the quarter. Compared to our initial plan, the year's cash flow was 36% or $1.3 billion higher, enabling us to increase drilling capital by $350 million and acquire $300 million of properties while still living within cash flow. Our 9% production growth despite 40% less capital speaks to the benefit of our long-term approach. Clearly, this growth could not have been achieved if not for first production from a number of significant long-term development projects.Exploration success continues to add to our pipeline of development projects, providing growth visibility that can really move the needle once brought on line. Despite higher production and substantially-reduced capital, Apache added 216 million barrels of oil equivalent through drilling and acquisitions, outpacing production of 213 million barrels of oil equivalent, at a cost of $3.5 billion. These additions were added at $16 per barrel of oil equivalent, and were quite economic as some 40% of our additions were oil. At $70 a barrel, oil sells at 14x the price of gas, leaving plenty of profit margin.This growing disparity between the value of oil and gas underscores Apache's advantageous product mix. Oil and NGLs comprise half of our production, but 72% of our 2009 revenue. We talk a lot about our balanced production mix, but I think it's often lost just how valuable oil really is to us. Our 50-50 production mix generated last year $8.6 billion in revenue. To get the same revenue, if we were all gas, we would have had to produce 2.3 Tcf, or twice what we actually produced. The point is, our oil production is incredibly valuable to us.Our international gas also held up quite well because it's not tied to volatile North American spot prices. In fact, while North American realizations declined by half in '09, our international gas price dropped less than 20%, coupled with 25% production growth, our international gas revenue actually climbed 5% to $770 million. Prospects are excellent for our international gas revenue to continue to grow, as once stranded gas, rises towards world prices.With international contributing 51% of our total production, Apache's the leading independent international producer in our peer group, and we think that gives us the competitive advantage, both in terms of finding more oil in the future and benefiting from rising international gas prices.Finally, in 2009, against our number one priority to live within cash flow, Apache ended the year with just over $2 billion of cash on the books, versus just under $2 billion in 2008. I would note that this was accomplished without having to issue equity, at or near the bottom of the market. That having been said, the real question is what's next? Now that the world economy is no longer dangling so close to the precipice of financial ruin, we're going to step it up a notch. We plan to increase the D&P capital by about half to $6 billion or $6.5 billion, which we figure roughly approximates to 2010 cash flow, assuming prices of around $700 per barrel, and $5 per Mcf. As usual, Apache will reassess our capital budget on a quarterly basis and adapt accordingly.Capital spending including for GTP facilities and P&A, is forecasted to be split evenly between North America and international. The significant increases in 2010 are in drilling, as activity ramps up to more typical levels. And in facilities, with our large projects progressing in Australia, Egypt, North Sea and Canada. The largest increases will occur in the U.S. after splitting our Central region and in Canada and Australia. You can find capital spending details by country on our website under the supplemental financial data section that Tom mentioned.Given our increased budget for 2010, we currently have hedged approximately 40% of our year end North American gas production. 225,000 MMBtu per day is hedged with swaps averaging around $5.80 and 84,000 MMBtu per day, it's hedged using collars with an average floors and ceilings of around $5.50 and $7. We've also hedged 100 gigajoules per day of our Canada gas production, with swaps at an average of around $5.35 in Canadian dollars in April.On the oil side, we haven't been quite as aggressive, we've hedged just over 10% of our worldwide liquids, or an average of 35,000 barrels per day for 2010, approximately 80% represents collars with average floors and ceilings of approximating $65 and $81 and a barrel. The balance is swapped at an average price of just under $69 a barrel.We're also actively screening acquisition opportunities, and while we we're not in hot pursuit at the moment, it is apparent that our industry's acquisition pipeline is fine. In addition to our $2 billion of cash, $2.3 billion of ongoing credit lines leave us the combined $4.3 billion of firepower, this in the low 24% debt to cap provides considerable flexibility to act on either incremental drilling, or acquisitions should attractive opportunities materialize.With respect to cost, we currently forecast slightly higher cash costs including taxes other than income but I would tell you, our goal is to get them flat with 2009 average of around $11 and a quarter for boe. With a strong financial position, solid oil prices, international gas prices turning higher, and projected production growth of 5% to 10%, the current outlook for 2010 is quite favorable. Steve?"

I'd like to close by summarizing what I think is the three main messages of all the information that all the gentlemen have shared today. The first is, 2009 was a good year for Apache. We had strong growth and a challenging environment with restricted capital and well capped. We really owe this to the performance and hard work of our team and their focus on generating growth and value.The second message Roger just mentioned is, we expect to have 5% or 10% net production growth in 2010. And I might add in addition, our development drilling program will deliver 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the first full year of its contribution in 2011. And third, we built a well-balanced global portfolio of growth areas for the long term. The diversity of our 2010 operating plans outlined by John and Rod, I think, reflect that. So 2010 is going to be a very busy year for Apache. And with the organization and opportunities set, there's much more in front of us in the years ahead.

We have -- even though we completed our Salam gas rigs 3 and 4 last summer, we've continued drilling successes through 2009. We shall, again, find ourselves in a situation with the need to add more processing capacity into the Western Desert by building this fifth Salam gas train, which we intend to initiate construction by year end, as I indicated. We have a lot of gas behind pipe, as well as oil and these are maybe common safe rich gas zones that have yet to be produced. So it's a matter of when you want to get it out. We could live with the current facilities and stretch it out for many, many years. But we have a lot of near-term opportunity to increase that present value of that gas by producing it sooner as opposed to later. Of course, the government of Egypt is very interested in adding more process and capacity to accommodate the additional production because of the almost insatiable gas demand in the country of Egypt, which continues to grow about 11%, 12% annually. So we have a very robust inventory of prospects about drilling, about 175 to 200 wells a year. And the exploration prospects continue to spawn additional development drilling year by year. This has been, kind of, a consistent pattern to the last decade. We've been drilling now some 1,600 or 1,700 wells in the country. And our success rate on exploration development is very consistent year-on-year."

And ultimately, I guess you're going to have to reset your 2x target at some point because you're getting pretty close.

Perhaps it's because it's cooler from a geological sense. Clearly the wells we're making there are oil wells. And they are oil wells that are deeper than you'd normally see in that part of the desert. That backlog of our inventory, we are looking to continually evaluating and assessing prospects that have developed off of our very large 80s seismic inventory. And in fact, we've been reshooting some of the areas that are main producing area. And we've shot a decade ago and the data quality now is amazing and turning up even more and more ideas. Whether it's on exploration projects or production enhancement projects or workovers, we have -- every year, we have this inventory and maybe, like 300 production enhancement projects. And then we do the jobs, the next year, we still have 300 production enhancement projects to do. The work continues to spawn other ideas and other work, whether it's on exploration side to exploration drilling, or the development of production enhancement activity. And as far as horizontal applications, activities for horizontal exploitation of Egypt are really not even touched. And we are beginning to investigate through horizontal drilling, certain formations, certain reservoir sequences that we think could be applicable to such. Like many times, these things have been done for years in North America. And they're just now arriving onshore in Egypt. There are no known horizontal plays operating in the country but we're looking to see what we can do in that area, from what we know from North America activity.

So we, obviously, have a pretty good feel for what we'd see in some of the areas that we've been drilling for years out there. And so we're concentrating on those areas that, first of all, would have the highest liquid yields. With that said, we're going to be doing a lot of work around really trying to assess our entire position out there over this year. So you should expect us to be very active in that Granite Wash play across our entire acreage position this year."

And the reason is, frankly, if you look across our portfolio and I'll give you four examples. Let's take Nevis, it was a little shallow gas play. And all of the sudden, we drilled CPM wells on it. And I think, we'd probably are still producing 80 million or 90 million a day out of the coalbed methane at Nevis that we really didn't see. We're talking an awful lot about Granite Wash. We probably got Granite Wash 500 wells. We drilled our first Granite Wash probably in the 50s. And we're getting ready to come through there with a horizontal play that if we have HBP of 200,000 acres. Or if you look at some of the things we're doing in West Texas, horizontal wells and the water floods, and all of a sudden, you are able to increase production. Owning acreage in real, well-known hydrocarbon areas really give you an advantage especially if you're large, which is why you see us in large positions in most places that we're in."

Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations f",823,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations front and mention two highlights. Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil development projects in Australia have now achieved maximum production ahead of what we forecasted for the year. This is an important step forward in the delivery of the large and visible pipeline of organic growth projects in our international region. 
In the North America, we ramped up the development of two large resource plays, the Horn River and the Granite Wash. We're going to drill over 60 gross wells this year in these two plays and expect to exit the year with net production of around 175 million a day. The Granite Wash is a liquid rich relative to most other large resource plays in North America, which gives big impact on economics. It's also differentiated by the acreage position we hold because it is primarily held by production. 
In the Horn River, the quality of the rock and the development efficiencies certainly differentiates it. We can achieve those through large drilling pads on continuous ground acreage. In addition, as we progress our Kitimat LNG project, our goal is to give Horn River access to international LNG markets. These are just a couple of the highlights on the operations side, and Rod and John will go over more on this as we go, which is really shows that organic growth engine is stronger than it's ever been. 
Going into 2010, we truly expected first quarter to be slow relative to the sequence of being of the quarters and production growth to accelerate from there and that's exactly what you see reflected on our numbers. Production ramped up throughout the quarter with March actual production coming in at 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared to our average for the quarter of 585,000 barrels a day. And we consider our 5% to 10% organic growth production outlook remains unchanged. 
Secondly, on the financial front, the highlights really is that we have the best quarter since 2008, both in terms of earnings and cash flow. This has been driven by our portfolio balance, and I can't say enough how important it is for our portfolio to be balanced between oil and gas, and then within gas, to have a good mix of both North American and international gas. Not only it's an important but frankly, at our size, it's pretty much impossible to replicate for companies that did not make that balanced growth choices that we've made over the last several years in getting to this position. 
And thirdly on the strategic front, we have taken three very important steps so far in 2010. A merger with Mariner Energy, which we announced after the quarter closed, will give Apache a new growth platform in the deepwater. Mariner gives us critical mass, experience and opportunities set that we want in this area and Apache's resources will enhance the value creation potential of this platform. 
In addition, Mariner gives us a rich opportunity inventory in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and also in the Permian Basin. The asset fit is excellent. The cultural fit is outstanding. And we're working diligently with Mariner's team to progress the merger and are very much looking forward to welcoming them officially onboard as Apache. 
Separately, the Devon offshore property transaction gives us yet another high-quality inventory set in the core region, with very attractive returns and frankly, I can't say that we know of anyone that can generate the reserves and value better than we can. The third strategic development that took place during the quarter that Apache became operator is the Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada. We've discussed that opportunity with you on our earnings call in February. But I'd note that just like Deepwater, LNG is a big step forward for Apache. It enables us to monetize very large gas resources, at LNG prices, which are generally linked to crude oil prices and gives us a large stable production and cash profile to complement our portfolio. 
Instead of following the pack, we certainly picked our own timing and direction in taking each of these steps. Looking back, I can reminisce going into Egypt in 1995, going into the North Sea in 2003 and going into Australia in 1993. All were important steps for us. And all of them were very much against the sector consensus at the time but which have created great value for our shareholders. And we're confident that the steps that we've taken in the first quarter will be looked back on in the same vein, and will provide meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum who will discuss North America."
169838,104540805,58689,"Apache Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gul",2099,"Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gulf Coast and Central regions were the primary factors. The ramp up of drilling operation, started in the first quarter after very low activity level in 2009, will arrest that drop for the second quarter. 
The Gulf Coast region production for the first quarter averaged just under 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Production gains of almost 6,000 barrels equivalent were experienced from additional hurricane repairs and resumption of the service of the Sea Robin Pipeline. However, these gains were offset by natural declines and again, the third-party host platform and pipeline issues during the quarter. 
The first quarter drilling program in the Gulf Coast has given us a nice start for 2010. We drilled 19 gross wells, of which 14 were successful. Four of those successful wells were exploratory and are now in evaluation and developmental planning stages. Two LLOG-operated Mississippi Canyon 199 wells successfully tested two adjacent fault blocks at our Mandy prospect, and penetrated net oil pay of 161 feet and 109 feet respectively at approximately 6,500-foot PVD. We are now evaluating subsea development plans for these wells and would expect production by mid 2011 with initial rates of around 6,000 barrels per day from each well. Apache has working interest of 15% in this field and Mariner Energy has 35% working interest in the discovery. 
In addition, we were successful with two tests of the N6 M [ph] at our Boomerang Prospect that main pass 308, where we identified 12 feet and 30 feet of net oil pay in the N6 M [ph] in our number one and number one sidetrack wells respectively. Regionally, the N6 M [ph] well is quite prolific with recoveries in the range of 1 million barrels of oil from 10-foot pay sections. 
We are currently mobilizing a rig to drill in a price of well and mainpass 309 to further delineate the reservoir and confirm our platform location for development plans. Initial rates are expected to be around 800 barrels per day per well, with the support of six wells development. First production would be expected in the first half of 2011. Apache operates this bill with 100% working interest. 
Other successful drilling of two wells, the Grand Isle 41 and South Pass 75, as well as the new well at High Island 129, and three new wells on to our producers will have additional production volumes for the second quarter. 
In our Central Region, production averaged 34,600 barrels equivalent per day, down 4% from last quarter. Third-party pipeline downtime and delays in completion of new wells were responsible for the decline. The third-party downtime issues resolved in our backlog of completions being worked off. We expect production to be up by more than 3,000 barrels equivalent in the second quarter. 
As most of you know, horizontal drilling with multiple stage frac stimulations has really improved the potential of the tight formations we typically target in the country United States. Our Central Region controls roughly 1 million gross acres, most of which is held by production. This has provided us with an excellent platform from which we actively and efficiently explore. We've been testing various geologic targets across the region to identify the most prospective acreage for horizontal application. 
Since late last year, the region has tested eight separate horizontal pay intervals within 20 wells over hundreds of square miles. More than a dozen more horizontal formation tests are planned this year. As plans are verified, leasing efforts have commenced. In the past year, 36,000 new gross acres have been leased with 16,000 of those acres being leased in the first quarter of 2010. The Central Region spud 23 wells in the first quarter, of which 13 were horizontal. The region's most active program continues to be the Granite Wash in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. You're all aware that the Granite Wash is a series of liquid-rich tech gas, which underlies some 4,000 square miles of the Anadarko Basin. 
We've been active even in the decades and have only recently ramped up horizontal multi-frac operations. We have now drilled eight horizontal wells, five of which have been completed, as well as have already produced 4 bcf gas at 150,000 barrels of oil. The remaining three are now being completed. Meanwhile, we are expanding the drilling campaign and are currently operating six horizontal Granite Wash rigs. A seventh horizontal rig will be added as well as an additional vertical rig in May. 
At the same time, we have another three rigs targeting other horizontal effects around the region. We are quite enthused about the results of our Cherokee formation activity in Western Oklahoma. For the past several years, Apache has been successful in acquiring acreage and drilling shallow Cherokee formation wells, primarily in Hartford County, Oklahoma, one of the oldest areas of the Anadarko Basin. 
We drilled over 20 vertical oil wells with initial rates typically averaging 100 barrels per day. On those results, we have recently leased more than 11,000 acres and now control over 60,000 acres in the play. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed our first horizontal path in this play. The Rose Hill for 29H after 150 barrels of oil per day from a 38-foot, 100-foot lateral and has held up quite nicely, still producing over 120 barrels per day after two months. 
Our second test, the Bentley 5-5H has to drill over 700 barrels a day from the 4,400-foot lateral and is still producing 530 barrels a day after six weeks. The region has identified more than 30 additional horizontal locations in this play and we expect to maintain at least one horizontal drilling rig in the play for the foreseeable future. 
In East Texas, Apache has been active with two horizontal drilling rigs targeting Bossier Sands since late last year. The region has completed three horizontal tests today. The Folk 6H, that was this year. The Folk 6H tested for 9.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody T-7H [ph] tested for 9.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. And while the Folk 9H tested for a very strong rate of 15.5 million cubic feet gas per day. The Moody 2-8H is currently testing out their frac, an early indications that it will be the strongest well to date.  
As of this morning, it's already flowing at more than 15 million cubic feet of gas per day while still recovering frac water at more than 2,000 barrels per day. We're on a 100% of Moody lease in the lease and 77% of the 12 place [ph]. 
Our new Permian Region is operating independently after the year end spun out from our Central Region. We've been actively recruiting staff from both inside and outside Apache and expect to be fully operational from our newly leased office space in Midland by early July. Permian production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent within 1% of the prior quarter. We expect production to be up slightly for the second quarter. The Permian region drilling program got off to a fast start as well. We're currently operating five rigs, three in New Mexico and two in Texas. During the first quarter, the region drilled 51 wells targeting oil reservoirs in 11 different fields across Permian Basin. All 51 Wells are either completed and on production or will be completed in the near future. 
As in the Central Region, application of horizontal well technology is having a significant impact on our plants. Importantly, we drilled two successful horizontal tests in all waterflood units. The Shafterlike [ph] 606-H well was drilled and completed in the San Andres with a fixed-stage frac stimulation and came on production at the initial rate of nearly 500 barrels of oil per day. The North McElroy 4025-H was drilled and completed in the Grayburg with an eight-stage frac stimulation and tested approximately 200 barrels of oil per day. Both wells initial rates and post-drill reserve estimates were higher than pre-drill estimates. Based on this success, follow-up locations are planned in both fields, where we will test longer laterals and more fracture stimulation stages. 
We're very optimistic about the potential for horizontal drilling throughout the Permian Basin with additional wells planned at TSO South [ph] and Dean units in West Texas, as well as the monument area of southeast new Mexico.  We expect to keep at least one horizontal rig working at the remainder of the year. We also expect to add two additional drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter to expand our traditional low risk bread-and-butter vertical oil well programs. 
During the first quarter, the region also sanctioned Roberts CO2-enhanced recovery expansion and just signed an agreement with Kinder Morgan for the purchase of 38 bcf of CO2 over 10 years. CO2-enhanced recovery will be an important piece to the Permian Region business for a long time given our extensive holdings in the basin. We have already identified 26 of our fields with CO2 enhanced recovery potential. 
In Canada, Canadian production averaged 68,000 barrels equivalent a day, down 5% from the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, extreme weather early in the year caused extensive freeze up across the region and was the primary reason for the drop. We are bringing on production from our winter drilling program and completion operations, which are expected to lead to a 6% increase for the second quarter. The majority of the impact of the Horn River activity will not become evident until the second half of the year. 
Development drilling and our conventional business units totaled 42 wells resulting in 38 producers during the first quarter, with successful gas completions at Zama, Kaybob and Nevis. Oil drilling activity was focused on House Mountain where six new horizontal wells are producing over 1,100 barrels per day. Also an 18-well winter program in our Provost area has delivered good results including one well that tested over 500 barrels of oil per day at our proposed Battle River EOR [Enhanced Oil Recovery] project area. 
Our Horn River activity continues to dominate Canadian operations with horizontal wells were drilled in the two island of late developed area during the quarter with four of the Apache operated 52 pan and three on enhanced and can operated 63 tape. In addition come Apache drilled through horizontal Wells in our ability area to hold expiring acreage. Drilling efficiencies that result in cost performance continued to improve with average drill times now at 19 days from the spud rig release and average drill cost at $3.7 million per well for about 7,200-foot of horizontal section. 
Completion operations on the 16 Wells 70 K-Pad, which was drilled in 2009 commenced in January. We have just finished the amount of frac stimulation project associated with these wells this week. Over the past three and a half months, we have completed 274 frac stimulations on those 16 Wells, accounting more than 500 million barrels of water and an excess of 100 million pounds of sand. The project also involves conducting a huge micro-seismic acquisition program with 82 individual frac stages in over 19,000 individual micro seismic events mapped. This data will be used to optimize frac design, frac spacing and then well spacing on our future pads. 
The first half 16 70-K came on stream on March 29 to start recovering frac load water, and we're now producing around 25 million a day from that pad. The ramp-up has been severely limited due to the space restrictions while the frac spread remain on location. We are presently demobilizing the frac equipment and would expect to have all 16 wells on production by early July. 
Construction of the DeBolt water treatment facility ramped up in the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early May. While it is not available for our 70-K Pad program, utilization of this water supply will ultimately reduce the volumes of fresh water used for frac stimulation purposes and the associated costs for water transportation. Steve mentioned the Kitimat operation during the first quarter, we have now received feed proposals from four parties and we're under technical evaluation. We would expect to award fees sometime or the next month and a half, two months. 
And that's all I have. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob Eichler."

During the first quarter, production from Apache's international operations was 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 2% increase over fourth quarter 2009. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and successful commission of oil developments in Australia. In Egypt, net production was 151,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 5% from fourth quarter due to higher oil prices and lower recoverable costs resulting in lower cost recovery barrels. By contrast, gross fuel per day increased 3,000 barrels a day or 1% from 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Exploration activity continued stronger in the quarter with operations being conducted on five free seismic surveys representing nearly 3,000 square kilometers average. Oil activity increased during the quarter with a total of 48 wells, reaching total debt including 10 exploration wells. The region heads for the quarter with 20 after drilling rigs operating and the success rate for Apache-operated exploration wells was 67%. 
Exploration appraisal drilling was largely focused in our expanding Faghur Basin oil play, where four plays tested in a combined rate of 12,000 barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of gas per day from AEB reservoir. 18 well remain to drilled in the basin this year including non-exploration wells. Development of the Phiops field of the east end of Faghur Basin continued with Phiops-8 well, which encountered 124 net feet of pay and multiple AEB sands. The initial completion, AEB 3E sand tested at 4,500 barrels of oil per day and no water. Construction is during completion on the West Kalansha facility project, which will increase the export capacity of our Faghur Basin facilities from the current 11,000 barrels of oil per day to 20,000 barrels per day by midyear. 
Extension of the Malaha accrual pipeline and completion of the chain of infrastructure upgrades will further produce Apache's Faghur Basin production capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day, which we should be able to fill up by year end. Notable drilling results were also achieved in the Jade field discovered by Apache in 2007 on a Matruh development lease. The Jade-8 well was completed in AEB 3E put on production this 10th of March. In its current report, the Salam gas plant at the rate of 3,100 barrels condensate per day and 32 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Jade-10 well is drilled in that quest of Jade structure and tested 3,100 barrels of oil per day with no water from the AEB 3E. Additional field wells are planned in 2010 to accelerate this oil development. To date, the Jade field has produced 47 Bcf and 4.5 million barrels of oil and condensate and presently produces 107 million cubic feet of gas per day and 12,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day. 
Apache has 100% contract interest for all the previously referenced wells. 
In Australia, net production was 61,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 40% increase over fourth quarter and double the rate for first quarter of 2009. Gas production increased by 1% from fourth quarter while oil production nearly tripled. The substantial increase in net oil production from 9,900 barrels of oil per day to 27,000 barrels per day was due to successful commissioning of the of Van Gogh and Pyrenees development projects. Their region also benefited from the absence of cyclones in the first quarter compared to three cyclones and storm production eruptions for the same period of 2009. 
At the Van Gogh oil project, which Apache operates for 52.5% working interest, the Ningaloo Vision FPSO arrived on location and following a five-week commissioning period, the field commenced production on February 13. Well performance has been excellent with oil wells tested above 10,000 barrels of oil per day on Cleo [ph]. Production peaked at 72,200 barrels of oil per day gross in March, and averaged 66,000 barrels of oil per day gross or 34,700 barrels a day net in the last week of the quarter. To date, the field has produced 3.4 million barrels of oil or 1.8 million barrels net. 
Nearby, BHP Billiton operated Pyrenees FPSO development in which Apache has a 28.6% working interest commenced production February 24.  Production ramped up quickly to 90,000 barrels a day gross from the seven WA-42 L permit wells with six wells remain to be completed on the adjacent WA-43 L permit in which Apache has a 31.5% working interest. To date, Pyrenees field has produced 4.4 million barrels of oil gross and 1.3 million barrels net for Apache. These high initial rates for both fields are essentially flush production as we commission the facilities and we expect the region's net oil production to average 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for the year. 
Work is progressing in our Devil Creek Reindeer development project in which Apache is the operator with 55% working interest. Gas plant in both Earthworks were sort of completed in the first quarter and several works commenced. The first shipment of the Thailand fabricated gas plant hyperact modules arrived on site and installation in progress. The onshore pipeline from the beach crossing to the gas plant and the horizontal directional-drilling operations on the beach was started. Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform deck is underway in China. The project is on schedule for postproduction in third quarter 2011. Also during the first quarter, four Apache-operated wells reached TD yield in two trend exploration dry holes and two successful appraisal wells on Australia's North Sea shell. The Julimar Southwest 1 and Southwest 2 how much Apache has a 65% working interest were drilled in a single surface location to confirm productivity of the Mungaroo formation in the southern part of the Julimar horse block. Both wells are part of the Julimar-Brunello development component of the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project. 
In the North Sea, production averaged 58,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 2% for the fourth quarter. 32,000 barrels of oil per day average for the quarter was added to new drilling where we lost 1,800 barrels a day from mechanical failures, unplanned events in normal times. At the end of the quarter, seven development wells and five pilot holes were drilled and completed. Notably, the Forties Alpha 15A 53W [ph] in the Forties Charlie 24 C - 44 Y [ph] development wells tested 3,031 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The field development plan for the mall field, a new field using oil discovery made by Apache in the fourth quarter has been proved by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. First oil expected late in the second quarter of 2010. The field has qualified as a small field development yielding up to 75 million pounds earning a supplement corporation tax breaks as well as exemption from the petroleum revenue tax. 
In Argentina, net production was 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 8% from the fourth quarter. The normal decline as well as mechanical and other related downtime in Neuquén fields pushed oil production down while gas production separate from lower than normal residential seasonal demand and lower demand by power generation customers from increased hydroelectric power capability, availability all result in increased gas, injection and shutting gas wells throughout the first quarter. In total, we reinjected close to 4 million cubic feet of gas per day net more than in the first quarter compared to previous quarter. 
Regions shallow [ph] program however was very successful in the first quarter, with 10 wells drilled with no dry hole adding net reserves is 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the shallow drilling program in the Neuquén Basin three successful wells were drilled at a gross production of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas per day and 335 barrels of oil per day from Centenario and Cuyo reservoirs. All three wells are drilled at depths of only 4,000 feet. An additional 16 Wells are planned for this year. Also the Neuquén Basin, four successful wells are drilled as part of the Gas Plus program. Three wells in EFO field have been completed in the Lajas the depth 11,500 feet and our production can combined rate of 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day or 108 barrels of currency per day after multizone stimulated completions. If fourth well, the EFO 109, encountered 328 feet of net pay in the Lajas, it is being completed and frac is stimulated in six zones. Those are currently cleaning up after frac of the first three zones at a rate of 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Based on the quality of paying [ph] and the results of the first three zone the EFO 109 is expected to produce over 500 million cubic feet of gas per day and 125 barrels of condensate per day. 
Eight additional wells are planned in EFO field to develop gas volumes for the Gas Plus contracts that is currently being negotiated to provide 15 million cubic feet of gas per day at a price of $5 per million BTU on January 1, 2011. 10 additional wells in AC and Ronaco fields will also be drilled this year to support the Gas Plus program. Apache operates the reference Neuquén Basin wells and fields with 100% working interest. 
Now let's turn the presentation over to Roger Plank for the finance."
169838,104540805,58689,"Apache Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million o",662,"Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million or $2.08 per share were 21% higher than the prior quarter and our highest since third quarter of '08. Adjusted for the impact of FX on our deferred tax balances, earnings totaled $712 million or $2.10 a share. Cash flow from operations for us $1.5 billion also for the first time since third quarter of '08. Apache's substantial oil and liquid production base was the primary driver behind our results. Highland liquids represented half of our equivalent production but generated nearly 3/4 of revenue, and are principally responsible for our revenue rising $118 million sequentially to $2.7 billion. 
Long before the current industries stampede began oil exposure, Apache took deliberate steps to achieve a balanced production mix. As a result, we're already benefiting from a current 20 to 1 multiple in the price of oil versus gas. And we are ramping up activity on the oil side of our portfolio. In the first quarter, for example, Van Gogh and Pyrenees enabled Apache's lower production to rise 3% sequentially, nearly offsetting a 4% temporary decline in gas production. I would note that absent the impact of higher prices had on both price-sensitive volumes in Egypt and to a lesser extent in Canada, on a production volumes, would've been up slightly and pretty much spot on our first quarter plan. A few quick comments on costs, cash costs excluding taxes other than income, came in at $11.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, impacted by slightly lower production. Rising future productions should drive us toward our goals to match 2009's average of $11.25 per boe. 
You're maybe wondering about the potential impact of our recently announced transactions on 2010. Because it so much depends on exactly when the transactions closed. The precise impact is difficult to measure but here's some broad indicators. Absent the exercise of preferential purchase rate, which covers some 7,500 barrels equivalent per day, Apache is picking up 19,000 barrels equivalent per day from Devon and another 63,000 with Mariner. A combined 82,000 equivalent barrels per day represents 14% of Apache's first quarter worldwide production. With respect to the financial 2010 impact, assuming Devin closes in early June and Mariner late in the third quarter, 2010 average volumes should rise around 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 4% to 5% from these transactions alone. Now this is over and above our earlier production growth target of 5% to 10% growth pre-acquisitions. 
I would note that for the last couple of years, Apache chose to build cash rather than pursue transactions of size in what was generally considered a profiting market. Net cash was in fact pent-up growth potential that is now being put to work and will benefit all key per share metrics over the next several years. While we potentially took up 14% more production, share count rises just 5%, resulting in accretion to per-share earnings, cash flow, production and reserves in the first full year of ownership. 
The bottom line is our outlook for growth is excellent. I would also note that in our two recent deals, about 60% of combined production is gas. Approximately 60% of the revenue is generated from oil and liquids. There's also a deep inventory of future development projects as well as exploration prospects that are oil. 
One final note on our balance sheet, while the combined transactions totaled $5 billion, our financial flexibility remains intact. Approximately $2 billion at consideration is equity and we will also tap a significant portion of our $2.1 billion of cash balances to close these deals. By year-end, debt cash should be below 25% and cash balances above $1 billion, leaving us in excellent position to continue to carry out Apache's growth strategy.

I'd like to sum up what I think were the three main messages from all the information that we shared with you on this call. 
First, we had a very good quarter operationally. As you heard mentioned few times Van Gogh and Pyrenees have ramped up. Our organic growth engine as strong as ever and our organic growth production's expectations for the year remain at 5% to 10%. 
Secondly, we have had a very good quarter from a financial perspective, with the highest earnings and cash flow since 2008. We achieved this in spite of a weak price environment from North American gas and it's because of our portfolio, which is really a central part of our strategy and a key differentiating factor for most of our peers. 
And third, we certainly took very important strategic steps during the quarter. You got further omissions that are a little, profitable long-term growth our shareholders. We picked our own timing and direction. And we're very excited about the growth and value creation potential by the Mariner merger, the Devon offshore acquisition and our Kitimat LNG project.

Winter is difficult for us in Canada and unfortunately, it's difficult for us in the central region because we've got one of the more severe freezes that we've had through that part of our portfolio in the first quarter. So a lot of costs with respect to activities to start production again is part of those costs and the other thing is to be honest with you, our production was down a little bit and one of the major culprits was because we are in a CS3 a production sharing agreement in Egypt and the bedside of is all prices go up come in the downside of it is we see less production which cost us about 5000 barrels a day in Egypt. And gross operated was actually up. But overall, I don't think the cost side of it is going to get out of line. On the steel prices, that's certainly going to have an impact and I'm sure everyone's over the steel prices are going up.

169838,104540805,58692,"Apache Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations f",823,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations front and mention two highlights. Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil development projects in Australia have now achieved maximum production ahead of what we forecasted for the year. This is an important step forward in the delivery of the large and visible pipeline of organic growth projects in our international region. 
In the North America, we ramped up the development of two large resource plays, the Horn River and the Granite Wash. We're going to drill over 60 gross wells this year in these two plays and expect to exit the year with net production of around 175 million a day. The Granite Wash is a liquid rich relative to most other large resource plays in North America, which gives big impact on economics. It's also differentiated by the acreage position we hold because it is primarily held by production. 
In the Horn River, the quality of the rock and the development efficiencies certainly differentiates it. We can achieve those through large drilling pads on continuous ground acreage. In addition, as we progress our Kitimat LNG project, our goal is to give Horn River access to international LNG markets. These are just a couple of the highlights on the operations side, and Rod and John will go over more on this as we go, which is really shows that organic growth engine is stronger than it's ever been. 
Going into 2010, we truly expected first quarter to be slow relative to the sequence of being of the quarters and production growth to accelerate from there and that's exactly what you see reflected on our numbers. Production ramped up throughout the quarter with March actual production coming in at 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared to our average for the quarter of 585,000 barrels a day. And we consider our 5% to 10% organic growth production outlook remains unchanged. 
Secondly, on the financial front, the highlights really is that we have the best quarter since 2008, both in terms of earnings and cash flow. This has been driven by our portfolio balance, and I can't say enough how important it is for our portfolio to be balanced between oil and gas, and then within gas, to have a good mix of both North American and international gas. Not only it's an important but frankly, at our size, it's pretty much impossible to replicate for companies that did not make that balanced growth choices that we've made over the last several years in getting to this position. 
And thirdly on the strategic front, we have taken three very important steps so far in 2010. A merger with Mariner Energy, which we announced after the quarter closed, will give Apache a new growth platform in the deepwater. Mariner gives us critical mass, experience and opportunities set that we want in this area and Apache's resources will enhance the value creation potential of this platform. 
In addition, Mariner gives us a rich opportunity inventory in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and also in the Permian Basin. The asset fit is excellent. The cultural fit is outstanding. And we're working diligently with Mariner's team to progress the merger and are very much looking forward to welcoming them officially onboard as Apache. 
Separately, the Devon offshore property transaction gives us yet another high-quality inventory set in the core region, with very attractive returns and frankly, I can't say that we know of anyone that can generate the reserves and value better than we can. The third strategic development that took place during the quarter that Apache became operator is the Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada. We've discussed that opportunity with you on our earnings call in February. But I'd note that just like Deepwater, LNG is a big step forward for Apache. It enables us to monetize very large gas resources, at LNG prices, which are generally linked to crude oil prices and gives us a large stable production and cash profile to complement our portfolio. 
Instead of following the pack, we certainly picked our own timing and direction in taking each of these steps. Looking back, I can reminisce going into Egypt in 1995, going into the North Sea in 2003 and going into Australia in 1993. All were important steps for us. And all of them were very much against the sector consensus at the time but which have created great value for our shareholders. And we're confident that the steps that we've taken in the first quarter will be looked back on in the same vein, and will provide meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum who will discuss North America.

North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gul",2099,"Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gulf Coast and Central regions were the primary factors. The ramp up of drilling operation, started in the first quarter after very low activity level in 2009, will arrest that drop for the second quarter. 
The Gulf Coast region production for the first quarter averaged just under 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Production gains of almost 6,000 barrels equivalent were experienced from additional hurricane repairs and resumption of the service of the Sea Robin Pipeline. However, these gains were offset by natural declines and again, the third-party host platform and pipeline issues during the quarter. 
The first quarter drilling program in the Gulf Coast has given us a nice start for 2010. We drilled 19 gross wells, of which 14 were successful. Four of those successful wells were exploratory and are now in evaluation and developmental planning stages. Two LLOG-operated Mississippi Canyon 199 wells successfully tested two adjacent fault blocks at our Mandy prospect, and penetrated net oil pay of 161 feet and 109 feet respectively at approximately 6,500-foot PVD. We are now evaluating subsea development plans for these wells and would expect production by mid 2011 with initial rates of around 6,000 barrels per day from each well. Apache has working interest of 15% in this field and Mariner Energy has 35% working interest in the discovery. 
In addition, we were successful with two tests of the N6 M [ph] at our Boomerang Prospect that main pass 308, where we identified 12 feet and 30 feet of net oil pay in the N6 M [ph] in our number one and number one sidetrack wells respectively. Regionally, the N6 M [ph] well is quite prolific with recoveries in the range of 1 million barrels of oil from 10-foot pay sections. 
We are currently mobilizing a rig to drill in a price of well and mainpass 309 to further delineate the reservoir and confirm our platform location for development plans. Initial rates are expected to be around 800 barrels per day per well, with the support of six wells development. First production would be expected in the first half of 2011. Apache operates this bill with 100% working interest. 
Other successful drilling of two wells, the Grand Isle 41 and South Pass 75, as well as the new well at High Island 129, and three new wells on to our producers will have additional production volumes for the second quarter. 
In our Central Region, production averaged 34,600 barrels equivalent per day, down 4% from last quarter. Third-party pipeline downtime and delays in completion of new wells were responsible for the decline. The third-party downtime issues resolved in our backlog of completions being worked off. We expect production to be up by more than 3,000 barrels equivalent in the second quarter. 
As most of you know, horizontal drilling with multiple stage frac stimulations has really improved the potential of the tight formations we typically target in the country United States. Our Central Region controls roughly 1 million gross acres, most of which is held by production. This has provided us with an excellent platform from which we actively and efficiently explore. We've been testing various geologic targets across the region to identify the most prospective acreage for horizontal application. 
Since late last year, the region has tested eight separate horizontal pay intervals within 20 wells over hundreds of square miles. More than a dozen more horizontal formation tests are planned this year. As plans are verified, leasing efforts have commenced. In the past year, 36,000 new gross acres have been leased with 16,000 of those acres being leased in the first quarter of 2010. The Central Region spud 23 wells in the first quarter, of which 13 were horizontal. The region's most active program continues to be the Granite Wash in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. You're all aware that the Granite Wash is a series of liquid-rich tech gas, which underlies some 4,000 square miles of the Anadarko Basin. 
We've been active even in the decades and have only recently ramped up horizontal multi-frac operations. We have now drilled eight horizontal wells, five of which have been completed, as well as have already produced 4 bcf gas at 150,000 barrels of oil. The remaining three are now being completed. Meanwhile, we are expanding the drilling campaign and are currently operating six horizontal Granite Wash rigs. A seventh horizontal rig will be added as well as an additional vertical rig in May. 
At the same time, we have another three rigs targeting other horizontal effects around the region. We are quite enthused about the results of our Cherokee formation activity in Western Oklahoma. For the past several years, Apache has been successful in acquiring acreage and drilling shallow Cherokee formation wells, primarily in Hartford County, Oklahoma, one of the oldest areas of the Anadarko Basin. 
We drilled over 20 vertical oil wells with initial rates typically averaging 100 barrels per day. On those results, we have recently leased more than 11,000 acres and now control over 60,000 acres in the play. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed our first horizontal path in this play. The Rose Hill for 29H after 150 barrels of oil per day from a 38-foot, 100-foot lateral and has held up quite nicely, still producing over 120 barrels per day after two months. 
Our second test, the Bentley 5-5H has to drill over 700 barrels a day from the 4,400-foot lateral and is still producing 530 barrels a day after six weeks. The region has identified more than 30 additional horizontal locations in this play and we expect to maintain at least one horizontal drilling rig in the play for the foreseeable future. 
In East Texas, Apache has been active with two horizontal drilling rigs targeting Bossier Sands since late last year. The region has completed three horizontal tests today. The Folk 6H, that was this year. The Folk 6H tested for 9.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody T-7H [ph] tested for 9.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. And while the Folk 9H tested for a very strong rate of 15.5 million cubic feet gas per day. The Moody 2-8H is currently testing out their frac, an early indications that it will be the strongest well to date.  
As of this morning, it's already flowing at more than 15 million cubic feet of gas per day while still recovering frac water at more than 2,000 barrels per day. We're on a 100% of Moody lease in the lease and 77% of the 12 place [ph]. 
Our new Permian Region is operating independently after the year end spun out from our Central Region. We've been actively recruiting staff from both inside and outside Apache and expect to be fully operational from our newly leased office space in Midland by early July. Permian production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent within 1% of the prior quarter. We expect production to be up slightly for the second quarter. The Permian region drilling program got off to a fast start as well. We're currently operating five rigs, three in New Mexico and two in Texas. During the first quarter, the region drilled 51 wells targeting oil reservoirs in 11 different fields across Permian Basin. All 51 Wells are either completed and on production or will be completed in the near future. 
As in the Central Region, application of horizontal well technology is having a significant impact on our plants. Importantly, we drilled two successful horizontal tests in all waterflood units. The Shafterlike [ph] 606-H well was drilled and completed in the San Andres with a fixed-stage frac stimulation and came on production at the initial rate of nearly 500 barrels of oil per day. The North McElroy 4025-H was drilled and completed in the Grayburg with an eight-stage frac stimulation and tested approximately 200 barrels of oil per day. Both wells initial rates and post-drill reserve estimates were higher than pre-drill estimates. Based on this success, follow-up locations are planned in both fields, where we will test longer laterals and more fracture stimulation stages. 
We're very optimistic about the potential for horizontal drilling throughout the Permian Basin with additional wells planned at TSO South [ph] and Dean units in West Texas, as well as the monument area of southeast new Mexico.  We expect to keep at least one horizontal rig working at the remainder of the year. We also expect to add two additional drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter to expand our traditional low risk bread-and-butter vertical oil well programs. 
During the first quarter, the region also sanctioned Roberts CO2-enhanced recovery expansion and just signed an agreement with Kinder Morgan for the purchase of 38 bcf of CO2 over 10 years. CO2-enhanced recovery will be an important piece to the Permian Region business for a long time given our extensive holdings in the basin. We have already identified 26 of our fields with CO2 enhanced recovery potential. 
In Canada, Canadian production averaged 68,000 barrels equivalent a day, down 5% from the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, extreme weather early in the year caused extensive freeze up across the region and was the primary reason for the drop. We are bringing on production from our winter drilling program and completion operations, which are expected to lead to a 6% increase for the second quarter. The majority of the impact of the Horn River activity will not become evident until the second half of the year. 
Development drilling and our conventional business units totaled 42 wells resulting in 38 producers during the first quarter, with successful gas completions at Zama, Kaybob and Nevis. Oil drilling activity was focused on House Mountain where six new horizontal wells are producing over 1,100 barrels per day. Also an 18-well winter program in our Provost area has delivered good results including one well that tested over 500 barrels of oil per day at our proposed Battle River EOR [Enhanced Oil Recovery] project area. 
Our Horn River activity continues to dominate Canadian operations with horizontal wells were drilled in the two island of late developed area during the quarter with four of the Apache operated 52 pan and three on enhanced and can operated 63 tape. In addition come Apache drilled through horizontal Wells in our ability area to hold expiring acreage. Drilling efficiencies that result in cost performance continued to improve with average drill times now at 19 days from the spud rig release and average drill cost at $3.7 million per well for about 7,200-foot of horizontal section. 
Completion operations on the 16 Wells 70 K-Pad, which was drilled in 2009 commenced in January. We have just finished the amount of frac stimulation project associated with these wells this week. Over the past three and a half months, we have completed 274 frac stimulations on those 16 Wells, accounting more than 500 million barrels of water and an excess of 100 million pounds of sand. The project also involves conducting a huge micro-seismic acquisition program with 82 individual frac stages in over 19,000 individual micro seismic events mapped. This data will be used to optimize frac design, frac spacing and then well spacing on our future pads. 
The first half 16 70-K came on stream on March 29 to start recovering frac load water, and we're now producing around 25 million a day from that pad. The ramp-up has been severely limited due to the space restrictions while the frac spread remain on location. We are presently demobilizing the frac equipment and would expect to have all 16 wells on production by early July. 
Construction of the DeBolt water treatment facility ramped up in the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early May. While it is not available for our 70-K Pad program, utilization of this water supply will ultimately reduce the volumes of fresh water used for frac stimulation purposes and the associated costs for water transportation. Steve mentioned the Kitimat operation during the first quarter, we have now received feed proposals from four parties and we're under technical evaluation. We would expect to award fees sometime or the next month and a half, two months. 
And that's all I have. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob Eichler.

During the first quarter, production from Apache's international operations was 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 2% increase over fourth quarter 2009. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and successful commission of oil developments in Australia. In Egypt, net production was 151,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 5% from fourth quarter due to higher oil prices and lower recoverable costs resulting in lower cost recovery barrels. By contrast, gross fuel per day increased 3,000 barrels a day or 1% from 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Exploration activity continued stronger in the quarter with operations being conducted on five free seismic surveys representing nearly 3,000 square kilometers average. Oil activity increased during the quarter with a total of 48 wells, reaching total debt including 10 exploration wells. The region heads for the quarter with 20 after drilling rigs operating and the success rate for Apache-operated exploration wells was 67%. 
Exploration appraisal drilling was largely focused in our expanding Faghur Basin oil play, where four plays tested in a combined rate of 12,000 barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of gas per day from AEB reservoir. 18 well remain to drilled in the basin this year including non-exploration wells. Development of the Phiops field of the east end of Faghur Basin continued with Phiops-8 well, which encountered 124 net feet of pay and multiple AEB sands. The initial completion, AEB 3E sand tested at 4,500 barrels of oil per day and no water. Construction is during completion on the West Kalansha facility project, which will increase the export capacity of our Faghur Basin facilities from the current 11,000 barrels of oil per day to 20,000 barrels per day by midyear. 
Extension of the Malaha accrual pipeline and completion of the chain of infrastructure upgrades will further produce Apache's Faghur Basin production capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day, which we should be able to fill up by year end. Notable drilling results were also achieved in the Jade field discovered by Apache in 2007 on a Matruh development lease. The Jade-8 well was completed in AEB 3E put on production this 10th of March. In its current report, the Salam gas plant at the rate of 3,100 barrels condensate per day and 32 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Jade-10 well is drilled in that quest of Jade structure and tested 3,100 barrels of oil per day with no water from the AEB 3E. Additional field wells are planned in 2010 to accelerate this oil development. To date, the Jade field has produced 47 Bcf and 4.5 million barrels of oil and condensate and presently produces 107 million cubic feet of gas per day and 12,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day. 
Apache has 100% contract interest for all the previously referenced wells. 
In Australia, net production was 61,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 40% increase over fourth quarter and double the rate for first quarter of 2009. Gas production increased by 1% from fourth quarter while oil production nearly tripled. The substantial increase in net oil production from 9,900 barrels of oil per day to 27,000 barrels per day was due to successful commissioning of the of Van Gogh and Pyrenees development projects. Their region also benefited from the absence of cyclones in the first quarter compared to three cyclones and storm production eruptions for the same period of 2009. 
At the Van Gogh oil project, which Apache operates for 52.5% working interest, the Ningaloo Vision FPSO arrived on location and following a five-week commissioning period, the field commenced production on February 13. Well performance has been excellent with oil wells tested above 10,000 barrels of oil per day on Cleo [ph]. Production peaked at 72,200 barrels of oil per day gross in March, and averaged 66,000 barrels of oil per day gross or 34,700 barrels a day net in the last week of the quarter. To date, the field has produced 3.4 million barrels of oil or 1.8 million barrels net. 
Nearby, BHP Billiton operated Pyrenees FPSO development in which Apache has a 28.6% working interest commenced production February 24.  Production ramped up quickly to 90,000 barrels a day gross from the seven WA-42 L permit wells with six wells remain to be completed on the adjacent WA-43 L permit in which Apache has a 31.5% working interest. To date, Pyrenees field has produced 4.4 million barrels of oil gross and 1.3 million barrels net for Apache. These high initial rates for both fields are essentially flush production as we commission the facilities and we expect the region's net oil production to average 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for the year. 
Work is progressing in our Devil Creek Reindeer development project in which Apache is the operator with 55% working interest. Gas plant in both Earthworks were sort of completed in the first quarter and several works commenced. The first shipment of the Thailand fabricated gas plant hyperact modules arrived on site and installation in progress. The onshore pipeline from the beach crossing to the gas plant and the horizontal directional-drilling operations on the beach was started. Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform deck is underway in China. The project is on schedule for postproduction in third quarter 2011. Also during the first quarter, four Apache-operated wells reached TD yield in two trend exploration dry holes and two successful appraisal wells on Australia's North Sea shell. The Julimar Southwest 1 and Southwest 2 how much Apache has a 65% working interest were drilled in a single surface location to confirm productivity of the Mungaroo formation in the southern part of the Julimar horse block. Both wells are part of the Julimar-Brunello development component of the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project. 
In the North Sea, production averaged 58,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 2% for the fourth quarter. 32,000 barrels of oil per day average for the quarter was added to new drilling where we lost 1,800 barrels a day from mechanical failures, unplanned events in normal times. At the end of the quarter, seven development wells and five pilot holes were drilled and completed. Notably, the Forties Alpha 15A 53W [ph] in the Forties Charlie 24 C - 44 Y [ph] development wells tested 3,031 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The field development plan for the mall field, a new field using oil discovery made by Apache in the fourth quarter has been proved by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. First oil expected late in the second quarter of 2010. The field has qualified as a small field development yielding up to 75 million pounds earning a supplement corporation tax breaks as well as exemption from the petroleum revenue tax. 
In Argentina, net production was 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 8% from the fourth quarter. The normal decline as well as mechanical and other related downtime in Neuquén fields pushed oil production down while gas production separate from lower than normal residential seasonal demand and lower demand by power generation customers from increased hydroelectric power capability, availability all result in increased gas, injection and shutting gas wells throughout the first quarter. In total, we reinjected close to 4 million cubic feet of gas per day net more than in the first quarter compared to previous quarter. 
Regions shallow [ph] program however was very successful in the first quarter, with 10 wells drilled with no dry hole adding net reserves is 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the shallow drilling program in the Neuquén Basin three successful wells were drilled at a gross production of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas per day and 335 barrels of oil per day from Centenario and Cuyo reservoirs. All three wells are drilled at depths of only 4,000 feet. An additional 16 Wells are planned for this year. Also the Neuquén Basin, four successful wells are drilled as part of the Gas Plus program. Three wells in EFO field have been completed in the Lajas the depth 11,500 feet and our production can combined rate of 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day or 108 barrels of currency per day after multizone stimulated completions. If fourth well, the EFO 109, encountered 328 feet of net pay in the Lajas, it is being completed and frac is stimulated in six zones. Those are currently cleaning up after frac of the first three zones at a rate of 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Based on the quality of paying [ph] and the results of the first three zone the EFO 109 is expected to produce over 500 million cubic feet of gas per day and 125 barrels of condensate per day. 
Eight additional wells are planned in EFO field to develop gas volumes for the Gas Plus contracts that is currently being negotiated to provide 15 million cubic feet of gas per day at a price of $5 per million BTU on January 1, 2011. 10 additional wells in AC and Ronaco fields will also be drilled this year to support the Gas Plus program. Apache operates the reference Neuquén Basin wells and fields with 100% working interest. 
Now let's turn the presentation over to Roger Plank for the finance.

I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million o",662,"Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million or $2.08 per share were 21% higher than the prior quarter and our highest since third quarter of '08. Adjusted for the impact of FX on our deferred tax balances, earnings totaled $712 million or $2.10 a share. Cash flow from operations for us $1.5 billion also for the first time since third quarter of '08. Apache's substantial oil and liquid production base was the primary driver behind our results. Highland liquids represented half of our equivalent production but generated nearly 3/4 of revenue, and are principally responsible for our revenue rising $118 million sequentially to $2.7 billion. 
Long before the current industries stampede began oil exposure, Apache took deliberate steps to achieve a balanced production mix. As a result, we're already benefiting from a current 20 to 1 multiple in the price of oil versus gas. And we are ramping up activity on the oil side of our portfolio. In the first quarter, for example, Van Gogh and Pyrenees enabled Apache's lower production to rise 3% sequentially, nearly offsetting a 4% temporary decline in gas production. I would note that absent the impact of higher prices had on both price-sensitive volumes in Egypt and to a lesser extent in Canada, on a production volumes, would've been up slightly and pretty much spot on our first quarter plan. A few quick comments on costs, cash costs excluding taxes other than income, came in at $11.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, impacted by slightly lower production. Rising future productions should drive us toward our goals to match 2009's average of $11.25 per boe. 
You're maybe wondering about the potential impact of our recently announced transactions on 2010. Because it so much depends on exactly when the transactions closed. The precise impact is difficult to measure but here's some broad indicators. Absent the exercise of preferential purchase rate, which covers some 7,500 barrels equivalent per day, Apache is picking up 19,000 barrels equivalent per day from Devon and another 63,000 with Mariner. A combined 82,000 equivalent barrels per day represents 14% of Apache's first quarter worldwide production. With respect to the financial 2010 impact, assuming Devin closes in early June and Mariner late in the third quarter, 2010 average volumes should rise around 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 4% to 5% from these transactions alone. Now this is over and above our earlier production growth target of 5% to 10% growth pre-acquisitions. 
I would note that for the last couple of years, Apache chose to build cash rather than pursue transactions of size in what was generally considered a profiting market. Net cash was in fact pent-up growth potential that is now being put to work and will benefit all key per share metrics over the next several years. While we potentially took up 14% more production, share count rises just 5%, resulting in accretion to per-share earnings, cash flow, production and reserves in the first full year of ownership. 
The bottom line is our outlook for growth is excellent. I would also note that in our two recent deals, about 60% of combined production is gas. Approximately 60% of the revenue is generated from oil and liquids. There's also a deep inventory of future development projects as well as exploration prospects that are oil. 
One final note on our balance sheet, while the combined transactions totaled $5 billion, our financial flexibility remains intact. Approximately $2 billion at consideration is equity and we will also tap a significant portion of our $2.1 billion of cash balances to close these deals. By year-end, debt cash should be below 25% and cash balances above $1 billion, leaving us in excellent position to continue to carry out Apache's growth strategy.

I'd like to sum up what I think were the three main messages from all the information that we shared with you on this call. 
First, we had a very good quarter operationally. As you heard mentioned few times Van Gogh and Pyrenees have ramped up. Our organic growth engine as strong as ever and our organic growth production's expectations for the year remain at 5% to 10%. 
Secondly, we have had a very good quarter from a financial perspective, with the highest earnings and cash flow since 2008. We achieved this in spite of a weak price environment from North American gas and it's because of our portfolio, which is really a central part of our strategy and a key differentiating factor for most of our peers. 
And third, we certainly took very important strategic steps during the quarter. You got further omissions that are a little, profitable long-term growth our shareholders.

Winter is difficult for us in Canada and unfortunately, it's difficult for us in the central region because we've got one of the more severe freezes that we've had through that part of our portfolio in the first quarter. So a lot of costs with respect to activities to start production again is part of those costs and the other thing is to be honest with you, our production was down a little bit and one of the major culprits was because we are in a CS3 a production sharing agreement in Egypt and the bedside of is all prices go up come in the downside of it is we see less production which cost us about 5000 barrels a day in Egypt. And gross operated was actually up. But overall, I don't think the cost side of it is going to get out of line. On the steel prices, that's certainly going to have an impact and I'm sure everyone's over the steel prices are going up.

Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations f",823,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations front and mention two highlights. Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil development projects in Australia have now achieved maximum production ahead of what we forecasted for the year. This is an important step forward in the delivery of the large and visible pipeline of organic growth projects in our international region. 
In the North America, we ramped up the development of two large resource plays, the Horn River and the Granite Wash. We're going to drill over 60 gross wells this year in these two plays and expect to exit the year with net production of around 175 million a day. The Granite Wash is a liquid rich relative to most other large resource plays in North America, which gives big impact on economics. It's also differentiated by the acreage position we hold because it is primarily held by production. 
In the Horn River, the quality of the rock and the development efficiencies certainly differentiates it. We can achieve those through large drilling pads on continuous ground acreage. In addition, as we progress our Kitimat LNG project, our goal is to give Horn River access to international LNG markets. These are just a couple of the highlights on the operations side, and Rod and John will go over more on this as we go, which is really shows that organic growth engine is stronger than it's ever been. 
Going into 2010, we truly expected first quarter to be slow relative to the sequence of being of the quarters and production growth to accelerate from there and that's exactly what you see reflected on our numbers. Production ramped up throughout the quarter with March actual production coming in at 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared to our average for the quarter of 585,000 barrels a day. And we consider our 5% to 10% organic growth production outlook remains unchanged. 
Secondly, on the financial front, the highlights really is that we have the best quarter since 2008, both in terms of earnings and cash flow. This has been driven by our portfolio balance, and I can't say enough how important it is for our portfolio to be balanced between oil and gas, and then within gas, to have a good mix of both North American and international gas. Not only it's an important but frankly, at our size, it's pretty much impossible to replicate for companies that did not make that balanced growth choices that we've made over the last several years in getting to this position. 
And thirdly on the strategic front, we have taken three very important steps so far in 2010. A merger with Mariner Energy, which we announced after the quarter closed, will give Apache a new growth platform in the deepwater. Mariner gives us critical mass, experience and opportunities set that we want in this area and Apache's resources will enhance the value creation potential of this platform. 
In addition, Mariner gives us a rich opportunity inventory in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and also in the Permian Basin. The asset fit is excellent. The cultural fit is outstanding. And we're working diligently with Mariner's team to progress the merger and are very much looking forward to welcoming them officially onboard as Apache. 
Separately, the Devon offshore property transaction gives us yet another high-quality inventory set in the core region, with very attractive returns and frankly, I can't say that we know of anyone that can generate the reserves and value better than we can. The third strategic development that took place during the quarter that Apache became operator is the Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada. We've discussed that opportunity with you on our earnings call in February. But I'd note that just like Deepwater, LNG is a big step forward for Apache. It enables us to monetize very large gas resources, at LNG prices, which are generally linked to crude oil prices and gives us a large stable production and cash profile to complement our portfolio. 
Instead of following the pack, we certainly picked our own timing and direction in taking each of these steps. Looking back, I can reminisce going into Egypt in 1995, going into the North Sea in 2003 and going into Australia in 1993. All were important steps for us. And all of them were very much against the sector consensus at the time but which have created great value for our shareholders. And we're confident that the steps that we've taken in the first quarter will be looked back on in the same vein, and will provide meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum who will discuss North America."
169838,104540805,60608,"Apache Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gul",2099,"Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gulf Coast and Central regions were the primary factors. The ramp up of drilling operation, started in the first quarter after very low activity level in 2009, will arrest that drop for the second quarter. 
The Gulf Coast region production for the first quarter averaged just under 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Production gains of almost 6,000 barrels equivalent were experienced from additional hurricane repairs and resumption of the service of the Sea Robin Pipeline. However, these gains were offset by natural declines and again, the third-party host platform and pipeline issues during the quarter. 
The first quarter drilling program in the Gulf Coast has given us a nice start for 2010. We drilled 19 gross wells, of which 14 were successful. Four of those successful wells were exploratory and are now in evaluation and developmental planning stages. Two LLOG-operated Mississippi Canyon 199 wells successfully tested two adjacent fault blocks at our Mandy prospect, and penetrated net oil pay of 161 feet and 109 feet respectively at approximately 6,500-foot PVD. We are now evaluating subsea development plans for these wells and would expect production by mid 2011 with initial rates of around 6,000 barrels per day from each well. Apache has working interest of 15% in this field and Mariner Energy has 35% working interest in the discovery. 
In addition, we were successful with two tests of the N6 M [ph] at our Boomerang Prospect that main pass 308, where we identified 12 feet and 30 feet of net oil pay in the N6 M [ph] in our number one and number one sidetrack wells respectively. Regionally, the N6 M [ph] well is quite prolific with recoveries in the range of 1 million barrels of oil from 10-foot pay sections. 
We are currently mobilizing a rig to drill in a price of well and mainpass 309 to further delineate the reservoir and confirm our platform location for development plans. Initial rates are expected to be around 800 barrels per day per well, with the support of six wells development. First production would be expected in the first half of 2011. Apache operates this bill with 100% working interest. 
Other successful drilling of two wells, the Grand Isle 41 and South Pass 75, as well as the new well at High Island 129, and three new wells on to our producers will have additional production volumes for the second quarter. 
In our Central Region, production averaged 34,600 barrels equivalent per day, down 4% from last quarter. Third-party pipeline downtime and delays in completion of new wells were responsible for the decline. The third-party downtime issues resolved in our backlog of completions being worked off. We expect production to be up by more than 3,000 barrels equivalent in the second quarter. 
As most of you know, horizontal drilling with multiple stage frac stimulations has really improved the potential of the tight formations we typically target in the country United States. Our Central Region controls roughly 1 million gross acres, most of which is held by production. This has provided us with an excellent platform from which we actively and efficiently explore. We've been testing various geologic targets across the region to identify the most prospective acreage for horizontal application. 
Since late last year, the region has tested eight separate horizontal pay intervals within 20 wells over hundreds of square miles. More than a dozen more horizontal formation tests are planned this year. As plans are verified, leasing efforts have commenced. In the past year, 36,000 new gross acres have been leased with 16,000 of those acres being leased in the first quarter of 2010. The Central Region spud 23 wells in the first quarter, of which 13 were horizontal. The region's most active program continues to be the Granite Wash in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. You're all aware that the Granite Wash is a series of liquid-rich tech gas, which underlies some 4,000 square miles of the Anadarko Basin. 
We've been active even in the decades and have only recently ramped up horizontal multi-frac operations. We have now drilled eight horizontal wells, five of which have been completed, as well as have already produced 4 bcf gas at 150,000 barrels of oil. The remaining three are now being completed. Meanwhile, we are expanding the drilling campaign and are currently operating six horizontal Granite Wash rigs. A seventh horizontal rig will be added as well as an additional vertical rig in May. 
At the same time, we have another three rigs targeting other horizontal effects around the region. We are quite enthused about the results of our Cherokee formation activity in Western Oklahoma. For the past several years, Apache has been successful in acquiring acreage and drilling shallow Cherokee formation wells, primarily in Hartford County, Oklahoma, one of the oldest areas of the Anadarko Basin. 
We drilled over 20 vertical oil wells with initial rates typically averaging 100 barrels per day. On those results, we have recently leased more than 11,000 acres and now control over 60,000 acres in the play. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed our first horizontal path in this play. The Rose Hill for 29H after 150 barrels of oil per day from a 38-foot, 100-foot lateral and has held up quite nicely, still producing over 120 barrels per day after two months. 
Our second test, the Bentley 5-5H has to drill over 700 barrels a day from the 4,400-foot lateral and is still producing 530 barrels a day after six weeks. The region has identified more than 30 additional horizontal locations in this play and we expect to maintain at least one horizontal drilling rig in the play for the foreseeable future. 
In East Texas, Apache has been active with two horizontal drilling rigs targeting Bossier Sands since late last year. The region has completed three horizontal tests today. The Folk 6H, that was this year. The Folk 6H tested for 9.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody T-7H [ph] tested for 9.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. And while the Folk 9H tested for a very strong rate of 15.5 million cubic feet gas per day. The Moody 2-8H is currently testing out their frac, an early indications that it will be the strongest well to date.  
As of this morning, it's already flowing at more than 15 million cubic feet of gas per day while still recovering frac water at more than 2,000 barrels per day. We're on a 100% of Moody lease in the lease and 77% of the 12 place [ph]. 
Our new Permian Region is operating independently after the year end spun out from our Central Region. We've been actively recruiting staff from both inside and outside Apache and expect to be fully operational from our newly leased office space in Midland by early July. Permian production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent within 1% of the prior quarter. We expect production to be up slightly for the second quarter. The Permian region drilling program got off to a fast start as well. We're currently operating five rigs, three in New Mexico and two in Texas. During the first quarter, the region drilled 51 wells targeting oil reservoirs in 11 different fields across Permian Basin. All 51 Wells are either completed and on production or will be completed in the near future. 
As in the Central Region, application of horizontal well technology is having a significant impact on our plants. Importantly, we drilled two successful horizontal tests in all waterflood units. The Shafterlike [ph] 606-H well was drilled and completed in the San Andres with a fixed-stage frac stimulation and came on production at the initial rate of nearly 500 barrels of oil per day. The North McElroy 4025-H was drilled and completed in the Grayburg with an eight-stage frac stimulation and tested approximately 200 barrels of oil per day. Both wells initial rates and post-drill reserve estimates were higher than pre-drill estimates. Based on this success, follow-up locations are planned in both fields, where we will test longer laterals and more fracture stimulation stages. 
We're very optimistic about the potential for horizontal drilling throughout the Permian Basin with additional wells planned at TSO South [ph] and Dean units in West Texas, as well as the monument area of southeast new Mexico.  We expect to keep at least one horizontal rig working at the remainder of the year. We also expect to add two additional drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter to expand our traditional low risk bread-and-butter vertical oil well programs. 
During the first quarter, the region also sanctioned Roberts CO2-enhanced recovery expansion and just signed an agreement with Kinder Morgan for the purchase of 38 bcf of CO2 over 10 years. CO2-enhanced recovery will be an important piece to the Permian Region business for a long time given our extensive holdings in the basin. We have already identified 26 of our fields with CO2 enhanced recovery potential. 
In Canada, Canadian production averaged 68,000 barrels equivalent a day, down 5% from the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, extreme weather early in the year caused extensive freeze up across the region and was the primary reason for the drop. We are bringing on production from our winter drilling program and completion operations, which are expected to lead to a 6% increase for the second quarter. The majority of the impact of the Horn River activity will not become evident until the second half of the year. 
Development drilling and our conventional business units totaled 42 wells resulting in 38 producers during the first quarter, with successful gas completions at Zama, Kaybob and Nevis. Oil drilling activity was focused on House Mountain where six new horizontal wells are producing over 1,100 barrels per day. Also an 18-well winter program in our Provost area has delivered good results including one well that tested over 500 barrels of oil per day at our proposed Battle River EOR [Enhanced Oil Recovery] project area. 
Our Horn River activity continues to dominate Canadian operations with horizontal wells were drilled in the two island of late developed area during the quarter with four of the Apache operated 52 pan and three on enhanced and can operated 63 tape. In addition come Apache drilled through horizontal Wells in our ability area to hold expiring acreage. Drilling efficiencies that result in cost performance continued to improve with average drill times now at 19 days from the spud rig release and average drill cost at $3.7 million per well for about 7,200-foot of horizontal section. 
Completion operations on the 16 Wells 70 K-Pad, which was drilled in 2009 commenced in January. We have just finished the amount of frac stimulation project associated with these wells this week. Over the past three and a half months, we have completed 274 frac stimulations on those 16 Wells, accounting more than 500 million barrels of water and an excess of 100 million pounds of sand. The project also involves conducting a huge micro-seismic acquisition program with 82 individual frac stages in over 19,000 individual micro seismic events mapped. This data will be used to optimize frac design, frac spacing and then well spacing on our future pads. 
The first half 16 70-K came on stream on March 29 to start recovering frac load water, and we're now producing around 25 million a day from that pad. The ramp-up has been severely limited due to the space restrictions while the frac spread remain on location. We are presently demobilizing the frac equipment and would expect to have all 16 wells on production by early July. 
Construction of the DeBolt water treatment facility ramped up in the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early May. While it is not available for our 70-K Pad program, utilization of this water supply will ultimately reduce the volumes of fresh water used for frac stimulation purposes and the associated costs for water transportation. Steve mentioned the Kitimat operation during the first quarter, we have now received feed proposals from four parties and we're under technical evaluation. We would expect to award fees sometime or the next month and a half, two months. 
And that's all I have. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob Eichler."

During the first quarter, production from Apache's international operations was 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 2% increase over fourth quarter 2009. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and successful commission of oil developments in Australia. In Egypt, net production was 151,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 5% from fourth quarter due to higher oil prices and lower recoverable costs resulting in lower cost recovery barrels. By contrast, gross fuel per day increased 3,000 barrels a day or 1% from 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Exploration activity continued stronger in the quarter with operations being conducted on five free seismic surveys representing nearly 3,000 square kilometers average. Oil activity increased during the quarter with a total of 48 wells, reaching total debt including 10 exploration wells. The region heads for the quarter with 20 after drilling rigs operating and the success rate for Apache-operated exploration wells was 67%. 
Exploration appraisal drilling was largely focused in our expanding Faghur Basin oil play, where four plays tested in a combined rate of 12,000 barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of gas per day from AEB reservoir. 18 well remain to drilled in the basin this year including non-exploration wells. Development of the Phiops field of the east end of Faghur Basin continued with Phiops-8 well, which encountered 124 net feet of pay and multiple AEB sands. The initial completion, AEB 3E sand tested at 4,500 barrels of oil per day and no water. Construction is during completion on the West Kalansha facility project, which will increase the export capacity of our Faghur Basin facilities from the current 11,000 barrels of oil per day to 20,000 barrels per day by midyear. 
Extension of the Malaha accrual pipeline and completion of the chain of infrastructure upgrades will further produce Apache's Faghur Basin production capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day, which we should be able to fill up by year end. Notable drilling results were also achieved in the Jade field discovered by Apache in 2007 on a Matruh development lease. The Jade-8 well was completed in AEB 3E put on production this 10th of March. In its current report, the Salam gas plant at the rate of 3,100 barrels condensate per day and 32 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Jade-10 well is drilled in that quest of Jade structure and tested 3,100 barrels of oil per day with no water from the AEB 3E. Additional field wells are planned in 2010 to accelerate this oil development. To date, the Jade field has produced 47 Bcf and 4.5 million barrels of oil and condensate and presently produces 107 million cubic feet of gas per day and 12,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day. 
Apache has 100% contract interest for all the previously referenced wells. 
In Australia, net production was 61,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 40% increase over fourth quarter and double the rate for first quarter of 2009. Gas production increased by 1% from fourth quarter while oil production nearly tripled. The substantial increase in net oil production from 9,900 barrels of oil per day to 27,000 barrels per day was due to successful commissioning of the of Van Gogh and Pyrenees development projects. Their region also benefited from the absence of cyclones in the first quarter compared to three cyclones and storm production eruptions for the same period of 2009. 
At the Van Gogh oil project, which Apache operates for 52.5% working interest, the Ningaloo Vision FPSO arrived on location and following a five-week commissioning period, the field commenced production on February 13. Well performance has been excellent with oil wells tested above 10,000 barrels of oil per day on Cleo [ph]. Production peaked at 72,200 barrels of oil per day gross in March, and averaged 66,000 barrels of oil per day gross or 34,700 barrels a day net in the last week of the quarter. To date, the field has produced 3.4 million barrels of oil or 1.8 million barrels net. 
Nearby, BHP Billiton operated Pyrenees FPSO development in which Apache has a 28.6% working interest commenced production February 24.  Production ramped up quickly to 90,000 barrels a day gross from the seven WA-42 L permit wells with six wells remain to be completed on the adjacent WA-43 L permit in which Apache has a 31.5% working interest. To date, Pyrenees field has produced 4.4 million barrels of oil gross and 1.3 million barrels net for Apache. These high initial rates for both fields are essentially flush production as we commission the facilities and we expect the region's net oil production to average 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for the year. 
Work is progressing in our Devil Creek Reindeer development project in which Apache is the operator with 55% working interest. Gas plant in both Earthworks were sort of completed in the first quarter and several works commenced. The first shipment of the Thailand fabricated gas plant hyperact modules arrived on site and installation in progress. The onshore pipeline from the beach crossing to the gas plant and the horizontal directional-drilling operations on the beach was started. Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform deck is underway in China. The project is on schedule for postproduction in third quarter 2011. Also during the first quarter, four Apache-operated wells reached TD yield in two trend exploration dry holes and two successful appraisal wells on Australia's North Sea shell. The Julimar Southwest 1 and Southwest 2 how much Apache has a 65% working interest were drilled in a single surface location to confirm productivity of the Mungaroo formation in the southern part of the Julimar horse block. Both wells are part of the Julimar-Brunello development component of the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project. 
In the North Sea, production averaged 58,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 2% for the fourth quarter. 32,000 barrels of oil per day average for the quarter was added to new drilling where we lost 1,800 barrels a day from mechanical failures, unplanned events in normal times. At the end of the quarter, seven development wells and five pilot holes were drilled and completed. Notably, the Forties Alpha 15A 53W [ph] in the Forties Charlie 24 C - 44 Y [ph] development wells tested 3,031 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The field development plan for the mall field, a new field using oil discovery made by Apache in the fourth quarter has been proved by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. First oil expected late in the second quarter of 2010. The field has qualified as a small field development yielding up to 75 million pounds earning a supplement corporation tax breaks as well as exemption from the petroleum revenue tax. 
In Argentina, net production was 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 8% from the fourth quarter. The normal decline as well as mechanical and other related downtime in Neuquén fields pushed oil production down while gas production separate from lower than normal residential seasonal demand and lower demand by power generation customers from increased hydroelectric power capability, availability all result in increased gas, injection and shutting gas wells throughout the first quarter. In total, we reinjected close to 4 million cubic feet of gas per day net more than in the first quarter compared to previous quarter. 
Regions shallow [ph] program however was very successful in the first quarter, with 10 wells drilled with no dry hole adding net reserves is 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the shallow drilling program in the Neuquén Basin three successful wells were drilled at a gross production of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas per day and 335 barrels of oil per day from Centenario and Cuyo reservoirs. All three wells are drilled at depths of only 4,000 feet. An additional 16 Wells are planned for this year. Also the Neuquén Basin, four successful wells are drilled as part of the Gas Plus program. Three wells in EFO field have been completed in the Lajas the depth 11,500 feet and our production can combined rate of 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day or 108 barrels of currency per day after multizone stimulated completions. If fourth well, the EFO 109, encountered 328 feet of net pay in the Lajas, it is being completed and frac is stimulated in six zones. Those are currently cleaning up after frac of the first three zones at a rate of 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Based on the quality of paying [ph] and the results of the first three zone the EFO 109 is expected to produce over 500 million cubic feet of gas per day and 125 barrels of condensate per day. 
Eight additional wells are planned in EFO field to develop gas volumes for the Gas Plus contracts that is currently being negotiated to provide 15 million cubic feet of gas per day at a price of $5 per million BTU on January 1, 2011. 10 additional wells in AC and Ronaco fields will also be drilled this year to support the Gas Plus program. Apache operates the reference Neuquén Basin wells and fields with 100% working interest.

Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million or $2.08 per share were 21% higher than the prior quarter and our highest since third quarter of '08. Adjusted for the impact of FX on our deferred tax balances, earnings totaled $712 million or $2.10 a share. Cash flow from operations for us $1.5 billion also for the first time since third quarter of '08. Apache's substantial oil and liquid production base was the primary driver behind our results. Highland liquids represented half of our equivalent production but generated nearly 3/4 of revenue, and are principally responsible for our revenue rising $118 million sequentially to $2.7 billion. 
Long before the current industries stampede began oil exposure, Apache took deliberate steps to achieve a balanced production mix. As a result, we're already benefiting from a current 20 to 1 multiple in the price of oil versus gas. And we are ramping up activity on the oil side of our portfolio. In the first quarter, for example, Van Gogh and Pyrenees enabled Apache's lower production to rise 3% sequentially, nearly offsetting a 4% temporary decline in gas production. I would note that absent the impact of higher prices had on both price-sensitive volumes in Egypt and to a lesser extent in Canada, on a production volumes, would've been up slightly and pretty much spot on our first quarter plan. A few quick comments on costs, cash costs excluding taxes other than income, came in at $11.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, impacted by slightly lower production. Rising future productions should drive us toward our goals to match 2009's average of $11.25 per boe. 
You're maybe wondering about the potential impact of our recently announced transactions on 2010. Because it so much depends on exactly when the transactions closed. The precise impact is difficult to measure but here's some broad indicators. Absent the exercise of preferential purchase rate, which covers some 7,500 barrels equivalent per day, Apache is picking up 19,000 barrels equivalent per day from Devon and another 63,000 with Mariner. A combined 82,000 equivalent barrels per day represents 14% of Apache's first quarter worldwide production. With respect to the financial 2010 impact, assuming Devin closes in early June and Mariner late in the third quarter, 2010 average volumes should rise around 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 4% to 5% from these transactions alone. Now this is over and above our earlier production growth target of 5% to 10% growth pre-acquisitions. 
I would note that for the last couple of years, Apache chose to build cash rather than pursue transactions of size in what was generally considered a profiting market. Net cash was in fact pent-up growth potential that is now being put to work and will benefit all key per share metrics over the next several years. While we potentially took up 14% more production, share count rises just 5%, resulting in accretion to per-share earnings, cash flow, production and reserves in the first full year of ownership. 
The bottom line is our outlook for growth is excellent. I would also note that in our two recent deals, about 60% of combined production is gas. Approximately 60% of the revenue is generated from oil and liquids. There's also a deep inventory of future development projects as well as exploration prospects that are oil. 
One final note on our balance sheet, while the combined transactions totaled $5 billion, our financial flexibility remains intact. Approximately $2 billion at consideration is equity and we will also tap a significant portion of our $2.1 billion of cash balances to close these deals. By year-end, debt cash should be below 25% and cash balances above $1 billion, leaving us in excellent position to continue to carry out Apache's growth strategy.

I'd like to sum up what I think were the three main messages from all the information that we shared with you on this call. 
First, we had a very good quarter operationally. As you heard mentioned few times Van Gogh and Pyrenees have ramped up. Our organic growth engine as strong as ever and our organic growth production's expectations for the year remain at 5% to 10%. 
Secondly, we have had a very good quarter from a financial perspective, with the highest earnings and cash flow since 2008. We achieved this in spite of a weak price environment from North American gas and it's because of our portfolio, which is really a central part of our strategy and a key differentiating factor for most of our peers. 
And third, we certainly took very important strategic steps during the quarter. You got further omissions that are a little, profitable long-term growth our shareholders. We picked our own timing and direction. And we're very excited about the growth and value creation potential by the Mariner merger, the Devon offshore acquisition and our Kitimat LNG project. 
And with that, we're ready to take your questions."

So a lot of costs with respect to activities to start production again is part of those costs and the other thing is to be honest with you, our production was down a little bit and one of the major culprits was because we are in a CS3 a production sharing agreement in Egypt and the bedside of is all prices go up come in the downside of it is we see less production which cost us about 5000 barrels a day in Egypt. And gross operated was actually up. But overall, I don't think the cost side of it is going to get out of line.

Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations f",823,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations front and mention two highlights. Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil development projects in Australia have now achieved maximum production ahead of what we forecasted for the year. This is an important step forward in the delivery of the large and visible pipeline of organic growth projects in our international region. 
In the North America, we ramped up the development of two large resource plays, the Horn River and the Granite Wash. We're going to drill over 60 gross wells this year in these two plays and expect to exit the year with net production of around 175 million a day. The Granite Wash is a liquid rich relative to most other large resource plays in North America, which gives big impact on economics. It's also differentiated by the acreage position we hold because it is primarily held by production. 
In the Horn River, the quality of the rock and the development efficiencies certainly differentiates it. We can achieve those through large drilling pads on continuous ground acreage. In addition, as we progress our Kitimat LNG project, our goal is to give Horn River access to international LNG markets. These are just a couple of the highlights on the operations side, and Rod and John will go over more on this as we go, which is really shows that organic growth engine is stronger than it's ever been. 
Going into 2010, we truly expected first quarter to be slow relative to the sequence of being of the quarters and production growth to accelerate from there and that's exactly what you see reflected on our numbers. Production ramped up throughout the quarter with March actual production coming in at 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared to our average for the quarter of 585,000 barrels a day. And we consider our 5% to 10% organic growth production outlook remains unchanged. 
Secondly, on the financial front, the highlights really is that we have the best quarter since 2008, both in terms of earnings and cash flow. This has been driven by our portfolio balance, and I can't say enough how important it is for our portfolio to be balanced between oil and gas, and then within gas, to have a good mix of both North American and international gas. Not only it's an important but frankly, at our size, it's pretty much impossible to replicate for companies that did not make that balanced growth choices that we've made over the last several years in getting to this position. 
And thirdly on the strategic front, we have taken three very important steps so far in 2010. A merger with Mariner Energy, which we announced after the quarter closed, will give Apache a new growth platform in the deepwater. Mariner gives us critical mass, experience and opportunities set that we want in this area and Apache's resources will enhance the value creation potential of this platform. 
In addition, Mariner gives us a rich opportunity inventory in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and also in the Permian Basin. The asset fit is excellent. The cultural fit is outstanding. And we're working diligently with Mariner's team to progress the merger and are very much looking forward to welcoming them officially onboard as Apache. 
Separately, the Devon offshore property transaction gives us yet another high-quality inventory set in the core region, with very attractive returns and frankly, I can't say that we know of anyone that can generate the reserves and value better than we can. The third strategic development that took place during the quarter that Apache became operator is the Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada. We've discussed that opportunity with you on our earnings call in February. But I'd note that just like Deepwater, LNG is a big step forward for Apache. It enables us to monetize very large gas resources, at LNG prices, which are generally linked to crude oil prices and gives us a large stable production and cash profile to complement our portfolio. 
Instead of following the pack, we certainly picked our own timing and direction in taking each of these steps. Looking back, I can reminisce going into Egypt in 1995, going into the North Sea in 2003 and going into Australia in 1993. All were important steps for us. And all of them were very much against the sector consensus at the time but which have created great value for our shareholders. And we're confident that the steps that we've taken in the first quarter will be looked back on in the same vein, and will provide meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum who will discuss North America."
169838,104540805,60612,"Apache Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gul",2099,"Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gulf Coast and Central regions were the primary factors. The ramp up of drilling operation, started in the first quarter after very low activity level in 2009, will arrest that drop for the second quarter. 
The Gulf Coast region production for the first quarter averaged just under 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Production gains of almost 6,000 barrels equivalent were experienced from additional hurricane repairs and resumption of the service of the Sea Robin Pipeline. However, these gains were offset by natural declines and again, the third-party host platform and pipeline issues during the quarter. 
The first quarter drilling program in the Gulf Coast has given us a nice start for 2010. We drilled 19 gross wells, of which 14 were successful. Four of those successful wells were exploratory and are now in evaluation and developmental planning stages. Two LLOG-operated Mississippi Canyon 199 wells successfully tested two adjacent fault blocks at our Mandy prospect, and penetrated net oil pay of 161 feet and 109 feet respectively at approximately 6,500-foot PVD. We are now evaluating subsea development plans for these wells and would expect production by mid 2011 with initial rates of around 6,000 barrels per day from each well. Apache has working interest of 15% in this field and Mariner Energy has 35% working interest in the discovery. 
In addition, we were successful with two tests of the N6 M [ph] at our Boomerang Prospect that main pass 308, where we identified 12 feet and 30 feet of net oil pay in the N6 M [ph] in our number one and number one sidetrack wells respectively. Regionally, the N6 M [ph] well is quite prolific with recoveries in the range of 1 million barrels of oil from 10-foot pay sections. 
We are currently mobilizing a rig to drill in a price of well and mainpass 309 to further delineate the reservoir and confirm our platform location for development plans. Initial rates are expected to be around 800 barrels per day per well, with the support of six wells development. First production would be expected in the first half of 2011. Apache operates this bill with 100% working interest. 
Other successful drilling of two wells, the Grand Isle 41 and South Pass 75, as well as the new well at High Island 129, and three new wells on to our producers will have additional production volumes for the second quarter. 
In our Central Region, production averaged 34,600 barrels equivalent per day, down 4% from last quarter. Third-party pipeline downtime and delays in completion of new wells were responsible for the decline. The third-party downtime issues resolved in our backlog of completions being worked off. We expect production to be up by more than 3,000 barrels equivalent in the second quarter. 
As most of you know, horizontal drilling with multiple stage frac stimulations has really improved the potential of the tight formations we typically target in the country United States. Our Central Region controls roughly 1 million gross acres, most of which is held by production. This has provided us with an excellent platform from which we actively and efficiently explore. We've been testing various geologic targets across the region to identify the most prospective acreage for horizontal application. 
Since late last year, the region has tested eight separate horizontal pay intervals within 20 wells over hundreds of square miles. More than a dozen more horizontal formation tests are planned this year. As plans are verified, leasing efforts have commenced. In the past year, 36,000 new gross acres have been leased with 16,000 of those acres being leased in the first quarter of 2010. The Central Region spud 23 wells in the first quarter, of which 13 were horizontal. The region's most active program continues to be the Granite Wash in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. You're all aware that the Granite Wash is a series of liquid-rich tech gas, which underlies some 4,000 square miles of the Anadarko Basin. 
We've been active even in the decades and have only recently ramped up horizontal multi-frac operations. We have now drilled eight horizontal wells, five of which have been completed, as well as have already produced 4 bcf gas at 150,000 barrels of oil. The remaining three are now being completed. Meanwhile, we are expanding the drilling campaign and are currently operating six horizontal Granite Wash rigs. A seventh horizontal rig will be added as well as an additional vertical rig in May. 
At the same time, we have another three rigs targeting other horizontal effects around the region. We are quite enthused about the results of our Cherokee formation activity in Western Oklahoma. For the past several years, Apache has been successful in acquiring acreage and drilling shallow Cherokee formation wells, primarily in Hartford County, Oklahoma, one of the oldest areas of the Anadarko Basin. 
We drilled over 20 vertical oil wells with initial rates typically averaging 100 barrels per day. On those results, we have recently leased more than 11,000 acres and now control over 60,000 acres in the play. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed our first horizontal path in this play. The Rose Hill for 29H after 150 barrels of oil per day from a 38-foot, 100-foot lateral and has held up quite nicely, still producing over 120 barrels per day after two months. 
Our second test, the Bentley 5-5H has to drill over 700 barrels a day from the 4,400-foot lateral and is still producing 530 barrels a day after six weeks. The region has identified more than 30 additional horizontal locations in this play and we expect to maintain at least one horizontal drilling rig in the play for the foreseeable future. 
In East Texas, Apache has been active with two horizontal drilling rigs targeting Bossier Sands since late last year. The region has completed three horizontal tests today. The Folk 6H, that was this year. The Folk 6H tested for 9.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody T-7H [ph] tested for 9.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. And while the Folk 9H tested for a very strong rate of 15.5 million cubic feet gas per day. The Moody 2-8H is currently testing out their frac, an early indications that it will be the strongest well to date.  
As of this morning, it's already flowing at more than 15 million cubic feet of gas per day while still recovering frac water at more than 2,000 barrels per day. We're on a 100% of Moody lease in the lease and 77% of the 12 place [ph]. 
Our new Permian Region is operating independently after the year end spun out from our Central Region. We've been actively recruiting staff from both inside and outside Apache and expect to be fully operational from our newly leased office space in Midland by early July. Permian production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent within 1% of the prior quarter. We expect production to be up slightly for the second quarter. The Permian region drilling program got off to a fast start as well. We're currently operating five rigs, three in New Mexico and two in Texas. During the first quarter, the region drilled 51 wells targeting oil reservoirs in 11 different fields across Permian Basin. All 51 Wells are either completed and on production or will be completed in the near future. 
As in the Central Region, application of horizontal well technology is having a significant impact on our plants. Importantly, we drilled two successful horizontal tests in all waterflood units. The Shafterlike [ph] 606-H well was drilled and completed in the San Andres with a fixed-stage frac stimulation and came on production at the initial rate of nearly 500 barrels of oil per day. The North McElroy 4025-H was drilled and completed in the Grayburg with an eight-stage frac stimulation and tested approximately 200 barrels of oil per day. Both wells initial rates and post-drill reserve estimates were higher than pre-drill estimates. Based on this success, follow-up locations are planned in both fields, where we will test longer laterals and more fracture stimulation stages. 
We're very optimistic about the potential for horizontal drilling throughout the Permian Basin with additional wells planned at TSO South [ph] and Dean units in West Texas, as well as the monument area of southeast new Mexico.  We expect to keep at least one horizontal rig working at the remainder of the year. We also expect to add two additional drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter to expand our traditional low risk bread-and-butter vertical oil well programs. 
During the first quarter, the region also sanctioned Roberts CO2-enhanced recovery expansion and just signed an agreement with Kinder Morgan for the purchase of 38 bcf of CO2 over 10 years. CO2-enhanced recovery will be an important piece to the Permian Region business for a long time given our extensive holdings in the basin. We have already identified 26 of our fields with CO2 enhanced recovery potential. 
In Canada, Canadian production averaged 68,000 barrels equivalent a day, down 5% from the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, extreme weather early in the year caused extensive freeze up across the region and was the primary reason for the drop. We are bringing on production from our winter drilling program and completion operations, which are expected to lead to a 6% increase for the second quarter. The majority of the impact of the Horn River activity will not become evident until the second half of the year. 
Development drilling and our conventional business units totaled 42 wells resulting in 38 producers during the first quarter, with successful gas completions at Zama, Kaybob and Nevis. Oil drilling activity was focused on House Mountain where six new horizontal wells are producing over 1,100 barrels per day. Also an 18-well winter program in our Provost area has delivered good results including one well that tested over 500 barrels of oil per day at our proposed Battle River EOR [Enhanced Oil Recovery] project area. 
Our Horn River activity continues to dominate Canadian operations with horizontal wells were drilled in the two island of late developed area during the quarter with four of the Apache operated 52 pan and three on enhanced and can operated 63 tape. In addition come Apache drilled through horizontal Wells in our ability area to hold expiring acreage. Drilling efficiencies that result in cost performance continued to improve with average drill times now at 19 days from the spud rig release and average drill cost at $3.7 million per well for about 7,200-foot of horizontal section. 
Completion operations on the 16 Wells 70 K-Pad, which was drilled in 2009 commenced in January. We have just finished the amount of frac stimulation project associated with these wells this week. Over the past three and a half months, we have completed 274 frac stimulations on those 16 Wells, accounting more than 500 million barrels of water and an excess of 100 million pounds of sand. The project also involves conducting a huge micro-seismic acquisition program with 82 individual frac stages in over 19,000 individual micro seismic events mapped. This data will be used to optimize frac design, frac spacing and then well spacing on our future pads. 
The first half 16 70-K came on stream on March 29 to start recovering frac load water, and we're now producing around 25 million a day from that pad. The ramp-up has been severely limited due to the space restrictions while the frac spread remain on location. We are presently demobilizing the frac equipment and would expect to have all 16 wells on production by early July. 
Construction of the DeBolt water treatment facility ramped up in the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early May. While it is not available for our 70-K Pad program, utilization of this water supply will ultimately reduce the volumes of fresh water used for frac stimulation purposes and the associated costs for water transportation. Steve mentioned the Kitimat operation during the first quarter, we have now received feed proposals from four parties and we're under technical evaluation. We would expect to award fees sometime or the next month and a half, two months. 
And that's all I have. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob Eichler."

During the first quarter, production from Apache's international operations was 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 2% increase over fourth quarter 2009. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and successful commission of oil developments in Australia. In Egypt, net production was 151,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 5% from fourth quarter due to higher oil prices and lower recoverable costs resulting in lower cost recovery barrels. By contrast, gross fuel per day increased 3,000 barrels a day or 1% from 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Exploration activity continued stronger in the quarter with operations being conducted on five free seismic surveys representing nearly 3,000 square kilometers average. Oil activity increased during the quarter with a total of 48 wells, reaching total debt including 10 exploration wells. The region heads for the quarter with 20 after drilling rigs operating and the success rate for Apache-operated exploration wells was 67%. 
Exploration appraisal drilling was largely focused in our expanding Faghur Basin oil play, where four plays tested in a combined rate of 12,000 barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of gas per day from AEB reservoir. 18 well remain to drilled in the basin this year including non-exploration wells. Development of the Phiops field of the east end of Faghur Basin continued with Phiops-8 well, which encountered 124 net feet of pay and multiple AEB sands. The initial completion, AEB 3E sand tested at 4,500 barrels of oil per day and no water. Construction is during completion on the West Kalansha facility project, which will increase the export capacity of our Faghur Basin facilities from the current 11,000 barrels of oil per day to 20,000 barrels per day by midyear. 
Extension of the Malaha accrual pipeline and completion of the chain of infrastructure upgrades will further produce Apache's Faghur Basin production capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day, which we should be able to fill up by year end. Notable drilling results were also achieved in the Jade field discovered by Apache in 2007 on a Matruh development lease. The Jade-8 well was completed in AEB 3E put on production this 10th of March. In its current report, the Salam gas plant at the rate of 3,100 barrels condensate per day and 32 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Jade-10 well is drilled in that quest of Jade structure and tested 3,100 barrels of oil per day with no water from the AEB 3E. Additional field wells are planned in 2010 to accelerate this oil development. To date, the Jade field has produced 47 Bcf and 4.5 million barrels of oil and condensate and presently produces 107 million cubic feet of gas per day and 12,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day. 
Apache has 100% contract interest for all the previously referenced wells. 
In Australia, net production was 61,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 40% increase over fourth quarter and double the rate for first quarter of 2009. Gas production increased by 1% from fourth quarter while oil production nearly tripled. The substantial increase in net oil production from 9,900 barrels of oil per day to 27,000 barrels per day was due to successful commissioning of the of Van Gogh and Pyrenees development projects. Their region also benefited from the absence of cyclones in the first quarter compared to three cyclones and storm production eruptions for the same period of 2009. 
At the Van Gogh oil project, which Apache operates for 52.5% working interest, the Ningaloo Vision FPSO arrived on location and following a five-week commissioning period, the field commenced production on February 13. Well performance has been excellent with oil wells tested above 10,000 barrels of oil per day on Cleo [ph]. Production peaked at 72,200 barrels of oil per day gross in March, and averaged 66,000 barrels of oil per day gross or 34,700 barrels a day net in the last week of the quarter. To date, the field has produced 3.4 million barrels of oil or 1.8 million barrels net. 
Nearby, BHP Billiton operated Pyrenees FPSO development in which Apache has a 28.6% working interest commenced production February 24.  Production ramped up quickly to 90,000 barrels a day gross from the seven WA-42 L permit wells with six wells remain to be completed on the adjacent WA-43 L permit in which Apache has a 31.5% working interest. To date, Pyrenees field has produced 4.4 million barrels of oil gross and 1.3 million barrels net for Apache. These high initial rates for both fields are essentially flush production as we commission the facilities and we expect the region's net oil production to average 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for the year. 
Work is progressing in our Devil Creek Reindeer development project in which Apache is the operator with 55% working interest. Gas plant in both Earthworks were sort of completed in the first quarter and several works commenced. The first shipment of the Thailand fabricated gas plant hyperact modules arrived on site and installation in progress. The onshore pipeline from the beach crossing to the gas plant and the horizontal directional-drilling operations on the beach was started. Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform deck is underway in China. The project is on schedule for postproduction in third quarter 2011. Also during the first quarter, four Apache-operated wells reached TD yield in two trend exploration dry holes and two successful appraisal wells on Australia's North Sea shell. The Julimar Southwest 1 and Southwest 2 how much Apache has a 65% working interest were drilled in a single surface location to confirm productivity of the Mungaroo formation in the southern part of the Julimar horse block. Both wells are part of the Julimar-Brunello development component of the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project. 
In the North Sea, production averaged 58,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 2% for the fourth quarter. 32,000 barrels of oil per day average for the quarter was added to new drilling where we lost 1,800 barrels a day from mechanical failures, unplanned events in normal times. At the end of the quarter, seven development wells and five pilot holes were drilled and completed. Notably, the Forties Alpha 15A 53W [ph] in the Forties Charlie 24 C - 44 Y [ph] development wells tested 3,031 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The field development plan for the mall field, a new field using oil discovery made by Apache in the fourth quarter has been proved by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. First oil expected late in the second quarter of 2010. The field has qualified as a small field development yielding up to 75 million pounds earning a supplement corporation tax breaks as well as exemption from the petroleum revenue tax. 
In Argentina, net production was 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 8% from the fourth quarter. The normal decline as well as mechanical and other related downtime in Neuquén fields pushed oil production down while gas production separate from lower than normal residential seasonal demand and lower demand by power generation customers from increased hydroelectric power capability, availability all result in increased gas, injection and shutting gas wells throughout the first quarter. In total, we reinjected close to 4 million cubic feet of gas per day net more than in the first quarter compared to previous quarter. 
Regions shallow [ph] program however was very successful in the first quarter, with 10 wells drilled with no dry hole adding net reserves is 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the shallow drilling program in the Neuquén Basin three successful wells were drilled at a gross production of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas per day and 335 barrels of oil per day from Centenario and Cuyo reservoirs. All three wells are drilled at depths of only 4,000 feet. An additional 16 Wells are planned for this year. Also the Neuquén Basin, four successful wells are drilled as part of the Gas Plus program. Three wells in EFO field have been completed in the Lajas the depth 11,500 feet and our production can combined rate of 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day or 108 barrels of currency per day after multizone stimulated completions. If fourth well, the EFO 109, encountered 328 feet of net pay in the Lajas, it is being completed and frac is stimulated in six zones. Those are currently cleaning up after frac of the first three zones at a rate of 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Based on the quality of paying [ph] and the results of the first three zone the EFO 109 is expected to produce over 500 million cubic feet of gas per day and 125 barrels of condensate per day. 
Eight additional wells are planned in EFO field to develop gas volumes for the Gas Plus contracts that is currently being negotiated to provide 15 million cubic feet of gas per day at a price of $5 per million BTU on January 1, 2011. 10 additional wells in AC and Ronaco fields will also be drilled this year to support the Gas Plus program. Apache operates the reference Neuquén Basin wells and fields with 100% working interest. 
Now let's turn the presentation over to Roger Plank for the finance."
169838,104540805,60612,"Apache Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million o",662,"Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million or $2.08 per share were 21% higher than the prior quarter and our highest since third quarter of '08. Adjusted for the impact of FX on our deferred tax balances, earnings totaled $712 million or $2.10 a share. Cash flow from operations for us $1.5 billion also for the first time since third quarter of '08. Apache's substantial oil and liquid production base was the primary driver behind our results. Highland liquids represented half of our equivalent production but generated nearly 3/4 of revenue, and are principally responsible for our revenue rising $118 million sequentially to $2.7 billion. 
Long before the current industries stampede began oil exposure, Apache took deliberate steps to achieve a balanced production mix. As a result, we're already benefiting from a current 20 to 1 multiple in the price of oil versus gas. And we are ramping up activity on the oil side of our portfolio. In the first quarter, for example, Van Gogh and Pyrenees enabled Apache's lower production to rise 3% sequentially, nearly offsetting a 4% temporary decline in gas production. I would note that absent the impact of higher prices had on both price-sensitive volumes in Egypt and to a lesser extent in Canada, on a production volumes, would've been up slightly and pretty much spot on our first quarter plan. A few quick comments on costs, cash costs excluding taxes other than income, came in at $11.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, impacted by slightly lower production. Rising future productions should drive us toward our goals to match 2009's average of $11.25 per boe. 
You're maybe wondering about the potential impact of our recently announced transactions on 2010. Because it so much depends on exactly when the transactions closed. The precise impact is difficult to measure but here's some broad indicators. Absent the exercise of preferential purchase rate, which covers some 7,500 barrels equivalent per day, Apache is picking up 19,000 barrels equivalent per day from Devon and another 63,000 with Mariner. A combined 82,000 equivalent barrels per day represents 14% of Apache's first quarter worldwide production. With respect to the financial 2010 impact, assuming Devin closes in early June and Mariner late in the third quarter, 2010 average volumes should rise around 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 4% to 5% from these transactions alone. Now this is over and above our earlier production growth target of 5% to 10% growth pre-acquisitions. 
I would note that for the last couple of years, Apache chose to build cash rather than pursue transactions of size in what was generally considered a profiting market. Net cash was in fact pent-up growth potential that is now being put to work and will benefit all key per share metrics over the next several years. While we potentially took up 14% more production, share count rises just 5%, resulting in accretion to per-share earnings, cash flow, production and reserves in the first full year of ownership. 
The bottom line is our outlook for growth is excellent. I would also note that in our two recent deals, about 60% of combined production is gas. Approximately 60% of the revenue is generated from oil and liquids. There's also a deep inventory of future development projects as well as exploration prospects that are oil. 
One final note on our balance sheet, while the combined transactions totaled $5 billion, our financial flexibility remains intact. Approximately $2 billion at consideration is equity and we will also tap a significant portion of our $2.1 billion of cash balances to close these deals. By year-end, debt cash should be below 25% and cash balances above $1 billion, leaving us in excellent position to continue to carry out Apache's growth strategy.

I'd like to sum up what I think were the three main messages from all the information that we shared with you on this call. 
First, we had a very good quarter operationally. As you heard mentioned few times Van Gogh and Pyrenees have ramped up. Our organic growth engine as strong as ever and our organic growth production's expectations for the year remain at 5% to 10%. 
Secondly, we have had a very good quarter from a financial perspective, with the highest earnings and cash flow since 2008. We achieved this in spite of a weak price environment from North American gas and it's because of our portfolio, which is really a central part of our strategy and a key differentiating factor for most of our peers. 
And third, we certainly took very important strategic steps during the quarter. You got further omissions that are a little, profitable long-term growth our shareholders. We picked our own timing and direction. And we're very excited about the growth and value creation potential by the Mariner merger, the Devon offshore acquisition and our Kitimat LNG project. 
And with that, we're ready to take your questions."

Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations f",826,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations front and mention two highlights. Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil development projects in Australia have now achieved maximum production ahead of what we forecasted for the year. This is an important step forward in the delivery of the large and visible pipeline of organic growth projects in our International region. 
In the North America, we ramped up the development of two large resource plays, the Horn River and the Granite Wash. We're going to drill over 60 gross wells this year in these two plays and expect to exit the year with net production of around 175 million a day. The Granite Wash is a liquid rich relative to most other large resource plays in North America, which gives big impact on the economics. It's also differentiated by the acreage position we hold because it is primarily held by production. 
In the Horn River, the quality of the rock and the development efficiencies certainly differentiates it. We can achieve those through large drilling pads on continuous ground acreage. In addition, as we progress our Kitimat LNG project, our goal is to give the Horn River access to international LNG markets. These are just a couple of the highlights on the operations side, and Rod and John will go over more of them as we go, which is really shows that organic growth engine is stronger than it's ever been. 
Going into 2010, we truly expected first quarter to be slow relative to the sequence there being of the quarters and for production growth to accelerate from there, and that's exactly what you see reflected on our numbers. Production ramped up throughout the quarter, with March actual production coming in at 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, compared to our average for the quarter of 585,000 barrels a day. And we consider our 5% to 10% organic growth production outlook remains unchanged. 
Secondly, on the financial front, the highlight really is that we have the best quarter since 2008, both in terms of earnings and cash flow. It has been driven by our portfolio balance, and I can't say enough how important it is for our portfolio to be balanced between oil and gas, and then within gas, to have a good mix of both North American and International gas. Not only is it important, but frankly, at our size, it's pretty much impossible to replicate for companies that did not make that balanced growth choices that we've made over the last several years in getting to this position. 
And thirdly, on the strategic front, we have taken three very important steps so far in 2010. A merger with Mariner Energy, which we announced after the quarter closed, will give Apache a new growth platform in the Deepwater. Mariner gives us critical mass, experience and opportunities that we want in this area, and Apache's resources will enhance the value creation potential of this platform. 
In addition, Mariner gives us a rich opportunity inventory in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and also in the Permian Basin. The asset fit is excellent. The cultural fit is outstanding. And we're working diligently with Mariner's team to progress the merger and are very much looking forward to welcoming them officially onboard as Apache's. 
Separately, the Devon offshore property transaction gives us yet another high-quality inventory set in the core region, with very attractive returns and frankly, I can't say that we know of anyone that can generate the reserves and value better than we can. 
The third strategic development that took place during the quarter that Apache became operator is the Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada. We've discussed that opportunity with you on our earnings call in February. But I'd note that just like Deepwater, LNG is a big step forward for Apache. It enables us to monetize very large gas resources, at LNG prices, which are generally linked to crude oil prices and gives us a large stable production and cash profile to complement our portfolio. 
Instead of following the pack, we certainly picked our own timing and direction in taking each of these steps. Looking back, I can reminisce to going into Egypt in 1995, going into the North Sea in 2003 and going into Australia in 1993. All were important steps for us. And all of them were very much against the sector consensus at the time, but which have created great value for our shareholders. And we're confident that the steps that we've taken in the first quarter will be looked back on in the same vein, and will provide meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum who will discuss North America."
169838,104540805,66174,"Apache Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party host platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gul",2092,"Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party host platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gulf Coast and the Central regions were the primary factors. The ramp up of drilling operation started in the first quarter, after very low activity level in 2009, will arrest that drop for the second quarter. 
The Gulf Coast region production for the first quarter averaged just under 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Production gains of almost 6,000 barrels equivalent were experienced from additional hurricane repairs and resumption of service of the Sea Robin Pipeline. However, these gains were offset by natural declines and again, the third-party host platform and pipeline issues during the quarter. 
The first quarter drilling program in the Gulf Coast has given us a nice start for 2010. We drilled 19 gross wells, of which 14 were successful. Four of those successful wells were exploratory and are now in evaluation and developmental planning stages. Two LLOG-operated Mississippi Canyon 199 wells successfully tested two adjacent fault blocks at our Mandy prospect, and penetrated net oil pay of 161 feet and 109 feet respectively, at approximately 6,500-foot TVD. We are now evaluating subsea development plans for these wells and would expect production by mid 2011, with initial rates of around 6,000 barrels per day from each well. Apache has working interest of 15% in this field and Mariner Energy has 35% working interest in the discovery. 
In addition, we were successful with two tests of the N6 M [ph] at our Boomerang Prospect that Main Pass 308, where we identified 12 feet and 30 feet of net oil pay in the N6 M [ph] in our number one and number one sidetrack wells respectively. Regionally, the N6 M [ph] well is quite prolific, with recoveries in the range of 1 million barrels of oil from 10-foot pay sections. 
We are currently mobilizing a rig to drill an appraisal well in Main Pass 309 to further delineate the reservoir and confirm our platform location for development plans. Initial rates are expected to be around 800 barrels per day per well, with the support of six wells development. First production would be expected in the first half of 2011. Apache operates this build [ph] with 100% working interest. 
Other successful drilling of two wells, the Grand Isle 41 and South Pass 75, as well as the new well at High Island 129 and three new wells on to our producers will have additional production volumes for the second quarter. 
In our Central Region, production averaged 34,600 barrels equivalent per day, down 4% from the last quarter. Third-party pipeline downtime and delays in completion of new wells were responsible for the decline. The third-party downtime issue's resolved and our backlog of completions being worked off. We expect production to be up by more than 3,000 barrel equivalent in the second quarter. 
As most of you know, horizontal drilling with multiple stage frac stimulations has really improved the potential of the tight formations we typically target in the country, United States. Our Central Region controls roughly 1 million gross acres, most of which is held by production. This has provided us with an excellent platform, from which we actively and efficiently explore. We've been testing various geologic targets across the region to identify the most prospective acreage for horizontal application. 
Since late last year, the region has tested eight separate horizontal pay intervals within 20 wells over hundreds of square miles. More than a dozen more horizontal formation tests are planned this year. As plans are verified, leasing efforts have commenced. In the past year, 36,000 new gross acres have been leased with 16,000 of those acres being leased in the first quarter of 2010. 
The Central Region spud 23 wells in the first quarter, of which 13 were horizontal. The region's most active program continues to be the Granite Wash in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. You're all aware that the Granite Wash is a series of liquid-rich stack gas pays, which underlies some 4,000 square miles of the Anadarko Basin. We've been active in the play for decades, but have only recently ramped up horizontal multi-frac operations. We have now drilled eight horizontal wells, five of which have been completed, as well as have already produced 4 Bcf gas and 150,000 barrels of oil. The remaining three are now being completed. Meanwhile, we are expanding the drilling campaign and are currently operating six horizontal Granite Wash rigs. A seventh horizontal rig will be added as well as an additional vertical rig in May. 
At the same time, we have another three rigs targeting other horizontal effects [ph] around the region. We are quite enthused about the results of our Cherokee formation activity in Western Oklahoma. For the past several years, Apache has been successful in acquiring acreage and drilling shallow Cherokee formation wells, primarily in Hartford County, Oklahoma, one of the oldest areas of the Anadarko Basin. 
We drilled over 20 vertical oil wells with initial rates typically averaging 100 barrels per day. On those results, we have recently leased more than 11,000 acres and now control over 60,000 acres in the play. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed our first horizontal path in this play. The Rose Hill 4-29H tested 150 barrels of oil per day from a 38-foot, 100-foot lateral and has held up quite nicely, still producing over 120 barrels per day after two months. 
Our second test, the Bentley 5-5H tested over 700 barrels a day from a 4,400-foot lateral and is still producing 530 barrels a day after six weeks. The region has identified more than 30 additional horizontal locations in this play and we expect to maintain at least one horizontal drilling rig in the play for the foreseeable future. 
In East Texas, Apache has been active with two horizontal drilling rigs targeting the Bossier Sands since late last year. The region has completed three horizontal tests today. The Folk 6H, that was this year. The Folk 6H tested for 9.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody T-7H tested for 9.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. And while the Folk 9H tested for a very strong rate of 15.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody 2-8H is currently testing out their frac, an early indication that it will be the strongest well to date. As of this morning, it is already flowing at more than 15 million cubic feet of gas per day, while still recovering frac water at more than 2,000 barrels per day. We're on 100% of the Moody lease and 77% of it, 12 place [ph]. 
Our new Permian Region is operating independently after the year end spin out from our Central Region. We've been actively recruiting staff from both inside and outside Apache and expect to be fully operational from our newly leased office space in Midland by early July. Permian production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent within 1% of the prior quarter. We expect production to be up slightly for the second quarter. The Permian region drilling program got off to a fast start as well. We are currently operating five rigs, three in New Mexico and two in Texas. During the first quarter, the region drilled 51 wells, targeting oil reservoirs in 11 different fields across the Permian Basin. All 51 Wells are either completed and on production or will be completed in the near future. 
As in the Central Region, application of horizontal well technology is having a significant impact on our plans. Importantly, we drilled two successful horizontal tests in old waterflood units. The Shafterlike 606-H [ph] well was drilled and completed in the San Andres with a fixed-stage frac stimulation and came on production at an initial rate of nearly 500 barrels of oil per day. The North McElroy 4025H was drilled and completed in the Grayburg with an eight-stage frac stimulation and tested approximately 200 barrels per day. Both wells initial rates and post-drill reserve estimates were higher than pre-drill estimates. Based on this success, follow-up locations are planned in both fields, where we will test longer laterals and more fracture stimulation stages. 
We're very optimistic about the potential for horizontal drilling throughout the Permian Basin, with additional wells planned at TXO South [ph] and Dean units in West Texas, as well as the monument area of Southeast New Mexico.  We expect to keep at least one horizontal rig working at the remainder of the year. We also expect to add two additional drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter to expand our traditional low-risk bread-and-butter vertical oil well programs. 
During the first quarter, the region also sanctioned the Roberts Unit CO2-enhanced recovery expansion and just signed an agreement with Kinder Morgan for the purchase of 38 Bcf of CO2 over 10 years. CO2-enhanced recovery will be an important piece of the Permian Region business for a long time, given our extensive holdings in the basin. We have already identified 26 of our fields with CO2 enhanced recovery potential. 
In Canada, Canadian production averaged 68,000 barrels equivalent a day, down 5% from the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, extreme weather early in the year caused extensive freeze-up across the region and was the primary reason for the drop. We are bringing on production from our winter drilling program and completion operations, which are expected to lead to a 6% increase for the second quarter. The majority of the impact of the Horn River activity will not become evident until the second half of the year. 
Development drilling in our conventional business units totaled 42 wells, resulting in 38 producers during the first quarter, with successful gas completions at Zama, Kaybob and Nevis. Oil drilling activity was focused on House Mountain, where six new horizontal wells are producing over 1,100 barrels per day. Also an 18-well winter program in our Provost area has delivered good results, including one well that tested over 500 barrels of oil per day at our proposed Battle River EOR [enhanced oil recovery] project area.
Our Horn River activity continues to dominate Canadian operations. Seven horizontal wells were drilled in the Two Island Lake development area during the quarter, with four on the Apache-operated 52-L pad and three on the EnCana-operated 63-K pad. In addition, Apache drilled three horizontal wells in our building area to hold expiring acreage. Drilling efficiencies and result in cost performances continued to improve, with average drill times now at 19 days from spud to rig release and average drill cost at $3.7 million per well for a 7,200-foot horizontal section. 
Completion operations on the 16-well 70-K pad, which was drilled in 2009 commenced in January. We have just finished the amount of frac stimulation project associated with these wells this week. Over the past three and a half months, we have completed 274 frac stimulations on those 16 wells, accounting more than 500 million barrels of water and an excess of 100 million pounds of sand. The project also involves conducting a huge micro-seismic acquisition program with 82 individual frac stages in over 19,000 individual microseismic events mapped. This data will be used to optimize frac design, frac spacing and then the well spacing on our future pads. 
The first of 16 70-K wells came on stream on March 29 to start recovering frac load water, and we're now producing around 25 million a day from that pad. The ramp-up has been severely limited due to the space restrictions, while the frac spread remained on location. We are presently demobilizing the frac equipment and would expect to have all 16 wells on production by early July. 
Construction of the DeBolt water treatment facility ramped up in the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early May. While it is not available for our 70-K pad program, utilization of this water supply will ultimately reduce the volumes of fresh water used for frac stimulation purposes and the associated costs for water transportation. Steve mentioned the Kitimat operation during the first quarter. We have now received feed proposals from four parties and we're under technical evaluation. We would expect award feed sometime on the next month and a half, two months. 
And that's all I have. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob Eichler."

During the first quarter, production from Apache's International operations was 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 2% increase over fourth quarter 2009. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and successful commission of oil developments in Australia. In Egypt, net production was 151,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 5% from fourth quarter, due to higher oil prices and lower recoverable costs, resulting in lower cost recovery barrels. By contrast, gross boe per day increased 3,000 barrels a day or 1% from 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Exploration activity continued stronger in the quarter, with operations being conducted on five 3D seismic surveys, representing nearly 3,000 square kilometers coverage. Early activity increased during the quarter, with a total of 48 wells, reaching total debt, including 10 exploration wells. The region has, for the quarter, with 20 active drilling rigs operating and the success rate for Apache-operated exploration wells was 67%. 
Exploration appraisal drilling was largely focused in our expanding Faghur Basin oil play, where four wells tested in a combined rate of 12,000 barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of gas per day from AEB and Safa reservoirs. 18 well remain to be drilled in the basin this year, including non-exploration wells. Development of the Phiops Field at the East end of Faghur Basin continue with the Phiops 8 well, which encountered 124 net feet of pay and multiple AEB sands. The initial completion, AEB 3E sand tested at 4,500 barrels of oil per day and no water. Construction is nearing completion on the West Kalabsha facilities project, which will increase the export capacity of our Faghur Basin facilities from the current 11,000 barrels of oil per day to 20,000 barrels per day by midyear. 
Extension of the Malaha accrual pipeline [ph]  And completion of the chain of infrastructure upgrades will further boost Apache's Faghur Basin production capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day, which we should be able to fill up by year end. Notable drilling results were also achieved in the Jade Field discovered by Apache in 2007 on the Matruh development lease. The Jade-8 well was completed in AEB 3G sand put on production this 10th of March. In its current report, the Salam gas plant at the rate of 3,100 barrels condensate per day and 32 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Jade-10 well is drilled in that quest of Jade structure and tested 3,100 barrels of oil per day with no water from the AEB 3E. Additional field wells are planned in 2010 to accelerate this oil development. To date, the Jade Field has produced 47 Bcf and 4.5 million barrels of oil and condensate and presently produces 107 million cubic feet of gas per day and 12,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day. 
Apache has 100% contract of interest in all the previously referenced wells. 
In Australia, net production was 61,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 40% increase over fourth quarter and double the rate for first quarter of 2009. Gas production increased by 1% from fourth quarter, while oil production nearly tripled. The substantial increase in net oil production from 9,900 barrels of oil per day to 27,000 barrels per day was due to successful commissioning of the of Van Gogh and Pyrenees development projects. The region also benefited from the absence of cyclones in the first quarter, compared to three cyclones and storm production eruptions in the same period of 2009. 
At the Van Gogh oil project, which Apache operates with 52.5% working interest, the Ningaloo Vision FPSO arrived on location and following a five-week commissioning period, the field commenced production on February 13. Well performance has been excellent with oil wells tested above 10,000 barrels of oil per day on clean-up. Production peaked at 72,200 barrels of oil per day gross in March, and averaged 66,000 barrels of oil per day gross or 34,700 barrels a day net in the last week of the quarter. To date, the field has produced 3.4 million barrels of oil or 1.8 million barrels net. 
Nearby, BHP Billiton operated Pyrenees FPSO development, in which Apache has a 28.6% working interest commenced production, February 24.  Production ramped up quickly to 90,000 barrels a day gross from the seven WA-42 L permit wells with six wells remaining to be completed on the adjacent WA-43 L permit, in which Apache has a 31.5% working interest. To date, the Pyrenees field has produced 4.4 million barrels of oil gross and roughly some 1.3 million barrels net for Apache. These high initial rates for both fields are essentially flush production, as we commission the facilities and we expect the region's net oil production to average 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for the year. 
Work is progressing in our Devil Creek Reindeer development project, in which Apache is the operator with a 55% working interest. Gas plant in both Earthworks were essentially completed in the first quarter and some of the works commenced. The first shipment of the Thailand fabricated gas plant hyperact modules arrived on site and installation is in progress. The onshore pipeline from the beach crossing to the gas plant and the horizontal directional-drilling operations under the beach was started. Fabrication on the Reindeer Wellhead Platform deck is underway in China. The project is on schedule for first production in third quarter 2011. Also during the first quarter, four Apache-operated wells reached TD yield in two trend exploration dry holes and two successful appraisal wells on Australia's Northwestern shelf. 
The Julimar Southwest 1 and Southwest 2 how much Apache has a 65% working interest were drilled in a single surface location to confirm productivity of the Mungaroo formation in the southern part of the Julimar horse block. Both wells are part of the Julimar-Brunello development component of the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project. 
In the North Sea, production averaged 58,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 2% for the fourth quarter. 32,000 barrels of oil per day average for the quarter was added to new drilling where we lost 1,800 barrels a day from mechanical failures, unplanned events in normal times. At the end of the quarter, seven development wells and five pilot holes were drilled and completed. Notably, the Forties Alpha 15A 53W [ph] in the Forties Charlie 24 C - 44 Y [ph] development wells tested 3,031 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The field development plan for the mall field, a new field using oil discovery made by Apache in the fourth quarter has been proved by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. First oil expected late in the second quarter of 2010. The field has qualified as a small field development yielding up to 75 million pounds earning a supplement corporation tax breaks as well as exemption from the petroleum revenue tax. 
In Argentina, net production was 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 8% from the fourth quarter. The normal decline as well as mechanical and other related downtime in Neuquén fields pushed oil production down while gas production separate from lower than normal residential seasonal demand and lower demand by power generation customers from increased hydroelectric power capability, availability all result in increased gas, injection and shutting gas wells throughout the first quarter. In total, we reinjected close to 4 million cubic feet of gas per day net more than in the first quarter compared to previous quarter. 
Regions shallow [ph] program however was very successful in the first quarter, with 10 wells drilled with no dry hole adding net reserves is 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the shallow drilling program in the Neuquén Basin three successful wells were drilled at a gross production of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas per day and 335 barrels of oil per day from Centenario and Cuyo reservoirs. All three wells are drilled at depths of only 4,000 feet. An additional 16 Wells are planned for this year. Also the Neuquén Basin, four successful wells are drilled as part of the Gas Plus program. Three wells in EFO field have been completed in the Lajas the depth 11,500 feet and our production can combined rate of 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day or 108 barrels of currency per day after multizone stimulated completions. If fourth well, the EFO 109, encountered 328 feet of net pay in the Lajas, it is being completed and frac is stimulated in six zones. Those are currently cleaning up after frac of the first three zones at a rate of 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Based on the quality of paying [ph] and the results of the first three zone the EFO 109 is expected to produce over 500 million cubic feet of gas per day and 125 barrels of condensate per day. 
Eight additional wells are planned in EFO field to develop gas volumes for the Gas Plus contracts that is currently being negotiated to provide 15 million cubic feet of gas per day at a price of $5 per million BTU on January 1, 2011. 10 additional wells in AC and Ronaco fields will also be drilled this year to support the Gas Plus program. Apache operates the reference Neuquén Basin wells and fields with 100% working interest. 
Now let's turn the presentation over to Roger Plank for the finance."

I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million o",662,"Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million or $2.08 per share were 21% higher than the prior quarter and our highest since third quarter of '08. Adjusted for the impact of FX on our deferred tax balances, earnings totaled $712 million or $2.10 a share. Cash flow from operations for us $1.5 billion also for the first time since third quarter of '08. Apache's substantial oil and liquid production base was the primary driver behind our results. Highland liquids represented half of our equivalent production but generated nearly 3/4 of revenue, and are principally responsible for our revenue rising $118 million sequentially to $2.7 billion. 
Long before the current industries stampede began oil exposure, Apache took deliberate steps to achieve a balanced production mix. As a result, we're already benefiting from a current 20 to 1 multiple in the price of oil versus gas. And we are ramping up activity on the oil side of our portfolio. In the first quarter, for example, Van Gogh and Pyrenees enabled Apache's lower production to rise 3% sequentially, nearly offsetting a 4% temporary decline in gas production. I would note that absent the impact of higher prices had on both price-sensitive volumes in Egypt and to a lesser extent in Canada, on a production volumes, would've been up slightly and pretty much spot on our first quarter plan. A few quick comments on costs, cash costs excluding taxes other than income, came in at $11.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, impacted by slightly lower production. Rising future productions should drive us toward our goals to match 2009's average of $11.25 per boe. 
You're maybe wondering about the potential impact of our recently announced transactions on 2010. Because it so much depends on exactly when the transactions closed. The precise impact is difficult to measure but here's some broad indicators. Absent the exercise of preferential purchase rate, which covers some 7,500 barrels equivalent per day, Apache is picking up 19,000 barrels equivalent per day from Devon and another 63,000 with Mariner. A combined 82,000 equivalent barrels per day represents 14% of Apache's first quarter worldwide production. With respect to the financial 2010 impact, assuming Devin closes in early June and Mariner late in the third quarter, 2010 average volumes should rise around 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 4% to 5% from these transactions alone. Now this is over and above our earlier production growth target of 5% to 10% growth pre-acquisitions. 
I would note that for the last couple of years, Apache chose to build cash rather than pursue transactions of size in what was generally considered a profiting market. Net cash was in fact pent-up growth potential that is now being put to work and will benefit all key per share metrics over the next several years. While we potentially took up 14% more production, share count rises just 5%, resulting in accretion to per-share earnings, cash flow, production and reserves in the first full year of ownership. 
The bottom line is our outlook for growth is excellent. I would also note that in our two recent deals, about 60% of combined production is gas. Approximately 60% of the revenue is generated from oil and liquids. There's also a deep inventory of future development projects as well as exploration prospects that are oil. 
One final note on our balance sheet, while the combined transactions totaled $5 billion, our financial flexibility remains intact. Approximately $2 billion at consideration is equity and we will also tap a significant portion of our $2.1 billion of cash balances to close these deals. By year-end, debt cash should be below 25% and cash balances above $1 billion, leaving us in excellent position to continue to carry out Apache's growth strategy.

I'd like to sum up what I think were the three main messages from all the information that we shared with you on this call. 
First, we had a very good quarter operationally. As you heard mentioned few times Van Gogh and Pyrenees have ramped up. Our organic growth engine as strong as ever and our organic growth production's expectations for the year remain at 5% to 10%. 
Secondly, we have had a very good quarter from a financial perspective, with the highest earnings and cash flow since 2008. We achieved this in spite of a weak price environment from North American gas and it's because of our portfolio, which is really a central part of our strategy and a key differentiating factor for most of our peers. 
And third, we certainly took very important strategic steps during the quarter. You got further omissions that are a little, profitable long-term growth our shareholders. We picked our own timing and direction. And we're very excited about the growth and value creation potential by the Mariner merger, the Devon offshore acquisition and our Kitimat LNG project.

I would start off from a generalization. I think personally, I think it's premature to extrapolate cost increases that we've seen in the first quarter throughout the year. Winter is difficult for us in Canada and unfortunately, it's difficult for us in the central region because we've got one of the more severe freezes that we've had through that part of our portfolio in the first quarter. So a lot of costs with respect to activities to start production again is part of those costs and the other thing is to be honest with you, our production was down a little bit and one of the major culprits was because we are in a CS3 a production sharing agreement in Egypt and the bedside of is all prices go up come in the downside of it is we see less production which cost us about 5000 barrels a day in Egypt. And gross operated was actually up. But overall, I don't think the cost side of it is going to get out of line. On the steel prices, that's certainly going to have an impact and I'm sure everyone's over the steel prices are going up.

I know it's late. We have two things to announce. One is great Bakken [ph], the other one is standard business. But before it gets lost in the translation, Apache had a hell of a quarter this q",2520,"Thank you, Tom. And thank you everybody for joining us today. I know it's late. We have two things to announce. One is great Bakken [ph], the other one is standard business. But before it gets lost in the translation, Apache had a hell of a quarter this quarter and I'd like to just go over the highlights. 
If you have the page there, I think it's Page 3 that shows Apache's second quarter financial highlights. We earned $860 million or $2.53 a share, which is up 22% from the prior quarter. Our production was up a little over 10%, actually, sequentially from the first quarter to 647,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Our cash flow was up 17%. And importantly as we go forward, our cash on the balance sheet was $1.8 billion and at the end of the second quarter, our debt to cap was at 22%. 
What really drove that growth was the full quarter of Van Gogh and Pyrenees in Australia and some good results in Egypt. Van Gogh and Pyrenees were up about 30,000 barrels per day. The Van Gogh, as our development, is producing about 55,000 barrels a day, which we own 52.5%. And the Pyrenees is a BHP development that we own about 30% of them, made about 95,000 barrels a day. So we had a very good indigenous growth as a company, and we have a lot of good things ahead of us.
One of those things is the transaction that we just announced this afternoon after the market closed. And it is a strategic exit by BP from three core areas that are very strong to Apache. They're Permian, Canadian and the Western Desert of Egypt. And before you go through all the numbers and we go through the numbers, we are really buying individual businesses because this is a complete exit by BP from these areas. Apache has made a living off of the sales packages of majors. And I will tell you for the first time in our history, we have an opportunity to take a major out three core areas that are going businesses. 
And this doesn't just include production, it includes field studies, seismic, tremendous amount of acreage besides of the producing wells that they have right now. And we're tremendously excited about it. They are long-lived legacy properties, you can read on the slide yourself. Number of development projects, we do get some midstream assets with these that add to the value. And they really play to Apache's core competency, which is adding value to underworked assets. An old cliche is the best place to find new reserves is in mature areas. And this is right in our wheelhouse.
The transaction itself, I'll turn to the next page, Page 5. I've talked a little bit about what the transaction is. The Canadian Upstream business, it does exclude the oil sands and their NGL business. Other than that, it is a complete exit by BP. It's the entire Permian Basin business unit, and it's the entirety of the Western Deserts of Egypt. The transaction value is $7 billion, the expected date is July 1. We'll make a $5 billion deposit to BP by July 30, and these transactions are subject to only regulatory clearances in different locales. So there's a number of different regulatory clearances here in the States. There's Hart-Scott-Rodino, we got some filings in Canada and make the Foreign Investment Review Board and Egypt, it will be subject to EGPC's approval.
The next slide is a summary of what we have come up with so far. And I say come up with so far because we'll be working with these assets for the years to come. We have about 385 million barrels of proved reserves. We've evaluated so far 181 million barrels of probables. Total P1, P2 [P1+P2] are 566 million barrels, producing about 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Importantly, we're going to pick up 2.4 million acres across these regions. 763,000 acres in the Permian Basin, of which 400,000 are P [ph] minerals, so they're in perpetuity. In Egypt, we have a big acreage spend there, but we picked up 400,000 acres in a very prolific area in the Western Desert. And we picked up 1.2 million acres in Canada, and I'll go through a little bit of why we think that's so valuable.
The next slide shows the way we've allocated values in terms of values for each region. Canada is $3.25 billion. The different color slides there show the proved reserves, what we've put on probable, how much we put on acreage and then the midstream and a very small amount for exploration, and that is in Egypt. 
In terms of the acreage, we've only valued two plays. We valued the undeveloped P [ph] minerals in the Permian Basin, which were about 250,000 acres. And we also valued the 44,000 acres in the Montney play. We have 44,000 acres that underlie there in Noel development. But those acres are right in the heart of the play, the only two values that we put on acreage. So I would say we have a lot of value to allocate, but we'll see that as we go forward.
The next slide shows the Permian Basin. And the most important thing about this slide is look at the acreage positions. If you look at Apache's acreage position, you look at BP's acreage position and you add in the Mariner acquisition that's on the eastern side of the Permian Basin, we now have a sizable combined acreage position in a very, very prolific area. Our combined region at the end of this, we'll have about 700 million barrels of oil. And we're producing about 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. 
One of the strongest regions we'll have in the company is this. It's interesting that unbeknownst to us, we opened our Midland office July 12 of this year, really in anticipation of long before Mariner at the time as to really making this much more of a core area because of the oil content associated with it. But we have our office opened now. We'll be bringing the Mariner folks over, and I'm sure we'll be bringing some BP folks over as we move forward.
The interesting thing, BP spent about $25 million so far in 2010. They spent $50 million in 2009. These are very underworked assets. BP has not drilled an operated well in the last four years. So far, we've identified more than 2,000 infill drilling locations. We haven't booked any of those locations, but we've got over 2,000 infill drilling locations. The Yeso was in the Southeast New Mexico play. And the Spraberry is what that green stuff is out there in the eastern edge of the acreage position. 
Also increases our interest in some very key fields for us: NEDU, which we drilled off for a number of years. New Mexico Federal Unit, which is NMFU. We have 25%, that gives us 50%. Actually, ConocoPhillips has been somewhat of a hangup in making that activity out there. And this gives us a real position, which to control the opportunities out there. Great fit, great business unit.
Next slide is Canada. Again, I'd direct you to just the acreage that you see on that slide. Huge acreage position. We have about 4.3 million acres, you add BP's 1.3 million acres and you've got 5.7 million acres in one of the most prolific gas basins in the world. Our production goes up to significant about 117,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And our reserves are over 750 million barrels. 
A couple of plays in your appendix, you'll see and I'll direct you to the red stuff over there, just on the BP border called Noel/Montney. I'll give you an example of the majors' activity. They have put in $600 million worth of infrastructure in that field. They have a takeaway capacity for over 100 million a day. They're now out there drilling wells. They're in about 42 million a day today. They planned this to ramp up to 100 million a day and hold it flat for 15 years. Our job will be to not only get it to 100 million a day but to accelerate that. 
We think and I think, they've shown about a TCF of gas in that field, and that totally excludes any of the Montney. They've drilled the Montney well, they've drilled two Montney wells. The first Montney well that they've drilled had 130 meters of Montney in it, so great upside. A number of other plays: the Mountain Front play; they also have a coal bed methane play, this is called Mist Mountain down at the South. 
In terms of our capital program for each one of these, I will tell you right now, our case has about $300 million of capital for 2011. That's not what we're going to spend. It's just the way we have put together the evaluation. We're going to have to get our regions to look at these projects. Because of the early release and the leaks that we had in our discussions with BP, we pretty well held this very tight internally. So our regions haven't had a big opportunity to look at what we've put together for. But we'll be doing that over the next several weeks and come up with a plan for each one of these core areas.
I'm flipping to the Western Desert now. The red is 400,000 acres, but it gets lost in our 11 million acres in Egypt. Apache controls the Western Desert. And one of the biggest pluses of this is what it does to our control over the infrastructure. 
Although it's not shown on this slide and in your appendix, you'll see that the line on the coast that goes from west to east takes about 970 million cubic feet of gas a day. Now 800 million of that is Apache's. We are now gas constrained. We have built a line down to the south that goes through the tariff depression down there. We built that in 1997 and since then, we've been trying to get into that line that goes east-west on the south side that's labeled BP. That's a pipeline that's rated for about 140 million a day. There's also a gas plant there. We should be able to increase our production out of the Western Desert. And we have about 300 million a day of pent-up production that we can't move because of pipeline capacity. So this gives us a real opportunity not only to put gas down that line, but possibly move that line. It's a 24-inch line. We're going to have to do some work on it. It gives us a new opportunity to take gas out of the Western Desert. 
Although small, that 400,000 acres, if you look at two of the largest fields ever discovered in Egypt, they are right around it. The BED field, which is a shell field is made over a Tcf and a half of gas already. It's still producing 10,000 barrels a day and 129 million cubic feet of gas a day. VEGAS just made a recent discovery in 2007, which they were reporting as 1.5 Tcf of gas and 200 million barrels of oil. 
BP have never shot new 3D seismic over this. In fact, they were just now shooting the 3D seismic because they anticipated drilling these wells themselves. BP business units were not aware of this transaction until the last week. And they were continuing on to work these properties. So it is a great add-on. Although not big, we only paid $650 million for this, it has great synergies for what we're doing in the Western Desert.
The next slide I'll show is the combined production slide for Apache. And this is the APA after Mariner and after Devon, but before the BP transaction. I might point out, if you look to the left, there's a little box that shows what we've reported, before we had Mariner and Devon for the first quarter of 2010 was 588,000 barrels of oil per day. When we come out of this on a pro forma basis, we will have added the 200,000 barrels a day since the first quarter. 
So we've had significant growth. All of that growth has come in areas that we know something about. We're tremendously excited about the last transaction we made. And this BP transaction, if you look at it in terms of what we have been able to do for a living for lot of years, this is right in our wheelhouse.
Next slide. This is what our financing plan is. I am going to go over briefly. I've been told we can't talk about the financing, but this is a cursory look of our plan going forward. We'll use $1.5 billion cash, commercial paper, a 364-day bank revolver and a termed debt. And then we will have common and mandatory converts coming out tomorrow. 
Next slide. This is the financial impact. I will say that based on our numbers that we've run for 2011 because 2010, depending on when they close, it's hard to figure 2010. So for 2011, this is a push on earnings. And it's slightly accretive, both the cash flow and to reserves per share and production per share. You can see the BP businesses acquired, that is for half a year in terms of the revenues less expenses, $365 million to $400 million a day. So if you double that, that's we think over $800 million. 
And if you look at our evaluation, we've got $300 million worth of capital that we're going to spend in 2011. 
Obviously, we're going to have a lot more cash flow to spend on these properties than we've dialed in so far. It does improve our reserve life a little bit. In terms of our product mix, it doesn't change our product mix at all. I've had a number of questions from our folks internally about -- this is predominantly gas. If you look at our price deck, we don't get above $6 or we don't get to $6 in our price deck until 2014. So actually, it's probably not a bad time to buy gas.
Next slide. This is a little of our own propaganda frankly, because the growth per growth sake is not what we're about. But it does show what this transaction does in terms of our production against our peers and our proved reserves against our peers. So we obviously have taken a step change with this transaction.
Next slide. Our former Chairman and Founder used to say Apache's main businesses is following a cow through the cornfields, and we can get fat on the scraps that were left. The good thing about this transaction is that we're eating the corn this time. I mean this is a very good transaction for Apache. And I think with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

But in terms of the actual capital that we'll spend in 2011 on these properties, frankly we're going to have to get our regions down in the middle of this and compare these properties to some of the things that we're doing ourselves. Plus, we're going to have the capacity to gear up our capital from where we are today. We're projecting we're going to spend about $6.3 billion this year. That will probably go up some. But we really got to -- I mean first thing we've got to do is to close these. And Hart-Scott-Rodino is 30 days. So in many times we get the approvals out of Canada and certainly out of Egypt, it's going to be 60 to 90 days before we can actually get in the middle of these transactions.

In terms of long-term upside, I think, honestly, they all bring something different to the table. If you look at the Permian, in the past, we focused on the Oil side, and the reason is, is because oil was at $80 a barrel. We'll continue to do that. One of the reasons that we decided at the beginning of the year to hold them off was out there long before we had dreams of where we would be today. We've really focused on some of our water plus. We've been very successful in drilling horizontal wells in there. We think we've got a whole program of drilling horizontal wells and old water field. We drilled six to date, John? Six to date, all of them are tremendously economic. The best ones are doing 300 barrels a day. And I will tell you, at 300 barrels a day, you can make a hell of a lot of money and we know how much water you have to move. But each one of these areas bring something different. In Canada, we have an awful lot of vintage wells. I will tell you, out of this package, probably next year sometime, will come a rationalization package out of Canada, because we have a lot of stuff, smaller stuff in Alberta that we'll probably decide it doesn't fit our portfolio.

The fact that they are happy with their cash flow, if you will, with $400 million, and you can perhaps double that for the whole year.

Those of you who have followed us for many years know that Apache has a truly unique culture and is involved with strong sense of urge",850,"Thank you, Tom and good afternoon, everyone and thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2010 results call. Those of you who have followed us for many years know that Apache has a truly unique culture and is involved with strong sense of urgency and paramount of our employees and an independent mindset. And Apache's culture really is that the heart of how we build value and has taken us from very humble position not so long ago to where we are today. And I don't think there's anything that exemplifies more our third quarter, what that culture is capable of delivering for our shareholders. 
On the portfolio side, we announced the $7 billion acquisition of three entire upstream operating regions from BP and the Permian Basin, Canada and Egypt. These three positions have an excellent fit with our existing carriers and provide us with a rich inventory of growth and value enhancement opportunity for years to come. 
It was July 20, the last conference call, we were just announcing this step, and we were getting ready to get on a plane to go sell stock and debt for this important step forward. And while we clearly believed that the transaction had all the ingredients to make a great deal for our shareholders, we really didn't know how the share price would react, given the amount of new stock we were about to issue. 
Well, as most of you know, the stock actually went up by 5% in the three days after we announced, and this is opposite of what generally happens. Internally, we took that as an endorsement of Apache's ability to generate value out of the transaction. Obviously, we're honored with the vote of confidence. I want to ensure all of you, we'll do everything humanly possible to make good on this investment, to create long-term value for our shareholders. As of about an hour ago, we have now closed all three of the BP packages, if you haven't looked at the Wire, we just closed Egypt today. But we are integrating the people and starting to get our arms around the assets.  In addition, we expect to close on our merger with Mariner Energy when the vote ends on November 10.
We couldn't be more pleased and excited about the opportunity set we are building into our portfolio with the $11 billion in acquisitions. Through these steps we have added years of inventory to our core regions and have built the right footprint in what we believe are two new areas for us, the Deepwater oil exploration and LNG. LNG, for us, means the monetization of large North American gas resources at oil length prices. 
We've taken these steps on our own way which is the Apache way and we're confident that we'll constitute important foundations for Apache's continued growth and profitability during the coming decade. 
On the operating front, in the third quarter, we had a very successful quarter, with production was up 10% year-on-year and our cost and expense is on a per unit basis, excluding DD&A, it was down 3% year-on-year. John, Rod and Roger will give you more color on our results and developments during the quarter in a moment. Before getting to that, I'd like to put 2010 in a broader context, starting with where we were at the beginning of 2010 and what we look like going into 2011. 
If you recall, in February of this year on our 2009 year-end conference call, we were very bullish on what we've received in the acquisition market. We had amassed over $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and with commodity prices at more reasonable levels, we indicated that we would be very actively pursuing acquisition opportunity. Little did we know how attractive it would become. After the dust settles, and we have closed on all $11 billion of assets, apache's share count would have increased by approximately 12%, and we project we will end the year with a debt to cap of under 27%. 
Now on the flip side, on the production side, we are projecting December 2010 average production to exceed 775,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. So if you use the first quarter 2010 as a baseline, when Apache's production averaged 586,000 barrels of oil equivalent, we're entering 2011 with a third more firepower than we entered 2010. That added firepower will give us more cash flow to exploit the 3.8 million acres we acquired across three of the most prolific core areas Canada, Permian and Western Desert of Egypt. And the new core areas we've added in deepwater Gulf of Mexico has over 125 undeveloped blocks and interest in two world-class discoveries in Lucius and Heidelberg.   
Obviously, we're extremely excited about what we've been able to add to what we consider an already formative base and the opportunity that they bring to continue to add long-term value to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, John and Rod to talk about 2010 and '11 in a little more detail. Roger?"

Steve commented about how 2010 is shaping up and in a minute, I'm going to give a further glimpse of what may be a truly outstanding 2011. But before delving into next year I'd like to provide a few key highlights, financial highlights to the current quarter results. We think we have fine results, even though there were a lot of moving parts with all these transactions closing. 
Production was up 3% over second quarter to a record 667,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Oil and liquids were, once again the kind, representing just over half our production, but over 3/4 of our revenue. Cash costs per boe were essentially flat with second quarter while DD&A was up 3% as you might expect, given that our acquisitions remain at prices above our historic reserve cost. 
Debt ended at $6.5 billion and debt to cap at 23%, and that excludes $1.2 billion of cash on the books at quarter's end. Also, just of our year of acquisitions doesn't overshadow the considerable progress we're making on the organic side of our business. You should know that from the first quarter to the third, our oil production jumped 17% or 48,000 barrels per day, and over 3/4 of that growth was attributable solely to drilling and development activities, primarily in Egypt and especially, Australia. 
Turning to 2011. We're just now in the early stage of the part of next year's plan, but one thing seems certain, our year-over-year production growth should be well into the double digit. Exactly how much our production growth depends on our ultimate capital budget, which will be fine tuned between now and the year end. Our preliminary however, our capital budget is likely to reach or exceed $7 billion, up from around $6 billion this year and well within cash flow at prices currently indicated for next year. 
We've hedged oil for 2011 to protect cash flow and it's current active capital campaign. While we believe that the supply and demand outlook strongly favors oil, with over 3/4 of our revenue tied to oil and liquids since last quarter, we've hedged 64,000 barrels per day for 2011. We used costless collars with floors between $65 to $70 to protect the downside and ceilings between $95 to $103 to retain upside potential. We now have about 100,000 barrels per day hedged in total for 2011 or just over 1/4 of our post-merger liquids production. 
In addition to ensuring sufficient cash flow and capital to get after the upside on recently acquired properties, we are focusing particular attention on our extensive inventory of oil and liquids prospect for next year. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a deep inventory of oil prospects already enhanced and not have to join the herd chasing after high-cost oil opportunities after essentially the train's already left the station. 
I would like not to hedge any additional North American gases at today's low prices. And we are continuing to focus capital on those international gas projects, which are commanding substantially higher prices. Everyday oil remains at this lumpy level since more debt reduction than earlier anticipated. Additionally, to ensure that we make a major dent in our debt, which should peak following the Mariner merger at over $8 billion, we anticipate selling $1 billion of property sometime in the first half of 2011. We're just now in the process of determining which properties we'll be selling. So it's a bit early to tell the precise location, timing and impact of those sales. 
The combination of high oil prices and property sales meant lower debt and greater financial flexibility, consistent with an A-rated company. With double-digit production growth pretty much a shoo-in for 2011, a portfolio that's low in oil, a deep inventory of drilling opportunities and a strong financial position, we look forward to what could prove to be a better year in 2011.

Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third qua",998,"Thank you, Roger. Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third quarter and the Canadian piece closed in early October. We took over operations in the BP Canada properties on Monday of this week and welcomed almost 300 new Apaches. We will take over the BP Permian assets December 1, meanwhile, we expect to close on the Mariner merger next week after their shareholder meeting on November 10. 
Third quarter North American production was up over 7% versus second quarter to just under 309,000 barrels equivalent per day. Fourth quarter volumes will be up substantially as we see the impact of BP and Mariner acquisitions. 
Gulf Coast production increased 7% from the second quarter. Drilling activity offshore continues to be severely impacted by the permitting process associated with post and conduit requirements. While our Gulf region has received seven of the first 12 permits given to the Gulf of Mexico, requiring both NTL-05 and NTL-06 compliance. They remain significantly behind the plans for the year. 
At least for now the lack of clarity on the process makes it difficult for the BOEM [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] to approve anything in a timely fashion. We are however, presently running five jack-up rigs and one platform rig offshore, drilling primarily for oil targets. With permitting delays resolved, we expect to have a very strong 2011 drilling program with the addition of the new assets from Devon and Mariner. 
Our third quarter project of note is the redevelopment of the hurricane-damaged Eugene Island 330 field now underway. Three wells have already been drilled and are expected to add some 2,000 barrels a day, with additional drilling to extend into mid-2011 on the 63% working interest field. 
In the Permian region, we increased production by 21% on partial quarter BP volumes at a very active drilling program. Permian region production is expected to be up again on the fourth quarter as core BP volumes and the Mariner assets are added in. The BP and Mariner transactions allow our newly formed Permian region to add substantially to an already robust oil Permian drilling inventory with at least 3,000 new identified locations. The region was already very active in the quarter with seven rigs, drilling 73 new wells, while 116 wells were completed as we caught up on a backlog of frac stimulation work. 
With the addition of the Mariner properties later this month, we expect to keep up the 20 rigs running in the Permian for 2011. We also reached agreement with Concho on the BP, more above the Yeso play in New Mexico. Apache acquired a 60% working interest in the operatorship of the joint properties. We have identified 800 drillable locations in the play and expect to be very active there next year. 
The region continues to evaluate horizontal drilling potentials in a variety of well known producing intervals in the basin. We continue to have success with horizontal completions in all water fluid operations notably North McElroy in the Grayburg formation, TXL South in the Clearfork and Shafter Lake in the San Andres, where we're seeing IPs in the 250 to 400 barrel a day range.
The Central region also increased production by 7% from the second quarter. Importantly, distribution and gas coverage was up almost 20% on their oil productions. The region activity continues to be dominated by horizontal multi-stage frac operations in the liquid-rich Granite Wash play in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. 
We expect to drill 40 horizontal Granite Wash wells this year. The first 19 are currently on production and producing a net of 2,600 barrels of oil a day and some 40 million feet of gas. As in the Permian, we continue to look for additional applications for horizontal drilling. With this in mind, we recently test what we believe to be the first horizontal test on the of the Hogshooter Wash interval of the Granite Wash play.  
This morning, we announced two very successful tests. Each well produced the initial rates of over 2,000 barrels of oil a day and continue to average more than 700 barrels a day and 3.5 million feet of gas after two months. We expect to drill 10 additional Hogshooter tests in 2011. 
Our Canada region production decreased 1.8% from the second quarter. That figure will be up substantially in the fourth quarter as we add in BP volumes and ramp up at Horn River. Our 50%-owned Horn River production continues to build and reach the 100 million per day gross raw gas milestone in August and is expected to reach 200 million per day by first quarter of 2011. 
We have 18 new wells on production in 2010 and expect to bring another 12 on during the remainder of the year. We will leave the year with 24 wells already drilled and awaiting completion. As mentioned earlier, our Canadian region is quickly integrating BP properties with the help of the 300 new Apaches who moved in last Monday. While it's a little crowded in our Calgary office, while we complete the space build out, we wanted to get the things together as soon as possible. 
The most notable operation in the BP asset base in Canada is the Noel field producing from the Cadomin and Doig intervals. In addition, the field appears to have significant modeling potential, for which testing is now underway. Noel field production is currently at 62 million cubic feet of gas per day and is expected to reach 96 million by the end of the year and 125 million by the second quarter of 2011. The region is especially excited about the strong drilling inventory and the multitude of workover recompletion opportunities that are available with the new BP acquisition. 
And now Rod Eichler will give you an update on international."

Apache's international operations saw a good quarter, averaging 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with production increasing in three out of the four countries of operation. 
Egypt's gross production increased 3% to 323,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production was only up slightly resulting from timing differences in the PSC cost recovery mechanism. New production from Faghur Basin fields and discoveries as well as from our mature development lease help push gross operated oil and gas production above the 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day mark for the third consecutive quarter. Phase 2 of the Faghur Basin infrastructure project designed to upgrade capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day was completed on schedule on September 30. 
The acquisition of BP's risk-rated assets is complete. All contracts and agreements have been finalized and the final approvement from the government of Egypt was received today, closing occurred about an hour ago. Upon assuming operatorship, in terms of pinging on the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline will commence and we expect it to be completed by year end. 
Minor modifications of the existing system will be completed during first quarter of 2011 that will allow high liquid yield gas from the Faghur Basin to bypass this long gas plant and be directed to our existing 18-inch southern pipeline in the newly acquired Abu Gharadig plant and onward to the national gas, we had at the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline. 
So on gas train five and the Southern Pipeline loop projects should commence in early 2011. FEED studies with both the gas plant and the pipeline expansion have been completed. Negotiations to enter into EPC contracts are expected to be completed in the first quarter with project completions forecast in late 2012. With the addition of the BP properties [ph] continued drilling success in the Faghur and the two basins and each production infrastructure improvements for 2011 drilling campaign is set to be a busy one, with the forecast number of exploratory and tests up over 50% compared to 2010 and total well count expected to exceed 200 gross wells. 
In Australia, net production decreased a modest 5% in second quarter. Gad production decreased due to lower customer nominations, while oil production decreased due to natural decline in the Van Gogh oilfield. Van Gogh had a 52.5% working interest, averaged 23,700 barrels of oil per day net during the quarter, and the field has produced 11.2 million barrels gross, since startup in February, achieving project pay out in late September. 
On October 4, we shut in Van Gogh production in and the shoved him back go production and the FPSO production seals in the swivel portion of a detachable DTM system were found to be leaking and no hydrocarbon or liquids will leak to the ocean.  The failure of all swivel seals at the same time is pretty much impressive, and it's not an event that could have been reasonably foreseen. The result is that we have gone from a total seal failure to restarting production in 19 days. The temporary repairs have restored partial production to approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day gross.  Permanent repairs will allow Van Gogh to return to full production and 40,000 barrels of oil per day gross by mid-December. 
The BHP-operated Pyrenees FPSO development, in which Apache has a working interest that ranges from 28.5% to 31.5% continue to perform well in the third quarter, with net production averaging 23,600 barrels of oil per day, up 2,300 barrels per day on the second quarter. Total production from Pyrenees from start up through September 30 was 17.1 million barrels of oil gross. Pyrenees continues to believe in the steady 94,000 and 98,000 barrels of oil per day gross. 
Delta, Halyard and Devil Creek development projects remain on schedule to deliver first gas to the Western Australia domestic market in 2011. Halyard, in which Apache has a 5% working interest has a one-well tie back of the 2008 halyard gas discovery to our Varanus Island hub. First gas expected in May 2011. 
The Halyard project is designed for future well tie-ins expected at exploration success in the greater east far area. For example, Apache recently acquired a 55% in operatorship of the adjacent Spar field.  The Spar-2 appraisal well drilled in October found 163 feet of net gas play in the Upper Morrow objective. 
Upon testing and completion of this well, we've tied into the Halyard system. The Devil Creek development project and it's Apache has a 55% working interest, is 60% complete through September and are scheduled to deliver first gas from our Reindeer field by November of 2011.  Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform is 90% and installation of the 16-inch onshore raw gas pipeline from the beach process to the gas plant has been. 
To expand our exploration drilling inventory in 2011 and beyond, we've acquired eight new blocks in the Carnarvon Basin via purchase of [indiscernible], getting over 10,000 square kilometers of new exploration acreage, thus increasing our total acreage position in the basin by 35. Apache will operate all eight blocks at average to the 52%. 4,600 square kilometers of new drilling site will be acquired in these blocks, starting in December of 2010. 
Australia continue to offer attractive gas prices for new long term domestic contracts for further existing products. In addition, we made progress in monetizing our Julimar gas, signed two separate hedge of agreement for 20-year supply of LNG at oil-linked prices. One of these agreement's with the Tokyo Electric and the other one is with KOGAS [Korea Gas Corporation].  We also continued to add growth to our pipeline with the sanction of the Macedon domestic gas development project and the successful appraisal of our 2009 oil discovery at Balnaves. 
In the North Sea, production was flat in the second quarter. Increased output from our drilling program is offset by planned downtime at Bravo and Charlie platforms, an active drilling program that continue in Forties during the third quarter. Two of the field's fields four platform rigs will be in continuous operation. In addition, by quarter end, the though jack up will begin a six-month drilling training campaign over the Echo platform. Drilling has not taken place in Echo since July of 2005. 
Our satellite platform bridge linked to the Alpha platform is progressing for installation in 2012. This project will allow expansion of critical utilities the field, including expanding power generation, fewer processing capacity, high-pressure gas impression, dehydration, and most importantly 18 new slots for drilling. 
During the quarter, a new time lapse or 4D seismic survey was completed in Forties, with fast-track process data, coming available in time to influence the drilling locations previously referenced to Echo. Seismic imaging has driven the majority of drilling success at Forties for the seven years. These data, along with additional drilling slots and for the Alpha satellite platform should enable Forties maintain steady production in the 60,000 barrel day range over the next three plus years. 
In Argentina net production is at 7% for the second quarter. Gas production increased 11% as a result of the successful 2010 gas plus drilling program in. Neuquen. The TDS, San Sebastian drilling program and the increase in the order demand. For the gas plus pricing program, we've signed one gas contract for 28 million feet gas per day in August 2010 with Pampa Energy and we expect to sign a second contract with Pampa to 25 million a day this month. 
These two contracts were effective January 1, 2011, and specify a $5 per million BTU gas price for three years. These contracts will go a long way in pulling up our basket price in Neuquen Basin of our $3 per million BTU. In support of these contracts Apache has 18 wells a day in two fields in Neuquen Basin, with production capacity of 47 million cubic feet of gas per day. Additional wells are currently drilling. And by January 1, 2011, Apache will have more than 53 million feet of gas per day available to satisfy these higher-prices gas contracts. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now be happy to open up for questions."

Those of you who have followed us for many years know that Apache has a truly unique culture and is involved with strong sense of urgency and paramount of our employees and an independent mindset. And Apache's culture really is that the heart of how we build value and has taken us from very humble position not so long ago to where we are today. And I don't think there's anything that exemplifies more our third quarter, what that culture is capable of delivering for our shareholders. 
On the portfolio side, we announced the $7 billion acquisition of three entire upstream operating regions from BP and the Permian Basin, Canada and Egypt. These three positions have an excellent fit with our existing carriers and provide us with a rich inventory of growth and value enhancement opportunity for years to come. 
It was July 20, the last conference call, we were just announcing this step, and we were getting ready to get on a plane to go sell stock and debt for this important step forward. And while we clearly believed that the transaction had all the ingredients to make a great deal for our shareholders, we really didn't know how the share price would react, given the amount of new stock we were about to issue. 
Well, as most of you know, the stock actually went up by 5% in the three days after we announced, and this is opposite of what generally happens. Internally, we took that as an endorsement of Apache's ability to generate value out of the transaction. Obviously, we're honored with the vote of confidence. I want to ensure all of you, we'll do everything humanly possible to make good on this investment, to create long-term value for our shareholders. As of about an hour ago, we have now closed all three of the BP packages, if you haven't looked at the Wire, we just closed Egypt today. But we are integrating the people and starting to get our arms around the assets.  In addition, we expect to close on our merger with Mariner Energy when the vote ends on November 10.
We couldn't be more pleased and excited about the opportunity set we are building into our portfolio with the $11 billion in acquisitions. Through these steps we have added years of inventory to our core regions and have built the right footprint in what we believe are two new areas for us, the Deepwater oil exploration and LNG. LNG, for us, means the monetization of large North American gas resources at oil length prices. 
We've taken these steps on our own way which is the Apache way and we're confident that we'll constitute important foundations for Apache's continued growth and profitability during the coming decade. 
On the operating front, in the third quarter, we had a very successful quarter, with production was up 10% year-on-year and our cost and expense is on a per unit basis, excluding DD&A, it was down 3% year-on-year. John, Rod and Roger will give you more color on our results and developments during the quarter in a moment. Before getting to that, I'd like to put 2010 in a broader context, starting with where we were at the beginning of 2010 and what we look like going into 2011. 
If you recall, in February of this year on our 2009 year-end conference call, we were very bullish on what we've received in the acquisition market. We had amassed over $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and with commodity prices at more reasonable levels, we indicated that we would be very actively pursuing acquisition opportunity. Little did we know how attractive it would become. After the dust settles, and we have closed on all $11 billion of assets, apache's share count would have increased by approximately 12%, and we project we will end the year with a debt to cap of under 27%. 
Now on the flip side, on the production side, we are projecting December 2010 average production to exceed 775,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. So if you use the first quarter 2010 as a baseline, when Apache's production averaged 586,000 barrels of oil equivalent, we're entering 2011 with a third more firepower than we entered 2010. That added firepower will give us more cash flow to exploit the 3.8 million acres we acquired across three of the most prolific core areas Canada, Permian and Western Desert of Egypt. And the new core areas we've added in deepwater Gulf of Mexico has over 125 undeveloped blocks and interest in two world-class discoveries in Lucius and Heidelberg.   
Obviously, we're extremely excited about what we've been able to add to what we consider an already formative base and the opportunity that they bring to continue to add long-term value to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, John and Rod to talk about 2010 and '11 in a little more detail. Roger?

Steve commented about how 2010 is shaping up and in a minute, I'm going to give a further glimpse of what may be a truly outstanding 2011. But before delving into next year I'd like to provide a few key highlights, financial highlights to the current quarter results. We think we have fine results, even though there were a lot of moving parts with all these transactions closing. 
Production was up 3% over second quarter to a record 667,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Oil and liquids were, once again the kind, representing just over half our production, but over 3/4 of our revenue. Cash costs per boe were essentially flat with second quarter while DD&A was up 3% as you might expect, given that our acquisitions remain at prices above our historic reserve cost. 
Debt ended at $6.5 billion and debt to cap at 23%, and that excludes $1.2 billion of cash on the books at quarter's end. Also, just of our year of acquisitions doesn't overshadow the considerable progress we're making on the organic side of our business. You should know that from the first quarter to the third, our oil production jumped 17% or 48,000 barrels per day, and over 3/4 of that growth was attributable solely to drilling and development activities, primarily in Egypt and especially, Australia. 
Turning to 2011. We're just now in the early stage of the part of next year's plan, but one thing seems certain, our year-over-year production growth should be well into the double digit. Exactly how much our production growth depends on our ultimate capital budget, which will be fine tuned between now and the year end. Our preliminary however, our capital budget is likely to reach or exceed $7 billion, up from around $6 billion this year and well within cash flow at prices currently indicated for next year. 
We've hedged oil for 2011 to protect cash flow and it's current active capital campaign. While we believe that the supply and demand outlook strongly favors oil, with over 3/4 of our revenue tied to oil and liquids since last quarter, we've hedged 64,000 barrels per day for 2011. We used costless collars with floors between $65 to $70 to protect the downside and ceilings between $95 to $103 to retain upside potential. We now have about 100,000 barrels per day hedged in total for 2011 or just over 1/4 of our post-merger liquids production. 
In addition to ensuring sufficient cash flow and capital to get after the upside on recently acquired properties, we are focusing particular attention on our extensive inventory of oil and liquids prospect for next year. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a deep inventory of oil prospects already enhanced and not have to join the herd chasing after high-cost oil opportunities after essentially the train's already left the station. 
I would like not to hedge any additional North American gases at today's low prices. And we are continuing to focus capital on those international gas projects, which are commanding substantially higher prices. Everyday oil remains at this lumpy level since more debt reduction than earlier anticipated. Additionally, to ensure that we make a major dent in our debt, which should peak following the Mariner merger at over $8 billion, we anticipate selling $1 billion of property sometime in the first half of 2011. We're just now in the process of determining which properties we'll be selling. So it's a bit early to tell the precise location, timing and impact of those sales. 
The combination of high oil prices and property sales meant lower debt and greater financial flexibility, consistent with an A-rated company. With double-digit production growth pretty much a shoo-in for 2011, a portfolio that's low in oil, a deep inventory of drilling opportunities and a strong financial position, we look forward to what could prove to be a better year in 2011. John?

Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third qua",998,"Thank you, Roger. Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third quarter and the Canadian piece closed in early October. We took over operations in the BP Canada properties on Monday of this week and welcomed almost 300 new Apaches. We will take over the BP Permian assets December 1, meanwhile, we expect to close on the Mariner merger next week after their shareholder meeting on November 10. 
Third quarter North American production was up over 7% versus second quarter to just under 309,000 barrels equivalent per day. Fourth quarter volumes will be up substantially as we see the impact of BP and Mariner acquisitions. 
Gulf Coast production increased 7% from the second quarter. Drilling activity offshore continues to be severely impacted by the permitting process associated with post and conduit requirements. While our Gulf region has received seven of the first 12 permits given to the Gulf of Mexico, requiring both NTL-05 and NTL-06 compliance. They remain significantly behind the plans for the year. 
At least for now the lack of clarity on the process makes it difficult for the BOEM [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] to approve anything in a timely fashion. We are however, presently running five jack-up rigs and one platform rig offshore, drilling primarily for oil targets. With permitting delays resolved, we expect to have a very strong 2011 drilling program with the addition of the new assets from Devon and Mariner. 
Our third quarter project of note is the redevelopment of the hurricane-damaged Eugene Island 330 field now underway. Three wells have already been drilled and are expected to add some 2,000 barrels a day, with additional drilling to extend into mid-2011 on the 63% working interest field. 
In the Permian region, we increased production by 21% on partial quarter BP volumes at a very active drilling program. Permian region production is expected to be up again on the fourth quarter as core BP volumes and the Mariner assets are added in. The BP and Mariner transactions allow our newly formed Permian region to add substantially to an already robust oil Permian drilling inventory with at least 3,000 new identified locations. The region was already very active in the quarter with seven rigs, drilling 73 new wells, while 116 wells were completed as we caught up on a backlog of frac stimulation work. 
With the addition of the Mariner properties later this month, we expect to keep up the 20 rigs running in the Permian for 2011. We also reached agreement with Concho on the BP, more above the Yeso play in New Mexico. Apache acquired a 60% working interest in the operatorship of the joint properties. We have identified 800 drillable locations in the play and expect to be very active there next year. 
The region continues to evaluate horizontal drilling potentials in a variety of well known producing intervals in the basin. We continue to have success with horizontal completions in all water fluid operations notably North McElroy in the Grayburg formation, TXL South in the Clearfork and Shafter Lake in the San Andres, where we're seeing IPs in the 250 to 400 barrel a day range.
The Central region also increased production by 7% from the second quarter. Importantly, distribution and gas coverage was up almost 20% on their oil productions. The region activity continues to be dominated by horizontal multi-stage frac operations in the liquid-rich Granite Wash play in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. 
We expect to drill 40 horizontal Granite Wash wells this year. The first 19 are currently on production and producing a net of 2,600 barrels of oil a day and some 40 million feet of gas. As in the Permian, we continue to look for additional applications for horizontal drilling. With this in mind, we recently test what we believe to be the first horizontal test on the of the Hogshooter Wash interval of the Granite Wash play.  
This morning, we announced two very successful tests. Each well produced the initial rates of over 2,000 barrels of oil a day and continue to average more than 700 barrels a day and 3.5 million feet of gas after two months. We expect to drill 10 additional Hogshooter tests in 2011. 
Our Canada region production decreased 1.8% from the second quarter. That figure will be up substantially in the fourth quarter as we add in BP volumes and ramp up at Horn River. Our 50%-owned Horn River production continues to build and reach the 100 million per day gross raw gas milestone in August and is expected to reach 200 million per day by first quarter of 2011. 
We have 18 new wells on production in 2010 and expect to bring another 12 on during the remainder of the year. We will leave the year with 24 wells already drilled and awaiting completion. As mentioned earlier, our Canadian region is quickly integrating BP properties with the help of the 300 new Apaches who moved in last Monday. While it's a little crowded in our Calgary office, while we complete the space build out, we wanted to get the things together as soon as possible. 
The most notable operation in the BP asset base in Canada is the Noel field producing from the Cadomin and Doig intervals. In addition, the field appears to have significant modeling potential, for which testing is now underway. Noel field production is currently at 62 million cubic feet of gas per day and is expected to reach 96 million by the end of the year and 125 million by the second quarter of 2011. The region is especially excited about the strong drilling inventory and the multitude of workover recompletion opportunities that are available with the new BP acquisition. 
And now Rod Eichler will give you an update on international.

Apache's international operations saw a good quarter, averaging 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with production increasing in three out of the four countries of operation. 
Egypt's gross production increased 3% to 323,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production was only up slightly resulting from timing differences in the PSC cost recovery mechanism. New production from Faghur Basin fields and discoveries as well as from our mature development lease help push gross operated oil and gas production above the 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day mark for the third consecutive quarter. Phase 2 of the Faghur Basin infrastructure project designed to upgrade capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day was completed on schedule on September 30. 
The acquisition of BP's risk-rated assets is complete. All contracts and agreements have been finalized and the final approvement from the government of Egypt was received today, closing occurred about an hour ago. Upon assuming operatorship, in terms of pinging on the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline will commence and we expect it to be completed by year end. 
Minor modifications of the existing system will be completed during first quarter of 2011 that will allow high liquid yield gas from the Faghur Basin to bypass this long gas plant and be directed to our existing 18-inch southern pipeline in the newly acquired Abu Gharadig plant and onward to the national gas, we had at the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline. 
So on gas train five and the Southern Pipeline loop projects should commence in early 2011. FEED studies with both the gas plant and the pipeline expansion have been completed. Negotiations to enter into EPC contracts are expected to be completed in the first quarter with project completions forecast in late 2012. With the addition of the BP properties [ph] continued drilling success in the Faghur and the two basins and each production infrastructure improvements for 2011 drilling campaign is set to be a busy one, with the forecast number of exploratory and tests up over 50% compared to 2010 and total well count expected to exceed 200 gross wells. 
In Australia, net production decreased a modest 5% in second quarter. Gad production decreased due to lower customer nominations, while oil production decreased due to natural decline in the Van Gogh oilfield. Van Gogh had a 52.5% working interest, averaged 23,700 barrels of oil per day net during the quarter, and the field has produced 11.2 million barrels gross, since startup in February, achieving project pay out in late September. 
On October 4, we shut in Van Gogh production in and the shoved him back go production and the FPSO production seals in the swivel portion of a detachable DTM system were found to be leaking and no hydrocarbon or liquids will leak to the ocean.  The failure of all swivel seals at the same time is pretty much impressive, and it's not an event that could have been reasonably foreseen. The result is that we have gone from a total seal failure to restarting production in 19 days. The temporary repairs have restored partial production to approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day gross.  Permanent repairs will allow Van Gogh to return to full production and 40,000 barrels of oil per day gross by mid-December. 
The BHP-operated Pyrenees FPSO development, in which Apache has a working interest that ranges from 28.5% to 31.5% continue to perform well in the third quarter, with net production averaging 23,600 barrels of oil per day, up 2,300 barrels per day on the second quarter. Total production from Pyrenees from start up through September 30 was 17.1 million barrels of oil gross. Pyrenees continues to believe in the steady 94,000 and 98,000 barrels of oil per day gross. 
Delta, Halyard and Devil Creek development projects remain on schedule to deliver first gas to the Western Australia domestic market in 2011. Halyard, in which Apache has a 5% working interest has a one-well tie back of the 2008 halyard gas discovery to our Varanus Island hub. First gas expected in May 2011. 
The Halyard project is designed for future well tie-ins expected at exploration success in the greater east far area. For example, Apache recently acquired a 55% in operatorship of the adjacent Spar field.  The Spar-2 appraisal well drilled in October found 163 feet of net gas play in the Upper Morrow objective. 
Upon testing and completion of this well, we've tied into the Halyard system. The Devil Creek development project and it's Apache has a 55% working interest, is 60% complete through September and are scheduled to deliver first gas from our Reindeer field by November of 2011.  Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform is 90% and installation of the 16-inch onshore raw gas pipeline from the beach process to the gas plant has been. 
To expand our exploration drilling inventory in 2011 and beyond, we've acquired eight new blocks in the Carnarvon Basin via purchase of [indiscernible], getting over 10,000 square kilometers of new exploration acreage, thus increasing our total acreage position in the basin by 35. Apache will operate all eight blocks at average to the 52%. 4,600 square kilometers of new drilling site will be acquired in these blocks, starting in December of 2010. 
Australia continue to offer attractive gas prices for new long term domestic contracts for further existing products. In addition, we made progress in monetizing our Julimar gas, signed two separate hedge of agreement for 20-year supply of LNG at oil-linked prices. One of these agreement's with the Tokyo Electric and the other one is with KOGAS [Korea Gas Corporation].  We also continued to add growth to our pipeline with the sanction of the Macedon domestic gas development project and the successful appraisal of our 2009 oil discovery at Balnaves. 
In the North Sea, production was flat in the second quarter. Increased output from our drilling program is offset by planned downtime at Bravo and Charlie platforms, an active drilling program that continue in Forties during the third quarter. Two of the field's fields four platform rigs will be in continuous operation. In addition, by quarter end, the though jack up will begin a six-month drilling training campaign over the Echo platform. Drilling has not taken place in Echo since July of 2005. 
Our satellite platform bridge linked to the Alpha platform is progressing for installation in 2012. This project will allow expansion of critical utilities the field, including expanding power generation, fewer processing capacity, high-pressure gas impression, dehydration, and most importantly 18 new slots for drilling. 
During the quarter, a new time lapse or 4D seismic survey was completed in Forties, with fast-track process data, coming available in time to influence the drilling locations previously referenced to Echo. Seismic imaging has driven the majority of drilling success at Forties for the seven years. These data, along with additional drilling slots and for the Alpha satellite platform should enable Forties maintain steady production in the 60,000 barrel day range over the next three plus years. 
In Argentina net production is at 7% for the second quarter. Gas production increased 11% as a result of the successful 2010 gas plus drilling program in. Neuquen. The TDS, San Sebastian drilling program and the increase in the order demand. For the gas plus pricing program, we've signed one gas contract for 28 million feet gas per day in August 2010 with Pampa Energy and we expect to sign a second contract with Pampa to 25 million a day this month. 
These two contracts were effective January 1, 2011, and specify a $5 per million BTU gas price for three years. These contracts will go a long way in pulling up our basket price in Neuquen Basin of our $3 per million BTU. In support of these contracts Apache has 18 wells a day in two fields in Neuquen Basin, with production capacity of 47 million cubic feet of gas per day. Additional wells are currently drilling. And by January 1, 2011, Apache will have more than 53 million feet of gas per day available to satisfy these higher-prices gas contracts. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now be happy to open up for questions.

Those of you who have followed us for many years know that Apache has a truly unique culture and is involved with strong sense of urge",849,"Thank you, Tom and good afternoon, everyone and thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2010 results call. Those of you who have followed us for many years know that Apache has a truly unique culture and is involved with strong sense of urgency and paramount of our employees and an independent mindset. And Apache's culture really is that the heart of how we build value and has taken us from very humble position not so long ago to where we are today. And I don't think there's anything that exemplifies more our third quarter, what that culture is capable of delivering for our shareholders. 
On the portfolio side, we announced the $7 billion acquisition of three entire upstream operating regions from BP and the Permian Basin, Canada and Egypt. These three positions have an excellent fit with our existing carriers and provide us with a rich inventory of growth and value enhancement opportunity for years to come. 
It was July 20, the last conference call, we were just announcing this step, and we were getting ready to get on a plane to go sell stock and debt for this important step forward. And while we clearly believed that the transaction had all the ingredients to make a great deal for our shareholders, we really didn't know how the share price would react, given the amount of new stock we were about to issue. 
Well, as most of you know, the stock actually went up by 5% in the three days after we announced, and this is opposite of what generally happens. Internally, we took that as an endorsement of Apache's ability to generate value out of the transaction. Obviously, we're honored with the vote of confidence. I want to ensure all of you, we'll do everything humanly possible to make good on this investment, to create long-term value for our shareholders. As of about an hour ago, we have now closed all three of the BP packages, if you haven't looked at the Wire, we just closed Egypt today. But we are integrating the people and starting to get our arms around the assets.  In addition, we expect to close on our merger with Mariner Energy when the vote ends on November 10.
We couldn't be more pleased and excited about the opportunity set we are building into our portfolio with the $11 billion in acquisitions. Through these steps we have added years of inventory to our core regions and have built the right footprint in what we believe are two new areas for us, the Deepwater oil exploration and LNG. LNG, for us, means the monetization of large North American gas resources at oil length prices. 
We've taken these steps on our own way which is the Apache way and we're confident that we'll constitute important foundations for Apache's continued growth and profitability during the coming decade. 
On the operating front, in the third quarter, we had a very successful quarter, with production was up 10% year-on-year and our costs and expenses on a per unit basis, excluding DD&A, it was down 3% year-on-year. John, Rod and Roger will give you more color on our results and developments during the quarter in a moment. Before getting to that, I'd like to put 2010 in a broader context, starting with where we were at the beginning of 2010 and what we look like going into 2011. 
If you recall, in February of this year on our 2009 year-end conference call, we were very bullish on what we've received in the acquisition market. We had amassed over $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and with commodity prices at more reasonable levels, we indicated that we would be very actively pursuing acquisition opportunity. Little did we know how attractive it would become. After the dust settles, and we have closed on all $11 billion of assets, apache's share count would have increased by approximately 12%, and we project we will end the year with a debt to cap of under 27%. 
Now on the flip side, on the production side, we are projecting December 2010 average production to exceed 775,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. So if you use the first quarter 2010 as a baseline, when Apache's production averaged 586,000 barrels of oil equivalent, we're entering 2011 with a third more firepower than we entered 2010. That added firepower will give us more cash flow to exploit the 3.8 million acres we acquired across three of the most prolific core areas; Canada, Permian and Western Desert of Egypt. And the new core areas we've added in deepwater Gulf of Mexico has over 125 undeveloped blocks and interest in two world-class discoveries in Lucius and Heidelberg.   
Obviously, we're extremely excited about what we've been able to add to what we consider an already formative base and the opportunity that they bring to continue to add long-term value to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, John and Rod to talk about 2010 and '11 in a little more detail. Roger?"

Steve commented about how 2010 is shaping up and in a minute, I'm going to give a further glimpse of what may be a truly outstanding 2011. But before delving into next year I'd like to provide a few key highlights, financial highlights to the current quarter. We think we have fine results, even though there were a lot of moving parts with all these transactions closing. 
Production was up 3% over second quarter to a record 667,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Oil and liquids were, once again the king, representing just over half our production, but over 3/4 of our revenue. Cash costs per boe were essentially flat with second quarter while DD&A was up 3% as you might expect, given that our acquisitions remain at prices above our historic reserve cost. 
Debt ended at $6.5 billion and debt to cap at 23%, and that excludes $1.2 billion of cash on the books at quarter's end. Also, just of our year of acquisitions doesn't overshadow the considerable progress we're making on the organic side of our business. You should know that from the first quarter to the third, our oil production jumped 17% or 48,000 barrels per day, and over 3/4 of that growth was attributable solely to drilling and development activities, primarily in Egypt and especially, Australia. 
Turning to 2011. We're just now in the early stage of the core of next year's plan, but one thing seems certain, our year-over-year production growth should be well into the double digit. Exactly how much our production growth depends on our ultimate capital budget, which will be fine tuned between now and the year end. Our preliminary however, our capital budget is likely to reach or exceed $7 billion, up from around $6 billion this year and well within cash flow at prices currently indicated for next year. 
We've hedged oil for 2011 to protect cash flow and its current active capital campaign. While we believe that the supply and demand outlook strongly favors oil, with over 3/4 of our revenue tied to oil and liquids since last quarter, we've hedged 54,000 barrels per day for 2011. We used costless collars with floors between $65 to $70 to protect the downside and ceilings between $95 to $103 to retain upside potential. We now have about 100,000 barrels per day hedged in total for 2011 or just over 1/4 of our post-merger liquids production. 
In addition to ensuring sufficient cash flow and capital to get after the upside on recently acquired properties, we are focusing particular attention on our extensive inventory of oil and liquids prospect for next year. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a deep inventory of oil prospects already enhanced and not have to join the herd chasing after high-cost oil opportunities after essentially the train's already left the station. 
I would like not to hedge any additional North American gases at today's low prices. And we are continuing to focus capital on those international gas projects, which are commanding substantially higher prices. Everyday oil remains at this lumpy levels since more debt reduction than earlier anticipated. Additionally, to ensure that we make a major dent in our debt, which should peak following the Mariner merger at over $8 billion, we anticipate selling $1 billion of property sometime in the first half of 2011. We're just now in the process of determining which properties we'll be selling. So it's a bit early to tell the precise location, timing and impact of those sales. 
The combination of high oil prices and property sales meant lower debt and greater financial flexibility, consistent with an A-rated company. With double-digit production growth pretty much a shoo-in for 2011, a portfolio that's low in oil, a deep inventory of drilling opportunities and a strong financial position, we look forward to what could prove to be a better year in 2011. John?"

We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third qua",997,"Thank you, Roger. Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third quarter and the Canadian piece closed in early October. We took over operations in the BP Canada properties on Monday of this week and welcomed almost 300 new Apaches. We will take over the BP Permian assets December 1, meanwhile, we expect to close on the Mariner merger next week after their shareholder meeting on November 10. 
Third quarter North American production was up over 7% versus second quarter to just under 309,000 barrels equivalent per day. Fourth quarter volumes will be up substantially as we see the impact of BP and Mariner acquisitions. 
Gulf Coast production increased 7% from the second quarter. Drilling activity offshore continues to be severely impacted by the permitting process associated with post and conduit requirements. While our Gulf region has received seven of the first 12 permits given to the Gulf of Mexico, requiring both NTL-05 and NTL-06 compliance. They remain significantly behind the plans for the year. 
At least for now the lack of clarity on the process makes it difficult for the BOEM [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] to approve anything in a timely fashion. We are however, presently running five jack-up rigs and one platform rig offshore, drilling primarily for oil targets. With permitting delays resolved, we expect to have a very strong 2011 drilling program with the addition of the new assets from Devon and Mariner. 
Our third quarter project of note is the redevelopment of the hurricane-damaged Eugene Island 330 field now underway. Three wells have already been drilled and are expected to add some 2,000 barrels a day, with additional drilling to extend into mid-2011 on the 63% working interest field. 
In the Permian region, we increased production by 21% on partial quarter BP volumes at a very active drilling program. Permian region production is expected to be up again on the fourth quarter as core BP volumes and the Mariner assets are added in. The BP and Mariner transactions allow our newly formed Permian region to add substantially to an already robust oil Permian drilling inventory with at least 3,000 new identified locations. The region was already very active in the quarter with seven rigs, drilling 73 new wells, while 116 wells were completed as we caught up on a backlog of frac stimulation work. 
With the addition of the Mariner properties later this month, we expect to keep up the 20 rigs running in the Permian for 2011. We also reached agreement with Concho on the BP, more above the Yeso play in New Mexico. Apache acquired a 60% working interest in the operatorship of the joint properties. We have identified 800 drillable locations in the play and expect to be very active there next year. 
The region continues to evaluate horizontal drilling potentials in a variety of well known producing intervals in the basin. We continue to have success with horizontal completions in all water fluid operations notably North McElroy in the Grayburg formation, TXL South in the Clearfork and Shafter Lake in the San Andres, where we're seeing IPs in the 250 to 400 barrel a day range.
The Central region also increased production by 7% from the second quarter. Importantly, distributionally gas coverage was up almost 29% on their oil productions. The region activity continues to be dominated by horizontal multi-stage frac operations in the liquid-rich Granite Wash play in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. 
We expect to drill 40 horizontal Granite Wash wells this year. The first 19 are currently on production and producing a net of 2,600 barrels of oil a day and some 40 million feet of gas. As in the Permian, we continue to look for additional applications for horizontal drilling. With this in mind, we recently test what we believe to be the first horizontal test on the of the Hogshooter Wash interval of the Granite Wash play.  
This morning, we announced two very successful tests. Each well produced the initial rates of over 2,000 barrels of oil a day and continue to average more than 700 barrels a day and 3.5 million feet of gas after two months. We expect to drill 10 additional Hogshooter tests in 2011. 
Our Canada region production decreased 1.8% from the second quarter. That figure will be up substantially in the fourth quarter as we add in BP volumes and ramp up at Horn River. Our 50%-owned Horn River production continues to build and reach the 100 million per day gross raw gas milestone in August and is expected to reach 200 million per day by first quarter of 2011. 
We have 18 new wells on production in 2010 and expect to bring another 12 on during the remainder of the year. We will leave the year with 24 wells already drilled and awaiting completion. As mentioned earlier, our Canadian region is quickly integrating BP properties with the help of the 300 new Apaches who moved in last Monday. While it's a little crowded in our Calgary office, while we complete the space build out, we wanted to get the things together as soon as possible. 
The most notable operation in the BP asset base in Canada is the Noel field producing from the Cadomin and Doig intervals. In addition, the field appears to have significant modeling potential, for which testing is now underway. Noel field production is currently at 62 million cubic feet of gas per day and is expected to reach 96 million by the end of the year and 125 million by the second quarter of 2011. The region is especially excited about the strong drilling inventory and the multitude of workover recompletion opportunities that are available with the new BP acquisition. 
And now Rod Eichler will give you an update on international."
169838,104540945,86200,"Apache Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Apache's international operations saw a good quarter, averaging 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with production increasing in three out of the four countries of operation. Egypt's gross production increased 3% to 323,000 barr",1376,"Thank you, John. Apache's international operations saw a good quarter, averaging 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with production increasing in three out of the four countries of operation. 
Egypt's gross production increased 3% to 323,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production was only up slightly resulting from timing differences in the PSC cost recovery mechanism. New production from Faghur Basin fields and discoveries as well as from our mature development lease help push gross operated oil and gas production above the 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day mark for the third consecutive quarter. Phase 2 of the Faghur Basin infrastructure project designed to upgrade capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day was completed on schedule on September 30. 
The acquisition of BP's risk-rated assets is complete. All contracts and agreements have been finalized and the final approvement from the government of Egypt was received today, closing occurred about an hour ago. Upon assuming operatorship, in terms of pinging on the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline will commence and we expect it to be completed by year end. 
Minor modifications of the existing system will be completed during first quarter of 2011 that will allow high liquid yield gas from the Faghur Basin to bypass the Salam gas plant and be directed to our existing 18-inch southern pipeline in the newly acquired Abu Gharadig plant and onward to the national gas, we had at the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline. 
So on gas train five and the Southern Pipeline loop projects should commence in early 2011. FEED studies with both the gas plant and the pipeline expansion have been completed. Negotiations to enter into EPC contracts are expected to be completed in the first quarter with project completions forecast in late 2012. With the addition of the BP properties [indiscernible] continued drilling success in the Faghur and the two basins and each production infrastructure improvements for 2011 drilling campaign is set to be a busy one, with the forecast number of exploratory and appraisal tests up over 50% compared to 2010 and total well count expected to exceed 200 gross wells. 
In Australia, net production decreased a modest 5% in second quarter. Gas production decreased due to lower customer nominations, while oil production decreased due to natural decline in the Van Gogh oilfield. Van Gogh [indiscernible] had a 52.5% working interest, averaged 23,700 barrels of oil per day net during the quarter, and the field has produced 11.2 million barrels gross, since startup in February, achieving project pay out in late September. 
On October 4, we shut in Van Gogh production in the FPSO production seals in the swivel portion of a detachable torque boring [ph] of DTM system were found to be leaking and no hydrocarbon or liquids will leak to the ocean.  The failure of all swivel seals at the same time is pretty much impressive, and it's not an event that could have been reasonably foreseen. The result is that we have gone from a total seal failure to restarting production in 19 days. The temporary repairs have restored partial production to approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day gross.  Permanent repairs will allow Van Gogh to return to full production and 40,000 barrels of oil per day gross by mid-December. 
The BHP-operated Pyrenees FPSO development, in which Apache has a working interest that ranges from 28.5% to 31.5% continue to perform well in the third quarter, with net production averaging 23,600 barrels of oil per day, up 2,300 barrels per day on the second quarter. Total production from Pyrenees from start up through September 30 was 17.1 million barrels of oil gross. Pyrenees continues to believe in the steady 94,000 and 98,000 barrels of oil per day gross. 
Delta, Halyard and Devil Creek development projects remain on schedule to deliver first gas to the Western Australia domestic market in 2011. Halyard, in which Apache has a 55% working interest has a one-well tie back of the 2008 halyard gas discovery to our Varanus Island hub. First gas expected in May 2011. 
The Halyard project is designed for future well tie-ins expected at exploration success in the greater east far area. For example, Apache recently acquired a 55% in operatorship of the adjacent Spar field.  The Spar-2 appraisal well drilled in October found 163 feet of net gas play in the Upper Morrow objective. 
Upon testing and completion of this well, we've tied into the Halyard system. The Devil Creek development project in which Apache has a 55% working interest, is 60% complete through September and are scheduled to deliver first gas from our Reindeer field by November of 2011.  Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform is 90% and installation of the 16-inch onshore raw gas pipeline from the beach process to the gas plant has been completed. 
To expand our exploration drilling inventory in 2011 and beyond, we've acquired eight new blocks in the Carnarvon Basin via purchase of Faghur getting over 10,000 square kilometers of new exploration acreage, thus increasing our total acreage position in the basin by 35. Apache will operate all eight blocks at average to the 52%. 4,600 square kilometers of new drilling site will be acquired in these blocks, starting in December of 2010. 
Australia continues to offer attractive gas prices for new long term domestic contracts for further existing products. In addition, we made progress in monetizing our Julimar gas, signed two separate hedge of agreement for 20-year supply of LNG at oil-linked prices. One of these agreements with the Tokyo Electric and the other one is with KOGAS [Korea Gas Corporation]. We also continued to add growth to our pipeline with the sanction of the Macedon domestic gas development project and the successful appraisal of our 2009 oil discovery at Balnaves. 
In the North Sea, production was flat in the second quarter. Increased output from our drilling program is offset by planned downtime at Bravo and Charlie platforms, an active drilling program that continue in Forties during the third quarter. Two of the field's four platform rigs will be in continuous operation. In addition, by quarter end, the Lowen Gorilla Seven jack up will begin a six-month drilling training campaign over the Echo platform. Drilling has not taken place in Echo since July of 2005. 
A satellite platform bridge linked to the Alpha platform is progressing for installation in 2012. This project will allow expansion of critical utilities for the field, including expanding power generation, fuel processing capacity, high-pressure gas impression, dehydration, and most importantly 18 new slots for drilling. 
During the quarter, a new time lapse or 4D seismic survey was completed in Forties, with fast-track process data, coming available in time to influence the drilling locations previously referenced to Echo. 4D Seismic imaging has driven the majority of drilling success at Forties for the seven years. This data, along with additional drilling slots and for the Alpha satellite platform should enable Forties to maintain steady production in the 60,000 barrel day range over the next three plus years. 
In Argentina net production is at 7% for the second quarter. Gas production increased 11% as a result of the successful 2010 gas plus drilling program in Neuquen, The TDS San Sebastian drilling program and the increase in the order demand. For the gas plus pricing program, we've signed one gas contract for 28 million feet gas per day in August 2010 with Pampa Energy and we expect to sign a second contract with Pampa to 25 million a day this month. 
These two contracts were effective January 1, 2011, and specify a $5 per million BTU gas price for three years. These contracts will go a long way in pulling up our basket price in Neuquen Basin of our $3 per million BTU. In support of these contracts Apache has drilled 18 wells a day in two fields in Neuquen Basin, with production capacity of 47 million cubic feet of gas per day. Additional wells are currently drilling. And by January 1, 2011, Apache will have more than 53 million feet of gas per day available to satisfy these higher-prices gas contracts. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now be happy to open up for questions."

Those of you who have followed us for many years know that Apache has a truly unique culture and is involved with strong sense of urgency and paramount of our employees and an independent mindset. And Apache's culture really is that the heart of how we build value and has taken us from very humble position not so long ago to where we are today. And I don't think there's anything that exemplifies more our third quarter, what that culture is capable of delivering for our shareholders.
 On the portfolio side, we announced the $7 billion acquisition of three entire upstream operating regions from BP and the Permian Basin, Canada and Egypt. These three positions have an excellent fit with our existing carriers and provide us with a rich inventory of growth and value enhancement opportunity for years to come.
 It was July 20, the last conference call, we were just announcing this step, and we were getting ready to get on a plane to go sell stock and debt for this important step forward. And while we clearly believed that the transaction had all the ingredients to make a great deal for our shareholders, we really didn't know how the share price would react, given the amount of new stock we were about to issue.
 Well, as most of you know, the stock actually went up by 5% in the three days after we announced, and this is opposite of what generally happens. Internally, we took that as an endorsement of Apache's ability to generate value out of the transaction. Obviously, we're honored with the vote of confidence. I want to ensure all of you, we'll do everything humanly possible to make good on this investment, to create long-term value for our shareholders. As of about an hour ago, we have now closed all three of the BP packages, if you haven't looked at the Wire, we just closed Egypt today. But we are integrating the people and starting to get our arms around the assets.  In addition, we expect to close on our merger with Mariner Energy when the vote ends on November 10.
 We couldn't be more pleased and excited about the opportunity set we are building into our portfolio with the $11 billion in acquisitions. Through these steps we have added years of inventory to our core regions and have built the right footprint in what we believe are two new areas for us, the Deepwater oil exploration and LNG. LNG, for us, means the monetization of large North American gas resources at oil length prices.
 We've taken these steps on our own way which is the Apache way and we're confident that we'll constitute important foundations for Apache's continued growth and profitability during the coming decade.
 On the operating front, in the third quarter, we had a very successful quarter, with production was up 10% year-on-year and our costs and expenses on a per unit basis, excluding DD&A, it was down 3% year-on-year. John, Rod and Roger will give you more color on our results and developments during the quarter in a moment. Before getting to that, I'd like to put 2010 in a broader context, starting with where we were at the beginning of 2010 and what we look like going into 2011.
 If you recall, in February of this year on our 2009 year-end conference call, we were very bullish on what we've received in the acquisition market. We had amassed over $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and with commodity prices at more reasonable levels, we indicated that we would be very actively pursuing acquisition opportunity. Little did we know how attractive it would become. After the dust settles, and we have closed on all $11 billion of assets, apache's share count would have increased by approximately 12%, and we project we will end the year with a debt to cap of under 27%.
 Now on the flip side, on the production side, we are projecting December 2010 average production to exceed 775,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. So if you use the first quarter 2010 as a baseline, when Apache's production averaged 586,000 barrels of oil equivalent, we're entering 2011 with a third more firepower than we entered 2010. That added firepower will give us more cash flow to exploit the 3.8 million acres we acquired across three of the most prolific core areas; Canada, Permian and Western Desert of Egypt. And the new core areas we've added in deepwater Gulf of Mexico has over 125 undeveloped blocks and interest in two world-class discoveries in Lucius and Heidelberg.
 Obviously, we're extremely excited about what we've been able to add to what we consider an already formative base and the opportunity that they bring to continue to add long-term value to our shareholders.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, John and Rod to talk about 2010 and '11 in a little more detail. Roger?

Steve commented about how 2010 is shaping up and in a minute, I'm going to give a further glimpse of what may be a truly outstanding 2011. But before delving into next year I'd like to provide a few key highlights, financial highlights to the current quarter. We think we have fine results, even though there were a lot of moving parts with all these transactions closing.
 Production was up 3% over second quarter to a record 667,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Oil and liquids were, once again the king, representing just over half our production, but over 3/4 of our revenue. Cash costs per boe were essentially flat with second quarter while DD&A was up 3% as you might expect, given that our acquisitions remain at prices above our historic reserve cost.
 Debt ended at $6.5 billion and debt to cap at 23%, and that excludes $1.2 billion of cash on the books at quarter's end. Also, just of our year of acquisitions doesn't overshadow the considerable progress we're making on the organic side of our business. You should know that from the first quarter to the third, our oil production jumped 17% or 48,000 barrels per day, and over 3/4 of that growth was attributable solely to drilling and development activities, primarily in Egypt and especially, Australia.
 Turning to 2011. We're just now in the early stage of the core of next year's plan, but one thing seems certain, our year-over-year production growth should be well into the double digit. Exactly how much our production growth depends on our ultimate capital budget, which will be fine tuned between now and the year end. Our preliminary however, our capital budget is likely to reach or exceed $7 billion, up from around $6 billion this year and well within cash flow at prices currently indicated for next year.
 We've hedged oil for 2011 to protect cash flow and its current active capital campaign. While we believe that the supply and demand outlook strongly favors oil, with over 3/4 of our revenue tied to oil and liquids since last quarter, we've hedged 54,000 barrels per day for 2011. We used costless collars with floors between $65 to $70 to protect the downside and ceilings between $95 to $103 to retain upside potential. We now have about 100,000 barrels per day hedged in total for 2011 or just over 1/4 of our post-merger liquids production.
 In addition to ensuring sufficient cash flow and capital to get after the upside on recently acquired properties, we are focusing particular attention on our extensive inventory of oil and liquids prospect for next year. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a deep inventory of oil prospects already enhanced and not have to join the herd chasing after high-cost oil opportunities after essentially the train's already left the station.
 I would like not to hedge any additional North American gases at today's low prices. And we are continuing to focus capital on those international gas projects, which are commanding substantially higher prices. Everyday oil remains at this lumpy levels since more debt reduction than earlier anticipated. Additionally, to ensure that we make a major dent in our debt, which should peak following the Mariner merger at over $8 billion, we anticipate selling $1 billion of property sometime in the first half of 2011. We're just now in the process of determining which properties we'll be selling. So it's a bit early to tell the precise location, timing and impact of those sales.
 The combination of high oil prices and property sales meant lower debt and greater financial flexibility, consistent with an A-rated company. With double-digit production growth pretty much a shoo-in for 2011, a portfolio that's low in oil, a deep inventory of drilling opportunities and a strong financial position, we look forward to what could prove to be a better year in 2011. John?

Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third qu",997," Thank you, Roger. Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third quarter and the Canadian piece closed in early October. We took over operations in the BP Canada properties on Monday of this week and welcomed almost 300 new Apaches. We will take over the BP Permian assets December 1, meanwhile, we expect to close on the Mariner merger next week after their shareholder meeting on November 10.
 Third quarter North American production was up over 7% versus second quarter to just under 309,000 barrels equivalent per day. Fourth quarter volumes will be up substantially as we see the impact of BP and Mariner acquisitions.
 Gulf Coast production increased 7% from the second quarter. Drilling activity offshore continues to be severely impacted by the permitting process associated with post and conduit requirements. While our Gulf region has received seven of the first 12 permits given to the Gulf of Mexico, requiring both NTL-05 and NTL-06 compliance. They remain significantly behind the plans for the year.
 At least for now the lack of clarity on the process makes it difficult for the BOEM [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] to approve anything in a timely fashion. We are however, presently running five jack-up rigs and one platform rig offshore, drilling primarily for oil targets. With permitting delays resolved, we expect to have a very strong 2011 drilling program with the addition of the new assets from Devon and Mariner.
 Our third quarter project of note is the redevelopment of the hurricane-damaged Eugene Island 330 field now underway. Three wells have already been drilled and are expected to add some 2,000 barrels a day, with additional drilling to extend into mid-2011 on the 63% working interest field.
 In the Permian region, we increased production by 21% on partial quarter BP volumes at a very active drilling program. Permian region production is expected to be up again on the fourth quarter as core BP volumes and the Mariner assets are added in. The BP and Mariner transactions allow our newly formed Permian region to add substantially to an already robust oil Permian drilling inventory with at least 3,000 new identified locations. The region was already very active in the quarter with seven rigs, drilling 73 new wells, while 116 wells were completed as we caught up on a backlog of frac stimulation work.
 With the addition of the Mariner properties later this month, we expect to keep up the 20 rigs running in the Permian for 2011. We also reached agreement with Concho on the BP, more above the Yeso play in New Mexico. Apache acquired a 60% working interest in the operatorship of the joint properties. We have identified 800 drillable locations in the play and expect to be very active there next year.
 The region continues to evaluate horizontal drilling potentials in a variety of well known producing intervals in the basin. We continue to have success with horizontal completions in all water fluid operations notably North McElroy in the Grayburg formation, TXL South in the Clearfork and Shafter Lake in the San Andres, where we're seeing IPs in the 250 to 400 barrel a day range.
 The Central region also increased production by 7% from the second quarter. Importantly, distributionally gas coverage was up almost 29% on their oil productions. The region activity continues to be dominated by horizontal multi-stage frac operations in the liquid-rich Granite Wash play in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
 We expect to drill 40 horizontal Granite Wash wells this year. The first 19 are currently on production and producing a net of 2,600 barrels of oil a day and some 40 million feet of gas. As in the Permian, we continue to look for additional applications for horizontal drilling. With this in mind, we recently test what we believe to be the first horizontal test on the of the Hogshooter Wash interval of the Granite Wash play.
 This morning, we announced two very successful tests. Each well produced the initial rates of over 2,000 barrels of oil a day and continue to average more than 700 barrels a day and 3.5 million feet of gas after two months. We expect to drill 10 additional Hogshooter tests in 2011.
 Our Canada region production decreased 1.8% from the second quarter. That figure will be up substantially in the fourth quarter as we add in BP volumes and ramp up at Horn River. Our 50%-owned Horn River production continues to build and reach the 100 million per day gross raw gas milestone in August and is expected to reach 200 million per day by first quarter of 2011.
 We have 18 new wells on production in 2010 and expect to bring another 12 on during the remainder of the year. We will leave the year with 24 wells already drilled and awaiting completion. As mentioned earlier, our Canadian region is quickly integrating BP properties with the help of the 300 new Apaches who moved in last Monday. While it's a little crowded in our Calgary office, while we complete the space build out, we wanted to get the things together as soon as possible.
 The most notable operation in the BP asset base in Canada is the Noel field producing from the Cadomin and Doig intervals. In addition, the field appears to have significant modeling potential, for which testing is now underway. Noel field production is currently at 62 million cubic feet of gas per day and is expected to reach 96 million by the end of the year and 125 million by the second quarter of 2011. The region is especially excited about the strong drilling inventory and the multitude of workover recompletion opportunities that are available with the new BP acquisition.
 And now Rod Eichler will give you an update on international.

Apache's international operations saw a good quarter, averaging 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with production increasing in three out of the four countries of operation. Egypt's gross production increased 3% to 323,000 bar",1376," Thank you, John. Apache's international operations saw a good quarter, averaging 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with production increasing in three out of the four countries of operation.
 Egypt's gross production increased 3% to 323,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production was only up slightly resulting from timing differences in the PSC cost recovery mechanism. New production from Faghur Basin fields and discoveries as well as from our mature development lease help push gross operated oil and gas production above the 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day mark for the third consecutive quarter. Phase 2 of the Faghur Basin infrastructure project designed to upgrade capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day was completed on schedule on September 30.
 The acquisition of BP's risk-rated assets is complete. All contracts and agreements have been finalized and the final approvement from the government of Egypt was received today, closing occurred about an hour ago. Upon assuming operatorship, in terms of pinging on the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline will commence and we expect it to be completed by year end.
 Minor modifications of the existing system will be completed during first quarter of 2011 that will allow high liquid yield gas from the Faghur Basin to bypass the Salam gas plant and be directed to our existing 18-inch southern pipeline in the newly acquired Abu Gharadig plant and onward to the national gas, we had at the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline.
 So on gas train five and the Southern Pipeline loop projects should commence in early 2011. FEED studies with both the gas plant and the pipeline expansion have been completed. Negotiations to enter into EPC contracts are expected to be completed in the first quarter with project completions forecast in late 2012. With the addition of the BP properties [indiscernible] continued drilling success in the Faghur and the two basins and each production infrastructure improvements for 2011 drilling campaign is set to be a busy one, with the forecast number of exploratory and appraisal tests up over 50% compared to 2010 and total well count expected to exceed 200 gross wells.
 In Australia, net production decreased a modest 5% in second quarter. Gas production decreased due to lower customer nominations, while oil production decreased due to natural decline in the Van Gogh oilfield. Van Gogh [indiscernible] had a 52.5% working interest, averaged 23,700 barrels of oil per day net during the quarter, and the field has produced 11.2 million barrels gross, since startup in February, achieving project pay out in late September.
 On October 4, we shut in Van Gogh production in the FPSO production seals in the swivel portion of a detachable torque boring [ph] of DTM system were found to be leaking and no hydrocarbon or liquids will leak to the ocean.  The failure of all swivel seals at the same time is pretty much impressive, and it's not an event that could have been reasonably foreseen. The result is that we have gone from a total seal failure to restarting production in 19 days. The temporary repairs have restored partial production to approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day gross.  Permanent repairs will allow Van Gogh to return to full production and 40,000 barrels of oil per day gross by mid-December.
 The BHP-operated Pyrenees FPSO development, in which Apache has a working interest that ranges from 28.5% to 31.5% continue to perform well in the third quarter, with net production averaging 23,600 barrels of oil per day, up 2,300 barrels per day on the second quarter. Total production from Pyrenees from start up through September 30 was 17.1 million barrels of oil gross. Pyrenees continues to believe in the steady 94,000 and 98,000 barrels of oil per day gross.
 Delta, Halyard and Devil Creek development projects remain on schedule to deliver first gas to the Western Australia domestic market in 2011. Halyard, in which Apache has a 55% working interest has a one-well tie back of the 2008 halyard gas discovery to our Varanus Island hub. First gas expected in May 2011.
 The Halyard project is designed for future well tie-ins expected at exploration success in the greater east far area. For example, Apache recently acquired a 55% in operatorship of the adjacent Spar field.  The Spar-2 appraisal well drilled in October found 163 feet of net gas play in the Upper Morrow objective.
 Upon testing and completion of this well, we've tied into the Halyard system. The Devil Creek development project in which Apache has a 55% working interest, is 60% complete through September and are scheduled to deliver first gas from our Reindeer field by November of 2011.  Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform is 90% and installation of the 16-inch onshore raw gas pipeline from the beach process to the gas plant has been completed.
 To expand our exploration drilling inventory in 2011 and beyond, we've acquired eight new blocks in the Carnarvon Basin via purchase of Faghur getting over 10,000 square kilometers of new exploration acreage, thus increasing our total acreage position in the basin by 35. Apache will operate all eight blocks at average to the 52%. 4,600 square kilometers of new drilling site will be acquired in these blocks, starting in December of 2010.
 Australia continues to offer attractive gas prices for new long term domestic contracts for further existing products. In addition, we made progress in monetizing our Julimar gas, signed two separate hedge of agreement for 20-year supply of LNG at oil-linked prices. One of these agreements with the Tokyo Electric and the other one is with KOGAS [Korea Gas Corporation]. We also continued to add growth to our pipeline with the sanction of the Macedon domestic gas development project and the successful appraisal of our 2009 oil discovery at Balnaves.
 In the North Sea, production was flat in the second quarter. Increased output from our drilling program is offset by planned downtime at Bravo and Charlie platforms, an active drilling program that continue in Forties during the third quarter. Two of the field's four platform rigs will be in continuous operation. In addition, by quarter end, the Lowen Gorilla Seven jack up will begin a six-month drilling training campaign over the Echo platform. Drilling has not taken place in Echo since July of 2005.
 A satellite platform bridge linked to the Alpha platform is progressing for installation in 2012. This project will allow expansion of critical utilities for the field, including expanding power generation, fuel processing capacity, high-pressure gas impression, dehydration, and most importantly 18 new slots for drilling.
 During the quarter, a new time lapse or 4D seismic survey was completed in Forties, with fast-track process data, coming available in time to influence the drilling locations previously referenced to Echo. 4D Seismic imaging has driven the majority of drilling success at Forties for the seven years. This data, along with additional drilling slots and for the Alpha satellite platform should enable Forties to maintain steady production in the 60,000 barrel day range over the next three plus years.
 In Argentina net production is at 7% for the second quarter. Gas production increased 11% as a result of the successful 2010 gas plus drilling program in Neuquen, The TDS San Sebastian drilling program and the increase in the order demand. For the gas plus pricing program, we've signed one gas contract for 28 million feet gas per day in August 2010 with Pampa Energy and we expect to sign a second contract with Pampa to 25 million a day this month.
 These two contracts were effective January 1, 2011, and specify a $5 per million BTU gas price for three years. These contracts will go a long way in pulling up our basket price in Neuquen Basin of our $3 per million BTU. In support of these contracts Apache has drilled 18 wells a day in two fields in Neuquen Basin, with production capacity of 47 million cubic feet of gas per day. Additional wells are currently drilling. And by January 1, 2011, Apache will have more than 53 million feet of gas per day available to satisfy these higher-prices gas contracts.
 That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now be happy to open up for questions.
