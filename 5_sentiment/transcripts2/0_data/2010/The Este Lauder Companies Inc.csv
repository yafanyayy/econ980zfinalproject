I'm glad you have joined us for our fiscal 2010 second quarter earnings call. In our remarks today, I will discuss our performance in the quarter and further progress we made, advancing our long-term strategy. John will talk about the holiday season in the U.S. and the current state of the high-end beauty business worldwide. Lastly, Rick will provide the financial details. This morning, we reported great results, the strong topline growth and continued improvement in profitability, which was achieved against the backdrop of a challenging environment. Sales for the period were $2.26 billion, up 11% versus the previous year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 60% above the year-ago quarter to $1.28. In addition, we continue to make progress, advancing our strategic goals. We believe our sales grew faster than market trends in many key countries. Our international sales expanded faster than our U.S. business, moving us closer to our target of generating more than 60% of sales outside the U.S.Our results show a significant improvement in operating margin. Inventory days improved by 16 days from last year. Our turnaround brands collectively showed a substantial improvement in operating results for the first half before impairment charges compared to a year ago. And our cost savings initiatives saved $83 million this quarter, which was faster and larger than we had planned, including great progress in cost of goods. I'm pleased with these quarterly results and our strong staff executing our long-term strategy. Compared to the second quarter last year, our topline growth was driven by our robust International business, thanks to numerous strategies which are bearing fruit. We had solid growth in Asia-Pacific, led by Greater China and Korea. Sales in our European region expanded sharply, driven primarily by Travel Retail in the United Kingdom, Russia and Benelux. Sales in emerging markets, which are increasingly important contributions, climbed 14%. These countries, which include China, Russia, Turkey and Brazil among others, accounted for 12% of total sales.During the quarter, we opened an affiliate in Vietnam to support our growing brand presence there with a population of 86 million that is young, urban and has increasing disposable income. We see this emerging market adding to our growth in Asia.Our Online sales rose more than 25%. This division had its biggest sales day ever on Cyber Monday, nearly double the previous year. We now had e-Commerce site in nine countries and aggressive plans to expand further. Our strong topline growth was achieved with lower levels of advertising, sampling and merchandising as we started cutting ineffective spending in this difficult economy. We plan to accelerate a more effective investment in this area in the second half of fiscal year 2010. I will go more in detail on this topic later.During the first six months of our four-year strategy journey, we made substantial progress on our long-term objectives. In the recent quarter, we believe we gained share in many countries. In U.S. department stores, accordingly to NPD, our share expanded 10 basis points. Our retail sales outplays overall prestige beauty in several important countries including the UK, China, Spain, Russia and Germany.As we have said, a key initiative is to build our leadership in Skin Care. Our sales in this strategically important category climbed 12% in the quarter, excluding currency. Internationally, our Skin Care sales rose even faster, led by Estée Lauder brand. The first quarter launch of its successful New Advanced Night Repair was fueled demand throughout the brand. Its sales are so strong that Estée Lauder has become the leading brand in its distribution in China, Hong Kong and all of Asia combined in the first half of fiscal year 2010. Here in the United States, Clinique Skin Care share grew 30 basis points in the department store universe, which, for a brand of its size, is a clear victory. Clinique is the largest brand in U.S. prestige department stores and the largest in skin care. Even more impressive, 40 of the top 50 skin care SKUs in department stores are Estée Lauder Company's products.Our turnaround brands have made significant progress. Each one of these brands has a strategy to refocus on its most profitable and promising opportunity, and the early signs of improvements are encouraging. For the first six months of fiscal year 2010, their collecting efforts generated significant improvements in operating results, excluding impairment charges compared to  year-ago period. It was one of the top drivers of our year-over-year improvement.Prescriptives will shop (sic) [stop] its wholesale business on Monday. While it was a difficult decision, the closing has been handled extremely well, with Prescriptives' loyal consumers, retailers and employees. We have strategies in place to direct consumers to similar products of our sister brands, and we are adapting Prescriptive (sic) [Prescriptives] assets, formula, trademark and products to other brands, leveraging the power of our company. In fact, the cost to wind down the brand has been less than we projected due to the careful planning and execution of the transition.As you can see, we made real strides growing our business in many fronts. At the same time, we've also made substantial progress in our ongoing effort to reduce expenses in conjunction with our restructuring initiatives. For the first half of the year, we aligned total saving of $160 million, significantly higher than we expected. We are ahead of plan on cost of goods saving and some of the restructuring-emphasizing efforts. And we now expect full year savings to be between $275 million and $300 million. The saving this year are coming predominantly from improved cost of goods, resizing and restructuring activities and [indiscernible] (26:45) procurement. Part to our strategy is to bolster our capabilities in several areas which is crucial to making us even more formidable competitors. The company is accelerating investment in various digital application. Many of our brands have expanded their online and social media capabilities to market products, create stronger emotional bonds with consumers and provide information and resources. Our Bobbi Brown brand is helping lead this effort. It has attracted a growing number of followers on Facebook and Twitter, and this has launched a campaign on its website titled Pretty Powerful, using videos of real women to convey the brand's point of view. We will keep building our digital presence. We see it as a critical way to educate and reach consumers, and bring our brands and their philosophies to people across the globe. All of our brands are pushing comprehensive social networking and online campaigns. As part of this effort, a fan started a blog and communicates regularly with fans on Facebook and Twitter. Our M-A-C brand has one of the largest Facebook communities of any beauty brand, and launched e-commerce in Germany. In Japan, we began e-commerce for Clinique, including access from mobile devices. M-A-C and Bobbi Brown plan to follow in the third quarter. We are also piloting mobile e-commerce capabilities with Aveda in the U.S. and expects to expand this technology to other brands.Product innovation has always been a cornerstone of our success. Our biggest new product achievement this fiscal year has been the Estée Lauder brand Advanced Night Repair, which was formulated to appeal to many skin types. Now, we are advancing and fine tuning our efforts as our regional innovation centers in Asia and Europe to create locally relevant products for multicultural consumers. The next generation of products to be developed from these international themes would be unveiled in the coming 12 months.In the current third quarter, Clinique, even better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector will be a major global launch supported by comprehensive, integrated multimedia marketing effort including print, digital and national television advertising in North America and Europe. This product combats uneven skin tone, a large concern among many ethnicities around the world. It marks the first time at a stage treatment, rivals a prescription strength product for this concern. The key ingredients and the technology for even better Clinical was created in Asia, and we expect to develop many more cutting-edge products in this region.This quarter, our La Mer brand will introduce its breakthrough anti-aging regenerating serum, which we believe will bring new attention to this coveted luxury line. Another innovation effort is Green Chemistry, which minimizes the input on people and environment in all phases of the product lifecycle. We are extremely excited about a possibility that these new ventures will bring to our company.We continue to invest in our strategic modernization initiative, which is expected to roll out to nine North American manufacturing facilities this Spring. Subsequently, it will be deployed in the affiliate end regions. We appointed Christopher Wood, currently the General Manager of Korea to lead the SMI effort as it is integrated into the commercial side of our business. His broad international and brand expertise will serve the company well in this role.In the first six months of this fiscal year, we spent about $80 million less on advertising, merchandising and sampling than we did last year. However, even though we spent less, we invested it more efficiently. Our advertising was better elaborative and focused on product with high return such as Advanced Night Repair rather than allocated across many smaller launches, particularly in fragrances. However, we recognize the need to now increase our investment behind effective advertising, merchandising and sampling.With consumer spending rising and a general sense that the economy is starting to improve, we plan to accelerate our advertising for the next six months, spending between $150 million and $175 million more than last year. In the second half of the fiscal year, we are planning to invest efficiently and strategically behind big business building opportunities we have identified, which will include the highest investment in television and digital media we have ever made. Much of this will be allocated to developing markets.Throughout the remainder of the year, we expect Estee Lauder Brand to build on its fantastic momentum in Asia, particularly in greater China. And it will run three integrated print, digital and TV campaigns for skincare products. M-A-C opened 47 international doors in the first half and plans to add at least 45 more in the next six months, building strong awareness in many markets.We will continue to evolve our high-touch service model in department stores and other retail settings. We will also continue to strengthen our consumer insight capabilities, recognizing that the consumer thinking changed during this recession. And the company to have the first to understand and tap into her new mindset would be best position to win as global economies improve.We are confident in our direction, and in raising our full-year guidance based on our performance to date. However, economic and political risks still exist that could impact future results. Threats to our business includes continued high unemployment, a repeat economic downturn in the United States, in a more intensive wave of the H1N1 virus. We made great strides this quarter. Thanks to our employees worldwide and our exceptional leadership team. They worked with dedication and creativity to advance our strategic goals even while our company is undergoing an important cultural evolution in a difficult economy. Based on our success in the first six months of our strategic journey, I'm even more confident in our team's ability to realize our goal. Our organization has shown great flexibility and I'm extremely grateful for the positive response.Going forward, we believe that our constant focus on creativity and innovation throughout our operation, and the agility to adapt our high touch service to different channels will reinforce and advance our leading position in global prestige beauty. We are moving ahead with optimism, confidence and strength to accelerate our momentum. Now, I will turn the call over to John who will talk about the holiday season and the luxury market. John?"

Let me start by providing you with some insights into how the company faired in the recent holiday season. And then I will touch on the many ways we believe that we at the Estée Lauder companies are well-positioned going forward.In the United States, our holiday sales exceeded our expectations. In a difficult environment, consumers were attracted to value offerings across all of our brands. We had improve sell-through compared with a year ago. Our gift sets were highly successful and most of them sold out. The Estée Lauder brands annual blockbuster set has suggested retail price to this year a $55 along with a fragrance purchase. The price was higher than a year ago, but since its value was well communicated and readily apparent, we had 100% sellthrough and it drove traffic into the stores.In addition to holiday gift sets, we emphasized value in numerous ways at various suggested prices. Brand selections range from small sizes at entry-level prices to a large expensive products that offer great value. A case in point, John Malone offered little luxuries, a candle set for $30. And at the other end of the spectrum, a $390 luxury candle. Both items were virtual sellouts. As you well know, holiday is the largest selling season for fragrance. As a company, we had five of the top 10 women's fragrances in the United States prestige department store universe, as classic scents in general were the stars of the season. Estée Lauder Beautiful on the market for over 25 years was ranked number one with its flankers and gained share in a declining category. From our perspective, the aspirational luxury customer started returning with some force at the end of the year. High-end specialty department stores showed strong improvement in December which help boost our sales. We also saw increased traffic in our own free standing stores globally, a trend that has continued into January. Consumers not only responded well to our special holiday gift sets and offerings, but they also made many purchases for themselves. Our basic business, led by skincare and foundation was solid. M-A-C's foundation sales climbed 15% in the quarter and comprised 20% of its total business. And Estee Lauder Clinique's foundation products did well. We believe that our prestige products succeeded even in a challenging environment by offering priceless value through personalized service and creating an emotional connection with consumers. Our high-touch service model sets us apart and is influential in driving sales day in and day out.With a blurring of prices and products across mass and prestige, we are devoting more resources to emphasizing and reinforcing on what we do best: Providing individualized service that fits the right product to each consumer, high-quality in-store environments and effective sampling and promotions.As consumers have increasingly focused on value during this past year, M-A-C and Clinique, our entry level prestige brands had benefited the most. Both brands gained share this quarter, and M-A-C has had nine of the top 20 makeup launches in the United States department store universe this fiscal year.During the last year, U.S. mass channels performed better than prestige distribution for beauty products. However, this high started to change in November when prestige channels outperformed mass, a trend that has continued in December. Consumers in emerging markets, notably greater China, Russia and the Middle East are a growing force in the luxury arena. With rising incomes, they are gravitating to our aspirational brands. Our high-end brands include La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Estée Lauder's Re-Nurtiv collection have seen exceptional growth in Asia. In a more mature markets, the UK was a bright spot, benefiting from the influx of travelers from the continent who took advantage of the pound against the strong euro, as well as shoppers coming from Asia and the Middle East.We have a diversed portfolio of prestige products, suggested price points and a strong affiliate network around the world. This enables us to be agile and positions us extremely well to accelerate a particular brand or even certain products wherever there is demand. We can optimize our assets to our advantage and direct our advertising and promotions to areas that are fueling our momentum. We have the brand assets and creative talents to adjust our resources. And positioning whenever we see fit by strategically steering our investments to the most promising opportunities by brand, by country and by channel. We are confident that we can thrive.Now we'd like to call over Rick who will discuss this quarter's financial results. Rick?"

In local currencies, s",1651,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook excludes restructuring and special charges which I'll comment on separately.The quarter again came in better than expected. In local currencies, sales rose 6% over the prior year period when we were in the depths of the financial crisis. The impact of currency translation on sales growth turned positive this quarter, resulting in a reported sales increase of 11% to $2.26 billion. Net earnings for the quarter rose 62% to $256.6 million, compared with $158.2 million in the prior-year quarter. And diluted EPS was $1.28 compared to $0.80 in the prior year.We beat the midpoint of our sales projections by roughly $100 million. There were several factors driving the stronger than expected performance. Better holiday business in the U.S. and the UK accounted for about 75% of that overall performance. Much of the favorability came in December. Therefore, the majority of gross margin from the incremental sales dropped to the bottom-line.Furthermore, those sales came primarily from our high margins Skincare business, creating a favorable mix that contributed to a tremendous gross margin improvement. Operating expenses came in towards the lower end of our forecast as we exceeded our expectations for cost savings and some spending was deferred into the second half.Our improved inventory management, reduced obsolescence and the fantastic progress on our cost savings initiatives delivered about $33 million more in savings than we expected. Lastly, a lower-than-expected tax rate contributed to the variance.As it turned out, several potential risks that we mentioned in the last call did not impact our business. One of the largest threats was the H1N1 virus, which was prevalent but not severe enough to dampen people's travel plans or purchasing. However, since we didn't know how the risks will unfold, we took a conservative stance on spending.That said, we had a terrific quarter compared to last year. In line with our strategy, we continue to experience the strongest growth in skincare. Sales rose over 12% in local currency, with all three regions contributing to growth in this category, particularly Asia and Europe. In makeup, local currency sales rose 8% on strong international expansion of our makeup artist brands.In line with our strategy to improve fragrance profitability, we reduced a highly promotional portion of our U.S. business. As a result, our fragrance sales fell 6% excluding currency, but the category was far more profitable. Recent launches in the Michael Kors and DKNY brands were not large enough to offset the prior year introductions.In hair care, sales fell 1% due primarily to soft salon sales. Geographically, our international business continue to lead growth. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales gained 11% in local currency. Global Travel Retail sales experienced a sharp rebound of over 25%, contributing substantially to the increase. Travel Retail was better than we expected because international passenger traffic picked up sequentially each month. We expanded several brands into new doors and the H1N1 virus risk did not fully materialize.Our U.K. sales rose about 13%, driven by strong performance from our makeup artist brands and solid business at Estée Lauder and Clinique. Developing markets in the region contributed positively this quarter. For example, Russia and Turkey rose strong double-digit. The major Western European countries we're mixed, with Italy and France largely unchange while Germany delivered low single-digit growth. Pockets of trade destocking continued.Our strategically important Asia-Pacific region saw a 9% rise in local currency sales. Korea, our second-largest country in the region grew nearly 18%, and Hong Kong rose 24%. The momentum continues in China, which rose 26% fueled by their tremendous success of the Estée Lauder brand, like door growth and extended distribution. Japan declined mid-single digits as it continues to suffer from the tough economic environment.The flat local currency sales in the Americas reflected a continued caution of the consumer. Sales in department stores, salons in our own retail stores declined low to mid single digits. These declines were partially offset by sales growth from Latin America, products sold online and direct response to T.V. Some of the U.S. have asked about our presence in Venezuela. Our business there represents less than 1% of our global sales and we do not have a significant assets at risk in the country. Our gross margin improved by 150 basis points this quarter to 76.6%. The biggest contributors to the increase were lower obsolescence charges of 100 basis points and favorable changes in our mix of business of 60 basis points. Both of these factors were better than anticipated, and directly tied to our strategy and savings initiatives. The lower obsolescence reflects fewer SKUs and better inventory management. We also benefited from favorable manufacturing variances of 30 basis points, partially offset by an increase in the timing and level of promotion of 20 basis points and currency of 10 basis points.Operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter improved 290 basis points to 58.9%, compared to 61.8% last year. Our cost savings initiatives and conservative spending in the quarter contributed about 520 basis points. Lower losses from currency transactions added 20 basis points. These efforts were partially offset by higher IT and infrastructure costs of 50 basis points and asset impairment charges related to our Darphin and Ojon brand of about 200 basis points.Over the next six months, we expect to step up targeted investments behind effective advertising merchandising and sampling, our Online business, consumer insights, regional R&D and new high touch service concepts. Operating income rose 48% to $399.9 million compared to $270.6 million last year, and operating margin rose 440 basis points. Our cost savings initiatives are ahead of plan with total savings of $83 million or 370 basis points in the quarter, bringing our first half savings to $160 million. We are working to improve our tracking and measurement capabilities to fully incorporate the benefit of the strategic shift in our mix.Regarding our net interest expense, we reported $19.9 million in this quarter versus $19.6 million in last year's second quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, lower than expected due to the geographic mix of our earnings.In the quarter, we recorded net restructuring and other special charges of $300,000. Net cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2009 was $617 million, compared to $217 million last year. The biggest drivers of the game were higher net earnings, inventory improvements and the timing and level of tax payments.During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. Our day sales outstanding were 44 days this quarter, two days lower than last year. We continue to monitor the financial health of some key customers. Inventory days improved to 150 days, compared with 166 days last year. At the end of December, our SKU count was down 10% from a year earlier. We will be building inventory in our third quarter in advance of the rollout of SAP to North American manufacturing facilities this spring. The pickup in demand has made it more challenging to build these safety stocks, so we are focusing on protecting our top-selling SKUs across all brands. We spent $104 million for capital expenditures, which included spending for our company wide savings initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we expect to generate between $800 million and $850 million of cash flow from operations, and to use about $315 million to $330 million for capital expenditures.Looking ahead, our full-year forecast reflects the strong results to date, a slowly improving global economy and the lessening of some risks such as H1N1. We remained cautious about the consumer recovery here in the U.S. and the likelihood of a more aggressive competition for the remainder of the year. For the year, we now expect fiscal 2010 local currency sales growth of about 3% to 5% led by our international businesses. Currency is expected to add between two and three percentage points to our reported sales.Our full-year business model will look a bit different than the first six months. We expect to reap the benefits of our gross margin improvement and an increased spending efficiency to fund activities that will build market share and enhance our long-term brand equity. Our brands and affiliates have been authorized to invest in the second half against strategic priorities and to build on our sales momentum and shared gains. We expect to increase investments in advertising and key markets such as China, e-commerce and digital marketing programs, new high-touch service models, consumer insight capabilities, regional R&D and other marketing innovation efforts.We continue to pursue the cost savings initiatives we previously laid out for you, and we are increasing our full saving estimates for the year to between $275 and $300 million. For the full-year, we now expect to record charges of between $60 million and $90 million. Given our revised sales forecast, strategic investments and cost savings initiatives, we now expect a 350 to 380 basis point improvement in operating margin this year. At this time, we estimate our effective tax rate will range between 30% and 32% for the year.We are raising our full-year EPS forecast to between $2.55 and $2.73. Sales for our fiscal third quarter are expected to grow between 4% and 7% in local currency. Currency translation is expected to add about five percentage points to sales growth. We expect EPS for the three months ending March 31, 2010 to be between $0.20 and $0.30. We are very pleased with our business performance for the first half of the year. Our four year strategy is off to a good start, thanks to the great motivation and agility of our teams. We will continue to pursue cost savings to enable us to deliver sustainable profitable growth for the long-term. And that concludes my comments and we would be happy to take your questions now."

And that mix is three components, it's geographic mix, category mix and also within the each brand of SKU mix. The biggest driver is coming from the mix area. But we also have savings coming from our resizing and restructuring program, and our indirect procurement. So all of those are doing quite well. At this point, we said over the four year program, rather that we save between $450 million and $550 million, and we're not changing that number at this point in time.

So yes, we assume the competition will increase spending as well in the next six months, 12 months. So it's a fair statement to say that our extra spending is going to impact into a more competitive environment. However, it's not driven by that. Our extra spending in the next six months is driven first of all by the great learning of the current six months. We focused that this period in improving the targeting of our media spending. First of all, improving the quality of our communication, improving the mix of this communication, meaning focusing the communication and the investment in advertising, merchandising and sampling on big initiative with higher return in the most strategic countries and affiliates of the globe. And we have learned this improvement, all of these improvements are working very well for us because in front of the reduced spending, we got a substantial acceleration of our topline in the last six months. So for the next six months, we want to leverage these new learnings, this is a new way to become more effective and efficient in spending, which as I explained some time ago is also now based on more accurate rate of return on investment analysis on the spending. And to go back on the attack on our biggest initiative in our most strategic countries. And to build on current momentum to accelerate growth."

So we know these already, and we know, which is evident the results of these new strategy in our last six months. At the same, it's also true that they are not the only factor playing. As you said, it's clear that our topline growth comes from a continuous and successful overall share growth in markets, where the consumer is coming back, specifically Asia. Asia, the last months has been a stronger economy than what we had originally expected. And in that economy, we had a particularly strong program of growth, which obviously delivered results. The same we can say about Russia, about other developing markets. And this also is playing a role. Finally, our sales growth has also been accelerated in holiday season that went better than we expected. And finally, by some amazing results in Travel Retail, which delivered the increased sales against a better-than-expected traffic. But also importantly, against any success in the ability to control consumer from traffic to shoppers because we are also in travel retail growing market share accordingly."

When we speak about $15 million, $20 million woven [ph] a very important amount of better results than forecasted. So the majority of the better results are really coming out of topline sales and the sustainable impressive better cost of goods because of mix and restructure, resizing, indirect procurement. Means [ph] the last majority of our over-delivery, which just doesn't justify obviously, we need to get a better handle on these forecasting. But the majority is about very healthy over-deliveries. Sales growth, restructuring savings, indirect procurement, mix of cost of goods, reduction of the structure. All worth, honestly I predicted it was our focus. And specifically, I want to clarify that the fact that in many cases happens, that a good plan of SKU reduction, a good expansion on inventories creates more benefits the way the region estimates because in our case for example, it's having a very positive input on reduction of the structure. So, and then we have -- some less spending in advertising, merchandising and sampling which is attributable to the budgeting process which your question focused on. And the budgeting process is a process where we have a clear agreement on what we spend against which plan every quarter. But as I was explaining, there is some flexibility where we have a review every month in our business, where we review every month brand by brand, affiliate by affiliate, where affiliates and brands can make proposals to change their plans based on the competitive environment of the market forces. This is a point of strength and of [ph] agility. Normally, we don't see big variations, because what is spent last or moved is upset by other items in the total. In the last quarter, we saw this variation that I mentioned, which by the way is a small percentile of the total story of over-delivery. Said this, I want to go back on the fact that we understand your frustration with the trend that you had described, and we share it and we are focused to better in the future. But also, to clarify that, these last two quarters was very difficult to predict the environment. Let me say the way I see it. We had many integrated factors that were playing together the same time. First externally, was for us a bit difficult to predict how the economies will develop in this global world. In fact, Asia went better than what we expected, or it was difficult to predict the holiday season at a certain moment of time. And the holiday season went better, they weren't everyone expected, for sure in the U.K. and partially better also in the United States. It was difficult to predict this impact on the flu. As I explained, the flu could have been devastating on our Travel Retail business. While on the contrary, the Travel Retail business was a highlight of the last period. As you know it's a very profitable business when there is a variation there is a big impact on our business. The flu could have an impact also on holiday season which didn't on the contrary the only season where it was solid as I described. It was difficult to predict the trade destocking, the retailer destocking. That We have big trends of destocking that then somehow didn't continue for sure, it didn't continue in Travel Retail and in the U.S. At the same time, we had many internal changes with the first six months of the new strategy. What does it mean? There was a big cultural change and many people had to understand how to manage cost in a different way. It was difficult to predict how good the organization would've been able to buy into that. There was a new organization design as of July 1. With the creation of the region, a totally different dynamic correlation with the retailers and internal was difficult to predict that there would have been no issue at all in getting this going and went very smooth. As I already explained, the worse of the impact of SKU reduction and inventory on the structure and mix, there was much more positive. And finally, the effectiveness on the new way to invest a fee [ph] and a bigger attention to greater return to investment was a premiere for us. It was difficult to understand how fast this would have produced also positive topline results. So I think we have learned. We have learned a lot in this first six months. And I think we will apply this learning to our future ability to understand the strengths and the possibility of our strategy."

But there are still a lot to work to be done in front of us. We are ahead on the saving plans. The topline has to be obviously confirmed in its sustainability. In the internal capability buildings we are in line with goals. I will define it but not ahead. And articulately -- I need to become much more confident on the sustainabilities of this performance before adding any input on the topline growth and the long-term growth and the long-term margin goals that we have established."

This organization is becoming an efficient, effective and importantly integrated organization at the speed of light. If you want my honest point of view, I was worried about how fast this organization. Could they've been start working the way we are working. As you know, as we started we had a set of new corporate strategies, we had there strategies by brand, by function, by affiliate and we spend a lot of time in the beginning integrating all these strategies, and make clear that the organization should become more interdependent in all these aspect. This was a big cultural change for this organization, and there was a certain level of risk that it would be slow or will not work in certain areas. And that to say, the opposite is happening. This organization is integrating, is becoming very interdependent, the clarity on the strategies is everywhere. The processes, I was quoting the U.S. quarter like having affiliates meeting and all these is just the result of this integration and the way in which we are learning how to build scale. Actually, I believe you should see in the subject that we are overachieving the results, a sign that the ability to build scale and become interdependent organization is much better than the original estimate. And all these work we've exceeded I was referring to is actually a positive, at least not something I'm worried of in the future."

We had three out of the top 10 fragrances in the United States. Brand has been leading anti-age category. And with our largest Skin Care launch in Advanced Night Repair, and we are now the number one leading prestige skincare brand in Asia. So our core brands are performing better than the overall marketplace in terms of the Cosmetic business, outperforming the channels that we sell in and at the same time gaining share. The Fragrance business for the holiday season was difficult in its totality and our fragrance business, though difficult, outperformed what was taking place in the marketplace with strong ranks and strong performances well. Our Skin Care business in particular, as we discussed before, is strong in its strategic objective of the company, highlighting our product innovation and our high touch service in stores as well as our Foundation business. And the Color business has stabilized a bit. We also mentioned earlier in the presentation that up into November, the mass market was far exceeding the growth of the prestige channel. That switched in the month of November and December, and this is the first time that we've actually seen the prestige channel beginning to outpace mass. So we view this as a return of the aspirational consumer, and a more competitive set of aspirational brands competing effectively in the marketplace."

So it's really a big important area of growth and development where we are focusing on. In terms of presence, we have today in the tier one in two cities but there are so many other cities that we can grow on. So there is a possibility of expanding in China. Our portfolio brands in the future still there is a possibility of expanding the Karan brands in their existing distribution. There is a huge possibility of further enlarging distribution in different cities into larger parts of the population. And finally there is, at least we assume, very strong growth of the e-commerce China, also in China in which we are going to participate from the beginning of this strong expansion.

John will talk about the holiday season in the U.S. and the current state of the high-end beauty business worldwide. Lastly, Rick will provide the financial details. This morning, we reported great results, the strong topline growth and continued improvement in profitability, which was achieved against the backdrop of a challenging environment. Sales for the period were $2.26 billion, up 11% versus the previous year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 60% above the year-ago quarter to $1.28. In addition, we continue to make progress, advancing our strategic goals. We believe our sales grew faster than market trends in many key countries. Our international sales expanded faster than our U.S. business, moving us closer to our target of generating more than 60% of sales outside the U.S.Our results show a significant improvement in operating margin. Inventory days improved by 16 days from last year. Our turnaround brands collectively showed a substantial improvement in operating results for the first half before impairment charges compared to a year ago. And our cost savings initiatives saved $83 million this quarter, which was faster and larger than we had planned, including great progress in cost of goods. I'm pleased with these quarterly results and our strong staff executing our long-term strategy. Compared to the second quarter last year, our topline growth was driven by our robust International business, thanks to numerous strategies which are bearing fruit. We had solid growth in Asia-Pacific, led by Greater China and Korea. Sales in our European region expanded sharply, driven primarily by Travel Retail in the United Kingdom, Russia and Benelux. Sales in emerging markets, which are increasingly important contributions, climbed 14%. These countries, which include China, Russia, Turkey and Brazil among others, accounted for 12% of total sales.During the quarter, we opened an affiliate in Vietnam to support our growing brand presence there with a population of 86 million that is young, urban and has increasing disposable income. We see this emerging market adding to our growth in Asia.Our Online sales rose more than 25%. This division had its biggest sales day ever on Cyber Monday, nearly double the previous year. We now had e-Commerce site in nine countries and aggressive plans to expand further. Our strong topline growth was achieved with lower levels of advertising, sampling and merchandising as we started cutting ineffective spending in this difficult economy. We plan to accelerate a more effective investment in this area in the second half of fiscal year 2010. I will go more in detail on this topic later.During the first six months of our four-year strategy journey, we made substantial progress on our long-term objectives. In the recent quarter, we believe we gained share in many countries. In U.S. department stores, accordingly to NPD, our share expanded 10 basis points. Our retail sales outplays overall prestige beauty in several important countries including the UK, China, Spain, Russia and Germany.As we have said, a key initiative is to build our leadership in Skin Care. Our sales in this strategically important category climbed 12% in the quarter, excluding currency. Internationally, our Skin Care sales rose even faster, led by Estée Lauder brand. The first quarter launch of its successful New Advanced Night Repair was fueled demand throughout the brand. Its sales are so strong that Estée Lauder has become the leading brand in its distribution in China, Hong Kong and all of Asia combined in the first half of fiscal year 2010. Here in the United States, Clinique Skin Care share grew 30 basis points in the department store universe, which, for a brand of its size, is a clear victory. Clinique is the largest brand in U.S. prestige department stores and the largest in skin care. Even more impressive, 40 of the top 50 skin care SKUs in department stores are Estée Lauder Company's products.Our turnaround brands have made significant progress. Each one of these brands has a strategy to refocus on its most profitable and promising opportunity, and the early signs of improvements are encouraging. For the first six months of fiscal year 2010, their collecting efforts generated significant improvements in operating results, excluding impairment charges compared to  year-ago period. It was one of the top drivers of our year-over-year improvement.Prescriptives will shop (sic) [stop] its wholesale business on Monday. While it was a difficult decision, the closing has been handled extremely well, with Prescriptives' loyal consumers, retailers and employees. We have strategies in place to direct consumers to similar products of our sister brands, and we are adapting Prescriptive (sic) [Prescriptives] assets, formula, trademark and products to other brands, leveraging the power of our company. In fact, the cost to wind down the brand has been less than we projected due to the careful planning and execution of the transition.As you can see, we made real strides growing our business in many fronts. At the same time, we've also made substantial progress in our ongoing effort to reduce expenses in conjunction with our restructuring initiatives. For the first half of the year, we aligned total saving of $160 million, significantly higher than we expected. We are ahead of plan on cost of goods saving and some of the restructuring-emphasizing efforts. And we now expect full year savings to be between $275 million and $300 million. The saving this year are coming predominantly from improved cost of goods, resizing and restructuring activities and [indiscernible] (26:45) procurement. Part to our strategy is to bolster our capabilities in several areas which is crucial to making us even more formidable competitors. The company is accelerating investment in various digital application. Many of our brands have expanded their online and social media capabilities to market products, create stronger emotional bonds with consumers and provide information and resources. Our Bobbi Brown brand is helping lead this effort. It has attracted a growing number of followers on Facebook and Twitter, and this has launched a campaign on its website titled Pretty Powerful, using videos of real women to convey the brand's point of view. We will keep building our digital presence. We see it as a critical way to educate and reach consumers, and bring our brands and their philosophies to people across the globe. All of our brands are pushing comprehensive social networking and online campaigns. As part of this effort, a fan started a blog and communicates regularly with fans on Facebook and Twitter. Our M-A-C brand has one of the largest Facebook communities of any beauty brand, and launched e-commerce in Germany. In Japan, we began e-commerce for Clinique, including access from mobile devices. M-A-C and Bobbi Brown plan to follow in the third quarter. We are also piloting mobile e-commerce capabilities with Aveda in the U.S. and expects to expand this technology to other brands.Product innovation has always been a cornerstone of our success. Our biggest new product achievement this fiscal year has been the Estée Lauder brand Advanced Night Repair, which was formulated to appeal to many skin types. Now, we are advancing and fine tuning our efforts as our regional innovation centers in Asia and Europe to create locally relevant products for multicultural consumers. The next generation of products to be developed from these international themes would be unveiled in the coming 12 months.In the current third quarter, Clinique, even better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector will be a major global launch supported by comprehensive, integrated multimedia marketing effort including print, digital and national television advertising in North America and Europe. This product combats uneven skin tone, a large concern among many ethnicities around the world. It marks the first time at a stage treatment, rivals a prescription strength product for this concern. The key ingredients and the technology for even better Clinical was created in Asia, and we expect to develop many more cutting-edge products in this region.This quarter, our La Mer brand will introduce its breakthrough anti-aging regenerating serum, which we believe will bring new attention to this coveted luxury line. Another innovation effort is Green Chemistry, which minimizes the input on people and environment in all phases of the product lifecycle. We are extremely excited about a possibility that these new ventures will bring to our company.We continue to invest in our strategic modernization initiative, which is expected to roll out to nine North American manufacturing facilities this Spring. Subsequently, it will be deployed in the affiliate end regions. We appointed Christopher Wood, currently the General Manager of Korea to lead the SMI effort as it is integrated into the commercial side of our business. His broad international and brand expertise will serve the company well in this role.In the first six months of this fiscal year, we spent about $80 million less on advertising, merchandising and sampling than we did last year. However, even though we spent less, we invested it more efficiently. Our advertising was better elaborative and focused on product with high return such as Advanced Night Repair rather than allocated across many smaller launches, particularly in fragrances. However, we recognize the need to now increase our investment behind effective advertising, merchandising and sampling.With consumer spending rising and a general sense that the economy is starting to improve, we plan to accelerate our advertising for the next six months, spending between $150 million and $175 million more than last year. In the second half of the fiscal year, we are planning to invest efficiently and strategically behind big business building opportunities we have identified, which will include the highest investment in television and digital media we have ever made. Much of this will be allocated to developing markets.Throughout the remainder of the year, we expect Estee Lauder Brand to build on its fantastic momentum in Asia, particularly in greater China. And it will run three integrated print, digital and TV campaigns for skincare products. M-A-C opened 47 international doors in the first half and plans to add at least 45 more in the next six months, building strong awareness in many markets.We will continue to evolve our high-touch service model in department stores and other retail settings. We will also continue to strengthen our consumer insight capabilities, recognizing that the consumer thinking changed during this recession. And the company to have the first to understand and tap into her new mindset would be best position to win as global economies improve.We are confident in our direction, and in raising our full-year guidance based on our performance to date. However, economic and political risks still exist that could impact future results. Threats to our business includes continued high unemployment, a repeat economic downturn in the United States, in a more intensive wave of the H1N1 virus. We made great strides this quarter. Thanks to our employees worldwide and our exceptional leadership team. They worked with dedication and creativity to advance our strategic goals even while our company is undergoing an important cultural evolution in a difficult economy. Based on our success in the first six months of our strategic journey, I'm even more confident in our team's ability to realize our goal. Our organization has shown great flexibility and I'm extremely grateful for the positive response.Going forward, we believe that our constant focus on creativity and innovation throughout our operation, and the agility to adapt our high touch service to different channels will reinforce and advance our leading position in global prestige beauty. We are moving ahead with optimism, confidence and strength to accelerate our momentum. Now, I will turn the call over to John who will talk about the holiday season and the luxury market. John?"

Let me start by providing you with some insights into how the company faired in the recent holiday season. And then I will touch on the many ways we believe that we at the Estée Lauder companies are well-positioned going forward.In t",753,"Thank you, Fabrizio. Let me start by providing you with some insights into how the company faired in the recent holiday season. And then I will touch on the many ways we believe that we at the Estée Lauder companies are well-positioned going forward.In the United States, our holiday sales exceeded our expectations. In a difficult environment, consumers were attracted to value offerings across all of our brands. We had improve sell-through compared with a year ago. Our gift sets were highly successful and most of them sold out. The Estée Lauder brands annual blockbuster set has suggested retail price to this year a $55 along with a fragrance purchase. The price was higher than a year ago, but since its value was well communicated and readily apparent, we had 100% sellthrough and it drove traffic into the stores.In addition to holiday gift sets, we emphasized value in numerous ways at various suggested prices. Brand selections range from small sizes at entry-level prices to a large expensive products that offer great value. A case in point, John Malone offered little luxuries, a candle set for $30. And at the other end of the spectrum, a $390 luxury candle. Both items were virtual sellouts. As you well know, holiday is the largest selling season for fragrance. As a company, we had five of the top 10 women's fragrances in the United States prestige department store universe, as classic scents in general were the stars of the season. Estée Lauder Beautiful on the market for over 25 years was ranked number one with its flankers and gained share in a declining category. From our perspective, the aspirational luxury customer started returning with some force at the end of the year. High-end specialty department stores showed strong improvement in December which help boost our sales. We also saw increased traffic in our own free standing stores globally, a trend that has continued into January. Consumers not only responded well to our special holiday gift sets and offerings, but they also made many purchases for themselves. Our basic business, led by skincare and foundation was solid. M-A-C's foundation sales climbed 15% in the quarter and comprised 20% of its total business. And Estee Lauder Clinique's foundation products did well. We believe that our prestige products succeeded even in a challenging environment by offering priceless value through personalized service and creating an emotional connection with consumers. Our high-touch service model sets us apart and is influential in driving sales day in and day out.With a blurring of prices and products across mass and prestige, we are devoting more resources to emphasizing and reinforcing on what we do best: Providing individualized service that fits the right product to each consumer, high-quality in-store environments and effective sampling and promotions.As consumers have increasingly focused on value during this past year, M-A-C and Clinique, our entry level prestige brands had benefited the most. Both brands gained share this quarter, and M-A-C has had nine of the top 20 makeup launches in the United States department store universe this fiscal year.During the last year, U.S. mass channels performed better than prestige distribution for beauty products. However, this high started to change in November when prestige channels outperformed mass, a trend that has continued in December. Consumers in emerging markets, notably greater China, Russia and the Middle East are a growing force in the luxury arena. With rising incomes, they are gravitating to our aspirational brands. Our high-end brands include La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Estée Lauder's Re-Nurtiv collection have seen exceptional growth in Asia. In a more mature markets, the UK was a bright spot, benefiting from the influx of travelers from the continent who took advantage of the pound against the strong euro, as well as shoppers coming from Asia and the Middle East.We have a diversed portfolio of prestige products, suggested price points and a strong affiliate network around the world. This enables us to be agile and positions us extremely well to accelerate a particular brand or even certain products wherever there is demand. We can optimize our assets to our advantage and direct our advertising and promotions to areas that are fueling our momentum. We have the brand assets and creative talents to adjust our resources. And positioning whenever we see fit by strategically steering our investments to the most promising opportunities by brand, by country and by channel. We are confident that we can thrive.Now we'd like to call over Rick who will discuss this quarter's financial results. Rick?"

A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook excludes restructuring and special charges which I'll comment on separately.The quarter again came in better than expected. In local currencies, s",1651,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook excludes restructuring and special charges which I'll comment on separately.The quarter again came in better than expected. In local currencies, sales rose 6% over the prior year period when we were in the depths of the financial crisis. The impact of currency translation on sales growth turned positive this quarter, resulting in a reported sales increase of 11% to $2.26 billion. Net earnings for the quarter rose 62% to $256.6 million, compared with $158.2 million in the prior-year quarter. And diluted EPS was $1.28 compared to $0.80 in the prior year.We beat the midpoint of our sales projections by roughly $100 million. There were several factors driving the stronger than expected performance. Better holiday business in the U.S. and the UK accounted for about 75% of that overall performance. Much of the favorability came in December. Therefore, the majority of gross margin from the incremental sales dropped to the bottom-line.Furthermore, those sales came primarily from our high margins Skincare business, creating a favorable mix that contributed to a tremendous gross margin improvement. Operating expenses came in towards the lower end of our forecast as we exceeded our expectations for cost savings and some spending was deferred into the second half.Our improved inventory management, reduced obsolescence and the fantastic progress on our cost savings initiatives delivered about $33 million more in savings than we expected. Lastly, a lower-than-expected tax rate contributed to the variance.As it turned out, several potential risks that we mentioned in the last call did not impact our business. One of the largest threats was the H1N1 virus, which was prevalent but not severe enough to dampen people's travel plans or purchasing. However, since we didn't know how the risks will unfold, we took a conservative stance on spending.That said, we had a terrific quarter compared to last year. In line with our strategy, we continue to experience the strongest growth in skincare. Sales rose over 12% in local currency, with all three regions contributing to growth in this category, particularly Asia and Europe. In makeup, local currency sales rose 8% on strong international expansion of our makeup artist brands.In line with our strategy to improve fragrance profitability, we reduced a highly promotional portion of our U.S. business. As a result, our fragrance sales fell 6% excluding currency, but the category was far more profitable. Recent launches in the Michael Kors and DKNY brands were not large enough to offset the prior year introductions.In hair care, sales fell 1% due primarily to soft salon sales. Geographically, our international business continue to lead growth. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales gained 11% in local currency. Global Travel Retail sales experienced a sharp rebound of over 25%, contributing substantially to the increase. Travel Retail was better than we expected because international passenger traffic picked up sequentially each month. We expanded several brands into new doors and the H1N1 virus risk did not fully materialize.Our U.K. sales rose about 13%, driven by strong performance from our makeup artist brands and solid business at Estée Lauder and Clinique. Developing markets in the region contributed positively this quarter. For example, Russia and Turkey rose strong double-digit. The major Western European countries we're mixed, with Italy and France largely unchange while Germany delivered low single-digit growth. Pockets of trade destocking continued.Our strategically important Asia-Pacific region saw a 9% rise in local currency sales. Korea, our second-largest country in the region grew nearly 18%, and Hong Kong rose 24%. The momentum continues in China, which rose 26% fueled by their tremendous success of the Estée Lauder brand, like door growth and extended distribution. Japan declined mid-single digits as it continues to suffer from the tough economic environment.The flat local currency sales in the Americas reflected a continued caution of the consumer. Sales in department stores, salons in our own retail stores declined low to mid single digits. These declines were partially offset by sales growth from Latin America, products sold online and direct response to T.V. Some of the U.S. have asked about our presence in Venezuela. Our business there represents less than 1% of our global sales and we do not have a significant assets at risk in the country. Our gross margin improved by 150 basis points this quarter to 76.6%. The biggest contributors to the increase were lower obsolescence charges of 100 basis points and favorable changes in our mix of business of 60 basis points. Both of these factors were better than anticipated, and directly tied to our strategy and savings initiatives. The lower obsolescence reflects fewer SKUs and better inventory management. We also benefited from favorable manufacturing variances of 30 basis points, partially offset by an increase in the timing and level of promotion of 20 basis points and currency of 10 basis points.Operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter improved 290 basis points to 58.9%, compared to 61.8% last year. Our cost savings initiatives and conservative spending in the quarter contributed about 520 basis points. Lower losses from currency transactions added 20 basis points. These efforts were partially offset by higher IT and infrastructure costs of 50 basis points and asset impairment charges related to our Darphin and Ojon brand of about 200 basis points.Over the next six months, we expect to step up targeted investments behind effective advertising merchandising and sampling, our Online business, consumer insights, regional R&D and new high touch service concepts. Operating income rose 48% to $399.9 million compared to $270.6 million last year, and operating margin rose 440 basis points. Our cost savings initiatives are ahead of plan with total savings of $83 million or 370 basis points in the quarter, bringing our first half savings to $160 million. We are working to improve our tracking and measurement capabilities to fully incorporate the benefit of the strategic shift in our mix.Regarding our net interest expense, we reported $19.9 million in this quarter versus $19.6 million in last year's second quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, lower than expected due to the geographic mix of our earnings.In the quarter, we recorded net restructuring and other special charges of $300,000. Net cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2009 was $617 million, compared to $217 million last year. The biggest drivers of the game were higher net earnings, inventory improvements and the timing and level of tax payments.During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. Our day sales outstanding were 44 days this quarter, two days lower than last year. We continue to monitor the financial health of some key customers. Inventory days improved to 150 days, compared with 166 days last year. At the end of December, our SKU count was down 10% from a year earlier. We will be building inventory in our third quarter in advance of the rollout of SAP to North American manufacturing facilities this spring. The pickup in demand has made it more challenging to build these safety stocks, so we are focusing on protecting our top-selling SKUs across all brands. We spent $104 million for capital expenditures, which included spending for our company wide savings initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we expect to generate between $800 million and $850 million of cash flow from operations, and to use about $315 million to $330 million for capital expenditures.Looking ahead, our full-year forecast reflects the strong results to date, a slowly improving global economy and the lessening of some risks such as H1N1. We remained cautious about the consumer recovery here in the U.S. and the likelihood of a more aggressive competition for the remainder of the year. For the year, we now expect fiscal 2010 local currency sales growth of about 3% to 5% led by our international businesses. Currency is expected to add between two and three percentage points to our reported sales.Our full-year business model will look a bit different than the first six months. We expect to reap the benefits of our gross margin improvement and an increased spending efficiency to fund activities that will build market share and enhance our long-term brand equity. Our brands and affiliates have been authorized to invest in the second half against strategic priorities and to build on our sales momentum and shared gains. We expect to increase investments in advertising and key markets such as China, e-commerce and digital marketing programs, new high-touch service models, consumer insight capabilities, regional R&D and other marketing innovation efforts.We continue to pursue the cost savings initiatives we previously laid out for you, and we are increasing our full saving estimates for the year to between $275 and $300 million. For the full-year, we now expect to record charges of between $60 million and $90 million. Given our revised sales forecast, strategic investments and cost savings initiatives, we now expect a 350 to 380 basis point improvement in operating margin this year. At this time, we estimate our effective tax rate will range between 30% and 32% for the year.We are raising our full-year EPS forecast to between $2.55 and $2.73. Sales for our fiscal third quarter are expected to grow between 4% and 7% in local currency. Currency translation is expected to add about five percentage points to sales growth. We expect EPS for the three months ending March 31, 2010 to be between $0.20 and $0.30. We are very pleased with our business performance for the first half of the year. Our four year strategy is off to a good start, thanks to the great motivation and agility of our teams. We will continue to pursue cost savings to enable us to deliver sustainable profitable growth for the long-term. And that concludes my comments and we would be happy to take your questions now."

One is our inventory management and the SKU reduction programs, which are contributing tremendously to the improvement year-over-year. As well as managing our mix. And that mix is three components, it's geographic mix, category mix and also within the each brand of SKU mix. The biggest driver is coming from the mix area. But we also have savings coming from our resizing and restructuring program, and our indirect procurement. So all of those are doing quite well. At this point, we said over the four year program, rather that we save between $450 million and $550 million, and we're not changing that number at this point in time. We're happy that we're going a little bit faster in the beginning but we're comfortable with that target over the full year program."

So yes, we assume the competition will increase spending as well in the next six months, 12 months. So it's a fair statement to say that our extra spending is going to impact into a more competitive environment. However, it's not driven by that. Our extra spending in the next six months is driven first of all by the great learning of the current six months. We focused that this period in improving the targeting of our media spending. First of all, improving the quality of our communication, improving the mix of this communication, meaning focusing the communication and the investment in advertising, merchandising and sampling on big initiative with higher return in the most strategic countries and affiliates of the globe. And we have learned this improvement, all of these improvements are working very well for us because in front of the reduced spending, we got a substantial acceleration of our topline in the last six months. So for the next six months, we want to leverage these new learnings, this is a new way to become more effective and efficient in spending, which as I explained some time ago is also now based on more accurate rate of return on investment analysis on the spending.

So we know these already, and we know, which is evident the results of these new strategy in our last six months. At the same, it's also true that they are not the only factor playing. As you said, it's clear that our topline growth comes from a continuous and successful overall share growth in markets, where the consumer is coming back, specifically Asia. Asia, the last months has been a stronger economy than what we had originally expected. And in that economy, we had a particularly strong program of growth, which obviously delivered results. The same we can say about Russia, about other developing markets. And this also is playing a role. Finally, our sales growth has also been accelerated in holiday season that went better than we expected. And finally, by some amazing results in Travel Retail, which delivered the increased sales against a better-than-expected traffic. But also importantly, against any success in the ability to control consumer from traffic to shoppers because we are also in travel retail growing market share accordingly."

So the majority",800,"I would like first to take you straight to the numbers. It's true that it has been part of the spending. That is no mistake. When we speak about $15 million, $20 million woven [ph] a very important amount of better results than forecasted. So the majority of the better results are really coming out of topline sales and the sustainable impressive better cost of goods because of mix and restructure, resizing, indirect procurement. Means [ph] the last majority of our over-delivery, which just doesn't justify obviously, we need to get a better handle on these forecasting. But the majority is about very healthy over-deliveries. Sales growth, restructuring savings, indirect procurement, mix of cost of goods, reduction of the structure. All worth, honestly I predicted it was our focus. And specifically, I want to clarify that the fact that in many cases happens, that a good plan of SKU reduction, a good expansion on inventories creates more benefits the way the region estimates because in our case for example, it's having a very positive input on reduction of the structure. So, and then we have -- some less spending in advertising, merchandising and sampling which is attributable to the budgeting process which your question focused on. And the budgeting process is a process where we have a clear agreement on what we spend against which plan every quarter. But as I was explaining, there is some flexibility where we have a review every month in our business, where we review every month brand by brand, affiliate by affiliate, where affiliates and brands can make proposals to change their plans based on the competitive environment of the market forces. This is a point of strength and of [ph] agility. Normally, we don't see big variations, because what is spent last or moved is upset by other items in the total. In the last quarter, we saw this variation that I mentioned, which by the way is a small percentile of the total story of over-delivery. Said this, I want to go back on the fact that we understand your frustration with the trend that you had described, and we share it and we are focused to better in the future. But also, to clarify that, these last two quarters was very difficult to predict the environment. Let me say the way I see it. We had many integrated factors that were playing together the same time. First externally, was for us a bit difficult to predict how the economies will develop in this global world. In fact, Asia went better than what we expected, or it was difficult to predict the holiday season at a certain moment of time. And the holiday season went better, they weren't everyone expected, for sure in the U.K. and partially better also in the United States. It was difficult to predict this impact on the flu. As I explained, the flu could have been devastating on our Travel Retail business. While on the contrary, the Travel Retail business was a highlight of the last period. As you know it's a very profitable business when there is a variation there is a big impact on our business. The flu could have an impact also on holiday season which didn't on the contrary the only season where it was solid as I described. It was difficult to predict the trade destocking, the retailer destocking. That We have big trends of destocking that then somehow didn't continue for sure, it didn't continue in Travel Retail and in the U.S. At the same time, we had many internal changes with the first six months of the new strategy. What does it mean? There was a big cultural change and many people had to understand how to manage cost in a different way. It was difficult to predict how good the organization would've been able to buy into that. There was a new organization design as of July 1. With the creation of the region, a totally different dynamic correlation with the retailers and internal was difficult to predict that there would have been no issue at all in getting this going and went very smooth. As I already explained, the worse of the impact of SKU reduction and inventory on the structure and mix, there was much more positive. And finally, the effectiveness on the new way to invest a fee [ph] and a bigger attention to greater return to investment was a premiere for us. It was difficult to understand how fast this would have produced also positive topline results. So I think we have learned. We have learned a lot in this first six months. And I think we will apply this learning to our future ability to understand the strengths and the possibility of our strategy."

This organization is becoming an efficient, effective and importantly integrated organization at the speed of light. If you want my honest point of view, I was worried about how fast this organization. Could they've been start working the way we are working. As you know, as we started we had a set of new corporate strategies, we had there strategies by brand, by function, by affiliate and we spend a lot of time in the beginning integrating all these strategies, and make clear that the organization should become more interdependent in all these aspect. This was a big cultural change for this organization, and there was a certain level of risk that it would be slow or will not work in certain areas. And that to say, the opposite is happening. This organization is integrating, is becoming very interdependent, the clarity on the strategies is everywhere. The processes, I was quoting the U.S. quarter like having affiliates meeting and all these is just the result of this integration and the way in which we are learning how to build scale. Actually, I believe you should see in the subject that we are overachieving the results, a sign that the ability to build scale and become interdependent organization is much better than the original estimate.

In fact, the Estee Lauder brand is showing the first signs of stabilizing in the United States in many years, and the brand on a global basis is the key pillar of our corporations enhanced profitability in this time period. We had three out of the top 10 fragrances in the United States. Brand has been leading anti-age category. And with our largest Skin Care launch in Advanced Night Repair, and we are now the number one leading prestige skincare brand in Asia. So our core brands are performing better than the overall marketplace in terms of the Cosmetic business, outperforming the channels that we sell in and at the same time gaining share. The Fragrance business for the holiday season was difficult in its totality and our fragrance business, though difficult, outperformed what was taking place in the marketplace with strong ranks and strong performances well. Our Skin Care business in particular, as we discussed before, is strong in its strategic objective of the company, highlighting our product innovation and our high touch service in stores as well as our Foundation business. And the Color business has stabilized a bit. We also mentioned earlier in the presentation that up into November, the mass market was far exceeding the growth of the prestige channel. That switched in the month of November and December, and this is the first time that we've actually seen the prestige channel beginning to outpace mass. So we view this as a return of the aspirational consumer, and a more competitive set of aspirational brands competing effectively in the marketplace."

In terms of presence, we have today in the tier one in two cities but there are so many other cities that we can grow on. So there is a possibility of expanding in China. Our portfolio brands in the future still there is a possibility of expanding the Karan brands in their existing distribution. There is a huge possibility of further enlarging distribution in different cities into larger parts of the population. And finally there is, at least we assume, very strong growth of the e-commerce China, also in China in which we are going to participate from the beginning of this strong expansion. So a lot of possibilities. We also want to clarify that the success in China has huge impact on Greater China and on Travel Retail Asia.

I am pleased you had joined us for our fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings call. In our discussion today, I will review our performance and progress on our strategy.

In our discussion today, I will review our performance and progress on our strategy. Cedric will talk about the company international business and Rick will follow-up with financial details.
This morning we again announced strong results with solid sales gains and greater profitability. Third quarter sales were $1.86 billion, up 10% compared to the same period a year ago, with improvements in all regions and categories.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.34, more than double last year's results before restructuring charges.
I am also gratified that we continued advancing in many of our strategic goals. Let me give you some highlights; first, we believe that retail sales of our products grew at a faster pace than Prestige beauty trends in many critical countries and channels, which means that we increased share.
Excluding Prescriptives, we saw gains in US department store, as well as Russia and China among others. Our international business expanded more rapidly than our domestic business and we are approaching our target of generating more than 60% of sales outside our home market.
Our operating margin widened the gain, moving as closer to our long-range goal of 12% to 15%. Our Turnaround brands collectively showed continue improvement in operating results this quarter and we made additional progress in our cost savings initiatives.
In each of our three quarters, so far this fiscal year, we met or exceeded our sales and earnings estimates and successfully moved ahead of our strategic journey.
All of our employees should be extremely proud of these accomplishments, which are the results of their hard work and creativity and I want to thank them for their efforts.
Now let me turn to some of the specific areas that drove our growth this quarter. Our international business provided the greatest momentum. Asia Pacific remain robust led by strong gains in Greater China.
Sales in our European region climbed driven by travel retail Russia and the Middle East. Our strategy is to continue emphasis on our regions, which has enabled us to be more locally-relevant and accelerate our growth.
Estée Lauder brand enjoyed solid growth internationally in the quarter particularly in Asia-Pacific and travel retailing led by skin care sales.
Estée Lauder is the leading Prestige brand in Asia in our distribution. One of the most exciting developments in our foreign markets this quarter was the launch for our Origins brand in mainland China. The brand highly successful repositioning powered by nature proven by science has been directed by Senior Vice President and Origin General Manager, Jane Lauder.
She led the kick-off at the  Parkson Department Store in Shanghai, joined by Executive Chairman William Lauder one of the founders of Origins 20 years ago and other company executives and local celebrities. Cedric will give you more details about our international business in a few minutes, so, now I want to discuss other areas that drove our sales.
Clinique skin care sales grew over 11% at retail, thanks to strong launch activity and gained share in the US department stores. Clinique is the largest US cosmetic brand, so when a brand of its size gained share it is an impressive feat.
We were confident by the fact that US retail sales jumped strongly in March led by upscale department stores, which points to a possible initial recovery in consumer spending.
We are working closely with our large retail partners to create innovative shopping experiences in department stores. For example, we are refining our High-Touch services from education through post purchase. We are also leveraging in-store services differentiating by store size to better serve the needs of our consumer and improved profitability.
Our e-commerce business grew 25% with most of our brand sites reporting double-digit growth. Retailer side in North America also posted solid sales gain. In addition, we expanded our global web presence, Clinique launched online sales in Germany and M.A.C started e-commerce and mobile commerce in Japan.
Bobbi Brown will follow with both types of online shopping in Japan next month. As you know, one of our key mission is to build up on our global leadership position in skin care. This universal focus across our brands is reflected in our results.
In the recent quarter, reported skin care sales rose 16%, and we launched two breakthrough products that we believe will be important contributors to their respective brand portfolios for many years to come.
Toward the end of the quarter Clinique began shipments of Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector, which treats uneven skin tone with results that are comparable to a leading prescription ingredient.
We have high expectations for Even Better Clinical and are supporting it with an unprecedented television campaign in the US, which launched last week. The commercials will run for five weeks including prime spots during American Idol and Dancing With The Stars.
Our other major introduction was La Mer Regenerating Serum, which is the brand's first anti aging product. We are excited by its initial phase, but also encouraged that the serum has reached the sales of the brands Signature moisturizer.
La Mer is one of our high end Prestige brands and it had double-digit sales growth with particular strength in North America, the UK and travel retail. We believe that consumer are beginning to reconsider luxury products. It certainly bodes well for our entire Prestige portfolio.
Another standout in skin care is Origins, which has been remarkable consumer acceptance in its revamped skin care line. Origins had outstanding comp door growth in its major US retailers during the quarter. It also has been terrific improvement in the UK where sales grew 12% this quarter. With new merchandizing, advertising and communications the brand global sales rose high-single digits led by new products including GinZing eye cream and Brighter by Nature skin peels.
In makeup reported sales increased 2%m due to the improvements by both of our makeup Artists Brands, M A C and Bobbi Brown. M A C, enjoyed strong sales growth in Europe and Asia. Its brand equity and philosophy is closely tied to its annual Viva Glam lipsticks sales, which benefit the M.A.C AIDS Fund.
This year Viva Glam, spokespersons Lady Gaga and Cindy Lauper drew huge media attention. Sales of Viva Glam product exceeded forecast and had a (halo) effect on the rise of the business. Last week M A C took the Viva Glam range to Asia. Lady Gaga performed in Tokyo, which generated terrific media coverage. This month M A C open it's most innovative and technology driven store in Times Square. This busy area attracts close to thousand billion people a day making this location a superb retail opportunity.
Bobbi Brown recently, visited China to do television and magazine interviews and make-up artists events to build brand awareness. She previewed upcoming launches, which we expect will increase sales in the current quarter.
At Derek Lam's recent show during New York Fashion Week, the Estée Lauder brand's new Creative Makeup Director, Tom Pecheux gave a preview of the colors Estée Lauder will debut this fall. This was the first time the brand had been involved in backstage with the high profile runaway show.
Evelyn Lauder, Estée Lauder's Senior Vice President and Creative Director work closely with Tom to create the first collection and we had the static imagery to support it. We think his strong ties to beauty and fashion editors will attract a more fashion-conscious consumer and bring increased [buzz] and attention to our flagship brands when these products hit stores.
Along with the sales gains we generated, we also increased our profitability. Our restructuring efforts are enabling us to work more efficiently. As part of our ongoing cost reduction, we trimmed $104 million largely achieved in cost of goods, indirect procurement and resizing and restructuring initiatives.
Our year-to-year savings totaled $264 million and we now expect to save $300 to $330 million for the fiscal year. As you know, we have committed to reinvest a portion of our savings to build capabilities. We are also re-focused on continuously improving our productivity. Starting this July, we'll establish a company-wide mandate and plan that employ cost increase more slowly than sales growth.
Our Turnaround brands showed solid financial improvements, which have strengthened our bottom-line. The official closing of Prescriptives wholesale business on January 31 was executed flawlessly and we received praise from retailers noting how well it was handled. We moved the certain employees to other parts of the company and of transferring popular Prescriptives products and formulas to other brands including Calyx fragrance, which is now past over Aramis and Designer Fragrances. Some Prescriptives retail counters will be assumed by our other brands and its online sales will continue for a period of time.
The Aramis and Designer Fragrances division has begun reaping the benefit of a profit improvements strategy started in May 2008. It has dramatically improved its cost of goods, cut its SKUs by over 50 % in the last three years and is launching fewer fragrances with bigger impact. The recent European introduction of PureDKNY was well received. The fragrance is innovative because of its sustainability platform, which is unusual in the category. ADF also began distributing the Coach Fragrance in the US department stores, broadening its availability beyond Coach retail stores.
Another key component of our strategy is to enhance our capabilities in certain areas to improve our competiveness. To that end we announced the establishment of a Corporate Marketing Center of Excellence; which will be a resource for our research and development teams, brands and region as we develop greater consumer insights and marketing tools
Georgia Garinois, who worked for Johnson & Johnson, has joined us to lead the new center. His responsibilities include capability development in multicultural marketing, global consumer insight, customer relationship management, digital marketing and advertising services. Georgia reports to me and he is a member of the executive leadership team. 
One of the company’s historical trends has been our innovation and creativity. We believe by utilizing more in-depth consumer insights and focusing our efforts on the biggest opportunities, we will produce even greater creative breakthroughs across the company.
Our approach is to be creativity-driven and consumer-inspired. We are developing a strong pipeline of new initiatives to drive growth over the next three years. We are planning launches that will include new product ideas as well as existing successful products  that we will improve with updated technology, similar to what we did with Advanced Night Repair.
We will also accelerate innovation of the High-Touch, which integrate our products to create a well differentiated Prestige experience. We will give you further details as this initiative near their launch dates.
Earlier this month, we rolled out our strategic modernization initiative to nine North American manufacturing facilities. Over 80% of our in-house product is now on SAP. Although it is too early to give details, the implementation is being smooth and we haven't encountered any major problems.
On our next earning call in August, we plan to provide early results of the North American effort, review the SMI project and discuss future steps.
With just two months left in fiscal 2010, William Lauder and I are extremely pleased with how far we have come in the first lag of our four-year strategy journey. Looking ahead, we are prepared to move the company from successfully navigating in a recession to growing during a recovery.
We plan to continue taking aggressive steps to fuel our momentum. For example, our target advertising and promotional spending will be significantly higher in the fourth quarter versus the previous year, which should help to drive sales going into fiscal 2011.
We will focus on our biggest opportunities including major product launches in the best performing countries and our largest brands. As our performance this year should confirm we are growth company. Furthermore, as global economy returns to more solid footing and employment levels improve the money spend on Prestige beauty product worldwide is expected to gradually return to historical norms. We fully expect to capture a bigger share of the growth in sight.
Now, I will turn the call over the Cedric Prouvé who will talk about his area of the business. Cedric?

As Fabrizio mentioned, the international business once again enjoyed strong sales and earnings growth in the recent quarter. In fact our sales have increased every year for the last decade in local currency,",1353,"Thank you, Fabrizio and good morning everyone. As Fabrizio mentioned, the international business once again enjoyed strong sales and earnings growth in the recent quarter. In fact our sales have increased every year for the last decade in local currency, underscoring how important the international operations are to the company as a whole.
International accounts for nearly 60% of sales, is the major growth driver and it's transforming to the Estée Lauder company in to a true global power house.
Let me briefly explain why we have been so successful expanding our brands in to more than 140 products. First, we have a highly effective organization led by strong regional teams that are developing expanded capability. They are supported by a powerful network of global affiliates, which stay in touch with our consumer's taste and thinking and provide excellence on-the-ground execution. 
Our international organization continues to evolve and align with our global brands and functions. Of course, we also have a diverse portfolio of professional Prestige brands that allow us to leverage our strategies and optimize our growth, based on where we see the most promising opportunities.
Market characteristics dictate our investments by categories, product, brands and channels. At the same time we strive to balance our growth among emerging, developing and mature countries, again in alignment with each of our brand strategic priorities and plans.
This year every international region is ahead of its sales and profit objectives after the third quarter. Asia however is the standout with continued superb momentum. Within Asia, Greater China has been a key performer. The region's growth has been fueled by skin care, which accounts for a large majority of its sales.
Our strongest brand in Asia at the moment is Estée Lauder, which has seen such astounding skin care sales in China that in the recent quarter it became the brand's largest international business surpassing the UK.
Earlier Fabrizio mentioned Origins recent launch in China. We believe that Origins will be a perfect fit since Chinese consumers are passionate about skin care and natural ingredients. In its first week Origins was the top selling beauty brand in the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai. Since its launch Origins retail sales have exceeded our projections. We expect the brand to have six doors in Beijing and Shanghai by June 30th.
Origins is a ninth brand who joined the China portfolio. Our most widely distributed brands are available in about 80 department stores across 35 of China's largest cities. Our brands are also present in about 80 separate doors in the country. There is still much room for the expansion, which we are directing deliberately and strategically. We are extremely pleased that China is no longer dilutive to the average profitability of the Asia Pacific region and our results in the country have consistently outpaced our five-year projections for sales and profits by at least a year.
China is the largest of our emerging markets, which as a total grew 18% in the third quarter. They account now for 12% of total company sales and extend well beyond the BRIC foursome to also include Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Turkey just to name a few.
One way we accelerate our growth in the emerging market is by establishing our own affiliates early on. This enable us to hire the best local latent, which gives us a competitive advantage and develop a long-term strategy and investment plan. Our newest affiliate in Vietnam had strong double-digit growth in the third quarter and we will maintain the momentum by launching M-A-C there in this fiscal year.
As you heard travel retails performance was strong and it rebounded sharply from the weak environment of a year ago. The improvement was so great that the division had its best sales month ever in March. The channel was helped by higher passenger traffic, initial success converting more travelers to buyers, great growth in Asia/Pacific and some restocking following last year’s difficult climate. We continue to open doors for our younger brands, which accounted for about 15% of its sales growth this quarter.
Our results in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region were mixed with emerging markets outperforming the more mature ones. However, we believe we gained market share in our distribution despite market challenges in certain countries.
Our UK team has done an excellent job navigating our largest affiliate through a difficult economic environment especially in Ireland, while growing and gaining share in our distribution. Some of our less developed brands including Jo Malone and Tom Ford showed solid gains in the European regions.
M-A-C and Bobbi Brown were also strong and we plan to expand their point-of-sales including more freestanding stores, which allow us the best possible presentation to express their brand equity.
Business in Latin America has met our expectation, despite recent disruption in Chile and in Venezuela. The region's sales have more than doubled than last several years and our brands have sold well in Brazil and Mexico.
The company has started fulfilling its mission to become completely integrated, so that the best ideas and products generated in one area can easily translate and travel to the rest of the world.
As an example, when the Estée Lauder brand set out to create skin care commercials for Asian TV, it produced them on a location in Hong Kong, where the new launches of skin products and local spice anesthetics were best understood. The ads were such a success that the brand will use some of them worldwide.
Our international business has delivered excellent cost savings, which has helped improve profitability and allowed us o increase investments. Most of the incremental spending has gone to emerging markets to see future growth.
We expect to spend about 50% more on TV advertising this quarter throughout this country to raise awareness of our core brands and fuel our momentum. For the first time, the Estée Lauder brand will run three integrated marketing campaigns in Asia, using television, print and digital simultaneously for its skin care products. This is a prime example of how we allocate our investments to ensure that our momentum continues.
Internationally, there are many growth opportunities in department stores, particularly in Asia where the channel remain strong. However we are also pursuing other Prestige channels similar to our approach in the US, and believe the opportunities are most promising where we can deliver an excellent High-Touch experience.
This includes our international push in to more e-commerce platform generating not only significant sales growth but also a more locally relevant, dynamic, High-Touch interface with new and existing consumers.
We are expanding e-commerce and mobile commerce and building our digital capabilities to run website at regional and local levels in close collaboration with our brands.
 Providing personalized service and demonstration is an important factor as we grow our brands and introduce them to new consumers across various Prestige channels. For example, we are looking at ways to refine this model to best suit European perfumery, where we sell many of our brands.
We also intend to be a bigger player in European pharmacies where the skin care category has been growing rapidly. Then in fiscal 2011, Aveda will be fully integrated in to our international operations as we focus on adding high-end salons and spas to our distribution network.
As we strive to gain a larger share of the consumers total beauty purchases, we are learning from improved consumer insights to provide customization that is geared to local taste. We are focusing on our innovation on creating locally relevant products, packaging, product delivery, services and communications.
In closing, I want to emphasize how extremely proud I am of our international teams and the results they have produced. Our regions in travel retail channel intend to keep advancing the company’s strategy and allowing themselves to the commitment as Fabrizio just describe of being creativity driven and consumer inspired.
We are confident that international we’ll continue to propel the company’s growth and ensure that Estée Lauder companies remains the worldwide leader in prestige beauty.
Now I will turn the call over to Rick.

A quick reminder, like discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and special charges, which I’ll comment on separately. Once again, we had a solid quarter. Sales grew 10% to $1.86 billion excluding the impact of currency translation sales grew up 5% over the prior year period.
Net earnings for the quarter more than double to $68.9 million compared with $31.4 million in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $0.34 compared to $0.16 a year ago.
We continue to experience strong growth in the skin care category reflecting our strategic focus in that area. Sales growth was 10% in local currency contributing more than half of the global increase in net sales. All three regions contributed to growth in this category especially Asia and Europe.
In makeup local currency sales fell 2%. This category was adversely affected by the end of wholesale distribution of Prescriptives and was the most impacted by a charge for returns from European perfumeries, which I'll describe shortly.
Excluding the impact of these two factors, local currency sales grew 4% over the prior year. The category grew double-digit internationally on the strength from Clinique, M A C and Bobbi Brown.
Our Fragrance sales jumped 13% excluding currency and the category continued to improve its profitability. The launch of PureDKNY in Europe, Coach Signature in the US and increased sales of certain designer fragrances through self-select outlets drove most of the increase.
In the hair care, sales was 3% in local currency, due primarily to expanded distribution of Aveda in Japan, Korea and Australia.
Geographically, our international businesses continued to lead growth. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa sales gained 7% in local currency.
During the quarter, we recorded a charge of approximately 31 million to reflect anticipated returns from certain European perfumers. The returns, primarily make up relate to a strategic effort to proactively align our product assortments by discontinuing slow turning SKUs in favor of carrying high returning products.
Global travel retail sales continued to rebound from increased traffic and conversion of travelers to buyers. Sales in the channel jumped over 45% of an easy comparison in the prior year quarter, contributing substantially to the region's increase.
Our UK sales slowed in the third quarter to low single-digit growth as adverse weather and an increase in VAT dampened purchases, However, our make-up artist brands continue to produce double-digit growth in the UK.
Developing markets in the region including Russia, the Middle East, India and Turkey all grew strong double-digits. Most of the southern European countries performed below last year and the markets in Greece, Italy and Spain remain concerning. Germany was largely unchanged and the Nordic countries grew high single-digits.
Our Asia/Pacific regions sales climbed 10% in local currency with most affiliates contributing. China continued to lead the regions growth rising over 30% in the quarter. Our business at Hong Kong rose 24% and Taiwan was up 25%.
Korea grew 10% and we have continued to see strong results in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The political unrest in Thailand could curtail future sales. Japan declined mid single-digits as it continued to suffer from the tough economic environment.
Local currency sales in the Americas were up 2% reflecting a modest pickup in consumer demand. Excluding Prescriptives, sales in department stores and in our own retail stores grew at low single-digit.
Sales growth in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and our online division were more robust. Sales in other channels were mixed.
Our gross margin improved by 250 basis points this quarter to 76.2%. Our cost savings initiatives contributed 230 basis points primarily from the strategic shift in our product mix and lower material cost.
We also benefited from favorable currency. Each factors were partially offset by higher obsolescence of 40 basis points, which included the cost of returns from the SKU rationalization in Europe.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter improved 70 basis points to 68.5% compared to 69.2% last year. Improvements mostly came from cost savings initiatives partially offset by higher advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses and cost to build capabilities.
Operating income rose 87% to $142.8 million compared to $76.5 million last year and operating margin increased 320 basis points to 7.7%. Regarding our interest expense, we reported $18.2 million this quarter versus $20.6 million in last year’s third quarter.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.4%, higher than normal, due to the geographic mix of our earnings. The impact of the new tax legislation related to Health Insurance Reform was not material to our results. We reported net restructuring and other special charges of $16.5 million during the third quarter.
Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended March 31st were $798 million, compared to $307 million last year. The biggest drivers of the gain were higher net earnings and the timing and level of tax payments.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program.
Our day sales outstanding were 47 days this quarter, seven days lower than last year. Business has been improving for many of our customers, and so we are less concerned about their financial health at this time.
Inventory days were 157 compared with 154 days last year. We booked $35 million in inventory of our top selling SKUs in advance of the rollout of SAP to our North American manufacturing facilities earlier this month. We expect to work down the excess over the next two to three quarters.
Importantly, our global SKU count was down 8% from a year earlier at the end of March. We spent $161 million for capital expenditures, which includes spending for our company-wide systems initiative.
For fiscal 2010, we expect to generate between $800 million and $850 million of cash flow from operations and to use about $315 million to $330 million for capital expenditures, although some of the spending could go spill into next fiscal year.
As you saw in this morning's announcement, we are planning to purchase $200 million of our outstanding debt during the fourth quarter, which is expected to result in a one-time charge of $26 million to $30 million or $0.08 to $0.10 per share. We expect interest savings of approximately $10 million to $11 million in fiscal 2011. This reduces leverage back in line with single A target credit rate.
 With two month left in the fiscal year our forecast reflects continued growth in Asia and a measured consumer recovery here in the US and parts of Western Europe. We remain cautious about the economic environment and several Southern European markets as well as Japan and we expect more aggressive competition.
Additionally, the recent disruption in European air travel caused by the volcanic activity in Island modestly impacted sales in our travel retail channel. However, this is a reminder of the vulnerability of this channel to unforeseen events.
For the year, we now expect 2010 local currency sales growth of about 4% to 5% led by our international business. Currency is expected to add approximately two percentages points to our reported sales.
Advertising, merchandizing and sampling costs should continue to accelerate behind our biggest launches in markets with good momentum such as China and Russia. We also continue to invest in building capabilities as called for in our strategy in areas such as digital programs, new High-Touch service models, regional research and development, and consumer insights.
We expect to deliver savings for the year of $330 million and to record charges associated with restructuring activities of between $60 million and $90 million. Given our progress to-date, we now expect to improve operating margins by at least 400 basis points this year. At this time we estimate our effective tax rate will range between 30% and 32% for the year.
 We are moving our forecasted full year EPS range from $2.64 to $2.75 per share. This range excludes the one- time charge of $0.08 to $0.10 related to the repurchase of debt as well as restructuring charges.
We will review our long-term goals as part of our annual budgeting process over this summer and we plan to provide fiscal 2011 guidance on our year-end call in August as we do every year. Remember, there is a degree of uncertainty and volatility, inherent in our business.
Our full-year strategy is off to a good start and we are pleased with the progress to-date. We still have a lot of work ahead, building capabilities for simultaneously driving measured, profitable, top-line growth in a sustainable fashion and continuing to turnaround underperforming brands.
That concludes my comments. We'll be happy to take your questions now.

In answer to your question and just as Fabrizio described, we had temporary savings last year, which we said about 70% of that would probably come back. That spending is coming back, some of it much more efficiently than the way we had done it before, but we are more than compensating for that by the more permanent savings around our resizing, restructuring and cost savings initiatives.

It is the beginning of positive signs, but we want to observe those signs for a longer period of time before making a sign of conclusion.
The other positive thing that we see is that out of these this 2% increase of the prestige beauty business is faster that the increase we saw in the quarter for example in the [mask] business and that particularly faster in the area of skin care, where the increase of the prestige has been five points faster than the increase in M-A-C. So, it is a gain a positive indication that consumer feel a bit more comfortable with spending also on the higher end of the product choices meaning more in prestige than that done during the recession.

Those marketing investment have an immediate benefit in some cases, but those in some other cases there to create long term growth potential for the company. Let me clarify what I mean, when the market investment is behind the new launch in a developed markets, obviously you see some improved results on this launch initially in the quarter, but when those investments like honestly the large majority of our extra investment at this point of time, and in adding emerging markets ,where we are basically investing to create brand equity, a long-term awareness of these brands, those investments after using some immediate results, but particularly are lay in the ground for future long-term solid growth in this new markets.
Just to put a number straight, the increased advertising, merchandising and promotion during the third quarter was 14%. The increase in the fourth quarter that we expect is 35% versus year ago, so even more and however the advertising merchandising spending in percentage for the year in our current communicated estimate is actually flat to the percentage, but the absolute level is well above because obviously we're calculating this flat percentage on higher sales.
So, by the end of the year, we would have spent over $100 million more in support heavily skewed on the second semester, and we do see an acceleration, because if you made the number we have been growing excluding the return in Europe is 7%, ex-currency and we forecast a further slight acceleration of this for the fourth quarter. So, pretty solid growth in the context with the current economic environment.
Last point I want to add, we are also seeing obviously an increased spending from competition. So, the other way to look at that that we have been able in the first six months of this fiscal year to in a very efficient way with lower spending, but also in the context of competition also having on average lower spending. This quarter and next quarter we expect an increase spending also from our competitors they will make obviously our spending even more important.

I'm pleased you had joined us for our fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings call. In our discussion today, I will review our performance and progress on our strategy, Cedric will talk about the company International business and Rick will follow up with financial details.
This morning, we again announced strong results with solid sales gains in greater profitability. Third quarter sales were $1.86 billion, up 10% compared to the same period of a year ago, with improvements in all regions and categories. Diluted earnings per share were $0.34, more than double last year's results before restructuring charges. I'm also gratified that we continue advancing many of our strategic goals. Let me give you some highlights.
First, we believe that retail sales of our products grew at a faster pace than prestige beauty trends in many critical countries and channels, which means that we increased share. Excluding Prescriptives, we saw gains in U.S. department store as well as Russia and China among others. Our International business expanded more rapidly than our Domestic business, and we are approaching our target of generating more than 60% of sales outside our own market. 
Our operating margin risen again, moving us closer to our long-range goal of 12% to 13%. Our turnaround brands collectively showed continuing improvement in operating results this quarter, and we made additional progress in our cost savings initiatives. In each of our three quarters, so far this fiscal year, we met or exceeded our sales and earning estimates and successfully moved ahead of our strategic journey. All of our employees should be extremely proud of these accomplishments, which are the results of their hard work and creativity. And I want to thank them for their efforts.
Now let me turn to some of the specific areas that drove our growth this quarter. Our International business provided the greatest momentum. Asia/Pacific remain robust, led by strong gains in Greater China. Sales in our European region climbed, driven by Travel Retail, Russia and the Middle East. Our strategy puts a new emphasis on our regions, which has enabled us to be more locally relevant and accelerated our growth. 
The Estée Lauder brand enjoyed solid growth internationally in the quarter, particularly in Asia/Pacific and Travel Retailing, led by skin care sales. Estée Lauder is the leading prestige brand in Asia in our distribution.
One of the most exciting developments in our foreign markets this quarter was the launch for our Origins brand in mainland China. The brand highly successful repositioning powered by nature, proven by science, has been directed by Senior Vice President and Origin General Manager, Jane Lauder. She led the kickoff at the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai, joined by Executive Chairman William Lauder, one of the founders of the Origins 20 years ago, and other company executives and local celebrities. 
Cedric will give you more details about our International business in a few minutes, so now I want to discuss other areas that drove our sales. Clinique skin care sales grew over 11% at retail, thanks to a strong launch activity and it gained share in the U.S. department stores. Clinique is the largest U.S. cosmetic brand, so when a brand of its size gains share, it is an impressive thing. We were pertinent by the fact that the U.S. retail sales jumped strongly in March, led by upscale department store, which points to a possible initial recovery in consumer spending.
We are working closely with our large retail partners to create innovative shopping experiences in department stores. For example, we have refining our High-Touch service from education through post-purchase. We are also leveraging in-store services and differentiating by store size to better serve the needs of our consumer and improve profitability.
Our E-Commerce business grew 25% with most of our brand size reporting double-digit growth. Retailers side in North America also posted solid sales gain. In addition, we expanded our global web presence. Clinique launched at the online sales in Germany and M-A-C started e-commerce and mobile commerce in Japan. Bobbi Brown will follow with both types of online shopping in Japan next month.
As you know, one of our key missions is to build upon our global leadership position in skin care. This universal focus across our brands is reflected in our results. In the recent quarter, reported skin care sales rose 16%, and we launched the two breakthrough products that we believe will be important contributors to their respective brand portfolios for many years to come. 
Toward the end of the quarter, Clinique began shipments of Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector, which straights uneven skin tone with results that are comparable to a leading prescription ingredient. We have highest petitions for even better Clinique and are supporting it with an unprecedented television campaign in the U.S. which launched last week. The commercials will run for five weeks, including prime time spots during American Idol and Dancing With the Stars.
Our other major introduction was the La Mer Regenerating Serum, which is the brand's first anti-aging product. We are excited by its initial sales, but also encouraged that the Serum has lifted sales of the brand signature moisturizer. La Mer is one of our high-end prestige brands and it had double-digit sales growth with particular strengths in North America, the U.K. and throughout the retail. We believe that consumer are beginning to reconsider luxury products, which certainly bodes well for our entire prestige portfolio.
Another standout in skin care is Origins, which has been remarkable consumer acceptance in its revamped skin care line. Origins had outstanding contour growth in its major U.S. retailers during the quarter. It also has been terrific improvement in the U.K. where sales grew 12% this quarter. With new merchandising, advertising and communications, the brand global sales rose high-single digits led by new products, including GinZing eyes cream and Brighter by Nature peel pads.
In recap, reported sales increased 2% due to the improvements by both of our makeup artist brands, M-A-C and Bobbi Brown. M-A-C enjoyed strong sales growth in Europe and Asia. Its brand equity and philosophy is closely tied to its annual VIVA GLAM lipstick sales, which benefit the M-A-C AIDS Fund. This year, VIVA GLAM spokespersons, Lady Gaga and Cyndi Lauper, drew huge media attention. Sales of VIVA GLAM product exceeded forecast and had hollow effect on the rest of the business. Last week, M-A-C took the VIVA GLAM campaign to Asia. Lady Gaga performed in Tokyo, which generated terrific media coverage.
This month, M-A-C opened its most innovative and technology-driven store in Times Squares (sic) [Times Square]. This busy area attracts close to 500 million people a day, making this location a superb retail opportunity. 
Bobbi Brown recently visited China to do television and magazine interviews and make-up artist events to build brand awareness. She reviewed upcoming launches which we expect will increase sales in the current quarter.
At Derek Lam's recent show during New York Fashion Week, the Estée Lauder brand new Creative Makeup Director, Tom Pecheux, gave a preview of the colors Estée Lauder will debut this fall. This was the first time the brand had been involved in that stage with a high-profile runway show. Aerin Lauder, Estée Lauder's Senior Vice President and Creative Director, worked closely with Tom to create the first collection and get nostalgic imagery to support it. We think a strong ties to beauty and fashion editors will attract the more fashion-conscious consumer and bring increased vast and attention to our flagship brand when its product hit stores.
Along with the sales gains we generated, we also increase our profitability. Our restructuring efforts are enabling us to work more efficiently. As part of our ongoing cost reduction, we trimmed $104 million largely achieved in cost of goods, indirect procurement and resizing and restructuring initiatives. Our year-to-year savings totaled $264 million, and we now expect to save $300 million to $330 million for the fiscal year. 
As you know, we are committed to reinvest a portion of our savings to build capabilities. We are also refocused on continuously improving our productivity. Starting this July, we have established a company-wide mandate and plan that employee cost increased more slowly than sales growth. 
Our turnaround brands show solid financial improvements, which helps strengthen our bottom line. The official closing of Prescriptives Wholesale business on January 31, was executed flawlessly. And we received price from retailers and noting how well it was handled. We moved certain employees to other parts of the company and are transferring popular Prescriptive products and formulas to other brands, including Calyx fragrance which is now part of Aramis and designer fragrances. Some Prescriptive retail counters will be assumed by our other brands and its online sales will continue for a period of time. 
The Aramis and Designer Fragrance Division has began reaping the benefit of a profit-improvement strategy started it made in 2008. It has dramatically improved its cost of goods, cut its SKUs by over 50% in the last three years and its launching fewer fragrances with bigger impacts. The recent European introduction of Pure DKNY was well received. The fragrance is innovative because of its sustainability platform which is unusual in the category. ADF also began distributing the Coach fragrance in the U.S. department stores, broadening its availability beyond Coach retail stores. 
Another key component of our strategy is to enhance our capabilities in certain areas to improve our competitiveness. To that end, we announced that the establishment of a Corporate Marketing Center of Excellence, which will be a resource for our Research & Development teams, Brands and region, as we develop greater consumer insights and marketing tools. 
Georgia Garinois who worked for Johnson & Johnson, has joined us to lead the new center. Her responsibilities include capability development in multicultural marketing, global consumer insight, customer relationship management, digital marketing and advertising services. Georgia reports to me and is a member of the Executive Leadership Team. 
One of the company's historical strength has been our innovation and creativity. We believe that by utilizing more in-depth consumer insights and focusing our efforts on the biggest opportunities, we will produce even greater creative breakthroughs across the company. Our approach is to be creativity-driven and consumer-inspired.
We are developing a strong pipeline of new initiatives to drive growth over the next three years. We are planning launches that will include new product ideas, as well as existing successful products that we will improve with updated technology, similar to what we did with Advanced Night Repair. 
We will also accelerate innovation of the High-Touch services which integrate our products to create a well-differentiated prestige experience. We will give you further details of this initiative near the launch date.
Earlier this month, we rolled out our Strategic Modernization Initiative to nine North America manufacturing facilities. Over 80% of our in-house production is now on SAP. Although it is too early to give details, the implementation is being smooth and we haven't encountered any major problems. On our next earnings call in August, we plan to provide early results of the North America effort, review the SMI project and discuss crucial steps.
With just two months left in fiscal 2010, William Lauder and I are extremely pleased with how far we have come in the first leg of our four-year strategic journey. Looking ahead, we are prepared to move the company from successfully navigating in a recession to growing during a recovery. We plan to continue taking aggressive steps to fuel our momentum. For example, our targeted advertising and promotional spending will be significantly higher in the fourth quarter versus the previous year, which should help drive sales going into fiscal 2011. We will focus on our biggest opportunities, including major product launches, the best performing countries in our largest brands. 
As our performance this year should confirm, we are a growth company. Furthermore, as global economy return to more solid footing and employment levels improved, the money spent on prestige beauty products worldwide is expected to gradually return to historical norms. We fully expect to capture a bigger share of the growing pie. 
Now I will turn the call over to Cedric Prouvé who will talk about his area of the business. Cedric?"

As Fabrizio mentioned, the International business once again enjoyed strong sales and earnings growth in the recent quarter.

As Fabrizio mentioned, the International business once again enjoyed strong sales and earnings growth in the recent quarter. In fact, our sales have increased every year for the last decade in local currency, underscoring how important the international operations are to the company as a whole. International accounts for nearly 60% of sales is the major growth driver and is transforming the historic company into a true global powerhouse.
Let me briefly explain why we've been so successful expanding our brands into more than 140 markets. First, we have a highly effective organization, led by strong regional teams that are developing expanded capabilities. They are supported by a powerful network of local affiliates which stay in touch with their consumer states, taste and thinking and provide excellent on-the-ground education. 
Our international organization continues to evolve and align with our global brands and functions. Of course, we also have a diverse portfolio of operational prestige brands that allows us to leverage our strategy and optimize our growth based on where we see the most promising opportunities. Market characteristics dictate our investment by categories, products, brands and channels. At the same time, we strive to balance our growth among emerging, developing and mature countries, again in alignment with each of our brands strategic priorities and plans.
This year, every international region is ahead of its sales and profit objectives after the third quarter. Asia, however, is a standout with continued superb momentum. Within Asia, Greater China has been a key performer. The region's growth is being fueled by skin care, which accounts for a large majority of its sales. Our strongest brand in Asia at the moment is Estée Lauder, which has been such astounding skin care sales in China that in the recent quarter, it became the brand's largest International business surpassing the U.K. 
Earlier, Fabrizio mentioned Origins recent launch in China. We believe that Origins will be a perfect fit, since Chinese consumers are passionate about skin care and natural ingredients. In its first week, Origins was the top-selling beauty brand in the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai and since its launch, Origins retail sales have exceeded our projections. We expect the brand to have six doors in Beijing and Shanghai by June 30.
Origins is the ninth brand to join the China portfolio. Our most widely distributed brands are available in about 80 department stores across 35 of China's largest cities. Our brands are also present in about 80 separate doors in the country. There is still much room for expansion which we are directing deliberately and strategically. We're extremely pleased that China is no longer dilutive to the average profitability of the Asia/Pacific region. And our results in the country have consistently outpaced our five-year projections for sales and profits by at least a year. China is the largest of our emerging markets which as a total group grew 18% in the quarter. They account now for 12% of total company sales and extend well beyond the break foursome to also include Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Turkey, just to name a few.
One way we accelerate our growth in emerging markets is by establishing our own affiliates early on. This enables us to hire the best local talent, which gives us the competitive advantage and develop a long-term strategy and investment plan. Our newest affiliate in Vietnam had strong double-digit growth in the third quarter and we will maintain the momentum by launching M-A-C there in this fiscal year.
As you heard, Travel Retail's performance was strong and it rebounded sharply from the weak environment of a year ago. The improvement was so great that the division had its best sales month ever in March. The channel was held by higher passenger traffic, initial success, converting more travelers to buyers, great growth in Asia/Pacific and some restocking following last year's difficult climate. It continue to open doors for our younger brands, which accounted for about 15% of its sales growth this quarter. 
Our results into Europe, Middle East and Africa region were mixed with emerging markets outperforming the more mature ones. However, we believe we gained market share in our distribution despite market challenges in certain countries. Our U.K. team has done an excellent job navigating our largest affiliate through a difficult economic environment, especially in Ireland, while growing and gaining share in our distribution.
Some of our less-developed brands, including Jo Malone and Tom Ford, showed solid gains in the European region. M-A-C and Bobbi Brown were also strong and we plan to expand their point of sales including more freestanding stores, which allowed us the best possible presentation to express their brand equity.
Business in Latin America has met our expectations despite recent disruptions in Chile and in Venezuela. The region sales have more than doubled in last several years and our brand has sold well in Brazil and Mexico. The company has started fulfilling its mission to become completely integrated, so that the best ideas and products generated in one area and easily translate and traveled to the rest of the world. As an example, when the Estée Lauder brand set out to create skin care commercials for Asian TV, it produced them on location in Hong Kong, where the new entrance of skin care products and local styles and aesthetics were best understood. The ads were such a success that the brand will used some of them worldwide. 
Our International business has delivered excellent cost savings, which has help improve profitability and allowed us to increase investment. Most of the incremental spending has gone to emerging markets to seek future growth. We expect to spend about 50% more on TV advertising this quarter throughout this country to raise awareness of our core brands and fuel our momentum. For the first time, the Estée Lauder brand will run three integrated marketing campaigns in Asia using television, print and digital simultaneously for our skin care products. This is a prime example of how we allocate our investments to ensure that our momentum continues. 
Internationally, there are many growth opportunities in department stores, particularly in Asia where the channel remain strong. However, we are also pursuing other prestige channels similar to our approach in the U.S. and believe the opportunities are most promising where we can deliver an excellent High-Touch experience. This includes our international push into more e-commerce platform, generating not only significant sales growth but also a more locally relevant, dynamic, High-Touch interface with new and existing consumers. We are expanding e-commerce and mobile commerce and building our digital capabilities to run website at regional and local levels in close collaboration with our brands. 
Providing personalized service and demonstration is an important factor as we grow our brands and introduced them to new customers across various prestige channels. For example, we are looking at ways to refine this model to best suit European perfumeries, where we sell many of our brands. We all intend to be a bigger player in European pharmacies where the skin care category has been growing rapidly. And in fiscal 2011, Aveda will be fully integrated into our international operations as we focus on adding high-end salons and spas to our distribution network. 
As we strive to gain the larger share of the consumer's total beauty purchases, we are learning from improved consumer insights to provide customization that is geared to local taste. We are focusing our innovation on creating locally relevant product, packaging, product delivery, services and communications. 
In closing, I want to emphasize how extremely proud I am of our International teams and the results they have produced. Our Regions and Travel Retail channel intend to keep advancing the company's strategy and aligned themselves to the commitment, as Fabrizio just described of being creativity-driven and consumer-inspired. We are confident that International will continue to prepare the company's growth and ensure that the Estée Lauder Companies remains the worldwide leader in prestige beauty. And now, I will turn the call over to Rick."
207221,6102619,58003,"Estee Lauder Companies Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and special charges which I'll comment on separately.Once again, we had a solid quarter. Sales rose 10% to $1.86 billion",1455,"Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and special charges which I'll comment on separately.
Once again, we had a solid quarter. Sales rose 10% to $1.86 billion. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales were up 5% over the prior year period. Net earnings for the quarter more than doubled to $68.9 million compared with $31.4 million in the prior year quarter, and diluted EPS was $0.34 compared to $0.16 a year ago.
We continue to experience strong growth in the skin care category reflecting our strategic focus in that area. Sales rose 10% in local currency contributing more than half of the global increase in net sales. All three regions contributed to growth in this category, especially Asia and Europe. In makeup, local currency sales fell 2%. This category was adversely affected by the end of wholesale distribution of Prescriptives and was the most impacted by a charge for returns from European perfumeries, which I'll describe shortly. Excluding the impact of these two factors, local currency sales grew 4% over the prior year. The category grew double digits internationally on the strength from Clinique, M-A-C and Bobbi Brown.
Our fragrance sales jumped 13% excluding currency and the category continued to improve its profitability. The launch of Pure DKNY in Europe, Coach Signature in the U.S. and increased sales of certain designer fragrances through self-select outlets drove most of the increase.
In the hair care, sales rose 3% in local currency, due primarily through expanded distribution of Aveda in Japan, Korea and Australia. 
Geographically, our International businesses continued to lead growth. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa sales gain 7% in local currency. During the quarter, we recorded a charge of approximately $31 million to reflect anticipated returns from certain European perfumeries. The returns, primarily makeup, relate to a strategic effort to proactively align our product assortments by discontinuing slow-turning SKUs in favor of carrying higher-turning products.
Global Travel Retail sales continue to rebound from increased traffic and conversion of travelers to buyers. Sales in the channel jumped over 45% of an easy comparison in the prior year quarter, contributing substantially to the region's increase. 
Our U.K. sales slowed in the third quarter to low single-digit growth as adverse weather and an increase in VAT dampened purchases. However, our make-up artist brands continue to produce double-digit growth in the U.K. 
Developing markets in the region including Russia, the Middle East, India and Turkey all grew strong double digits. Most of the southern European countries perform below last year and the markets in Greece, Italy and Spain remained concerning. Germany was largely unchanged and the northern countries grew high-single digits
Our Asia/Pacific region sales climbed 10% in local currency, with most affiliates contributing. China continue to lead the region's growth rising over 30% in the quarter. Our business in Hong Kong rose 24% and Taiwan was up 25%. Korea grew 10% and we will continue to see strong results in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The political unrest in Thailand could curtail future sales. Japan decline mid-single digits as they continue to suffer from a tough economic environments.
Local currency sales in the Americas were up 2%, reflecting a modest pickup in consumer demand. Excluding Prescriptives, sales in department stores and our own retail stores was low-single digits. Sales growth in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and our Online division were more robust. Sales in other channels were mixed.
Our gross margin improved by 250 basis points this quarter to 76.2%. Our cost savings initiatives contributed 230 basis points primarily from the strategic shift in our product mix and lower material costs. We also benefited from favorable currency. These factors were partially offset by higher obsolescence of 40 basis points, which included the cost of returns from the SKU rationalization in Europe.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter improved 70 basis points to 68.5% compared to 69.2% last year. Improvements mostly came from cost savings initiative, partially offset by higher advertising, merchandising and sampling expense and cost to build capabilities. 
Operating income rose 87% to $142.8 million compared to $76.5 million last year, and operating margin increased 320 basis points to 7.7%. Regarding our interest expense, we reported $18.2 million this quarter versus $20.6 million in last year's third quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.4%, higher than normal due to the geographic mix of our earnings. The impact of the new tax legislation related to health insurance reform was not material to our results. We reported net restructuring and other special charges of $16.5 million during the third quarter.
Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, was $798 million compared to $307 million last year. The biggest drivers of the gain were higher net earnings and the timing and level of tax payments. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. 
Our days sales outstanding were 47 days this quarter, seven days lower than last year. Business  has been improving for many of our customers and so we are less concerned about their financial health at this time. Inventory days were 157 compared with 154 days last year. We booked $35 million in inventory of our top-selling SKUs in advance of the rollout of SAP to our North American manufacturing facilities earlier this month. We expect to work down the excess over the next two to three quarters. Importantly, our global SKU count was down 8% from a year earlier at the end of March. 
We spent $161 million for capital expenditures, which includes spending for our company-wide systems initiative. For fiscal 2010, we expect to generate between $800 million and $850 million of cash flow from operations, and to use about $315 million to $330 million for capital expenditures, although some of the spending could spill into the next fiscal year. 
As you saw in this morning's announcement, we are planning to purchase $200 million of our outstanding debt during the fourth quarter, which is expected to result in a one-time charge of $26 million to $30 million, or $0.08 to $0.10 per share. We expect interest savings of approximately $10 million to $11 million in fiscal 2011. This reduces leverage back in line with a A target credit rating.
With two months left in the fiscal year, our forecast reflect continued growth in Asia and a measured consumer recovery here in the U.S. and parts of Western Europe. We remain cautious about the economic environment in several Southern European markets, as well as Japan, and we expect more aggressive competition. Additionally, the recent disruption in European air travel cost by the volcanic activity in Iceland modestly impacted sales in our Travel Retail channel. However, this is a reminder of the vulnerability of this channel to unforeseen events. 
For the year, we now expect 2010 local currency sales growth of about 4% to 5%, led by our International business. Currency is expected to add approximately two percentage points to our reported sales.
Advertising, merchandising and sampling cost should continue to accelerate on our biggest launches in markets with good momentum such as China and Russia. We also continue to invest in building capabilities as called for in our strategy in areas such as digital programs, new High-Touch service models, regional, Research & Development and consumer insights. 
We expect to deliver savings for the year of $300 million to $330 million and to record charges associated with restructuring activities of between $60 million and $90 million. Given our progress to date, we now expect to improve operating margins by at least 400 basis points this year. At this time, we estimate our effective tax rate will range between 30% and 32% for the year.
We are moving our forecasted full year EPS range up to $2.65 to $2.75 per share. This range excludes the one-time charge of $0.08 to $0.10 related to the repurchase of debt, as well as restructuring charges. We will review our long-term goals as part of our annual budgeting process over the summer, and we plan to provide fiscal 2011 guidance on our year end call on August as we do every year. Remember, there is a degree of uncertainty and volatility inherent in our business. 
Our full year strategy is off to a good start and we are pleased with the progress to date. We still have a lot of work ahead, building capabilities, while simultaneously driving measured, profitable top line growth in a sustainable fashion and continuing to turn around underperforming brands. That concludes my comments and we'll be happy to take your questions now."

I think, particularly significant in the U.S. department store in the last quarter was the share growth of our Clinique brand. It was, as I said, significant. And on a brand of such a big size, means that we are doing the right thing. And the right thing is a combination of further initiative, improvement of our high-touch service, which, as you know, passes through better service encounter and better activity in the store and an increased level of service, plus a clarification of the value equation of the brands, which includes its position of prices, better value reframing on some of our SKUs and activities in this area. The combination of those things is working pretty well. Now in term of future development, I think we will continue accelerating the initiatives and the focus on big initiatives.

When the mark",363,"First of all, obviously, the answer is both. Those marketing investments have an immediate benefit, in some cases, but also, in some other cases, are there to create long-term growth potential for the company. And let me clarify what I mean. When the marketing investment is behind a new launch in developed markets, obviously, you see some improved results on these loans initially in the quarter. But when those investments like, honestly, the large majority of our extra investment at this point of time and are in emerging markets, where we are basically investing to create brand equity and long-term awareness of these brands, those investment, are producing some immediate results, but particularly, are laying the ground for future long-term solid growth in these new markets. Just to put the number straight, the increased advertising, merchandising and promotion during the third quarter was 14%. The increase in the fourth quarter than we expect is 35% versus a year ago, so even more. And however, the advertising, merchandising spending in percentage for the year, in our current communicated estimate, is actually flat to the percentage. But the absolute level is well above, because obviously, we are calculating this flat percent, as well on higher sales. So by the end of the year, we're going to spend over $100 million more in support, heavily skewed on the second semester. And we do see an acceleration, because if you make the number, we have been growing, excluding the return in Europe, at 7% as currency, and we forecast a further slight acceleration of this for the fourth quarter. So pretty, pretty solid growth in the context of the current economic environment. Last point I want to add, we are also seeing, obviously, an increased spending from competition. So the other way to look at that is that we have been able, in the first six months of this fiscal year, to operate in a very efficient way with lower spending, but also, in the context of competition also having on average lower spending. This quarter and next quarter we expect an increased spending also from our competitors. That will make, obviously, our spending even more important."

In our discussion today, I will review our performance and progress on our strategy, Cedric will talk about the company International business",2049,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning. I'm pleased you had joined us for our fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings call. In our discussion today, I will review our performance and progress on our strategy, Cedric will talk about the company International business and Rick will follow up with financial details.
This morning, we again announced strong results with solid sales gains in greater profitability. Third quarter sales were $1.86 billion, up 10% compared to the same period of a year ago, with improvements in all regions and categories. Diluted earnings per share were $0.34, more than double last year's results before restructuring charges. I'm also gratified that we continue advancing many of our strategic goals. Let me give you some highlights.
First, we believe that retail sales of our products grew at a faster pace than prestige beauty trends in many critical countries and channels, which means that we increased share. Excluding Prescriptives, we saw gains in U.S. department store as well as Russia and China among others. Our International business expanded more rapidly than our Domestic business, and we are approaching our target of generating more than 60% of sales outside our own market. 
Our operating margin risen again, moving us closer to our long-range goal of 12% to 13%. Our turnaround brands collectively showed continuing improvement in operating results this quarter, and we made additional progress in our cost savings initiatives. In each of our three quarters, so far this fiscal year, we met or exceeded our sales and earning estimates and successfully moved ahead of our strategic journey. All of our employees should be extremely proud of these accomplishments, which are the results of their hard work and creativity. And I want to thank them for their efforts.
Now let me turn to some of the specific areas that drove our growth this quarter. Our International business provided the greatest momentum. Asia/Pacific remain robust, led by strong gains in Greater China. Sales in our European region climbed, driven by Travel Retail, Russia and the Middle East. Our strategy puts a new emphasis on our regions, which has enabled us to be more locally relevant and accelerated our growth. 
The Estée Lauder brand enjoyed solid growth internationally in the quarter, particularly in Asia/Pacific and Travel Retailing, led by skin care sales. Estée Lauder is the leading prestige brand in Asia in our distribution.
One of the most exciting developments in our foreign markets this quarter was the launch for our Origins brand in mainland China. The brand highly successful repositioning powered by nature, proven by science, has been directed by Senior Vice President and Origin General Manager, Jane Lauder. She led the kickoff at the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai, joined by Executive Chairman William Lauder, one of the founders of the Origins 20 years ago, and other company executives and local celebrities. 
Cedric will give you more details about our International business in a few minutes, so now I want to discuss other areas that drove our sales. Clinique skin care sales grew over 11% at retail, thanks to a strong launch activity and it gained share in the U.S. department stores. Clinique is the largest U.S. cosmetic brand, so when a brand of its size gains share, it is an impressive thing. We were pertinent by the fact that the U.S. retail sales jumped strongly in March, led by upscale department store, which points to a possible initial recovery in consumer spending.
We are working closely with our large retail partners to create innovative shopping experiences in department stores. For example, we have refining our High-Touch service from education through post-purchase. We are also leveraging in-store services and differentiating by store size to better serve the needs of our consumer and improve profitability.
Our E-Commerce business grew 25% with most of our brand size reporting double-digit growth. Retailers side in North America also posted solid sales gain. In addition, we expanded our global web presence. Clinique launched at the online sales in Germany and M-A-C started e-commerce and mobile commerce in Japan. Bobbi Brown will follow with both types of online shopping in Japan next month.
As you know, one of our key missions is to build upon our global leadership position in skin care. This universal focus across our brands is reflected in our results. In the recent quarter, reported skin care sales rose 16%, and we launched the two breakthrough products that we believe will be important contributors to their respective brand portfolios for many years to come. 
Toward the end of the quarter, Clinique began shipments of Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector, which straights uneven skin tone with results that are comparable to a leading prescription ingredient. We have highest petitions for even better Clinique and are supporting it with an unprecedented television campaign in the U.S. which launched last week. The commercials will run for five weeks, including prime time spots during American Idol and Dancing With the Stars.
Our other major introduction was the La Mer Regenerating Serum, which is the brand's first anti-aging product. We are excited by its initial sales, but also encouraged that the Serum has lifted sales of the brand signature moisturizer. La Mer is one of our high-end prestige brands and it had double-digit sales growth with particular strengths in North America, the U.K. and throughout the retail. We believe that consumer are beginning to reconsider luxury products, which certainly bodes well for our entire prestige portfolio.
Another standout in skin care is Origins, which has been remarkable consumer acceptance in its revamped skin care line. Origins had outstanding contour growth in its major U.S. retailers during the quarter. It also has been terrific improvement in the U.K. where sales grew 12% this quarter. With new merchandising, advertising and communications, the brand global sales rose high-single digits led by new products, including GinZing eyes cream and Brighter by Nature peel pads.
In recap, reported sales increased 2% due to the improvements by both of our makeup artist brands, M-A-C and Bobbi Brown. M-A-C enjoyed strong sales growth in Europe and Asia. Its brand equity and philosophy is closely tied to its annual VIVA GLAM lipstick sales, which benefit the M-A-C AIDS Fund. This year, VIVA GLAM spokespersons, Lady Gaga and Cyndi Lauper, drew huge media attention. Sales of VIVA GLAM product exceeded forecast and had hollow effect on the rest of the business. Last week, M-A-C took the VIVA GLAM campaign to Asia. Lady Gaga performed in Tokyo, which generated terrific media coverage.
This month, M-A-C opened its most innovative and technology-driven store in Times Squares (sic) [Times Square]. This busy area attracts close to 500 million people a day, making this location a superb retail opportunity. 
Bobbi Brown recently visited China to do television and magazine interviews and make-up artist events to build brand awareness. She reviewed upcoming launches which we expect will increase sales in the current quarter.
At Derek Lam's recent show during New York Fashion Week, the Estée Lauder brand new Creative Makeup Director, Tom Pecheux, gave a preview of the colors Estée Lauder will debut this fall. This was the first time the brand had been involved in that stage with a high-profile runway show. Aerin Lauder, Estée Lauder's Senior Vice President and Creative Director, worked closely with Tom to create the first collection and get nostalgic imagery to support it. We think a strong ties to beauty and fashion editors will attract the more fashion-conscious consumer and bring increased vast and attention to our flagship brand when its product hit stores.
Along with the sales gains we generated, we also increase our profitability. Our restructuring efforts are enabling us to work more efficiently. As part of our ongoing cost reduction, we trimmed $104 million largely achieved in cost of goods, indirect procurement and resizing and restructuring initiatives. Our year-to-year savings totaled $264 million, and we now expect to save $300 million to $330 million for the fiscal year. 
As you know, we are committed to reinvest a portion of our savings to build capabilities. We are also refocused on continuously improving our productivity. Starting this July, we have established a company-wide mandate and plan that employee cost increased more slowly than sales growth. 
Our turnaround brands show solid financial improvements, which helps strengthen our bottom line. The official closing of Prescriptives Wholesale business on January 31, was executed flawlessly. And we received price from retailers and noting how well it was handled. We moved certain employees to other parts of the company and are transferring popular Prescriptive products and formulas to other brands, including Calyx fragrance which is now part of Aramis and designer fragrances. Some Prescriptive retail counters will be assumed by our other brands and its online sales will continue for a period of time. 
The Aramis and Designer Fragrance Division has began reaping the benefit of a profit-improvement strategy started it made in 2008. It has dramatically improved its cost of goods, cut its SKUs by over 50% in the last three years and its launching fewer fragrances with bigger impacts. The recent European introduction of Pure DKNY was well received. The fragrance is innovative because of its sustainability platform which is unusual in the category. ADF also began distributing the Coach fragrance in the U.S. department stores, broadening its availability beyond Coach retail stores. 
Another key component of our strategy is to enhance our capabilities in certain areas to improve our competitiveness. To that end, we announced that the establishment of a Corporate Marketing Center of Excellence, which will be a resource for our Research & Development teams, Brands and region, as we develop greater consumer insights and marketing tools. 
Georgia Garinois who worked for Johnson & Johnson, has joined us to lead the new center. Her responsibilities include capability development in multicultural marketing, global consumer insight, customer relationship management, digital marketing and advertising services. Georgia reports to me and is a member of the Executive Leadership Team. 
One of the company's historical strength has been our innovation and creativity. We believe that by utilizing more in-depth consumer insights and focusing our efforts on the biggest opportunities, we will produce even greater creative breakthroughs across the company. Our approach is to be creativity-driven and consumer-inspired.
We are developing a strong pipeline of new initiatives to drive growth over the next three years. We are planning launches that will include new product ideas, as well as existing successful products that we will improve with updated technology, similar to what we did with Advanced Night Repair. We will also accelerate innovation of the High-Touch services, which integrate our products to create a well-differentiated prestige experience. We will give you further details as this initiative near the launch date.
Earlier this month, we roll it out our Strategic Modernization Initiative to nine North America manufacturing facilities. Over 80% of our in-house production is now on SAP [Systems Analysis and Product]. Although it is too early to give details, the implementation is being smooth and we haven't encountered any major problems. On our next earning call in August, we plan to provide early results of the North America effort, review the SMI project and discuss crucial steps.
With just two months left in fiscal 2010, William Lauder and I are extremely pleased with how far we have come in the first leg of our four-year strategic journey. Looking ahead, we are prepared to move the company from successfully navigating in a recession to growing during a recovery. We plan to continue taking aggressive steps to fuel our momentum. For example, our targeted advertising and promotional spending will be significantly higher in the fourth quarter versus the previous year, which should help drive sales going into fiscal 2011. We will focus on our biggest opportunities, including major product launches, the best performing countries in our largest brands. 
As our performance this year should confirm, we are a growth company. Furthermore, as global economy return to more solid footing and employment levels improve, the money spent on prestige beauty product worldwide is expected to gradually return to historical norms. We fully expect to capture a bigger share of the growing pie. 
Now I will turn the call over to Cedric Prouvé who will talk about his area of the business. Cedric?"

As Fabrizio mentioned, the International business once again enjoyed strong sales and earnings growth in the recent quarter. In fact, our sales have increased every year for the last decade in local currenc",1341,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. As Fabrizio mentioned, the International business once again enjoyed strong sales and earnings growth in the recent quarter. In fact, our sales have increased every year for the last decade in local currency, underscoring how important the International operations are to the company as a whole. International accounts for nearly 60% of sales is the major growth driver and is transforming the historic company into a true global powerhouse.
Let me briefly explain why we've been so successful expanding our brands into more than 140 markets. First, we have a highly effective organization, led by strong regional teams that are developing expanded capabilities. They are supported by a powerful network of local affiliates which stay in touch with their consumer taste and thinking and provide excellent on-the-ground education. 
Our international organization continues to evolve and align with our global brands and functions. Of course, we also have a diverse portfolio of aspirational prestige brands that allows us to leverage our strategies and optimize our growth based on where we see the most promising opportunities. Market characteristics dictate our investments by categories, products, brands and channels. At the same time, we strive to balance our growth among emerging, developing and mature countries, again, in alignment with each of our brands strategic priorities and plans.
This year, every international region is ahead of its sales and profit objectives after the third quarter. Asia, however, is a standout with continued superb momentum. Within Asia, Greater China has been a key performer. The region's growth is being fueled by skin care, which accounts for a large majority of its sales. Our strongest brand in Asia at the moment is Estée Lauder, which has seen such astounding skin care sales in China that in the recent quarter, it became the brand's largest International business surpassing the U.K. 
Earlier, Fabrizio mentioned Origins' recent launch in China. We believe that Origins will be a perfect fit, since Chinese consumers are passionate about skin care and natural ingredients. In its first week, Origins was the top-selling beauty brand in the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai. And since its launch, Origins retail sales have exceeded our projections. We expect the brand to have six doors in Beijing and Shanghai by June 30. Origins is the ninth brand to join the China portfolio. 
Our most widely distributed brands are available in about 80 department stores across 35 of China's largest cities. Our brands are also present in about 80 separate doors in the country. There is still much room for expansion which we are directing deliberately and strategically. We're extremely pleased that China is no longer dilutive to the average profitability of the Asia-Pacific region. And our results in the country have consistently outpaced our five-year projections for sales and profits by at least a year. 
China is the largest of our emerging markets which as a total group grew 18% in the quarter. They account now for 12% of total company sales and extend well beyond the BRIC foursome to also include Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Turkey, just to name a few.
One way we accelerate our growth in emerging markets is by establishing our own affiliates early on. This enables us to hire the best local talent, which gives us the competitive advantage and develop a long-term strategy and investment plan. Our newest affiliate in Vietnam had strong double-digit growth in the third quarter, and we will maintain the momentum by launching M-A-C there in this fiscal year.
As you heard, Travel Retail's performance was strong, and it rebounded sharply from the weak environment of a year ago. The improvement was so great that the division had its best sales month ever in March. The channel was held by higher passenger traffic, initial success converting more travelers to buyers, great growth in Asia-Pacific and some restocking following last year's difficult climate. It continue to open doors for our younger brands, which accounted for about 15% of its sales growth this quarter. 
Our results in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region were mixed with emerging markets outperforming the more mature ones. However, we believe we gained market share in our distribution despite market challenges in certain countries. Our U.K. team has done an excellent job navigating our largest affiliate through a difficult economic environment, especially in Ireland, while growing and gaining share in our distribution.
Some of our less-developed brands, including Jo Malone and Tom Ford, showed solid gains in the European region. M-A-C and Bobbi Brown were also strong, and we plan to expand their point of sales including more freestanding stores, which allows us the best possible presentation to express their brand equity.
Business in Latin America has met our expectations despite recent disruptions in Chile and in Venezuela. The region's sales have more than doubled in the last several years, and our brands have sold well in Brazil and Mexico. The company has started fulfilling its mission to become completely integrated, so that the best ideas and products generated in one area can easily translate and travel to the rest of the world. 
As an example, when the Estée Lauder brand set out to create skin care commercials for Asian TV, it produced them on location in Hong Kong, where the nuances of skin care products and local styles and aesthetics were best understood. The ads were such a success that the brand will use some of them worldwide. 
Our International business has delivered excellent cost savings, which has helped improve profitability and allowed us to increase investments. Most of the incremental spending has gone to emerging market to seek future growth. We expect to spend about 50% more on TV advertising this quarter throughout this country to raise awareness of our core brands and fuel our momentum. 
For the first time, the Estée Lauder brand will run three integrated marketing campaigns in Asia using television, print and digital, simultaneously, for our skin care products. This is a prime example of how we allocate our investments to ensure that our momentum continues. 
Internationally, there are many growth opportunities in department stores, particularly in Asia where the channel remain strong. However, we are also pursuing other prestige channels similar to our approach in the U.S. and believe the opportunities are most promising where we can deliver an excellent High-Touch experience. This includes our international push into more e-commerce platform, generating not only significant sales growth, but also a more locally relevant, dynamic, High-Touch interface with new and existing consumers. We're expanding e-commerce and mobile commerce and building our digital capabilities to run website at regional and local levels in close collaboration with our brands. 
Providing personalized service and demonstration is an important factor as we grow our brands and introduced them to new customers across various prestige channels. For example, we are looking at ways to refine this model to best suit European perfumeries, where we sell many of our brands. We also intend to be a bigger player in European pharmacies where the skin care category has been growing rapidly. And in fiscal 2011, Aveda will be fully integrated into our International operations as we focus on adding high-end salons and spas to our distribution network. 
As we strive to gain the larger share of the consumer's total beauty purchases, we are learning from improved consumer insights to provide customization that is geared to local taste. We are focusing our innovation on creating locally relevant product, packaging, product delivery, services and communications. 
In closing, I want to emphasize how extremely proud I am of our International teams and the results they have produced. Our Regions and Travel Retail channel intend to keep advancing the company's strategy and aligned themselves to the commitment, as Fabrizio just described of being creativity-driven and consumer-inspired. We are confident that International will continue to prepare the company's growth and ensure that the Estée Lauder Companies remains the worldwide leader in prestige beauty. And now, I will turn the call over to Rick."

A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and special charges which I'll comment on separately.
Once again, we had a solid quarter. Sales rose 10% to $1.86 billion. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales were up 5% over the prior year period. Net earnings for the quarter more than doubled to $68.9 million compared with $31.4 million in the prior year quarter, and diluted EPS was $0.34 compared to $0.16 a year ago.
We continue to experience strong growth in the skin care category reflecting our strategic focus in that area. Sales rose 10% in local currency contributing more than half of the global increase in net sales. All three regions contributed to growth in this category, especially Asia and Europe. In makeup, local currency sales fell 2%. This category was adversely affected by the end of wholesale distribution of Prescriptives and was the most impacted by a charge for returns from European perfumeries, which I'll describe shortly. Excluding the impact of these two factors, local currency sales grew 4% over the prior year. The category grew double digits internationally on the strength from Clinique, M-A-C and Bobbi Brown.
Our fragrance sales jumped 13% excluding currency and the category continued to improve its profitability. The launch of Pure DKNY in Europe, Coach Signature in the U.S. and increased sales of certain designer fragrances through self-select outlets drove most of the increase.
In the hair care, sales rose 3% in local currency, due primarily through expanded distribution of Aveda in Japan, Korea and Australia. 
Geographically, our International businesses continued to lead growth. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa sales gain 7% in local currency. During the quarter, we recorded a charge of approximately $31 million to reflect anticipated returns from certain European perfumeries. The returns, primarily makeup, relate to a strategic effort to proactively align our product assortments by discontinuing slow-turning SKUs in favor of carrying higher-turning products.
Global Travel Retail sales continue to rebound from increased traffic and conversion of travelers to buyers. Sales in the channel jumped over 45% of an easy comparison in the prior year quarter, contributing substantially to the region's increase. 
Our U.K. sales slowed in the third quarter to low single-digit growth as adverse weather and an increase in VAT dampened purchases. However, our make-up artist brands continue to produce double-digit growth in the U.K. 
Developing markets in the region including Russia, the Middle East, India and Turkey all grew strong double digits. Most of the southern European countries perform below last year and the markets in Greece, Italy and Spain remained concerning. Germany was largely unchanged and the northern countries grew high-single digits
Our Asia-Pacific region sales climbed 10% in local currency, with most affiliates contributing. China continue to lead the region's growth rising over 30% in the quarter. Our business in Hong Kong rose 24% and Taiwan was up 25%. Korea grew 10% and we will continue to see strong results in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The political unrest in Thailand could curtail future sales. Japan decline mid-single digits as they continue to suffer from a tough economic environments.
Local currency sales in the Americas were up 2%, reflecting a modest pickup in consumer demand. Excluding Prescriptives, sales in department stores and our own retail stores was low-single digits. Sales growth in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and our Online division were more robust. Sales in other channels were mixed.
Our gross margin improved by 250 basis points this quarter to 76.2%. Our cost savings initiatives contributed 230 basis points primarily from the strategic shift in our product mix and lower material costs. We also benefited from favorable currency. These factors were partially offset by higher obsolescence of 40 basis points, which included the cost of returns from the SKU rationalization in Europe.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter improved 70 basis points to 68.5% compared to 69.2% last year. Improvements mostly came from cost savings initiative, partially offset by higher advertising, merchandising and sampling expense and cost to build capabilities. 
Operating income rose 87% to $142.8 million compared to $76.5 million last year, and operating margin increased 320 basis points to 7.7%. Regarding our interest expense, we reported $18.2 million this quarter versus $20.6 million in last year's third quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.4%, higher than normal due to the geographic mix of our earnings. The impact of the new tax legislation related to health insurance reform was not material to our results. We reported net restructuring and other special charges of $16.5 million during the third quarter.
Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, was $798 million compared to $307 million last year. The biggest drivers of the gain were higher net earnings and the timing and level of tax payments. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. 
Our days sales outstanding were 47 days this quarter, seven days lower than last year. Business  has been improving for many of our customers and so we are less concerned about their financial health at this time. Inventory days were 157 compared with 154 days last year. We booked $35 million in inventory of our top-selling SKUs in advance of the rollout of SAP to our North American manufacturing facilities earlier this month. We expect to work down the excess over the next two to three quarters. Importantly, our global SKU count was down 8% from a year earlier at the end of March. 
We spent $161 million for capital expenditures, which includes spending for our company-wide systems initiative. For fiscal 2010, we expect to generate between $800 million and $850 million of cash flow from operations, and to use about $315 million to $330 million for capital expenditures, although some of the spending could spill into the next fiscal year. 
As you saw in this morning's announcement, we are planning to purchase $200 million of our outstanding debt during the fourth quarter, which is expected to result in a one-time charge of $26 million to $30 million, or $0.08 to $0.10 per share. We expect interest savings of approximately $10 million to $11 million in fiscal 2011. This reduces leverage back in line with a A target credit rating.
With two months left in the fiscal year, our forecast reflect continued growth in Asia and a measured consumer recovery here in the U.S. and parts of Western Europe. We remain cautious about the economic environment in several Southern European markets, as well as Japan, and we expect more aggressive competition. Additionally, the recent disruption in European air travel cost by the volcanic activity in Iceland modestly impacted sales in our Travel Retail channel. However, this is a reminder of the vulnerability of this channel to unforeseen events. 
For the year, we now expect 2010 local currency sales growth of about 4% to 5%, led by our International business. Currency is expected to add approximately two percentage points to our reported sales.
Advertising, merchandising and sampling cost should continue to accelerate on our biggest launches in markets with good momentum such as China and Russia. We also continue to invest in building capabilities as called for in our strategy in areas such as digital programs, new High-Touch service models, regional, Research & Development and consumer insights. 
We expect to deliver savings for the year of $300 million to $330 million and to record charges associated with restructuring activities of between $60 million and $90 million. Given our progress to date, we now expect to improve operating margins by at least 400 basis points this year. At this time, we estimate our effective tax rate will range between 30% and 32% for the year.
We are moving our forecasted full year EPS range up to $2.65 to $2.75 per share. This range excludes the one-time charge of $0.08 to $0.10 related to the repurchase of debt, as well as restructuring charges. We will review our long-term goals as part of our annual budgeting process over the summer, and we plan to provide fiscal 2011 guidance on our year end call on August as we do every year. Remember, there is a degree of uncertainty and volatility inherent in our business. 
Our full year strategy is off to a good start and we are pleased with the progress to date. We still have a lot of work ahead, building capabilities, while simultaneously driving measured, profitable top line growth in a sustainable fashion and continuing to turn around underperforming brands. 
That concludes my comments, and we'll be happy to take your questions now."

I mean, the concept of reducing sales means of cutting back drastically on travel were temporary, certainly, in nature, and those things are absolutely coming back. There was some advertising spending that we did cut back last year. That spending is coming back as we are just describing, but it's coming back in a more efficient and effective way. So we're being careful and targeted in the way we spend that money. Whereas, historically, we were maybe not quite as good at measuring the ROI in that spending, and we're spending things on inefficient initiatives. So we're spending more money this year in those areas, but we're spending it more targeted. So in answer to your question, and just as Fabrizio described, we had temporary savings last year, which we said about 70% of that would probably come back as spending is coming back. Some of it much more efficiently than the way we had done it before. But we are more than compensating for that by the more permanent savings around our resizing, restructuring and cost-savings initiatives."

That's why we are cautious to say that this is just the recovery start, that everything is normalized. It's the beginning of positive signs, but we want to observe those signs for a longer period of time before making a final conclusion. The other, however positive thing that we see is that out of this 2% increase of the prestige beauty business is faster than the increase we saw in the quarter. For example, in the M-A-C's business and that particularly faster in the area of skin care, where the increase of the prestige has been five points faster than the increase in M-A-C's. So this, again, a positive indication that consumer feel a bit more comfortable with spending also on the higher end of their product choices.

Those marketing investments have an immediate benefit, in some cases, but also, in some other cases, are there to create long-term growth potential for the company. And let me clarify what I mean. When the marketing investment is behind a new launch in developed markets, obviously, you see some improved results on these loans initially in the quarter. But when those investments like, honestly, the large majority of our extra investment at this point of time and are in emerging markets, where we are basically investing to create brand equity and long-term awareness of these brands, those investment, are producing some immediate results, but particularly, are laying the ground for future long-term solid growth in these new markets. Just to put the number straight, the increased advertising, merchandising and promotion during the third quarter was 14%. The increase in the fourth quarter than we expect is 35% versus a year ago, so even more. And however, the advertising, merchandising spending in percentage for the year, in our current communicated estimate, is actually flat to the percentage. But the absolute level is well above, because obviously, we are calculating this flat percent, as well on higher sales. So by the end of the year, we're going to spend over $100 million more in support, heavily skewed on the second semester. And we do see an acceleration, because if you make the number, we have been growing, excluding the return in Europe, at 7% as currency, and we forecast a further slight acceleration of this for the fourth quarter. So pretty, pretty solid growth in the context of the current economic environment. Last point I want to add, we are also seeing, obviously, an increased spending from competition. So the other way to look at that is that we have been able, in the first six months of this fiscal year, to operate in a very efficient way with lower spending, but also, in the context of competition also having on average lower spending. This quarter and next quarter we expect an increased spending also from our competitors. That will make, obviously, our spending even more important."

Thank you for joining our Fiscal 2010 Year End Conference Call. My remarks this morning, I will discuss the company achievements during the past year and how we intend to continue our momentum in fiscal 2011. 
My first year as Chief Executive Officer, I am extremely gratified that our company performance was outstanding in so many respects. Last year, we laid out our plans, and you will see that we have delivered and in most instances exceeded our goals.
Our first major accomplishment was successfully launching our four-year strategy, and we made excellent progress. We are confident our strategy is sound and sustainable. Our senior management team and entire organization are aligned behind it, and our initial results show we are winning.
In addition, our performance was strong, and many financial measurements hit all-time high. This is even more extraordinary considering that our results were achieved during one of the most difficult economic times. We also made great strides evolving our organization and strengthening our capabilities to build our brands, fully leverage our innovation and improve profitability, but it is important to note that even as the company reorganized and changed its processes, we held on to our core family values and historical trends. Creativity and interpreting of spirits are ingrained in our heritage and culture.
Now let me highlight some specific financial results. These numbers are before charges for restructuring and the retirement of some debt. We announced this morning that full year sales were $7.81 billion, up 7% from the year before. Earnings per share were the highest ever at $2.75, nearly double last year results. Many other financial metrics also set records, including net sales in global skin care, the Asia Region and our Travel Retail businesses, cost of sales at a low of 23.3%, operating margin increases of 420 basis points, maturing of $552 million, cash flow from operation of $957 million and inventory obsolescence improvements. 
The backbone of our strategy is to be more competitive and gain share by growing sales at least 1% ahead of global prestige beauty every year by increasing our share in many of our largest countries and channels, including U.S. prestige department stores, Travel Retail, the U.K., China, it's clear we have achieved that goal. 
In U.S. department and specialty stores tracked by entity, our share expanded 0.1/2%, excluding the Prescriptives brand. The gain was led by Clinique, the biggest U.S. beauty brand, which has increased share the last two years. Being able to grow such a big brand is a major achievement. M-A-C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Origins also gained shares. 
Another objective was to increase profits in a sustainable way. In this first year, we reached an operating margin of 11.2%, a big jump from 7% in fiscal 2009. All of our costs declined as a percentage of sales, except advertising.  To further diversify, we set out to generate more than 60% of our sales outside of United States, and this year we achieved already that goal, hitting 62% of total sales. Our brands had strong organic growth, expanded into more countries and opened overseas stores. Also, our Travel Retail business far exceeded our expectation, driven by successful conversions of travelers into buyers. 
We also established broader objectives to better compete globally. In terms of product categories, our focus is more on skin care, particularly in Asia, again, we had a great success. In local currency, our skin care sales grew 9% globally and 11% in Asia where skin care counts for approximately 50% of our sales. As a result of this focus, skin care is now our largest category in both sales and profits.
The skin care gains were led by two high-profile launches: Estée Lauder reformulated Advanced Night Repair was the biggest launch in the company history and had a tremendous acceptance, particularly in Asia, China and Travel Retail. The brand recently introduced a complementary product, Advanced Night Repair for Eyes, and the two are being marketed together to continue the franchise momentum. Thanks to an effective new formula, supported by an integrated marketing campaign encompassing TV, digital and print, Clinique new Even Better Clinical also became a hit in the U.S., U.K. and Europe. As an example, after its launch, it quickly became the best-selling prestige skin care product in the highly competitive French market.
It's doing so well because it is the first beauty product whose results rival a prescription-strength product for treating an even skin tone, a universal concern that wasn't being adequately addressed by existing products. 
Our innovation also extended to our in-store services. We evolved our High-Touch model at Bloomingdale's where Clinique offers service as you like it, including express replenishment and do-it-yourself computer skin analysis. This concept is so successful that the brand expects to expand it to 60 more doors this year worldwide.
In term of our regions, sales in Asia climbed 10% and five markets posted solid double-digit growth. We are also thrilled that Estée Lauder became the best-selling prestige brand in its distribution in the region. We plan to accelerate our business in Asia, where most economies are strong, consumer spending is growing and we have opportunities to expand distribution.
The company also set out to improve our underperforming brands in an effort to boost overall profitability. We took many steps to address different issues, and as a group, these turnaround brands improved sharply. 
As you are likely aware, we closed Prescriptives wholesales business and did so at less cost than anticipated. We also are leveraging some of its best assets in other brands. Based on strong consumer demand, we continue to offer Prescriptives' top-selling products online for now.
Our Aramis and Designer Fragrance division showed great improvements. Its significant turnaround was driven by fewer, more impactful product launches, supporting its classics, improving its mix of business and distribution, tightening inventory and numerous savings in cost of goods. An upcoming Tommy Hilfiger fragrance called Loud is expected to be a major addition to its portfolio. 
In fiscal 2010, we saved $364 million from various cost-saving initiative, far greater than our original estimate of $175 million to $200 million. At the same time, we continue to invest in our business and increase our advertising, merchandising and sampling cost by approximately 7%.  Also, we believe we increased return on these investments by focusing on our biggest initiatives and improved media efficiencies. 
We also moved our Strategic Modernization Initiative forward by successfully implementing it across all of our North American manufacturing facilities. SMI will enable many of our future cost savings. Greg will go into more details about cost saving and SMI in a few minutes.
So as you have heard, we made fantastic progress in the first year of our four-year strategic journey, which is providing a solid foundation as we continue toward our goals. Our early success reinforces our vision and gives us confidence in our ability to execute our strategy with excellence.
Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned. Global prestige beauty is predicted to return to mid- single-digit growth over the long term. Research shows that women income is expanding around the world, and beauty is the category they are most likely to spend money on after food and clothing.
In fiscal 2011, we estimate that global prestige beauty will rise 2% to 3% at retail, and we intend to exceed that pace, again picking up share. For us, the stronger growth is expected to come from Asia, skin care, hair care and online, through both higher same-store sales and new distribution, as we continue rolling out our brands globally to meet increasing demand. M-A-C, for instance, plan to open about 140 doors this year across a variety of retail formats, including department stores, its own freestanding stores, Travel Retail location and perfumeries. The vast majority will be in international markets. 
We have gained share against prestige competitors in every region for the last two years. However, in some markets and categories, mass brands have grown faster than prestige behind heavy advertising, broad distribution and lower prices. We consider all brands, both M-A-C and prestige to be our competitors, as many consumers buy beauty product across various channels. We feel confident that honing and communicating our unique strengths, including a long history of aspirational brand equities and innovation in products, packaging, any store services, will make us an even stronger competitor across the entire beauty landscape. This characteristic will allow us to attract consumer to prestige distribution channels around the globe, where women are looking for aspirational brands and the latest innovation, combined with our High-Touch services. We can perfectly fulfill their cosmetic needs and provide them with the shopping experience they deserve in the time they choose to dedicate to themselves.
We are deepening our consumer insights, ramping up our creative energies to be even more locally relevant and furthering our new strategy for launching fewer, bigger products. We learned last year that effective advertising on aspirational brands focused on fewer winning products, build strong awareness and is more effective drawing traffic into our distribution. Once consumers come out to our doors or website, our High-Touch services create a personal connection in Estée brand loyalty, which we leverage to sell even more products. For example, Clinique unprecedented national print, TV and digital campaign for Even Better Clinical brought thousands of new consumers to U.S. department store and specialty stores who purchased skin care products there for the first time. 
Our product introductions will be supported after their full potential with our new launch level approach. We will introduce fewer products, support them with aggressive advertising and use them to accelerate sales by leveraging the power of our High-Touch service. We have identified several new initiative that will be launched in this way. Our plans call for us to expand our advertising budget this year, and we expect to continue investing significantly in print, TV and digital to support innovation.
We also are tailoring our in-store High-Touch services to different kinds of channels. Our retail brands experts at more than 5 million face-to-face interaction with consumers every day worldwide, and provide personalized information and education. This is a powerful asset that isn't generally available in mass channels, and we plan to build farther on this point of differentiation.
Let me give you a few example on how we are adapting High-Touch service beyond the traditional department store counter to other channels as well. M-A-C new Times Square flagship already is largest freestanding store, is stocked with 60 multi-cultural makeup artists, who together speaks nine languages. It also features touch screen computers and video for the latest makeup looks. 
In European pharmacies, where we do not usually have brand-specific advisers, we have put in testers and consumer information on shelves for their favorite skin line. The improvements on dialing and senior explains how to use the products, which ones are new and which ones are best sellers.
In Travel Retail, we created a private prestige space within airport stores to present Estée Lauder renew clinic line and stocked it with a specially trained ambassador for expert consultation. And we are launching Spanish language e-commerce sites in the U.S. for Clinique, M-A-C, Estée Lauder and Bobbi Brown and building on our mobile e-commerce initiatives in the U.S. and Japan. About half of our online visits and sales in Japan come from mobile phones and devices.
North America department stores remain our largest and most critical channel. Thanks to our new North America affiliate, we have a stronger internal structure and are building better consumer plans with our important retail partners. So together we can attract new shoppers and grow beauty sales in this channel. 
Our efforts are working. In the last several months prestige beauty sales in North America department stores have made significant improvements as consumer spending has picked up. Some of our best initiatives like Clinique Even Better Clinical have attracted users of most brands to department and specialty stores. In coreguly [ph] [45:25], sales of our luxury brands, including Bobbi Brown and La Mer accelerated as well in the second half of the year.
We are also strategically expanding our presence in faster growing alternative prestige channels. Bumble and bumble will initially open in 10 U.S. Sephora doors, with modern, brand equity building High-Touch elements such as interactive touch screen and fashion week videos, and it won't be simply another retail location. Consumer also will be directed to Bumble's network of salon and get a $20 gift card for salon services when they buy products. 
We are also planning to aggressively build our hair care brands presence in prestige salons, while staying highly selected, and we'll increase our penetration over the next few years. Since consumers spent an average of 45 minutes in a salon during each visit, this channel is well positioned to deliver the next level of High-Touch.
Our recent acquisition of the makeup brand Smashbox was also driven by its expertise in alternative channels, including Sephora, ULTA, dial-response television and online. We plan to use the brand's talents and experience in these channels as we expand our presence in the fastest growing areas for beauty. We expect Smashbox will be a wonderful addition to our portfolio.
Another important growth vehicle is emerging markets, particularly China. Our sales in China grew 29% in fiscal 2010. To maintain the momentum and gain share, we plan to open more than 90 doors in this area in department stores and Sephora. Also, Origins, our newest brand in China, we continue to open more doors. M-A-C, we launched an e-commerce site in January, and we will continue using TV to advertising major skin care products.
China is growing so fast that its planned to be our second biggest Asian market this year overtaking Korea. We are also looking to capture sales from avid Chinese beauty users outside their home market. Travel Retail expects to capitalize on the growing number of Chinese citizens who are traveling and shopping. 50 million Chinese traveled abroad in 2009, a number that is expected to rise to 90 million by 2013.
We are also strengthening our capabilities. We established a new Corporate Marketing Center of Excellence to give our brands and regions greater consumer insights and improve access to best practices, which they can use to create more targeted products, services and stronger marketing plans. In concert with this effort, we are completing the staffing of our regional R&D centers in Europe and Asia, which we are expanding to get closer to our consumer local preferences. Regionally developed products with widespread appeal will eventually be sold in other geographies too.
With the digital universe growing in importance, we will continue strengthening our many capabilities in this area, ranging from e-commerce to mobile commerce and online advertising to social media engagement. E-commerce sales are expected to climb strong double digits for the foreseeable future, and part of that growth will come from new sites. This year we will launch e-commerce in Brazil, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway for the first time and add more brand sides to the nine countries we are already in.
In closing, we are extremely proud and pleased with our major accomplishment during the first year of our long-range plan. We stuck to our strategy, it paid off handsomely. Our exports made us stronger, leaner and more profitable, enabling us to add several billion dollar in stockholder value. Our employees deserve a huge thanks for their tremendous efforts. We relied on their talent, deep knowledge, innovative thinking and dedication to the company to move forward and create new ways of working together. I know at times it wasn't easy, and we are extremely grateful for the hard work that was required. I also want to acknowledge my appreciate to William Lauder and the entire Lauder family for their guidance and encouragement during my first year leading the company. With their support, we been able to implement many worldwide changes, while maintaining and leveraging the company's strengths, historical values and long-held principles. This has been invaluable. 
In order to reach our ultimate goals, much work still remains, and some of it will be harder to achieve. However, our initial results make us confident we can obtain our goals, so we are raising our 2013 operating margin target. We now expect to achieve a 12 1/2% to 13 1/2% operating margin by fiscal 2013. We will regularly review this target as our strategy evolves.
The global beauty industry is becoming more complex and competitive by the day, but is also an exciting place to be. And we are confident that anchored by our diverse brand portfolio, vast geographic region, passionate and creative workforce, we can confront the challenge and exploit the opportunities that will arise. We are a creativity-driven, consumer-inspired company. This unique balance will help us deliver sustainable, profitable growth and enable us to be the global leader in prestige beauty for years to come.
Now, Greg will speak to you about our cost savings and the Strategic Modernization Initiatives. Greg?"
207221,6109958,74323,"Estee Lauder Companies Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-12-2010",2010-08-12,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Thank you Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. For those of you who don't know me, let me give you a little background. I joined the Estée Lauder Companies two years ago after having worked at several consumer products companies during my 30 year career",2043,"Thank you Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. For those of you who don't know me, let me give you a little background. I joined the Estée Lauder Companies two years ago after having worked at several consumer products companies during my 30 year career. I held leadership positions in the supply chain area, as well as in brands and finance. In my current role I lead the company's end-to-end global supply chain, which ranges from procurement, manufacturing and distribution to planning and quality assurance. I also oversee the Strategic Modernization Initiative and co-chair the Program Management Team with Rick.
I was attracted to Estée Lauder because of the passion, creativity and energy of its people, it's fabulous portfolio of brands and the opportunity to help design and implement the new strategy. And the reality has been even better than I expected. Joining Estee Lauder offered me the opportunity to use my skills and experience to help lead the supply chain and take it to the next level, while also being able to learn from my colleagues as we work together to improve integration and alignment.
Improving integration and alignment from the very beginning of our creative and innovation approach, right through execution to the market really does add value to our brands. I'm pleased to say we've made tremendous progress in a short time, and created a partnership between the brands, regions and functions, which has helped make the company more efficient and supported our growth. The high quality of our products continues, of course, to be paramount and our R&D, packaging, supply chain and innovation teams are all included early in the development process. 
I'm equally excited by the opportunities for additional cost savings and other improvements that lie ahead. By continuing to create more efficiencies and drive costs out of our supply chain, we're able to channel it back into needed capabilities to grow the business, and also increase returns to the stockholders. 
As Fabrizio mentioned, thanks to the collective efforts of our employees across brands, regions and functions, the company saved $364 million in fiscal 2010 from our cost savings programs. These initiatives are being led by the Program Management Team, an executive leadership group that is developing new processes, alignment and capabilities to enable sustained savings. The PMT also helps to determine the ideal pacing and sequencing of various projects to ensure the best use of our resources.
The major cost savings for fiscal 2010 occurred as follows: The largest piece accounting for about half the savings, came from cost of goods at $171 million, which is the area I'll discuss in more detail in a minute; next was resizing and restructuring and a company-wide salary freeze, which contributed approximately $145 million and lastly in indirect procurement and distribution, we saved about $33 million. 
The company had its lowest cost of goods as a percentage of sales since it went public in 1995, and this was achieved in several ways. About one third came from mix, mix by category, region and brand. Skin care is our category with the lowest cost of goods, and by emphasizing this area across our relevant brands, we increased our skin care sales as a percentage of our overall business. We also sold more products in Asia, and that region has the lowest cost of goods as a percentage of sales. Skin care comprises the largest percentage of sales in Asia.  We also successfully sold more products from our high-end brands that have the lowest cost of goods. The other two thirds of savings came from cost efficiencies, including material costs and productivity. We work together to make all of our brands more profitable. 
Much of these accomplishments were possible because the supply-chain teams worked collaboratively with the cross functional brand teams, both before and after launches to examine all the costs involved in a particular product. Joining forces and perspectives at the start of the innovation process creates a capability to bring more products to market in a more efficient manner. Although this was a cultural change, I believe the integration and interaction has been valuable to the supply chain as we get a better understanding about our brands. We have been able to launch more products with higher margins right from the start, which obviously frees up resources to invest in marketing and building brand equity.
Let me give you an example. When we were developing the pureDKNY fragrance, a cross functional team, which included members of the supply chain, was integrated into the innovation process early on. The entire package and other elements of the mix were created with our consumer in mind, offering outstanding quality and sustainable environmentally friendly platform, but also included the expertise of suppliers, manufacturing and distribution, who were all at the table. The result is a great product, with high consumer satisfaction at a cost that's 22% less than plan.
Also contributing to the improved cost of goods was a lower cost of material, which we accomplished in part by being more collaborative with suppliers. Again, as an example in the case of fragrances, we created a new business model that assures a select group of suppliers greater engagement in developing our products, a new way of helping drive more efficiency in the end-to-end development process and a longer view of our brand and innovation plans. Obviously, this helped to create a more efficient way of working for us and our suppliers, which will not only help improve margins but add even more fuel to our innovation capabilities. We plan to broaden this concept across our supply base and in other product categories, as we work to improve the total systems cost and streamline our supply chain. However, as we improve the way we work with our suppliers, we also need to continue to enhance our internal processes and capabilities.
We've also begun to drive improvements in logistics, which contributed to our overall savings effort. We are working to create an upgraded and consolidated global distribution network. In Europe and Asia, we have already closed or moved several distribution centers and have started the work required to implement SMI. [audio gap] [57:44] savings in the distribution center network and transportation and continue to analyze this area for further efficiencies in the coming years.
For the second year in a row, we made considerable progress on another important front: Reducing the number of stock-keeping units, which we shrunk 10% in fiscal 2010 after an even bigger drop in 2009. We have eliminated less profitable SKUs and creating fewer, less productive ones, which obviously contributes to a more efficient portfolio. Fewer SKUs also improves our productivity in buying and manufacturing, and greatly contributed to improving our obsolescence. Thanks in part to trimming the number of SKUs and by working closely together in a more formal sales inventory and operating plant process, we've lowered our obsolescence expense by about $35 million this year, which includes taking back large returns of stock from Europe, to provide a better assortment in the perfumery channel. In fiscal 2011, we expect to reduce these costs even further.
We're also refining our manufacturing strategy to produce our products closer to our consumers where economically logical. This reduces transportation and distribution costs and lead times. We'll continue to study our network to find greater efficiencies and enhance productivity. 
All these cost savings and improvements are great successes, but one of the changes I'm most proud of is that we made great progress toward building an interdependent organization, where people realize their actions have a ripple effect and impact more than just their piece of the business. We are working collaboratively and making decisions for the good of the company as a whole, not just for a particular brand or region and using leverage across brands and geographies to improve our results. 
We're still relatively early in this journey, but from my experience, the amount of progress we've made in creating this interdependent organization could only be accomplished because of the quality of the people in our brands, regions and functions. Their commitment to this company is amazing. Despite the changes required to be a more integrated organization, we've managed to maintain the high quality uniqueness and equity of each of our brands. We've learned we can drive innovation and creativity, while still finding and leveraging synergies. This new approach and way of thinking is evident in the company's stellar results this year. In fiscal 2011, we expect our PMT led programs to save between $130 million and $140 million. About half of that sum, again, is expected to come from cost of goods. 
Now let me turn to SMI, our Strategic Modernization Initiative, which is one of the company's biggest undertakings ever. At its most basic level, SMI is about creating common and more efficient processes where logical, and as appropriate, supporting them with technology. SMI is key to enabling the implementation of various parts of our company's strategy and helps to ensure that we can sustain the progress.
This year, we have succeeded in implementing SMI in the technical solution of SAP in nine manufacturing facilities, and did so without any major issues or disruptions to our business. This, again, is a real credit to our global and regional SMI teams, the support of our partner, IBM, and the focus of the leadership on this initiative. More than 80% of our in-house production is now using SAP software. Previously, we launched SMI at our Aveda operation in Minnesota and our U.K. manufacturing facility, and in North America, we implemented the financial backbone and demand planning functions. Launching SMI throughout our North American manufacturing was a major milestone, and it went just about as well as we could have expected.
We continue to gain important knowledge and expertise, and we will leverage that knowledge in the next wave, which rolls out to multiple affiliates and regions in the second half of fiscal 2011. At that time, we expect to implement SMI in the U.K., Germany, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. We are now carefully planning and testing the technical implementation, working on the change of leadership and the organizational design and sharing the lessons learned from our previous experience in advance of going live.
Christopher Wood, who was named Senior Vice President of Global SMI several months ago, brings strong international affiliate and brand expertise, which will be critical as we further integrate SMI into the commercial side of our business. He has hands on knowledge of what it takes to provide High-Touch service to our local markets, while ensuring that through SMI we are taking full advantage of the common processes and technology for speed, efficiency and the transparency of information.
We expect to have the majority of our operations on the SMI program by the end of fiscal 2012. We've seen some early benefits from the implementation of SMI, but the major and sustainable efficiencies will come after a bit more real life use in the manufacturing network and after the majority of the companies using the same system, supporting our objectives through fiscal 2013 and beyond.
The SAP technology will reduce the number of applications we have from approximately 700 down to 100 when finished, and dramatically simplify the number of in-scope systems interfaces from about 3,800 to 300. For the first time, we'll have a single source of data across the world, which will enable globally consistent and reliable information.
SMI will continue to enable improved supply chain leverage, back office and indirect procurement savings, speed to market and ultimately our bottom line. SMI is a key enabler to help us unleash and importantly sustain a significant piece of the savings we expect to reap now and for many years to come.
In closing, we're working hard on many fronts to improve our cost structure, assure the superior quality of our products, streamline our entire supply chain from customers through suppliers and to modernize our systems. All of these efforts should greatly contribute to the Estée Lauder Companies sustained profitably this year and long into the future and will continue to liberate resources to invest in our growth. 
Thank you. Now we will turn the call over to Rick."
207221,6109958,74323,"Estee Lauder Companies Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-12-2010",2010-08-12,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll briefly cover our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year, and then focus my discussion on fiscal 2011. My commentary reflects our results before restructuring and special charges, which I'l",2565,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll briefly cover our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year, and then focus my discussion on fiscal 2011. My commentary reflects our results before restructuring and special charges, which I'll cover separately. 
The fourth quarter capped off a terrific year. Sales in the quarter grew 9% as reported, 8% excluding currency. Strong new product launches, backed by more significant growth in advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses, fueled the increase and attracted more consumers to both our brands and distribution. These investments should help us continue our sales momentum into the first half of fiscal 2011.
All regions grew in the quarter, led by Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with nearly 14% organic growth. Asia-Pacific rose 8% in local currency, and the Americas region grew 3%. In the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, operating results declined as we spent heavily to support major launches. 
In line with our strategic priorities, skin care again led category growth, followed closely by makeup. For the quarter they rose 11% and 9% respectively and grew in each region. Gross margin improved 240 basis points, which includes about $46 million in PMT savings.
Operating expenses increased 290 basis points for the quarter. PMT savings of approximately $54 million and lower impairment charges of $46 million helped the expense margin. However, we strategically increased advertising, merchandising and sampling by over 35%, leading to an operating margin decline of 50 basis points to 3.7% for the quarter.
Our fourth quarter tax provision, included a $31 million credit resulting from a reduction in our reserves primarily related to favorable tax settlements. 
The fourth quarter performance was the culmination of a year that saw a modest recovery in the U.S., a sharp rebound in Travel Retail and a continuation of growth in key markets around the world, despite weakness in Japan and Southern Europe. The combination of faster than expected recovery, the rapid realization of our strategic priorities and the fact that significant risk didn't materialize, allowed us to increase our guidance twice during the year. For fiscal 2010 full year, sales rose 5% versus last year on local currency at the top end of our most recent guidance range.
Favorable currency movements added nearly two percentage points of growth, resulting in a reported sales gain of 7% to $7.81 billion. Net earnings for the year were $551.7 million compared with $280.1 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.75, almost double the $1.42 reported last year. As Fabrizio noted, we achieved all time highs in a number of key measures, including operating income, EPS and cash flow.
Our sales growth was broad based with every region and nearly every product category contributing. Asia-Pacific once again led growth, with net sales rising 10% in local currencies. Every country in the region, except Japan, grew, and many markets saw double-digit gains. China led the region with growth of 29% on increased consumption and distribution. Hong Kong rose 23% on tourism. Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia grew double digits on strong consumer demand. Japan continued to suffer with a local currency sales decline in the mid-single digits for the year.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, local currency sales gained 8%. Our Travel Retail business recovered quickly in fiscal 2010, rising 27%, as international airline passenger traffic improved, retailers restocked and we implemented programs to increase conversion and improve the in store experience. Sales in the U.K. remained a bright spot, rising 7%. The growth was due to robust London tourism, high demand for makeup and strong double-digit growth in our Online business.
Among developing markets, Russia and Turkey grew over 20% in fiscal 2010. The Middle East grew 7% and India jumped over 40% off a very small base. Southern Europe remains weak and Greece declined sharply as consumer demand dropped in the wake of austerity measures. Trade destocking continued this year, primarily in areas hard hit by recession.
We estimate that destocking reduced regional sales by approximately 2% equal to about two weeks of retail inventory. The Americas turned the quarter in fiscal 2010. According to NPD, excluding Prescriptives, beauty sales in department stores and Sephora declined less than 2%. Our retail sales on the same basis, declined less than 1% and our share rose 50 basis points for the year. Beauty sales growth in department stores, our primary channel of distribution, began to outpace beauty sales growth in mass channels during the second half of our fiscal year. For us, the regions also saw a nice recovery during the second half of the fiscal year, ending with full year net sales slightly better than last year. Sales in alternative channels were mixed. Salons and company-owned retail stores were flat, and online sales grew 15%. Sales in Latin America rose more than 15% and Canada grew modestly.
By category, skin care sales rose 9% this year, excluding currency leading growth in all regions. Estée Lauder's Advanced Night Repair and other key products were the biggest contributors, especially in Asia. Clinique products also resonated, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Even Better Clinical and Youth Surge Night led sales of products, while the core three-step franchise continued to grow. 
Makeup grew 4% in constant dollars led by M-A-C. The brand added about 100 new doors, reflecting a strategy for international expansion. Additionally, this year's Viva Glam campaign with Lady Gaga and Cyndi Lauper was the most successful ever. Bobbi Brown also contributed to growth in this category on the success of its pretty powerful campaign and strong basic business. 
In fragrance, our goal was to improve the business model before focusing on top line growth. That said, sales in the category declined only 2%, while profits swung dramatically from a loss last year to a profit this year, thanks to the hard work of our fragrance task force. Our newest scent, pureDKNY was well received in Europe, and we just launched it in the U.S. 
Sales of hair care products rose 2% this year, primarily from Aveda. The brand benefited from salon expansion in Europe and Asia and new products. Operating profit in this category was adversely impacted by impairment charges recorded in December for Ojon. However, Aveda and Bumble and bumble saw improved operating income.
Gross margin expanded to a 220 basis points to a record 76.7%. Favorable product mix added 70 basis points, lower obsolescence contributed 60 basis points, favorable manufacturing branches were 40 points and positive currency and lower promotions garnered 10 points each. For the year, our PMT initiatives improved cost of sales by $171 million.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales fell 250 basis points to 65.5%. We achieved $193 million in operating expense savings from our initiatives, which contributed about 250 basis points to the reduction. Higher impairment charges in the prior year resulted in an additional 20 basis point decline, and currency contributed 10 basis points. These savings were partially offset by higher advertising, merchandising and sampling investment of 20 basis points, where we spent approximately $120 million more than fiscal 2009, and strategic investment spending of about 10 basis points.  Operating income rose 71% to $874.6 million, and operating margin rose 420 basis points to 11.2% compared to last year.
We are proud of this tremendous accomplishment, and we believe it is sustainable. We expect to continue to improve our operating margin but not at the same rate. The savings going forward are expected to be more measured in their pace.
Net interest expense was slightly lower at $74.3 million compared with $75.7 million in fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate for the year was approximately 31%. The rate reflects a significant reduction, primarily attributable to favorable tax settlements.
During fiscal 2010, we recorded $84.7 million in returns and restructuring charges. We have now recorded a total of $176 million of the $350 million to $450 million we originally expected to take through fiscal 2013. The charges primarily reflect employee-related costs, asset and inventory write offs, contract terminations and other special charges. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $27.3 million related to the repurchase of debt. These costs were equal to $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.37 per share for the year.
Now moving to operating cash flow. For the year ended June 30, 2010, operating cash flow increased to a record $957 million compared with $696 million the previous year. The increase primarily reflects the substantial improvement in earnings. Days sales outstanding improved to 36 days compared with 45 days at this time last year. We benefited from tightened receivables in emerging markets, as well as the timing of sales in the fourth quarter. Some of this benefit is likely to reverse itself in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Inventory days rose to 166 compared with 155 days last year. The increase reflects the planned inventory build ahead of the North American SAP implementation and the expectation of strong 2011 first quarter sales. We spent $271 million for capital expenditures this year, reflecting continued investment on an SMI and information technology, with some of our planned spending delayed into fiscal 2011.
During the year, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of our Class A Common Stock. Through June, we've repurchased 70 million shares and had 18 million shares remaining in our current authorization.
We ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. In fiscal 2010, we've maintained our $0.55 per share dividend rate, paying out $109 million. On January 1, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Smashbox, which reduced our cash balance. Additionally, we expect to continue to return cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and/or dividends. We are currently reevaluating our uses of cash in light of our relatively low dividend payout ratio. Our board typically approves the annual dividend in November.
Now I'll discuss a few assumptions for the coming fiscal year. In fiscal 2011, we plan to build on the success of the solid foundation we have created for sustainable, continuous progress towards our long-term goals. We expect global prestige beauty to expand by 2% to 3% at retail, as we continue a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe. Our own sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8% excluding currency but including about a percentage point of growth from the acquisition of Smashbox.
Currency translation could decrease our reported sales growth by about two to three percentage points. Euro-based countries represent about 12% of our total sales, and our assumption for the euro is approximately $1.25. The U.K. is currently 8% of our sales, and our estimate assumes about a $1.50 for the pound. Japan is now 4% of sales, and we are using approximately 85 yen to the dollar.  As you know, if the dollar strengthens or weakens against these major currencies, it will further impact our financial results. 
We expect gross and to improve by 50 to 70 basis points for the fiscal year, driven by the cost of goods improvements Greg discussed earlier. Operating expenses should benefit from improved leverage of our savings initiatives, mostly offset by a ramp up in investment spending behind capabilities, including digital, global R&D, SMI and consumer insights, targeted advertising spending and equity compensation cost related to the higher stock price.
Let me give you some details behind the incremental savings we are expecting this year. Organizational restructuring and resizing, while nearly complete, could add $15 million to $20 million in savings this year. As Greg mentioned, cost of goods activities, primarily mix, reduced inventory-related costs and supplier consolidation are forecasted at around $70 million. We expect to save an additional $45 million to $50 million in shared services and indirect procurement. We expect to achieve fiscal 2011 savings of between $130 million to $140 million, with about $30 million to $35 million expected in the first quarter. The savings should be relatively evenly spread by quarter this year. We are reinvesting some of that savings back into the most promising and most profitable areas of our business.
We expect an approximate 50 to 90 basis point improvement in operating margin this year, which brings us closer to our long-range targets. The improvement would also be about 30 to 40 basis points higher, excluding Smashbox and the effect of currency rate movements.
We have changed our processes to institutionalize continuous productivity improvements by limiting the growth of overhead in any given year to a percentage of sales growth. This systemic approach should help us ensure not only sustainability but continuous improvements. Our savings initiatives are reflected in the substantial projected growth of pre-tax earnings. The natural tax rate, based primarily o projected geographic earnings and statutory rates, is expected to be between 32% and 34%. The rate may be influenced by changes in tax rates, mix of earnings and fluctuations in the amount of tax reserves and can vary by quarter.
Diluted EPS for fiscal 2011 is expected to be between $2.80 and $3.5. Included in this estimate are Smashbox integration costs, the impact of currency movements and the anticipated increase of the effective tax rate, which combined reduce EPS by approximately $0.25.
We anticipate working down the inventory as we built for the SAP roll out and continue to pursue inventory improvements in other areas of the business. This should result in a 10% improvement in inventory days year-over-year. With rising earnings and a solid improvement in inventory levels, partially offset by the reversal of the timing of receivables I just mentioned and about $50 million cash outlays related to restructuring, we expect to generate between $825 million and $875 million in cash flow from operations. We plan to use approximately $350 million of cash for capital projects, including some spending carried over from fiscal 2010.
In fiscal 2011, we expect to take restructuring and other special charges of $45 million to $55 million with about $13 million in the first quarter. We will update these estimates if necessary on future calls. 
Our first quarter will have a tough comparison to the prior year, when we more than tripled EPS and grew the operating margin by almost 10 percentage points. Nonetheless, we expect to reap the rewards of the fourth quarter marketing spend and new product launches, to grow sales between 11% and 13% in local currency.
Adverse foreign exchange could impede growth by two to three percentage points. We expect gross margin to decline during the quarter, and support spending should revert to more normal levels compared to the relatively light spend in the year ago period. EPS for the three months is expected to come in between $0.67 and $0.80 reflecting a more normalized spending level. 
Regarding restructuring plans, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013, we said we expected to record $350 million to $450 million in restructuring and other special charges and derive $450 million to $550 million in savings. At this time, we feel comfortable we can hit the higher end of the savings target, while incurring the lower end of the charges. We continue to expect incremental savings in each year.
I just want to remind you again that our guidance for fiscal 2011 for the first quarter and the full year does not include restructuring and other special charges. 
And that concludes my comments for today, and we'd be happy to take your questions now."

In the last quarter, we increase advertising very strong, 35%, as we've communicated. This was due with capital things. First of all, because we had some important initiative concentrating the periods, and second, because we were learning and testing some new ways to advertise, by the way, proven to be very effective. So for the total year, we grew advertising by about 7%, and we believe that in 2011, we'll continue in that direction. So we plan to continue increasing advertising on the high single digit. So this trend with advertising growing in line with sales slightly ahead, is probably the trend that we are going to see, but obviously we are still in the middle of our learning process so this number is subject to be readjusted and changed as we learn. The key learning here is that as I've explained, I think in my speech, is that we have learned that having some high quality and high advertising on some great initiative is essential to attract new users to our distribution and to our accounts. And there we are able, thanks to our High-Touch service, to sell more products and to create better loyalty to our brands and to retain those consumers. So the combination of our business model is proven to be enhanced importantly from focused high-quality advertising on key initiatives. And I think we will be more and more able to exploit these new learning in the future here spending in advertising at this level."

So it's a very, very different by region and by competitor, but the key point is, yes, competition is also increasing advertising spending as the economy recovers and as consumer become more sensitive to spending again. In term of our growth in July, September, Smashbox will be accounted for one point out of 11, 13 points. The rest is really organic growth of our business. So our business really growing fast in this quarter, as we said, is the result of the fact that the key 35% increase in advertising in the last quarter this year was mainly focused on some key initiatives, which are winning big.

We attract new consumers to our counters, and the fact that we are investing in improving also our High-Touch services with all our retail partners, that this combination is proving to be of share and to be winning where we exercise it. So what the real change of philosophy is there will be fewer, bigger initiatives supported by heavy advertising as an alternative to manage more initiative, each one of them supported by a little bit of advertising. That's the real change in philosophy. And you have a change in philosophy then we have identified in each one of our key brands some very interesting new initiatives for re-launching of existing winning assets for the next three years that we plan to support with this new model of advertising.

So why wouldn't you have a reduction in the ratio due to your cost savings initiatives and operating leverage as you achieve sales growth? So why would SG&A ratio be flattish in FY '11?"

We are making savings and there will be savings reflected in those numbers, but we're also investing in capabilities and we've talked about that for some time. The biggest impact of that financial impact is felt in fiscal 2011; those capabilities around R&D, consumer insights, digital are the main themes of that so those are big numbers that are in there. And there's also, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's a cost related to equity-based compensation based on the higher stock price as well. So those are some of the things that are offsetting, if you will, some of the savings. But our operating margin after coming off a year of 420 basis points and then to grow another, between 50 and 90 basis points, we're moving towards our long-range target which we took up to 12.5% to 13.5%, and we're making pretty good progress, we think.

Some might say that it wasn't that long ago that you really grew top line pretty handily at a much lower cost expense. We're very easily beating EPS guidance and expectation, 15% operating margin was in some peoples' expectations by 2012, not that you said that, but that was what some people had expected, and arguably some of that is still in the stock. On the flip side, you could also say that you're growing organic sales, sure, but it is decelerated on a stacked basis, and your operating margin this quarter suggested a lot of spend back for, again, a deceleration in top line. Next year it doesn't look like you're growing operating margins that quickly. And so I'm just trying to get a sense of what you think the momentum is? It feels like you're really slowing down here going forward, and just want to understand why that is?

Let me tell where I believe the momentum is. First of all, I think we are delivering what we said. I said that we would have been going 1% ahead of market in sales and reached by 2013, 12% to 13% margin. And that was the first phase. Then I said afte",619,"Yes. Let me tell where I believe the momentum is. First of all, I think we are delivering what we said. I said that we would have been going 1% ahead of market in sales and reached by 2013, 12% to 13% margin. And that was the first phase. Then I said after we would have clarified the plan how to reach a 15% margin, but this was premature for the time being. Now vis-à-vis these goals, there still is our goals with the entire organization is being focused on, vis-à-vis these goals, we are growing more aggressively than that. We are growing more than 1% ahead of market. And particularly in 2011, our 6% to 8% growth is going to be well ahead of this initial goal and well ahead of the average of the market. So we are continue to be what, you're right, historically, we have been a good growth company, and we are actually becoming an even better growth company, in my opinion, thanks to the new ability to use innovation and High-Touch in new ways and thanks to the important contribution of some new winning regions like Asia or Travel Retail. Second, we have delivered our savings and we have delivered our saving, proving to ourself what maybe a year ago was not so obvious: That we can execute with excellence in the organization, and proving to ourselves that we can deliver and over-deliver our cost savings as we become focused on them. And not only cost savings, we have proven that we can also manage pretty aggressively all our cash elements. We have reduced inventories, we make amazing work on receivables. So I think that the financial and operational discipline that I was discussing in the beginning of this journey seems to be really proven after the first year of going. Then we also are seeing that these initial identified cost savings are going to be delivered the top range, and we are saying that then, we are creating new elements of sustainability like SMI, that they will produce the next group of savings that we today don't feel yet we can deploy and commit to because the work is not finished, but we are working on it. And finally, we are seeing that because of the first year, is only one year, by the way, the first good year of this journey, we're already in a position to commit on the high end of the cost saving and important to commit to, at that point, more margin target for 2013. And I know that this bring us to 13.5% and not to 15% as some of the market believe. But also I said that the 15% is something we believe one day we can reach, but today, is a bit too early to create a new target before we have proven sustainability of the initial target now increased, and before we have really demonstrated that we can also execute some of the other elements of the plans that we are in the process of finalizing. So we believe that the momentum come from growth, that momentum come from our financial discipline and ability to deliver the savings we commit to. The momentum comes from the fact that we are actually increasing our commitment for 2013, and that we are confirming that thanks to SMI, a more long-term approach, we have visibility in the long term for the 15%. So we are a growth company, which is becoming a better growth company, and we are a company which is proving to be able to grow step-by-step the margin over the future year which is, in my opinion, the idea of sustainable, profitable improvement."

I mean at 77% plus gross margins, perhaps I'm too simplistic or even misguided, but 77% gross margin, 4% operating margin this quarter, or even 12% operating margin, 12½% operating margin going forward, say, it doesn't seem that there's much more bang for the bank on G&A, on more overhead, on more ROI analyses in some of the spending and more sophistication than what you're describing, it was just spending more on big endeavors. And I wonder whether that's something you guys will focus on. And I guess I say that in the context of step-by-step, I think, for what it's worth, to get to this 15% or get to something more sustainable from a momentum perspective, continuous improvement in G&A may not be enough and may be something more like immediate improvement or something quicker.

In other words, that the combination on productivity roles and continuing managing our organization in an efficient way and accelerated sales, top line sales, will create year after year strong productivity improvements that will continue bring us in the right direction there. The second thing that you comment on is that some of the saving will be enabled by things that today we don't have yet. I keep saying that, but SMI is a very important enabler. It's very difficult to restructure distribution centers around the globe without the right systems and without the right processes. It's very difficult to get many of the savings that we're having the very complex international set of 45 affiliates without the right system and the right project to get there. So obviously, there is a next step of savings available when we have concluded that. But in order to access this next step, we will need to have the right system, the right processes, and this will take the next couple of years to be finalized. So while those couple of years will go, we are focusing on the savings that we communicated to you, and then we will continue focus on productivity and on the rest of the saving [indiscernible]. I think I'm pretty clear on what is the deal. This is also reflected in the fact that, let's not forget, we have dramatically improved our return on invested capital. I've been saying from the first day that I was bringing this measure into our way of operating, and we are making progress of return on invested capital.

But sales are now just about back to where they were before the recession really impacted your business. Theoretically, there was the belt-tightening, and I'd love to get an update on to what degree that spending has started to roll back into the P&L. But in aggregate, it certainly does feel like there is a significant increase in the amount of sort of planned and already going on incremental spending to drive growth.

We believe that we've been probably stable on total market in our assumptions, and that's exactly the point. I think you're right. I think that over the years, mass in some economies like the U.S. has been growing faster than Prestige. And I think that what we have learned this year, that when we use the new model that we have discussed, we can compete more effectively against this. First of all, not in every market of the world this is happening. There are many markets around the world where, as we speak, Prestige has been consistently growing faster than mass. There are other markets, mainly U.S., where in the last five, six years, this didn't happen. Now the good news is that with – so generally, we really tested our new way of operating, meaning these launches and these excellent initiatives like Clinique Even Better Clinical supported by advertising, print advertising, but honestly, also for the first time TV advertising and an enormous amount of digital activities. So the combination of new TV, print and digital, this is the first time that we have done, for sure the first time in the U.S., in combination with our renewed High-Touch services, meaning our better way to provide fit and services in-store to our consumer has generated impressive growth, also faster than mass. I mean in the January-June period, the first time in many years in the U.S. where the Skincare category in Prestige in department stores and specialty store has been growing faster than in mass. And we believe this has been also because of the contribution that our special initiative has given to our department store and specialty store to attract back users that may have chosen to shop also in mass skincare in the past. So this is just the beginning of a journey that I believe we can compete more effectively with mass as well. Again, consumers in the U.S. have 12 products on average at home between Makeup and Skincare, and these 12 products for the large majority of consumer comes from any channel. So the real competition is competing for market share of the consumer bag or whatever the consumer have in their bathroom, that's the real market share we need to win. And the model that we are learning to use, I think will be capable also be more efficient on that front on top, obviously, of continuing building aggressive market share within Prestige."

So this is the aspect. And in order to finance these aggressive initiative, management and spending, we have capped other activities, namely promotions. We have been capping promotions, we have been cutting things we purchase, for example, in many brands around the globe in order to finance more equity building and share leadership building activities.

Thank you for joining our fiscal 2010 year end conference call. My remarks this morning, I will discuss the company achievements during the past year and how we intend to continue our momentum in fiscal 2011. My first year as Chief Executive",2855,"Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2010 year end conference call. My remarks this morning, I will discuss the company achievements during the past year and how we intend to continue our momentum in fiscal 2011. My first year as Chief Executive Officer, I’m extremely gratified that our company performance was outstanding in so many respects.
Last year, we laid out our plans and you will see that we have delivered and in most instances exceeded our goals. Our first major accomplishment was successfully launching our four-year strategy and we made excellent progress. We accounted our strategy is sound and sustainable. Our senior management team and entire organization are aligned behind it and our initial results show we are winning.
In addition, our performance was strong. Many financial measurements hit all-time highs. This is even more extraordinary considering that our results were achieved during one of the most difficult economic times.
We also made great strides evolving our organization and strengthening our capabilities to build our brands, fully leverage our innovation and improve profitability. But it is important to note that even as the company reorganized and changed its processes we held on to our core family values and historical strengths, creativity and interpretation speeded are ingrained in our heritage and culture.
Now, let me highlight some specific financial results. These numbers are before charges for restructuring and the retirement of some debt. We announced this morning that full year sales were $7.81 billion, up 7% from the year before. Earnings per share were the highest ever at $2.75, nearly double last year results.
Many other financial metrics also set records, including net sales in global skin care, the Asia region and our travel retail businesses. Cost of sales at a low of 23.3%. Operating margin increases of $420 basis points returning of $552 million. Cash flow from operation of $957 million and inventory of solid improvement.
The backbone of our strategy is to be more competitive against share by growing sales at least 1% ahead of global prestige beauty every year. By increasing our share in many of our largest countries in channels, including US prestige department stores, travel retail, the U.K., China, it’s clear, we have achieved that goal.
In U.S. department and specialty stores tracked by MPD, our shares standard (inaudible), excluding a prescriptive brands. The gain was led by Clinique, the biggest U.S. beauty brand, which has increased share the last two years. Being able to grow such a big brand is a major achievement. M A C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Origins also gained share.
In other objective we increased profits in a sustainable way. In this first year we reached an operating margin of 11.2%, a big jump from 7% in fiscal 2009. All of our costs declined as a percentage of sales, except advertising.
To further diversify we set out to generate more than 60% of our sales outside of the United States and this year we achieved already the goal, hitting 62% of total sales. Our brand has strong organic growth, expanded into more countries and opened overseas doors. Also, our travel retail business far exceeded our expectation, driven by successful conversion of travelers into buyers.
We also established broader objectives U.S. to better complete -- compete globally. In terms of product catalysts, our focus is more on skin care, particularly in Asia, again, we had a great success. In local currency our skin care sales grew 9% globally and 11% in Asia, where skin care counts for approximately 60% of our sales.
As a result of this focus, skin care is now our largest category in both sales and profits. The skin care gains were led by two high profile launches. Estée Lauder reformulated Advanced Night Repair was biggest launch in the company history and had tremendous acceptance, particularly in Asia, China and other retail. The brand recently introduced a complimentary product, Advanced Night Repair for eyes. And the two are being marketed together to continue the franchise momentum.
Thanks to an effective new formula supported by an integrated marketing campaign, encompassing TV, digital and print. Clinique new Even Better Clinical also became a hit in the U.S., U.K. and Europe. As an example, after its launch, it quickly became the best selling prestige skin care product in the highly competitive French market. It’s doing so well because it is the first beauty product whose results rival a prescription strength product for treating uneven skin tone, a universal concern that wasn’t being adequately addressed by existing products.
Our innovation also extended to our in-store services. We evolved our high-touch model at Bloomingdales where Clinique offers service as you like it including a fresh replenishment and do it yourself computer skin analysis. This concept is so successful that the brand expect to expand it to 60 more doors this year worldwide.
In terms of our regions, sales in Asia climbed 10% and five markets posted solid double-digit growth. We are also thrilled that Estée Lauder became the best selling prestige brand in each distribution in the region. We plan to accelerate our business in Asia where most economies are strong, consumer spending is growing and we have opportunities to expand distribution.
The company also set out to improve our underperforming brands in an effort to boost overall profitability. We took many steps to address different issues and as a group, this turnaround brands improved sharply.
As you are likely aware we closed Prescriptives wholesales business and did so at less cost than anticipated. We’re also leveraging some of its best assets in other brands. Based on strong consumer demand we continue to offer Prescriptives up-selling products online for now.
Our Aramis and designer fragrances division showed great improvement, a significant turnaround was driven by fewer more impactful product launches supporting its classics, improving its mix of business and distribution, tightening inventory and numerous savings in cost of goods. In up coming Tommy Hilfiger fragrance called [Loud] is expected to be a major addition to its portfolio.
In fiscal 2010, we saved $364 million from various cost saving initiatives, far greater than our original estimate of $175 to $200 million. At the same time, we continue to invest in our business and increase our advertising, merchandising and sampling costs by approximately 7%. Also, we believe we increased return on this investment by focusing on our biggest initiatives and improved media efficiencies.
We also improved our strategic modernization initiative forward by successfully implementing it across all of our North American manufacturing facilities. SMI will enable many of our future cost savings. Greg will go into more details about cost saving in SMI in few minutes.
So as you have heard, we made fantastic progress in the first year of our full year strategic journey, which is providing a solid foundation as we continue toward our goals. Our early success reinforces our vision and gives us confidence in our ability to execute our strategy with excellence.
Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned. Global prestige beauty is predicted to return to mid single-digit growth over the long-term. Research shows that women income is expanding around the world and beauty is the category they are most likely to spend money on after food and clothing.
In fiscal 2011, we estimate global prestige beauty will rise 2% to 3% at retail and we intend to exceed that pace, again, picking up share. For us, the stronger growth is expected to come from Asia, skin care, hair care and online, through both higher same-store sales and new distribution, as we continue rolling out our brands globally to meet increasing demand.
M A C for instance planned to open about 140 doors this year across a variety of retail formats, including department stores, its own freestanding stores, private retail locations and perfumers. The vast majority will be in international markets.
We have gained share against prestige competitors in every region for the last two years. However, in some markets and categories, mass brands have grown faster than prestige behind heavy advertising, broad distribution and lower prices. We consider all brands both mass and prestige to be our competitors, as many consumers buy beauty product across various channels.
We feel confident that [holding] and communicating our unique strengths, including a long history of aspirational brand equities and innovationing products, packaging, any store services will make us an even stronger competitor across the entire beauty landscape. This characteristic will allow us to attract consumer to prestige distribution channels around the globe where women are looking for aspirational brands and the latest innovation, combined with our high-touch services. We can perfectly fulfill their cosmetic needs and provide them with the shopping experience they deserve in the time they choose to dedicate to themselves.
We are deepening our consumer insights, ramping up our creative energies to be even more locally relevant and furthering our new strategy for launching fewer bigger products. We learned last year that effective advertising on aspirational brands focused on fewer winning product, build strong awareness and is more effective drawing traffic into our distribution.
Once consumer come out to our doors or websites, our high-touch services create a personal connection and in still brand loyalty, which we leverage to sell even more product. For example, Clinique unprecedented national print, TV and digital campaign for Even Better Clinical brought thousands of new consumers to U.S. department stores and specialty stores, who purchased skin care products there for the first time.
Our product introductions will be supported up to their full potential with our new launch and leverage approach. We will introduce fewer products, support them with aggressive advertising and use them to accelerate sales by leveraging the power of our high-touch service.
We have identified several new initiatives that will be launched in this way. Our plans call for us to expand our advertising budget this year and we expect to continue investing significantly in print, TV and digital to support innovation.
We also are tailoring our in-store high-touch service to different kinds of channels. Our retail brands experts at more than 5 million face-to-face interaction with consumers everyday worldwide and provide personalized information and education. This is a powerful asset that isn’t generally available in mass channels and we plan to build further on this point of differentiation.
Let me give you a few examples on how we are adapting, how that service beyond the traditional department store count to other channels as well. M A C new Time Square flagship, already its largest freestanding store, is staffed with 60 multicultural makeup artists who together speaks nine languages. It also features touch screen computers and video for the latest makeup looks.
In European pharmacies, where we do not usually have brand specific advisors, we have put in testers and consumer information on shelves for Darphin skin line, improved merchandising in senior explains how to use the product, which ones are new and which ones are best sellers.
In travel retail we created a private prestige space within airport stores to present Estée Lauder to new client and started with a specially trained ambassador for expert consultation. And we are launching Spanish language e-commerce sites in the U.S. for Clinique, M A C, Estée Lauder and Bobbi Brown in building on our mobile e-commerce initiatives in the U.S. and Japan. About half of our online visits and sales in Japan came from mobile phones and devices.
North America department stores remain our largest and most critical channel. Thanks to our new North America affiliate, we have a stronger internal structure and are building builder consumer plans with our important retail partners. So together, we can attract new shoppers and grow beauty sales in this channel.
Our efforts are working. In the last several months, prestige beauty sales in North America department stores have made significant improvements as consumer spending has picked up. Some of our best initiatives like Clinique, Even Better Clinical have attracted users of mass brands to department and specialty stores. Encouragingly, sales of our luxury brands, including Bobbi Brown and La Mer accelerated as well in the second half of the year.
We are also strategically expanding our presence in faster growing alternative prestige channels. Bumble and bumble will initially open in 10 U.S. separate stores, with modern brand equity building high-touch elements, such as interactive touch screen and fashion week videos and it won’t be simply another retail location. Consumers also will be directed to Bumble’s network of salon and get a $20 gift card for salon services when they buy products.
We’re also planning to aggressively build our hair care brands’ presence in prestige salons, while staying highly selective and we’ll increase our penetration over the next few years. Since consumers spent an average of 45 minutes in a salon during each visit, this channel is well-positioned to deliver the next level of high-touch.
Our recent acquisition of the makeup brand Smashbox was also driven by its expertise in alternative channels including several all direct response television and online. We plan to use the brand’s talents and experience in these channels as we expand our presence in the fastest growing areas for beauty. We expect Smashbox will be a wonderful addition to our portfolio.
Another important growth vehicle is emerging markets, particularly China. Our sales in China grew 29% in fiscal 2010, to maintain the momentum and gain share, we plan to open more than 90 doors in department stores and separate.
Also, Origins, our newest brand in China will continue to open more doors. M A C will launch an e-commerce site in January and we will continue using TV to advertise in major skin care products. China is growing so fast that it’s planned to be our second biggest Asia market this year overtaking Korea. We are also looking to capture sales from ever Chinese beauty users outside their own market. Travel retail expect to capitalize on the growing number of Chinese citizens who are traveling and shopping, 50 million Chinese traveled abroad in 2009, a number that is expected to rise to 90 million by 2013.
We are also strengthening our capabilities. We established a new corporate marketing center of excellence to give our brands and regions greater consumer insights and improved access to best practices, which they can use to create more targeted products, services and stronger marketing plans.
In concert with this effort, we are completing the task of our staffing of our regional R&D centers in Europe and Asia, which we are expanding to get closer to our consumer local preferences. Regionally developed products with widespread appeal will eventually be sold in other geographies too.
With the digital universe growing in importance, we will continue strengthening our many capabilities in this area, ranging from e-commerce to mobile commerce and online advertising to social media engagement.
E-commerce sales are expected to climb strong double digits for the foreseeable future and part of that growth will come from new sites. This year we will launch e-commerce in Brazil, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway for the first time and add more brand sites to the nine countries we’re already in.
In closing, we are extremely proud and pleased with our major accomplishment during the first year of our long range plan. We stuck to our strategy, it paid off handsomely. Our efforts made us stronger, leaner and more profitable, enabling us to add several billion dollars in stakeholder value.
Our employees deserve a huge thanks for their tremendous efforts. We relied on their talents, deep knowledge, innovative thinking and dedication to the company to move forward and create new ways of working together. I know at times it wasn’t easy and we are extremely grateful for the hard work that was required.
I also want to acknowledge my appreciation to William Lauder and the entire Lauder family for their guidance and encouragement during my first year leading the company. With their support, we have been able to implement many worldwide changes while maintaining and leveraging the company’s strengths, historical values and long held principles. This has been unvaluable.
In order to reach our ultimate goals, much work still remains and some of it would be harder to achieve. However, our initial results make us confident we can attain our goals, so we are raising our 2013 operating margin target. We now expect to achieve a 12.5% to 13.5% operating margin by fiscal 2013. We will regularly review this target as our strategy evolves.
The global beauty industry is becoming more complex and competitive by the day, but it is also an exciting place to be and we are confident that anchored by our diverse brand portfolio, vast geographic region, passionate and creative workforce, we can come on the challenges and exploit the opportunities that will arise.
We are a creativity driven consumer-inspired company. This unique balance will help us deliver sustainable profitable growth and enable us to be the global leader in prestige beauty for years to come.
Now Greg will speak to you about our cost savings and strategic modernization initiatives. Greg?

For those of you who don’t know me, let me give you a little background. I joined the Estée Lauder company two years after having worked at several consumer product companies during my 30-year career. I",2037,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. For those of you who don’t know me, let me give you a little background. I joined the Estée Lauder company two years after having worked at several consumer product companies during my 30-year career. I held leadership positions in supply chain area, as well as brand and finance.
In my current role, I lead the company’s end-to-end global supply chain, which ranges from procurement, manufacturing and distribution to planning and quality assurance. I also oversee the strategic modernization initiative and Co-Chair the program management team with Rick.
I was attracted to Estée Lauder because of the passion, creativity and energy of its people, its fabulous portfolio of brands and the opportunity to help design and implement the new strategies, and the reality has been even better than I expected.
Joining Estée Lauder offered me the opportunity to use my skills and experience to help lead the supply chain and take it to the next level, while also being able to learn from my colleagues as we work together to improve integration and alignment. Improving integration and alignment from the very beginning of our creative and innovation approach, right through execution to the market really does had a value to our brands.
I’m pleased to say we’ve made tremendous progress in a short time and created a partnership between the brands, regions and functions, which has helped make the company more efficient and supported our growth. The high quality of our products continues, of course, to be paramount and our R&D packaging supply chain and innovation teams are all included early in the development process.
I’m equally excited by the opportunities for additional cost savings and other improvements in my head. By continuing to create more efficiencies and drive costs out of our supply chain, we’re able to channel it back into needed capabilities to grow the business and also increase returns to the stockholders.
As Fabrizio mentioned, thanks to the collective efforts of our employees across brands, regions and functions, the company saved $364 million in fiscal 2010 from our cost savings programs. These initiatives are being led by the program management team, an executive leadership group that is developing new processes, alignment and capabilities to enable sustained savings. The PMT also helps to determine the ideal pacing and sequencing of various projects to ensure the best use of our resources.
The major cost savings for fiscal 2010 occurred as follows. The largest piece, accounting for about half the savings came from cost of goods at $171 million, which is the area I’ll discuss in more detail in a minute.
Next was resizing and restructuring in a company-wide salary for each, which contributed approximately $145 million, and lastly, in indirect procurement and distribution, we saved about $33 million.
The company had its lowest cost of sales -- cost of goods as a percentage of sales since it went public in 1995 and this was achieved in several ways. About one-third came from mix, mix by category, region and brand.
Skin care is our category with the lowest cost of goods and by emphasizing this area across our relevant brands, we increased our skin care sales as a percentage of our overall business. We also sold more products in Asia and that region has the lowest cost of goods as a percentage of sales. Skin care comprises the largest percentage of sales in Asia. We also successfully sold more products from our high-end brands that have the lowest cost of goods.
The other two-thirds of savings came from cost efficiencies including material costs and productivity. We work together to make all of our brands more profitable. Much of these accomplishments were possible because of supply chain teams worked collaboratively with the cross functional brand teams, both before and after launches, to examine all the costs involved in a particular product.
Joining forces and prospective at the start of the innovation process creates a capability to bring more products to market in a more efficient manner. Although, this is a cultural change, I believe the integration and interaction has been valuable to the supply chain as we get a better understanding about our brands. We’ve been able to launch more products with higher margins right from the start, which obviously frees up resources to invest in marketing and building brand equity.
Let me give you an example. When we were developing the pure DKNY fragrance, a cross-functional team which included members of the supply chain was integrated into the innovation process early on. The entire package and other elements of the mix were created with our consumer in mind, offering outstanding quality and sustainable environmentally friendly platform but also included the expertise of suppliers, manufacturing and distribution, who were all at the table.
The result is a great product with high consumer satisfaction at a cost that’s 22% less than planned. Also contributing to the improved cost of goods was a lower cost of material, which we accomplished in part by being more collaborative with suppliers.
Again, as an example in the case of fragrances, we created a new business model that he assures a select group of suppliers’ greater engagement in developing our product, a new way of helping to drive more efficiency in the end-to-end development process and a longer view of our brand and innovation plans.
Obviously, this helped to create a more efficient way of working for us and our suppliers, which will not only help improve margins but add even more fuel to our innovation capabilities. We plan to broaden this concept across our supply base and in other product categories as we work to improve the total systems cost and streamline our supply chain.
However, as we improve the way we work with our suppliers, we also need to continue to enhance our internal processes and capabilities. We’ve also begun to drive improvements in logistics which contributed to our overall savings effort. We’re working to create an upgraded and consolidated global distribution network.
In Europe and Asia, we’ve already closed or moved several distribution centers and have started the work required to implement SMI. We’ve seen savings in the distribution center network and transportation and continue to analyze this area for further efficiencies in the coming years.
For the second year in a row, we made considerable progress on another important front. Reducing the number of stock keeping units, which we shrunk 10% in fiscal 2010 after an even bigger drop in 2009.
We have eliminated less profitable SKUs and creating fewer less productive ones which obviously contributes to a more efficient portfolio. Fewer SKUs also improves our productivity in buying and manufacturing and greatly contributed to improving our obsolescence.
Thanks in part to trimming the number of SKUs and by working closely together in a more formal sales, inventory and operating plan process, we’ve lowered our obsolescence expense by about $35 million this year which includes taking back large returns of stock from Europe that provide a better assortment in the perfumery channel.
In fiscal 2011, we expected to reduce these costs even further. We’re also refining our manufacturing strategy to produce our products closer to our consumers where economically logical. This reduces transportation and distribution costs and lead times.
We’ll continue to study our network to find greater efficiencies and enhance productivity. All these savings -- cost savings and improvements are great successes, but one of the changes I’m most proud of is that we’ve made great progress toward building an inter-dependent organization where people realize their actions, have a ripple effect and impact more than just their piece of the business.
We’re working collaboratively and making decisions for the good of the company as a whole, not just for a particular brand or a region and using leverage across brands and geographies to improve our results. We’re still relatively early in this journey but from my experience the amount of progress we’ve made in creating this interdependent organization could only be accomplished because of the quality of the people in our brands, regions and function.
Their commitment to this company is amazing. Despite the changes required to be more integrated organization, we’ve managed to maintain the high quality, uniqueness and equity of each of our brands.
We’ve learned we can drive innovation and creativity while still finding and leveraging synergies. This new approach and way of thinking is evident in the company’s stellar results this year.
In fiscal 2011, we expect our PNT-led programs to save between $130 million and $140 million, about half of that sum again is expected to come from cost of goods. Now, let me turn to SMI, our strategic modernization initiative which is one of the company’s biggest undertakings ever.
At its most basic level, SMI is about creating common and more efficient processes where logical and as appropriate, supporting them with technology. SMI is key to enabling the implementation of various parts of our company strategy and helps to ensure that we can sustain the progress.
This year we’ve succeeded in implementing SMI and the technical solution of SAP in nine manufacturing facilities and did so without any major issues or disruptions to our business. This again is a real credit to our global and regional SMI teams, the support of our partner IBM and the focus of the leadership on this initiative.
More than 80% of our in-house production is now using SAP software. Previously, we launched SMI at our Aveda operation in Minnesota and our U.K. manufacturing facility and in North America, we implemented the financial backbone and demand-planning functions.
Launching SMI throughout our North American manufacturing was a major milestone and it went just about as well as we could have expected. We continue to gain important knowledge and expertise and we will leverage that knowledge in the next wave, which rolls out for multiple affiliates and regions in the second half of fiscal 2011.
At that time, we expect to implement SMI in the U.K., Germany, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. We are now carefully planning and testing the technical implementation, working on the change leadership and organizational design and sharing the lessons learned from our previous experience in advance of going live.
Christopher Wood who was named Senior Vice President of Global SMI several months ago brings strong international affiliate and brand expertise, which will be critical as we further integrate SMI into the commercial side of our business. He has hands-on knowledge of what it takes to provide high-touch service to our local markets, while ensuring that through SMI we are taking full advantage of the common processes and technology for speed, efficiency and the transparency of information.
We expect to have the majority of our operations on the SMI program by the end of fiscal 2012. We’ve seen some early benefits from the implementation of SMI but the major and sustainable efficiencies will come after a bit more real-life use in the manufacturing network and after the majority of the companies using the same system supporting our objectives through fiscal 2013 and beyond.
The SAP technology will reduce the number of applications, we have from approximately 700 down to 100 when finished and dramatically, simplify the number of (inaudible) systems interfaces from about 3800 to 300. For the first time, we’ll have a single source of data across the world which will enable globally consistent and reliable information.
SMI will continue to enable improved supply chain leverage, back office and indirect procurement savings, speed to market and ultimately our bottom line. SMI is a key enabler to help us unleash and importantly sustain a significant piece of the savings we expect to reap now and for many years to come.
In closing, we’re working hard on many fronts to improve our cost structure, assure the superior quality of our product, streamline our entire supply chain from customers through suppliers and to modernize our systems. All of these efforts should greatly contribute to the Estée Lauder company’s sustained profitability this year and long into the future and will continue to liberate resources to invest in our growth. Thank you.
Now, we will turn the call over to Rick.

This morning, I will briefly cover our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year and then focus my discussion on fiscal 2011. My commentary will reflect our results before restructuring and special charges which",2582,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will briefly cover our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year and then focus my discussion on fiscal 2011. My commentary will reflect our results before restructuring and special charges which I will cover separately.
The fourth quarter capped off a terrific year. Sales in the quarter grew 9% as reported, 8% excluding currency. Strong new product launches backed by more significant growth in advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses fueled the increase and attracted more consumers to both our brands and our distribution. These investments should help us continue our sales momentum into the first half of fiscal 2011.
All regions grew in the quarter led by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, with nearly 14% organic growth. Asia Pacific rose 8% in local currency and the Americas region grew 3%.
In the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, operating results declined as we spent heavily to support major launches. In line with our strategic priorities, skin care again led category growth followed closely by makeup.
For the quarter, there was 11% and 9% respectively and grew in each region. Gross margin improved 240 basis points, which includes about $46 million in PMT savings. Operating expenses increased 290 basis points for the quarter.
PMT savings of approximately $54 million and lower impairment charges of $46 million helped the expense margin. However, we strategically increased advertising merchandising and sampling by over 35%, leading to an operating margin decline of 50 basis points to 3.7% for the quarter.
Our fourth quarter tax provision included a $31 million credit resulting from a reduction in our reserves primarily related to favorable tax settlements. The fourth quarter performance was the culmination of a year that saw a modest recovery in the U.S., a sharp rebound in travel retail, and a continuation of growth in key marks around the world despite weak business in Japan and southern Europe.
The combination of faster than expected recovery, the rapid realization of our strategic priorities and the fact that significant risks didn’t materialize allowed us to increase our guidance twice during the year.
For fiscal 2010 full year, sales rose 5% versus last year in local currency at the top end of our most recent guidance range. Favorable currency movement added nearly two percentage points of growth resulting in a reported sales gain of 7% to $7.81 billion. Net earnings for the year were $551.7 million compared with $280.1 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.75, almost double the $1.42 reported last year.
As Fabrizio noted, we achieved all-time highs in a number of key measures including operating income, EPS and cash flow. Our sales growth was broad-based with every region and nearly every product category contributing. Asia Pacific once again led growth with net sales rising 10% in local currencies. Every country in the region except Japan grew and many markets saw double-digit gains.
China led the region with growth of 29% on increased consumption and distribution. Hong Kong rose 23% on tourism. Korea, Taiwan, and Malaysia grew double digits on stronger consumer demand. Japan continued to suffer with a local currency sales decline in the mid single digits for the year.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, local currency sales gained 8%. Our travel retail business recovered quickly in fiscal 2010 rising 27% as international airline passenger traffic improved, retailers restocked and we implemented programs to increase conversion and improve the in-store experience.
Sales in the U.K. remained a bright spot, rising 7%. The growth was due to robust London tourism, high demand for makeup and strong double-digit growth in our online business. Among developing markets, Russia and Turkey grew over 20% in fiscal 2010. The Middle East grew 7% and India jumped over 40% off a very small base.
Southern Europe remains weak and Greece declined sharply as consumer demand dropped in the wake up of steady measures. Trade de-stocking continued this year primarily in areas hard hit by recession.
We estimate that de-stocking reduced regional sales by approximately 2% equal to about two weeks of retail inventory. The Americas turned the corner in fiscal 2010. According to NPD, excluding prospectives, beauty sales and department stores and support declined less than 2%.
Our retail stores on the same basis declined less than 1 -- our retail sales rather on the same basis declined less than 1%. And our share rose 50 basis points for the year. Beauty sales growth in department stores are primary channel of distribution began to outpace beauty sales growth in mass channels during the second half of our fiscal year.
For us, the regions also saw a nice recovery during the second half of the fiscal year, ending with full-year net sales slighting better than last year. Sales in alternative channels were mixed. Salons and company-owned retail sales were flat and online sales grew 15%. Sales in Latin America rose more than 15% and Canada grew modestly.
By category, skin care sales rose 9% this year excluding currency leading growth in all regions. Estée Lauder’s Advanced Night Repair and other key products were the biggest contributors, especially in Asia. Clinique product also resonated particularly in the U.S. and Europe, Even Better Clinical and Youth Surge Night led sales with new products while the core three-step franchise continued to grow.
Makeup grew 4% in custom dollars led by M.A.C. The brand added about 100 new doors reflecting the strategy for international expansion. Additionally, this year’s Viva Glam campaign with Lady Gaga and Cyndi Lauper was the most successful ever. Bobbi Brown also contributed to growth on the success of its pretty powerful campaign and strong basic business.
In fragrance, our goal was to improve the business model before focusing on top-line growth. That said, sales in the category declined only 2% while profits swung dramatically from a loss last year to a profit this year, thanks to the hard work of our fragrance task force.
Our newest scent, pure DKNY, was well received in Europe, and we just launched it in the U.S. Sales of hair care product rose 2% primarily from Aveda. The brand benefited from salon expansion and new products.
Operating profit in this category was adversely impacted by impairment charges recorded in December for Ojon. However, Aveda and Bumble and bumble saw improved operating income. Gross margin expanded 220 basis point to a record 76.7%.
Favorable product mix added 70 basis points, lower obsolescence contributed 60 basis points, favorable manufacturing variances were 40 points and positive currency and lower promotions garnered 10 points each. For the year, our PMT initiatives improved cost of sales by $171 million.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales fell 200 basis points to 65.5%. We achieved $193 million in operating expense savings from our initiatives, which contributed about 250 basis points to the reduction. Higher impairment charges in the prior year resulted in an additional 20-basis-point decline and currency contributed 10 basis points.
These savings were partially offset by higher advertising, merchandising, and sampling investment of 20 basis points where we spent approximately $120 million more than fiscal 2009 and strategic investment spending of about 10 basis points. Operating income rose 71% to $874.6 million and operating margin rose 420 basis points to 11.2% compared to last year.
We are proud of this tremendous accomplishment and we believe it is sustainable. We expect to continue to improve our operating margin but not at the same rate. The savings going forward are expected to be more measured in their pace.
Net interest expense was slightly lower at $74.3 million compared with $75.7 million in fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate for the year was approximately 31%. The rate reflects a significant reduction, primarily attributable to favorable tax settlements.
During fiscal 2010, we reported $84.7 million in returns and restructuring charges. We have now recorded a total of $176 million of the $350 million to $450 million we originally expected to take through fiscal 2013. The charges primarily reflect employee-related costs, asset and inventory write-offs, contract terminations and other special charges. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $27.3 million related to the repurchase of debt. These costs were equal to $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.37 per share for the year.
Now, moving to operating cash flow, for the year ended June 30, 2010, operating cash flow increased to a record $957 million compared with $696 million the previous year. The increase primarily reflects the substantial improvement in earnings.
Day sales outstanding improved to 36 days compared with 45 days at this time last year. We benefited from tightened receivables in emerging measuring as well as the timing of sales in the fourth quarter. Some of this benefit is like toll reverse itself in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
Inventory days rose to 166 compared with 155 days last year. The increase reflects the planned inventory build ahead of the North American SAP implementation and the expectation of strong 2011 first quarter sales. We spent $271 million for capital expenditures this year reflecting continued investment behind SMI and information technology with some of our planned spending delayed into fiscal 2011.
During the year, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of our class A common stock. Through June, we repurchased 70 million shares and had 18 million shares remaining in our current authorization.
We ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. In fiscal 2010, we maintained our $0.55 per share dividend rate paying out $109 million. On January 1, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Smashbox which reduced our cash balance.
Additionally, we expect to continue to return cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and/or dividends. We are currently re-evaluating our uses of cash in light of our relatively low dividend payout ratio. Our board typically approves the annual dividend in November.
Now, I will discuss a few assumptions for the coming fiscal year. In fiscal 2011, we plan to build on the success of the solid foundation we have created for sustainable continuous progress towards our long-term goals. We expect global prestige beauty to expand by 2% to 3% at retail and we continue -- as we continue a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe.
Our own sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8% excluding currency but including about a percentage point of growth from the acquisition of Smashbox. Currency translation could decrease our reported sales growth by about two to three percentage points. Euro based countries represent about 12% of our total sales and our assumption for the euro is approximately $1.25.
U.K. is currently 8% of our sales and our estimate assumes about a $1.50 for the pound. Japan is now 4% of sales and we are using approximately 85 yen to the dollar. As you know, if the dollar strengthens or weakens against these major currencies, it will further impact our financial results.
We expect gross margin to improve by 50 to 70 basis points for the fiscal year driven by the cost of goods improvements Greg discussed earlier. Operating expenses should benefit from improved leverage of our savings initiatives mostly offset by a ramp-up in investment spending behind capabilities including digital, global R&D, SMI and consumer insights, targeted advertising spending and equity compensation costs related to the higher stock price.
Let me give you some details behind the incremental savings we are expecting this year. Organizational restructuring and resizing while nearly complete could add $15 million to 420 million in savings this year. As Greg mentioned, cost of goods activities primarily mix reduced inventory related costs and supplier consolidation are forecasted at around $70 million.
We expect to save an additional $45 million to $50 million in shared services and indirect procurement. We expect to achieve fiscal 2011 savings of between $130 million and $140 million with about $30 million to $35 million expected in the first quarter. The savings should be relatively evenly spread by quarter this year.
We are reinvesting some of that savings back into the most promising and most profitable areas of our business. We expect an approximate 50 to 90 basis point improvement in operating margin this year, which brings us closer to our long-range targets.
The improvement would also be about 30 to 40 basis points higher excluding Smashbox and the effect of currency rate movements. We have changed our processes to institutionalize continuous productivity improvements by limiting the growth of overhead in any given year to a percentage of sales growth.
This systemic approach should help us ensure not only sustainability but continuous improvements. Our savings initiatives are reflected in substantial projected growth of pretax earnings.
The natural tax rate based primarily on projected geographic earnings and statutory rates is expected to be between 32% and 34%. The rate may be influenced by changes in tax rates, mix of earnings and fluctuations in the amount of tax reserves and can vary by quarter.
Diluted EPS for the -- for fiscal 2011 is expected to be between $2.80 and $3.05. Included in this estimate are Smashbox integration costs, the impact of currency movements and the anticipated increase of the effective tax rate which combined reduced EPS by approximately $0.25.
We anticipate working down the inventory as we build for the SAP rollout and continue to pursue inventory improvements in other areas of the business. This should result in a 10% improvement in inventory days year-over-year.
With rising earnings and a solid improvement in inventory levels partially offset by the reversal of the timing of receivables, I just mentioned and about $50 million cash outlays related to restructuring, we expect to generate between $825 million and $875 million in cash flow from operations. We plan to use approximately $350 million of cash for capital projects including some spending carried over from fiscal 2010.
In fiscal 2011, we expect to take restructuring and other special charges of $45 to $55 million with about $13 million in the first quarter. We will update these estimates if necessary on future calls. Our first quarter will have a tough comparison to the prior year, when we more than tripled EPS and grew the operating margin by almost 10 percentage points. Nonetheless, we expect to reap the rewards of the fourth quarter marketing spend and new product launches to grow sales between 11% and 13% in local currency.
Adverse foreign exchange could impede growth by 2 to 3 percentage points. We expect gross margin to decline during the quarter and support spending should revert to more normal levels compared to the relatively light spend in the year-ago period. EPS for the three months is expected to come in between $0.67 and $0.80, reflecting a more normalized spending level.
Regarding restructuring plans, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013, we said we expected to report $350 to $450 million in restructuring and other special charges and derive $450 to $550 million in savings. At this time, we feel comfortable we can hit the higher end of the savings target while incurring the lower end of the charges. We continue to expect incremental savings in each year. I just want to remind you again that our guidance for fiscal 2011 for first quarter and the full year does not include restructuring and other special charges.
And that concludes my comment for today and we’d be happy to take your questions now. If you can queue up our question, it would be terrific.

Because, even though you made some progress for example in the Americas region for full year fiscal ‘10, that business is still so much less profitable than the international businesses. So what’s the outlook for that? And do you think you’d get back to a high single digit margin for the U.S. business. And then secondarily, did you set a new target now that you’re above your 60% for the international business? Do you have a new target for us for that? Thanks.

First of all, let me answer immediately the second question. Yeah, we believe we will continue to increase from 60 to very gradually overtime, but we hope to increase now at a slower pace because we believe we’ll go back to more different growth, also in our North American business. In fact, our estimate already for 2011 is to start growing again also in the U.S. So the pace of change between International and U.S. is supposed to change from now on, given this result.
The second, our margin long term will continue to grow in every region and we will continue to make improvements in North America region, but some of our International regions, namely Asia and some of our division, namely travel retail, will continue to be on very important, because they have margin accretive overall and will continue to be margin accretive for the long term.

As you know, we spent not a lot of -- we did increase advertising, in the first six months we increased advertising more aggressive in the second six months of this fiscal year. In the last quarter we increased advertising very strong 35% as we communicated this was due to a couple of things.
First of all, because we had some important initiatives concentrated in the period and second, because we were learning and testing some new way to advertise, the better way proven to be very effective. So for the total year, we grew advertising about 7% and we believe that in 2011 we continued in that direction. So we plan to continue increasing advertising on the high single digits. So this trend with advertising growing in line with sales was slightly ahead is probably the trend that we are going to see.
But obviously we are still in the middle of our learning process, so these numbers are subject to be adjusted and changed as we learn. The key learning here is that as I have explained, I think in my speech is that we have learned that having some high quality and high advertising and some great initiative is essential to attract new users to our distribution and to our concept. And there we are able, thanks to our high-touch service to sell more products and to create better loyalty to our brands and to retain those consumers.
So the combination of our business model is proving to be enhanced importantly from focused high quality advertising on key initiatives. And I think we will be more and more able to exploit this new learning in the future year, spending in advertising at a decent level.

But the key point is yeah, competition is also increasing advertising spending as the economy recovers and as consumers become more sensitive to spending again.
In terms of our growth in July, September, Smashbox will be accounting for one point out of 11, 13 points. The rest is really organic growth of our business and so our business really growing fast in this quarter. As we said, as a result of the fact that the key 35% increase in advertising in the last quarter this year was mainly focused on some key initiatives which are winning big and we’re mentioning in our note that the Clinique Even Better Clinical or Estée Lauder advanced night repair or DKNY pure, we had numbers of very successful initiatives driven by advertising and now are not finish to grow and not finish to bring new fresh volume and new consumers into our portfolio.

The change in advertising is only a specific learning that advertising focused on our best initiatives, is more rewarding for our business, because it’s able to attract consumers, thanks to this new very interesting innovation that we bring to a very high level of awareness in the key countries.
We attract new consumers to our counters and the fact that we are investing, improving our high touch services with all our retail partners, this combination is proving to be share and to be win where we exercise it. So what the real change of philosophy is that there will be fewer bigger initiatives supported by heavy advertising as an alternative to many small initiative each one of them supported by a little bit of advertising. That’s the real change in philosophy.
And the other change in philosophy that then we had identified in each one of our key brands, some very interesting new initiatives or re-launching of assisting with assets for the next three years, that we plan to support with this new model of advertising. And so we believe that we will continue to have for the next two, three years, similar success that we’re having today with advance Bill Lauder opening to make it even better, DKNY pure on every single brand of the company and on many new promising initiatives in the future few years.

We started seeing some recovery of the markets as of October and more importantly, particularly in the U.S. as of January. So it’s also true that in terms of market power, the base of July, September was an easier base, so the combination of strong initiatives and easier base is giving us a very strong quarter.
It’s in the about pipeline. In terms of stocks and stocks build up in the market what we see is that in North America and in Asia, the stock seems to be pretty stable we don’t see any more big stock -- neither for us, nor the market in general. While we continue to see actually some destocking in Europe and we start seeing other countries some restocking is in travel retail. Those are phenomenal that we are assuming in our numbers.

We can’t continue to take -- improve our operating margin 400 basis points a year.

Now, arguably some of that is already -- or still in the stock. On the flip side, you could also say that you are growing organic sales, sure, but it is decelerated on a stacked basis and your operating margin this quarter suggests that a lot of spend back for, again, deceleration and topline.
Next year doesn’t look like you’re growing praying margins that quickly. Aim just trying to get a sense of what you think the momentum is. Feels like you’re really slowing down here going forward. Just want to understand why that is, if just the cost savings were easily gotten up-front and it’s going to be harder going in the back end. When should we expect some stability in your growth again from an operating margin perspective? And I do after follow-up.

Then I said after",822,"Let me tell you where I believe the momentum is. First of all, I think we are delivering what we said. I said that we would have been growing 1% ahead of market in sales and reached by 2013, 12 to 13 margins and that was the first pace. Then I said after we would have clarified the plan how to reach a 15% margin, but this was premature for the time being.
Now, vis-à-vis these goals, the thing is our goals, we and the entire organization has been focused on. Vis-a-vis these goals, we are growing more aggressively than that. We are growing more than 1% ahead of market and particularly in 2011, our 6 to 8% growth is going to be well ahead of this in addition goal and well ahead of the average of the market.
So we are continue to be, but you are right, historically, we have been a good growth company and we are actually becoming an even better growth company, in my opinion, thanks to the new ability to use innovation and high touch in new ways and thanks to the important contribution of some new winning regions lake Asia or -- second, we have delivered our savings, proving to ourselves what will be a year -- a year ago was not so obvious that we can ex call it with excellence and proving to ourselves that we can deliver and over deliver our cost savings as we become focused on them.
And not only cost savings, but we have proven that we can also manage pretty aggressively over our cash elements that we have reduced inventories, amazing work on receivables, so I think that the financial and operation a.m. discipline that was discussing in the beginning of this journey seems to be really proven after the first year of going.
Then we also are saying that this initial identified cost savings are going to be delivered top range and we are saying that then we are creating a new element of sustainability like SMI that that will produce the next group of saving. we today don’t feel yet we can deploy and commit to because the work is not finished, but we are working on it. And finally, we are seeing that because of the first year, it’s only one year, by the way, the first good year of this journey, we are really in a position to commit on the high end of the cost savings and important to commit to as a point more, margin target for 2013.
And I know that this brings to us 13.5 and not to 15 as some of the market believes. But also I said that the $15 is something we believe one day we can reach, but today is a bit too early to create a new target before we have proven sustainability of the initial target now increased and before we had really demonstrated that we can also execute some of the other elements of the plans that we are in the process of analyzing.
So we believe that the momentum come from growth, the momentum come from our financial discipline, ability to deliver the savings we commit to, the momentum comes from the fact that we are actually increasing our commitment for 2013 and that we are confirming that thanks to SMI a more long-term approach we have visibility in the long-term for the 15%. So we are a growth company which is becoming a better growth company and we are a company which is proving to be able to grow step by step the margin over the few short years which is, in my opinion, the idea of sustainable profitable improvement.
So in terms of step by step, we spent a lot of time on this conference call, helpfully, I might add, on cogs and some cost savings to get gross margins up but don’t you think there’s a certain limit there? I mean at 7, 7% plus gross margin perhaps I’m too simplistic even misguided, but 77% gross margin, 4% operating margin this quarter or even 12% operating or 12.5% operating margin going forward. It doesn’t seem it is much more bang for the buck on G&A, on more overhead, on more ROI analysis in some of the spending is and more, maybe sophistication than what you’re describing, I was just spending more on big endeavors?
And I wonder whether that’s something you guys will focus on. I guess I say in that the context of step-by-step. I think for its worth to get to the 15 or get to something more sustainable from a momentum perspective, continuous improvement in G&A may not be enough. It may be something more like immediate improvement or something wicker. Aim just trying to get a sense of your philosophy on that aspect of the P&L which has barely been really touched, in my opinion.

My philosophy I think I explained, I said that I believe that after this first step, we he will continue to improve. That’s why I said step-step, with productivity. In other words, the combination on productivity rolls and continuing managing our organization in efficient ways and accelerated sales, topline sales, will create year-after-year strong productivity improvements that will continue bringing us in the right direction there.
The second thing that you comment on is that some of the savings will be enabled by things that today we don’t have yet. I keep saying that, but SMI is a very important enabler, is very difficult to restructure distribution centers around the globe without the right systems and without the right processes. It’s very difficult to get many of the savings that we had in the very accomplished international set of 45 without the right system and the right project to get there.
So obviously there is a next step of savings available when we have concluded that, but in order to access the next step, we will need to add the right system, the right processes and this will take the next couple of years to be finalized. So while those couple of years will go, we will be focusing on the save that is we communicated to you and then we will he continue focus on productivity and on the rest of the savings. Thanks for the SMIzing.
The investment, I think I’m pretty clear on what is the deal and this is also reflected in the fact that let’s not forget we have dramatically improved our return on invested capital. I’ve been saying from the first day that I was bringing in this measure into our way of operating and we are making progress on returning invested capital. This should also reassure that you step by step we are getting the right direction.

There was 300 basis points of lost profitability during the recession, obviously very understandably as sales fell off, but sales are now just about back to where they were before the recession really impacted your business.
Theoretically, there was the bent tightening and I’d love to get an update on to what degree that spending has started to roll back into the P&L, but in aggregate it certainly does feel like there’s a significant increase in the amount of sort of planned and already going on incremental spending to drive growth. Maybe that’s not a bad thing, but it does feel like something has sort of changed in your view of the support needed to drive well above market growth over the long-term. So maybe you can help me sort that out a little bit.

We know that we don’t have the doctor and the number to make it an official claim on total market. We believe that we have been probably stable on total market in our assumptions and that’s exactly the point. You are right. I think that over the years, mass in some economies like the U.S. has been growing faster than prestige. And I think that what we have learned is that when we use the new model that we can compete more effectively against.
First of all, not in every market of the world this is happening. There are many markets around the world where, as we speak, prestige is being consistently growing faster than mass. There are other markets, namely US, when the last five, six years this isn’t happening. Now, the good news is that as of January, we really tested our new way operating meaning, this launches and this excellent initiative, like Even Better Clinical, supported advertising, print advertising, but honestly also for the first time TV advertising, print advertising and an a normal amount of digital activities.
So the combination of new TV, print and digital, this is the first time that we have done, for sure the first time in the US. As in combination with our renewed high-touch services, meaning our better way to provide seat and services in store to our consumer has generated impressive growth, also faster than mass. In the January-June period, the first time in many years in the U.S. where the skin care category in prestige in department store and specialty stores has been growing faster than in mass.
And we believe this has been also for -- because of the contribution that our special initiative has given to our department store and specialty store to attract back users that may have chosen to shop also in mass in the past. So this is just the beginning of a journey, but I believe we can compete more effectively with mass as well. Again, consumers in the U.S. have 12 products on average at home between makeup and skin occasions and these 12 products for the large majority of consumers comes from any channel.
So the real competition is competing for market share of the consumer bag or whatever the consumer had in their bathroom. That’s the real mark share that win-to-win and the model that we are learning to use I think will be capable also of beg more efficient on that front, on top obviously of continuing building aggressive market share within prestige.

We are a very different strategy depending by region and by brand. So I cannot make a generic statement. It is a fact that in Asia Pacific, particularly in markets like China, or in other marks like Russia, we have made the explicit decision to grow to market share leadership some of our key brands and in Asia, as I have said in my prepared remarks that Estée Lauder is now market leader in our distribution.
That’s a mega achievement. Having the market leader in the fast growing market of the world is an important achievement that is a very strong asset for our future. And so we have gone for it. We have gone for it, with the right approach meaning supporting the brand equity and the key initiatives, making them as local as possible in their execution, which goes to the other point I covered about local relevance, new R&D centers, Asia, et cetera, et cetera. So this is the aspect. 
And in order to finance these aggressive initiatives, management is spending, we have capped other activities, namely promotions. We have been capping promotions. We have been capping repurchase, for example, in many brands around the globe in order to finance more equity building and share leadership building activities. So I believe that this has happened in a pretty healthy way.

Today, I will discuss the quarter's highlights and progress we made against our strategy, and Rick will provide details of our financial performance. We announced this",1896,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Conference Call. Today, I will discuss the quarter's highlights and progress we made against our strategy, and Rick will provide details of our financial performance. We announced this morning that before restructuring charges, sales for the quarter grew 13% to $2.1 billion. This was a milestone since it's the first time we have exceeded the $2 billion in sales in our first quarter. Our strong performance was due to robust business around the world and was helped by the dollar, which was weaker than we had forecast. Diluted earnings per share were $0.97 on a non-GAAP basis, up 14% versus year ago. 
Our success was broad-based. Sales climbed by double digits in every region, including North America and in our three largest categories, driven by strong product launches and increased advertising spending in the previous quarter. In fact, our highest sales spanned the range of the portfolio, from our entry-level Prestige brands to high end luxury ones. Most significantly, our largest brands led the way, Estée Lauder, Clinique, M-A-C and Aramis designer fragrances had such great momentum that each rang up double-digit sales gains globally and delivered substantial improvement in North America. 
All in all, it was a terrific performance in many regards. Several of our financial measures broke records for the first quarter, including sales, operating margin, earnings and EPS. Our strategy is clearly working, and we are executing it well, which is reflected in these outstanding financial achievements. We've also made progress against many of our specific strategic goals. We again gained share in skin care and in important channels and countries, including U.S. Prestige department stores and our Prestige distribution in China. Also, our turnaround brands showed further improvement. Our creativity resulted in robust launches. We exceeded our cost-saving projection by about $50 million and we continued building our strategic capabilities. 
William Lauder and I are proud that our executive leadership team is directing our strategy so well around the world that the entire organization is executing it so successfully. This strong start is a fantastic way to launch a new fiscal year. Our positive performance this quarter give us greater confidence in the remainder of the year. So we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.10. 
Let me now provide you with some color behind the numbers. In recent quarters, the fastest growing areas have been Skin Care, China, Travel Retail and Online. While these businesses continue to record solid growth, we also saw a strong performance in U.S. department stores and fragrance, which had been declining. We attribute our success to external factors, including pent-up demand and stronger consumer spending, as well as internal achievements, creating exciting new products and unique High-Touch services that appeal to consumers over the world. Our more effective marketing, which includes compelling advertising has contributed to our success by making consumers more aware of our newest products and services. A key part of our strategy is focusing our talents and efforts on fewer but bigger product launches offsetting cutting-edge innovation. Recent introductions from our research and development teams have been outstanding, and the success of these products underline our superb sales growth. Our brands had a rich pipeline of truly novelty launches over the next several years that we believe will continue to set the pace and set us apart in the industry. Harvey can answer questions about our innovation strategy during the Q&A.
Our year old America affiliates have been working with department stores to make the beauty floor more exciting and the initiatives are paying off for us and the retailers. Our sales in North America department store grew double digits this quarter. Sales of Estee Lauder and M-A-C brands into China grew double digits and Clinique recorded solid gains. Some of our largest U.S. department stores customers, particularly Macy's and Nordstrom, posted solid sales gains for the recent three months and higher traffic contributed to our sales growth. We believe our more focused and frequent advertising, which entices consumers to buy our must-have products helped generate the higher traffic. And while we have made inroads against Prestige competitors, we have also gained against mass. The luxury consumer is shopping again, and we are seeing our strategy contribute toward the old Prestige beauty growing faster than mass in many parts of the world. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, total U.S. beauty sales in Prestige department stores and Sephora rose 4% according to NPD, while sales in mass channel grew 1%. The strength was even greater in skin care, where Prestige sales growth was five points higher than mass. Our sales in Europe rose sharply, helped by incremental orders from perfumes as part of the reassortment effort we began last March. Asia sales growth was a little softer this quarter, but still rose 10%. Skin Care in Asia is a main area of strategic focus, and now accounts for 61% of the region's total sales, up from 56% only a year ago. In the recent quarter, our Asian Skin Care sales rose 19%. Rick will talk more about the regions in a few minutes. A key strategic focus has been to advertise our newest and most popular products effectively to pull consumers into stores. We have put the most money behind Clinique Repairwear, Laser Focus and even better Clinique Estée Lauder franchise and the pure DKNY Fragrance. Once consumers come to our counters and websites, we leverage our High-Touch service to build a personal connection, foster brand loyalty and sell multiple products. Although we are investing more in advertising, our total advertising and promotional spending hasn't increased as a percentage of sales. Instead, we have reallocated our spending in the category. We are putting less into gifts and sampling and more into advertising, including TV, online and print to build greater awareness and demand for our brands globally. The company's focus on skin care is driving sales growth at many of our brands: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins and La Mer have substantial advances in their Skin Care business. Both Estée Lauder and Clinique's global skin care sales surged more than 19%, with gains in all regions. The Estée Lauder brand continues to make impressive gains in Asia/Pacific and Travel retail, fueled by the popularity of several recent product introductions. Currently, the flagship brand is updating Re-Nutriv Ultimate, its luxury line, which we believe will continue to propel its winning skin care story. 
Clinique's strategy to target skin care products for specific concern paid huge dividends. In addition, the brand's recent launch of Repairwear Laser Focus fueled solid growth in Asia and particularly, in China. Clinique is the largest beauty brand in the United States, yet it managed to expand its skin care share in Prestige department store by more than one point. Throughout the quarter, our brands continued tailoring their products and communications to different regions as they become more locally relevant. Aramis and Designer Fragrances successfully launched Coach Poppy and Pure DKNY in North America and Tommy Hilfiger Loud in the U.K. ADS [ph] sales climbed more than 25% and coupled with a lower cost of goods and cost-cutting initiatives, its operating profit improved sharply. 
Our fragrance category, led by ADS [ph] courageously changed strategy to first improve its bottom line before accelerating topline growth. That approach has paid off dramatically as higher sales, coupled with massive spending resulted in much improved profitability this quarter. Other brands in our portfolio that are turning around have also made substantial strides toward greater profitability, which has helped the company's overall performance. Two of our high-end Fragrance brands, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, generated healthy sales increases, particularly in Europe and in the Middle East because they created heavier, more intense scents that appeal to consumers in those markets. This quarter was the first that included our newest brand, Smashbox, and it's off to a good start. Smashbox is a strong brand in the United States, with a loyal consumer following. It helps strengthen our makeup category and our presence in alternative channels. We are working to integrate the brand organizationally and functionally. While our brands have been busy accelerating their individual strategies, on a corporate basis, we have taken steps to strengthen our capabilities, both regionally and globally. With the digital universe increasingly important in everything we do, are committed to building on our expertise and expanding our global presence online. We are constantly evolving our communications and use of social media online and searching for better ways to sell and promote our products. 
To that end, we feel that employees must be engaged and dedicated to these endeavors. To show our commitment, the company organized a digital media conference in New York in August for hundreds of our executives to immerse them in the fast-paced online world and provide them with a deeper understanding of the potential it holds. The event included speakers from Facebook, Google, Foursquare, as well as digital executives from other consumer companies at the forefront of social networking. The day was a tremendous learning experience and enforced to our management that this is an area that we believe holds amazing promise and potential.
Looking ahead, we are anticipating a solid holiday season. The U.S. department store business is healthier than last year and our brands have created a wide selection of products offering compelling value. We believe consumers will find our products and unique services to be attractive in this environment. As we continue on our path of achieving sustainable profitable growth, we will bring our brands to more people. For example, M-A-C plans to open about 50 doors in international markets in the second quarter and La Mer and Aramis and Designer Fragrances expect to launch e-commerce in Japan. We will open more than 90 locations in China this fiscal year for our nine brands there. 
As a dynamic enterprise, we must constantly look ahead to be in the forefront to stay on top of our game, so we are reinvesting some of our profits in our future and pursuing our most promising opportunities by brand, by market, in China, backed by an unwavering commitment to innovation and to talent. Our focus this year centers on five areas embedded in our corporate strategy: Strengthening our creativity and innovation, expanding our High-Touch services, deepening our local relevance and widening our lead in the digital arena. We'll continue to tighten our costs and run our business in a smarter, more efficient and integrated manner. 
I want to thank my leadership team and our worldwide employees for their hard work and continuous innovation. We couldn't have accomplished any of these without you. As we continue to pursue our goals, William Lauder and I are working to preserve the company's solid foundation, its culture and the integrity instilled by the Lauder family for more than 60 years. We are in the unique position to leverage and draw inspiration from our historic strengths as we move forward to make our strategy a reality. The Estée Lauder Companies will always pride itself on creative thinking and entrepreneurial spirit and the will to win. It's wonderful for the entire organization to be able to leverage the success of the past, while participating in and embracing the company's bright future.
Now, I will turn the call over to Rick."

In local curr",1366,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and special charges. As Fabrizio said, we had a terrific quarter, driven by better-than-anticipated sales. In local currency, sales rose 14%. Adverse currency translation was less than one percentage point, resulting in reported sales growth of 13% to $2.09 billion. Net earnings for the quarter rose 16% to $194.4 million compared with $168 million in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $0.97 compared to $0.85. Sales growth was about four points more than our guidance. About two points of the upside was due to a weaker U.S. dollar than we had forecasted and another two points from stronger overall business. We are very pleased to see the sales momentum increase during the quarter, including the effect of targeted advertising behind key products in Estée Lauder and Clinique. We saw this especially in our Americas and European regions. The quarter also benefited from the sell-in of faster moving SKUs as part of the reassortment program in European perfumeries, after having taken a charge for returns of slow-moving products in the fiscal 2010 March quarter. This program is now essentially complete, and we do not expect to see incremental sales at the same level for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Additionally, our cost of goods were lower than anticipated due in part to a shift of some GWP and SAP shipments to the second quarter and better-than-expected improvements in obsolescence. Importantly, operating expenses came in where we expected, reflecting a more normalized cadence to our marketing spending. Three of our major categories grew double digits. Compared to last year, we saw the fastest growth in the strategically important Skin Care category. Sales rose 18% in local currency aided by product launches. Skin care sales grew by double digits in every region. In Makeup, local currency sales rose 11%, driven by growth in our M-A-C, Bobbi Brown and Estée Lauder brands, as well as the addition of Smashbox. This was partially offset by the discontinuation of Prescriptives in department stores. The category grew double digits in the Americas and European regions. Our Fragrance business grew 17%, excluding currency. Fragrance launches in the U.S. and U.K. helped growth in the Americas and Europe. In Hair Care, sales declined 3%, primarily due to soft results at Ojon. We are reformulating Ojon products and plan to relaunch the brand with a new marketing campaign later this fiscal year. 
On a geographic basis, all regions grew double digits. We are pleased with a 12% growth in the Americas, our best performance in a number of years. The strongest contributions came from our largest brands, Estée Lauder, Clinique, M-A-C and the Aramis and Designer Fragrance group. Additionally, Latin America grew more than 25%. In Europe the Middle East and Africa, sales rose 18% in local currency. Travel Retail grew 24% as the channel continued to benefit from improved traffic, led by Asia and Latin America. Our U.K. sales rose 12%, driven by good retail traction across the brand portfolio and positive response to our television advertising. Emerging markets in the region were up strong double digits. All of the Western European countries grew, although, many benefited from the perfumery reassortment program. We believe our underlying retail growth in the major Western European markets is mid-single digits. 
We continue to see overall sales growth in the Asia/Pacific region, which had a 10% rise in local currency. China rose 32%, fueled by 16% like retail growth and expanded distribution. The appetite of Chinese consumers for our products is also driving strong, double-digit gains in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Korea grew 6% but Japan and Australia declined, reflecting their tough economic environments. Our gross margin improved by 40 basis points this quarter to 76.7%. Contributing to the increase were lower obsolescence charges of 30 basis points and positive currency of 20 basis points. These figures include the benefit of our cost savings initiatives of $21 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, rose 10 basis points to 62.2%. Factors affecting operating expenses as a percentage of sales include lower selling and shipping costs of 130 basis points, partially offset by higher advertising merchandising and sampling and general administrative costs of about 110 basis points. These figures reflect savings of $28 million from our cost-reduction programs. As a result, operating income rose 15% to $302.6 million and operating margin rose 30 basis points to 14.5% of sales. Our cost-savings initiatives are moving ahead well and we achieved total savings of $49 million in the quarter. We now expect to save between $135 million and $145 million for the full year. Regarding net interest expense, we reported $16.1 million this quarter versus $19.6 million in last year's first quarter. The decrease is due to lower debt levels. The effective tax rate was 32.7%, within our projected range. We recorded $4.6 million in restructuring and other special charges, equal to $0.02 per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect to record charges of between $60 million and $70 million. 
Our fiscal first quarter cash flow typically reflect seasonal working capital levels as we gear up for the holiday season. This quarter, net cash used for operating activities was $39 million compared to $3 million of cash generated last year. The biggest driver of the variance is the increase in accounts receivable. Our days sales outstanding were 50 days this quarter, three days lower than last year. Inventory days were 177 days compared with 170 days last year, reflecting the expected second quarter sales growth. At the end of September, our SKU count was down 7% from a year earlier. However, we have experienced service issues as some vendors are having difficulty meeting the increased industry-wide demand for ingredients and components. As we continue to improve our forecasting and react to the increase in demand, we may build some additional inventories to address these service issues. We spent $58 million for capital expenditures, which includes our company-wide systems initiative. We also used $258 million primarily for the purchase of Smashbox. For fiscal 2011, we expect to generate around $850 million to $900 million of cash flow from operations and use about $350 million for capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program.
Looking ahead, we are balancing the better-than-expected sales and earnings in the first quarter with the risk of a possible consumer downturn after the holidays, more aggressive competition and volatile currency markets. However, we remain confident in our business and believe it is reasonable to raise our expectations. For the year, we expect local currency sales growth of 7% to 9%. Our fiscal year guidance builds in assumptions of approximately $1.30 for the euro, 85 for the yen and $1.55 for the pound. This scenario would reduce reported sales growth by about one percentage point. We expect to continue investing behind our strategic priorities in the remainder of the fiscal year to drive growth and increase share. At the same time, we continue to pursue the cost savings we previously laid out. We expect a 50 to 90 basis point improvement in operating margin this year. At this time, we continue to estimate an effective tax rate of between 32% and 34%. We are raising our full year, non-GAAP EPS forecast to between $2.90 and $3.10. 
Our outlook for the holiday season reflects an improvement in consumer spending compared to last year. Our sales growth for the second quarter is forecast to come in between 8% and 10% in local currency. The negative impact of foreign exchange translation is expected to decrease sales growth by about three percentage points. We expect EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2010, to be between $1.32 and $1.45. We are encouraged by our results for the first quarter, and we are optimistic about the response to our innovation and unique service that sets us apart. Longer-term, we are working hard to make our four-year strategy a reality. That concludes my comments for today, and we'll be happy to take your questions now."

And we have also had some very interesting value activities for our consumer during the holiday season. But if you look to the first quarter, and if you look to the year as a total, you will definitely see a reduction of our gift and promotional activity in total and increase at the same time of advertising spend in print, magazines, in television and online advertising. The other important difference, these activities of extra advertising had been focused and concentrated on our most successful and biggest launches globally, which means there is another advantage versus the past model where the level of support that will most potentially win our activity having is dramatically increasing. And in fact, a lot of our accelerated growth came from the extraordinary success of some of our launches like Clinique Even Better Clinical or Lauder Advanced Night Repair or DKNY Pure, which is also the response to a concentrated effort of advertising on those initiatives. Obviously, the reduction of promotional activity and more push activity has influenced, meaning will reduce a little bit our volume.

First of all, we still have a good, valid pipeline of products, which have been previously approved and we are launching in this moment. So we do not have a problem in the very short term. Then in case this had to continue longer in the future year or more, then we have plans, obviously, to re-promote and relaunch some of our most important activities. You need to understand that in China, even our most successful products for the moment have trial levels, which have stayed well below level of 30% or 40%. So the fact that we may need to push those products more and continue to make more consumer awareness to try this product is not necessarily a bad idea. And anyway, we'll definitely continue to build our volume for a certain period of time.

First of all, we are very, very positive on our strategy, and we are getting every quarter more positive about our ability to execute in general.

First of all, we are very, very positive on our strategy, and we are getting every quarter more positive about our ability to execute in general. And also, we start seeing positive results in the important U.S. department store channel for us. So those are all positive and we are pretty bullish on those key aspects. However, we need to balance the results of this quarter with the expectation for the next say, quarter or within the fiscal year for the following reason. First of all, because also, in; fact for the supply chain which has been discussed, we have some of the gift with process promotions which are in holiday sales. Which originally had to be shipped in September, will be actually shipped in October. And this interestingly, is actually creating a better gross margin in the first quarter, and we create some worse gross margin in the second quarter. So this is an element of balancing that we are taking under account. The second important element is that the incremental orders that we got in Europe because of the reassortment program that have positively impacted our first quarter will not continue after early October. So we do not expect this positive trend to continue in the remaining part of the fiscal year. Next point is the low base. I mean, our first quarter last year was the worst in terms of growth. And so the comps are going to be much tougher for the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year. Importantly, then is currency. The currency rates has been more favorable than anticipated in this first quarter. We honestly, do not expect this trend to continue. As Rick has explained in the prepared remarks, we are assuming for the average of the remainder of the fiscal year, a euro at 41.30. And as you know, this has been pretty volatile and difficult to predict. And finally, but not less important, we are only one quarter into the year and we have some concerns for the external macro factors, specifically in the U.S., the expectation for the holiday season is pretty positive, but the January March or January June period is a big question mark. There are many factors that may generate a softening of the market after January, particularly, if the unemployment rate had remained at the current level. And then we continue to be pretty worried by the pocket of softness around the world, namely Japan and Australia, in Asia and Southern Europe in general, they remain very worried. To this worry, you can now use of the U.K. program. Now U.K. is our second biggest market. And so we are prudent on what will be the effect on consumption on the new measures in U.K. and the increase in January in the U.K. for the second six months of our fiscal year. So the combination of these factors is the reason why you see us taking the yearly guidance up, but not of the total amount that we've been doing better in the first quarter."

The result of this is that for a few years, every complete assortment is composed of high moving items, items that move very frequently in the course of the year and slow movers. After some time, the accumulation of too many slow movers in a relatively small door like European perfumeries creates the inability of those retailers then to buy in sufficient quantities than high movers. So we took the important strategic decision to help the retailers to eliminate the slow movers from their assortment so they could create space to get in the high movers. That's what reassortment is. This is having an amazing benefit because on one side, it's making our assortment better in each single perfumery. On the other side, it's giving to its single perfumery a competition of high mover, which makes their overall rotation increase and importantly, make better profit for the retailer and better profit for us. So it's been probably one of those investments that we could have done, now the key challenge in front of us is to maintain the assortment in those stores with a right balance between completeness of the assortment and focus on high mover SKUs, which is the plan."

That's the model that has the potential to have Prestige growing nicely for many years to come and maybe to be more competitive with the mass growth even when the markets will normalize.

And we have one more thing that we do, which is we create products closest to the most demanding consumer and make them global hits. So what we're doing is creating products that could action and collaboration between two more different region buy creating products that satisfy that consumer which is extremely demanding, one of which for example is Asia, and then taking that idea globally, so that we have a very big hit. If you do those things, back it up with strong advertising, I think we can delight the consumer with more and more products.

And we've always said our priorities for cash are investing in our business, make strategic acquisitions and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So I mentioned share repurchase. Dividends really is part of a capital allocation discussion that we have with the board of directors, and we do that rather frequently. But the declaration of dividends is in their hands quite honestly. We're lucky that we do have a strong balance sheet that gives us a great deal of flexibility. Regarding material costs, we have seen some pressure in material costs, and we've mentioned this on earlier calls, quite honestly, the value of the materials that we buy is not so much in the raw materials but in the creative process, if you will, the construction of what we buy. So the creation of the caps or bottles or boxes that are specific for us, that's really the cost to add component, if you will, of our cost of goods. So material costs make it more difficult for us to continue to improve our gross margin. But it is not quite as only risk for us as it is for some other companies.

Today, I will discuss the quarter's highlights and progress we made against our strategy, and Rick will provide details of our financial performance. We announced this",1896,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Conference Call. Today, I will discuss the quarter's highlights and progress we made against our strategy, and Rick will provide details of our financial performance. We announced this morning that before restructuring charges, sales for the quarter grew 13% to $2.1 billion. This was a milestone since it's the first time we have exceeded the $2 billion in sales in our first quarter. Our strong performance was due to robust business around the world and was helped by the dollar, which was weaker than we had forecast. Diluted earnings per share were $0.97 on a non-GAAP basis, up 14% versus year ago. 
Our success was broad-based. Sales climbed by double digits in every region, including North America and in our three largest categories, driven by strong product launches and increased advertising spending in the previous quarter. In fact, our highest sales spanned the range of the portfolio, from our entry-level Prestige brands to high end luxury ones. Most significantly, our largest brands led the way, Estée Lauder, Clinique, M-A-C and Aramis designer fragrances had such great momentum that each rang up double-digit sales gains globally and delivered substantial improvement in North America. 
All in all, it was a terrific performance in many regards. Several of our financial measures broke records for the first quarter, including sales, operating margin, earnings and EPS. Our strategy is clearly working, and we are executing it well, which is reflected in these outstanding financial achievements. We've also made progress against many of our specific strategic goals. We again gained share in skin care and in important channels and countries, including U.S. Prestige department stores and our Prestige distribution in China. Also, our turnaround brands showed further improvement. Our creativity resulted in robust launches. We exceeded our cost-saving projection by about $50 million and we continued building our strategic capabilities. 
William Lauder and I are proud that our executive leadership team is directing our strategy so well around the world that the entire organization is executing it so successfully. This strong start is a fantastic way to launch a new fiscal year. Our positive performance this quarter give us greater confidence in the remainder of the year. So we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.10. 
Let me now provide you with some color behind the numbers. In recent quarters, the fastest growing areas have been Skin Care, China, Travel Retail and Online. While these businesses continue to record solid growth, we also saw a strong performance in U.S. department stores and fragrance, which had been declining. We attribute our success to external factors, including pent-up demand and stronger consumer spending, as well as internal achievements, creating exciting new products and unique High-Touch services that appeal to consumers over the world. Our more effective marketing, which includes compelling advertising has contributed to our success by making consumers more aware of our newest products and services. A key part of our strategy is focusing our talents and efforts on fewer but bigger product launches offsetting cutting-edge innovation. Recent introductions from our research and development teams have been outstanding, and the success of these products underline our superb sales growth. Our brands had a rich pipeline of truly novelty launches over the next several years that we believe will continue to set the pace and set us apart in the industry. Harvey can answer questions about our innovation strategy during the Q&A.
Our year old America affiliates have been working with department stores to make the beauty floor more exciting and the initiatives are paying off for us and the retailers. Our sales in North America department store grew double digits this quarter. Sales of Estee Lauder and M-A-C brands into China grew double digits and Clinique recorded solid gains. Some of our largest U.S. department stores customers, particularly Macy's and Nordstrom, posted solid sales gains for the recent three months and higher traffic contributed to our sales growth. We believe our more focused and frequent advertising, which entices consumers to buy our must-have products helped generate the higher traffic. And while we have made inroads against Prestige competitors, we have also gained against mass. The luxury consumer is shopping again, and we are seeing our strategy contribute toward the old Prestige beauty growing faster than mass in many parts of the world. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, total U.S. beauty sales in Prestige department stores and Sephora rose 4% according to NPD, while sales in mass channel grew 1%. The strength was even greater in skin care, where Prestige sales growth was five points higher than mass. Our sales in Europe rose sharply, helped by incremental orders from perfumes as part of the reassortment effort we began last March. Asia sales growth was a little softer this quarter, but still rose 10%. Skin Care in Asia is a main area of strategic focus, and now accounts for 61% of the region's total sales, up from 56% only a year ago. In the recent quarter, our Asian Skin Care sales rose 19%. Rick will talk more about the regions in a few minutes. A key strategic focus has been to advertise our newest and most popular products effectively to pull consumers into stores. We have put the most money behind Clinique Repairwear, Laser Focus and even better Clinique Estée Lauder franchise and the pure DKNY Fragrance. Once consumers come to our counters and websites, we leverage our High-Touch service to build a personal connection, foster brand loyalty and sell multiple products. Although we are investing more in advertising, our total advertising and promotional spending hasn't increased as a percentage of sales. Instead, we have reallocated our spending in the category. We are putting less into gifts and sampling and more into advertising, including TV, online and print to build greater awareness and demand for our brands globally. The company's focus on skin care is driving sales growth at many of our brands: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins and La Mer have substantial advances in their Skin Care business. Both Estée Lauder and Clinique's global skin care sales surged more than 19%, with gains in all regions. The Estée Lauder brand continues to make impressive gains in Asia/Pacific and Travel retail, fueled by the popularity of several recent product introductions. Currently, the flagship brand is updating Re-Nutriv Ultimate, its luxury line, which we believe will continue to propel its winning skin care story. 
Clinique's strategy to target skin care products for specific concern paid huge dividends. In addition, the brand's recent launch of Repairwear Laser Focus fueled solid growth in Asia and particularly, in China. Clinique is the largest beauty brand in the United States, yet it managed to expand its skin care share in Prestige department store by more than one point. Throughout the quarter, our brands continued tailoring their products and communications to different regions as they become more locally relevant. Aramis and Designer Fragrances successfully launched Coach Poppy and Pure DKNY in North America and Tommy Hilfiger Loud in the U.K. ADS [ph] sales climbed more than 25% and coupled with a lower cost of goods and cost-cutting initiatives, its operating profit improved sharply. 
Our fragrance category, led by ADS [ph] courageously changed strategy to first improve its bottom line before accelerating topline growth. That approach has paid off dramatically as higher sales, coupled with massive spending resulted in much improved profitability this quarter. Other brands in our portfolio that are turning around have also made substantial strides toward greater profitability, which has helped the company's overall performance. Two of our high-end Fragrance brands, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, generated healthy sales increases, particularly in Europe and in the Middle East because they created heavier, more intense scents that appeal to consumers in those markets. This quarter was the first that included our newest brand, Smashbox, and it's off to a good start. Smashbox is a strong brand in the United States, with a loyal consumer following. It helps strengthen our makeup category and our presence in alternative channels. We are working to integrate the brand organizationally and functionally. While our brands have been busy accelerating their individual strategies, on a corporate basis, we have taken steps to strengthen our capabilities, both regionally and globally. With the digital universe increasingly important in everything we do, are committed to building on our expertise and expanding our global presence online. We are constantly evolving our communications and use of social media online and searching for better ways to sell and promote our products. 
To that end, we feel that employees must be engaged and dedicated to these endeavors. To show our commitment, the company organized a digital media conference in New York in August for hundreds of our executives to immerse them in the fast-paced online world and provide them with a deeper understanding of the potential it holds. The event included speakers from Facebook, Google, Foursquare, as well as digital executives from other consumer companies at the forefront of social networking. The day was a tremendous learning experience and enforced to our management that this is an area that we believe holds amazing promise and potential.
Looking ahead, we are anticipating a solid holiday season. The U.S. department store business is healthier than last year and our brands have created a wide selection of products offering compelling value. We believe consumers will find our products and unique services to be attractive in this environment. As we continue on our path of achieving sustainable profitable growth, we will bring our brands to more people. For example, M-A-C plans to open about 50 doors in international markets in the second quarter and La Mer and Aramis and Designer Fragrances expect to launch e-commerce in Japan. We will open more than 90 locations in China this fiscal year for our nine brands there. 
As a dynamic enterprise, we must constantly look ahead to be in the forefront to stay on top of our game, so we are reinvesting some of our profits in our future and pursuing our most promising opportunities by brand, by market, in China, backed by an unwavering commitment to innovation and to talent. Our focus this year centers on five areas embedded in our corporate strategy: Strengthening our creativity and innovation, expanding our High-Touch services, deepening our local relevance and widening our lead in the digital arena. We'll continue to tighten our costs and run our business in a smarter, more efficient and integrated manner. 
I want to thank my leadership team and our worldwide employees for their hard work and continuous innovation. We couldn't have accomplished any of these without you. As we continue to pursue our goals, William Lauder and I are working to preserve the company's solid foundation, its culture and the integrity instilled by the Lauder family for more than 60 years. We are in the unique position to leverage and draw inspiration from our historic strengths as we move forward to make our strategy a reality. The Estée Lauder Companies will always pride itself on creative thinking and entrepreneurial spirit and the will to win. It's wonderful for the entire organization to be able to leverage the success of the past, while participating in and embracing the company's bright future.
Now, I will turn the call over to Rick.

In local curr",1366,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and special charges. As Fabrizio said, we had a terrific quarter, driven by better-than-anticipated sales. In local currency, sales rose 14%. Adverse currency translation was less than one percentage point, resulting in reported sales growth of 13% to $2.09 billion. Net earnings for the quarter rose 16% to $194.4 million compared with $168 million in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $0.97 compared to $0.85. Sales growth was about four points more than our guidance. About two points of the upside was due to a weaker U.S. dollar than we had forecasted and another two points from stronger overall business. We are very pleased to see the sales momentum increase during the quarter, including the effect of targeted advertising behind key products in Estée Lauder and Clinique. We saw this especially in our Americas and European regions. The quarter also benefited from the sell-in of faster moving SKUs as part of the reassortment program in European perfumeries, after having taken a charge for returns of slow-moving products in the fiscal 2010 March quarter. This program is now essentially complete, and we do not expect to see incremental sales at the same level for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Additionally, our cost of goods were lower than anticipated due in part to a shift of some GWP and SAP shipments to the second quarter and better-than-expected improvements in obsolescence. Importantly, operating expenses came in where we expected, reflecting a more normalized cadence to our marketing spending. Three of our major categories grew double digits. Compared to last year, we saw the fastest growth in the strategically important Skin Care category. Sales rose 18% in local currency aided by product launches. Skin care sales grew by double digits in every region. In Makeup, local currency sales rose 11%, driven by growth in our M-A-C, Bobbi Brown and Estée Lauder brands, as well as the addition of Smashbox. This was partially offset by the discontinuation of Prescriptives in department stores. The category grew double digits in the Americas and European regions. Our Fragrance business grew 17%, excluding currency. Fragrance launches in the U.S. and U.K. helped growth in the Americas and Europe. In Hair Care, sales declined 3%, primarily due to soft results at Ojon. We are reformulating Ojon products and plan to relaunch the brand with a new marketing campaign later this fiscal year. 
On a geographic basis, all regions grew double digits. We are pleased with a 12% growth in the Americas, our best performance in a number of years. The strongest contributions came from our largest brands, Estée Lauder, Clinique, M-A-C and the Aramis and Designer Fragrance group. Additionally, Latin America grew more than 25%. In Europe the Middle East and Africa, sales rose 18% in local currency. Travel Retail grew 24% as the channel continued to benefit from improved traffic, led by Asia and Latin America. Our U.K. sales rose 12%, driven by good retail traction across the brand portfolio and positive response to our television advertising. Emerging markets in the region were up strong double digits. All of the Western European countries grew, although, many benefited from the perfumery reassortment program. We believe our underlying retail growth in the major Western European markets is mid-single digits. 
We continue to see overall sales growth in the Asia/Pacific region, which had a 10% rise in local currency. China rose 32%, fueled by 16% like retail growth and expanded distribution. The appetite of Chinese consumers for our products is also driving strong, double-digit gains in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Korea grew 6% but Japan and Australia declined, reflecting their tough economic environments. Our gross margin improved by 40 basis points this quarter to 76.7%. Contributing to the increase were lower obsolescence charges of 30 basis points and positive currency of 20 basis points. These figures include the benefit of our cost savings initiatives of $21 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, rose 10 basis points to 62.2%. Factors affecting operating expenses as a percentage of sales include lower selling and shipping costs of 130 basis points, partially offset by higher advertising merchandising and sampling and general administrative costs of about 110 basis points. These figures reflect savings of $28 million from our cost-reduction programs. As a result, operating income rose 15% to $302.6 million and operating margin rose 30 basis points to 14.5% of sales. Our cost-savings initiatives are moving ahead well and we achieved total savings of $49 million in the quarter. We now expect to save between $135 million and $145 million for the full year. Regarding net interest expense, we reported $16.1 million this quarter versus $19.6 million in last year's first quarter. The decrease is due to lower debt levels. The effective tax rate was 32.7%, within our projected range. We recorded $4.6 million in restructuring and other special charges, equal to $0.02 per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect to record charges of between $60 million and $70 million. 
Our fiscal first quarter cash flow typically reflect seasonal working capital levels as we gear up for the holiday season. This quarter, net cash used for operating activities was $39 million compared to $3 million of cash generated last year. The biggest driver of the variance is the increase in accounts receivable. Our days sales outstanding were 50 days this quarter, three days lower than last year. Inventory days were 177 days compared with 170 days last year, reflecting the expected second quarter sales growth. At the end of September, our SKU count was down 7% from a year earlier. However, we have experienced service issues as some vendors are having difficulty meeting the increased industry-wide demand for ingredients and components. As we continue to improve our forecasting and react to the increase in demand, we may build some additional inventories to address these service issues. We spent $58 million for capital expenditures, which includes our company-wide systems initiative. We also used $258 million primarily for the purchase of Smashbox. For fiscal 2011, we expect to generate around $850 million to $900 million of cash flow from operations and use about $350 million for capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program.
Looking ahead, we are balancing the better-than-expected sales and earnings in the first quarter with the risk of a possible consumer downturn after the holidays, more aggressive competition and volatile currency markets. However, we remain confident in our business and believe it is reasonable to raise our expectations. For the year, we expect local currency sales growth of 7% to 9%. Our fiscal year guidance builds in assumptions of approximately $1.30 for the euro, 85 for the yen and $1.55 for the pound. This scenario would reduce reported sales growth by about one percentage point. We expect to continue investing behind our strategic priorities in the remainder of the fiscal year to drive growth and increase share. At the same time, we continue to pursue the cost savings we previously laid out. We expect a 50 to 90 basis point improvement in operating margin this year. At this time, we continue to estimate an effective tax rate of between 32% and 34%. We are raising our full year, non-GAAP EPS forecast to between $2.90 and $3.10. 
Our outlook for the holiday season reflects an improvement in consumer spending compared to last year. Our sales growth for the second quarter is forecast to come in between 8% and 10% in local currency. The negative impact of foreign exchange translation is expected to decrease sales growth by about three percentage points. We expect EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2010, to be between $1.32 and $1.45. We are encouraged by our results for the first quarter, and we are optimistic about the response to our innovation and unique service that sets us apart. Longer-term, we are working hard to make our four-year strategy a reality. That concludes my comments for today, and we'll be happy to take your questions now.

And we have also had some very interesting value activities for our consumer during the holiday season. But if you look to the first quarter, and if you look to the year as a total, you will definitely see a reduction of our gift and promotional activity in total and increase at the same time of advertising spend in print, magazines, in television and online advertising. The other important difference, these activities of extra advertising had been focused and concentrated on our most successful and biggest launches globally, which means there is another advantage versus the past model where the level of support that will most potentially win our activity having is dramatically increasing. And in fact, a lot of our accelerated growth came from the extraordinary success of some of our launches like Clinique Even Better Clinical or Lauder Advanced Night Repair or DKNY Pure, which is also the response to a concentrated effort of advertising on those initiatives. Obviously, the reduction of promotional activity and more push activity has influenced, meaning will reduce a little bit our volume. But this is being more than offset by the benefit that we see in more focused and increased advertising [ph].

First of all, we are very, very positive on our strategy, and we are getting every quarter more positive about our ability to execute in general. And also, we start seeing positive results in the important U.S. department store channel for us. So those are all positive and we are pretty bullish on those key aspects. However, we need to balance the results of this quarter with the expectation for the next say, quarter or within the fiscal year for the following reason. First of all, because also, in; fact for the supply chain which has been discussed, we have some of the gift with process promotions which are in holiday sales. Which originally had to be shipped in September, will be actually shipped in October. And this interestingly, is actually creating a better gross margin in the first quarter, and we create some worse gross margin in the second quarter. So this is an element of balancing that we are taking under account. The second important element is that the incremental orders that we got in Europe because of the reassortment program that have positively impacted our first quarter will not continue after early October. So we do not expect this positive trend to continue in the remaining part of the fiscal year. Next point is the low base. I mean, our first quarter last year was the worst in terms of growth. And so the comps are going to be much tougher for the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year. Importantly, then is currency. The currency rates has been more favorable than anticipated in this first quarter. We honestly, do not expect this trend to continue. As Rick has explained in the prepared remarks, we are assuming for the average of the remainder of the fiscal year, a euro at 41.30. And as you know, this has been pretty volatile and difficult to predict. And finally, but not less important, we are only one quarter into the year and we have some concerns for the external macro factors, specifically in the U.S., the expectation for the holiday season is pretty positive, but the January March or January June period is a big question mark. There are many factors that may generate a softening of the market after January, particularly, if the unemployment rate had remained at the current level. And then we continue to be pretty worried by the pocket of softness around the world, namely Japan and Australia, in Asia and Southern Europe in general, they remain very worried. To this worry, you can now use of the U.K. program. Now U.K. is our second biggest market. And so we are prudent on what will be the effect on consumption on the new measures in U.K. and the increase in January in the U.K. for the second six months of our fiscal year. So the combination of these factors is the reason why you see us taking the yearly guidance up, but not of the total amount that we've been doing better in the first quarter.

We are transferring some of our U.S. learnings into our Japan program and working with retailers there to generate a high level of learning. And particularly, the level of learning in how to improve the High Touch, how to the differentiation versus the mass channel, how to improve the role of new initiative and make the launches to attract new consumers to the floor of beauty in big department stores. And finally, how to improve the cost structure to liberate the funds that needs to be invested in attracting new consumer and serving them with higher, higher quality. All elements that will definitely be used also in Japan to launch the second. However, the Japan economy is really under pressure. So this may take some time, because it requires some improvement of the business model. But at the same time, we'll require that the economy in Japan will be less stabilized or hopefully one day be turned around.

The result of this is that for a few years, every complete assortment is composed of high moving items, items that move very frequently in the course of the year and slow movers. After some time, the accumulation of too many slow movers in a relatively small door like European perfumeries creates the inability of those retailers then to buy in sufficient quantities than high movers. So we took the important strategic decision to help the retailers to eliminate the slow movers from their assortment so they could create space to get in the high movers. That's what reassortment is. This is having an amazing benefit because on one side, it's making our assortment better in each single perfumery. On the other side, it's giving to its single perfumery a competition of high mover, which makes their overall rotation increase and importantly, make better profit for the retailer and better profit for us. So it's been probably one of those investments that we could have done, now the key challenge in front of us is to maintain the assortment in those stores with a right balance between completeness of the assortment and focus on high mover SKUs, which is the plan.

This business has been decently profitable for some time and what we need to turn around is the top line and we need to accelerate the top line on this business. Now in fact, this is very much linked to the trends. The High-End Salon business in which we operate in North America particularly, is still relatively soft. The market is not recuperating fast, and we are suffering part of this softness. At the same time, we are making some important improvements to the plant of our High-End Salon business. We are improving our distribution in high end salons in North America. We are working on the continuous but gradual international expansions of our key brands, Aveda and Bumble and bumble. For example, we started the expansion of Bumble in the U.K. very recently. And we are working to link particularly on Bumble, the business also, with a retailing format that form a execution that could develop our retailing sales and at the same time help and support our salon network to further build that business. And on that front, we are running a very exciting test market with Sephora here in the U.S. that, if successful, can really transform the high-end hair care industry in my opinion in North America and possibly in the future, international.

We purchased Smashbox, as you know, for about $250 million and we also bought back about 2.4 million shares, so we are using some of that cash balance. And we've always said our priorities for cash are investing in our business, make strategic acquisitions and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So I mentioned share repurchase. Dividends really is part of a capital allocation discussion that we have with the board of directors, and we do that rather frequently. But the declaration of dividends is in their hands quite honestly. We're lucky that we do have a strong balance sheet that gives us a great deal of flexibility. Regarding material costs, we have seen some pressure in material costs, and we've mentioned this on earlier calls, quite honestly, the value of the materials that we buy is not so much in the raw materials but in the creative process, if you will, the construction of what we buy. So the creation of the caps or bottles or boxes that are specific for us, that's really the cost to add component, if you will, of our cost of goods. So material costs make it more difficult for us to continue to improve our gross margin. But it is not quite as only risk for us as it is for some other companies. And then you're exactly right, our long-term target is 12.5% to 13.5%. And we're working very hard. And I don't know, Fabrizio will add to that.

Today, I will discuss the quarter's highlights and progress we made against our strategy, and Rick will provide details of our financial performance. We announced this",1900,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Conference Call. Today, I will discuss the quarter's highlights and progress we made against our strategy, and Rick will provide details of our financial performance. We announced this morning that before restructuring charges, sales for the quarter grew 13% to $2.1 billion. This was a milestone since it's the first time we have exceeded the $2 billion in sales in our first quarter. Our strong performance was due to robust business around the world and was helped by the dollar, which was weaker than we had forecast. Diluted earnings per share were $0.97 on a non-GAAP basis, up 14% versus year ago. 
Our success was broad-based. Sales climbed by double digits in every region, including North America and in our three largest categories, driven by strong product launches and increased advertising spending in the previous quarter. In fact, our highest sales spanned the range of the portfolio, from our entry-level Prestige brands to high-end luxury ones. Most significantly, our largest brands led the way, Estée Lauder, Clinique, M-A-C and Aramis designer fragrances had such great momentum that each rang up double-digit sales gains globally and delivered substantial improvement in North America. 
All in all, it was a terrific performance in many regards. Several of our financial measures broke records for the first quarter, including sales, operating margin, earnings and EPS. Our strategy is clearly working, and we are executing it well, which is reflected in these outstanding financial achievements. We've also made progress against many of our specific strategic goals. We again gained share in skin care and in important channels and countries, including U.S. Prestige department stores and our Prestige distribution in China. Also, our turnaround brands showed further improvement. Our creativity resulted in robust launches. We exceeded our cost-saving projection by about $50 million and we continued building our strategic capabilities. 
William Lauder and I are proud that our executive leadership team is directing our strategy so well around the world that the entire organization is executing it so successfully. This strong start is a fantastic way to launch a new fiscal year. Our positive performance this quarter give us greater confidence in the remainder of the year. So we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.10. 
Let me now provide you with some color behind the numbers. In recent quarters, the fastest growing areas have been Skin Care, China, Travel Retail and Online. While these businesses continue to record solid growth, we also saw a strong performance in U.S. department stores and fragrance, which had been declining. We attribute our success to external factors, including pent-up demand and stronger consumer spending, as well as internal achievements, creating exciting new products and unique High-Touch services that appeal to consumers over the world. Our more effective marketing, which includes compelling advertising has contributed to our success by making consumers more aware of our newest products and services. A key part of our strategy is focusing our talents and efforts on fewer but bigger product launches offsetting cutting-edge innovation. Recent introductions from our research and development teams have been outstanding, and the success of these products underline our superb sales growth. Our brands had a rich pipeline of truly novelty launches over the next several years that we believe will continue to set the pace and set us apart in the industry. Harvey can answer questions about our innovation strategy during the Q&A.
Our year-old America affiliates have been working with department stores to make the beauty floor more exciting and the initiatives are paying off for us and the retailers. Our sales in North America department store grew double digits this quarter. Sales of Estee Lauder and M-A-C brands into China grew double digits and Clinique recorded solid gains. Some of our largest U.S. department stores customers, particularly Macy's and Nordstrom, posted solid sales gains for the recent three months and higher traffic contributed to our sales growth. We believe our more focused and frequent advertising, which entices consumers to buy our must-have products helped generate the higher traffic. And while we have made inroads against Prestige competitors, we have also gained against mass. The luxury consumer is shopping again, and we are seeing our strategy contribute toward the old Prestige beauty growing faster than mass in many parts of the world. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, total U.S. beauty sales in Prestige department stores and Sephora rose 4% according to NPD, while sales in mass channel grew 1%. The strength was even greater in skin care, where Prestige sales growth was five points higher than mass. Our sales in Europe rose sharply, helped by incremental orders from perfumes as part of the reassortment effort we began last March. Asia sales growth was a little softer this quarter, but still rose 10%. Skin Care in Asia is a main area of strategic focus, and now accounts for 61% of the region's total sales, up from 56% only a year ago. In the recent quarter, our Asian Skin Care sales rose 19%. Rick will talk more about the regions in a few minutes. A key strategic focus has been to advertise our newest and most popular products effectively to pull consumers into stores. We have put the most money behind Clinique Repairwear, Laser Focus and even better Clinique Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair franchise and the pure DKNY Fragrance. Once consumers come to our counters and websites, we leverage our High-Touch service to build a personal connection, foster brand loyalty and sell multiple products. Although we are investing more in advertising, our total advertising and promotional spending hasn't increased as a percentage of sales. Instead, we have reallocated our spending in the category. We are putting less into gifts and sampling and more into advertising, including TV, online and print to build greater awareness and demand for our brands globally. The company's focus on skin care is driving sales growth at many of our brands: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins and La Mer have substantial advances in their Skin Care business. Both Estée Lauder and Clinique's global skin care sales surged more than 19%, with gains in all regions. The Estée Lauder brand continues to make impressive gains in Asia/Pacific and Travel retail, fueled by the popularity of several recent product introductions. Currently, the flagship brand is updating Re-Nutriv Ultimate, its luxury line, which we believe will continue to propel its winning skin care story. 
Clinique's strategy to target skin care products for specific concern paid huge dividends. In addition, the brand's recent launch of Repairwear Laser Focus fueled solid growth in Asia and particularly, in China. Clinique is the largest beauty brand in the United States, yet it managed to expand its skin care share in Prestige department store by more than one point. Throughout the quarter, our brands continued tailoring their products and communications to different regions as they become more locally relevant. Aramis and Designer Fragrances successfully launched Coach Poppy and Pure DKNY in North America and Tommy Hilfiger Loud in the U.K. ADS [ph] (00:10:29) sales climbed more than 25% and coupled with a lower cost of goods and cost-cutting initiatives, its operating profit improved sharply. 
Our fragrance category, led by ADS [ph] (00:10:48) courageously changed strategy to first improve its bottom line before accelerating topline growth. That approach has paid off dramatically as higher sales, coupled with massive spending resulted in much improved profitability this quarter. Other brands in our portfolio that are turning around have also made substantial strides toward greater profitability, which has helped the company's overall performance. Two of our high-end Fragrance brands, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, generated healthy sales increases, particularly in Europe and in the Middle East because they created heavier, more intense scents that appeal to consumers in those markets. This quarter was the first that included our newest brand, Smashbox, and it's off to a good start. Smashbox is a strong brand in the United States, with a loyal consumer following. It helps strengthen our makeup category and our presence in alternative channels. We are working to integrate the brand organizationally and functionally. While our brands have been busy accelerating their individual strategies, on a corporate basis, we have taken steps to strengthen our capabilities, both regionally and globally. With the digital universe increasingly important in everything we do, we are committed to building on our expertise and expanding our global presence online. We are constantly evolving our communications and use of social media online and searching for better ways to sell and promote our products. 
To that end, we feel that employees must be engaged and dedicated to these endeavors. To show our commitment, the company organized a digital media conference in New York in August for hundreds of our executives to immerse them in the fast-paced online world and provide them with a deeper understanding of the potential it holds. The event included speakers from Facebook, Google, Foursquare, as well as digital executives from other consumer companies at the forefront of social networking. The day was a tremendous learning experience and enforced to our management that this is an area that we believe holds amazing promise and potential.
Looking ahead, we are anticipating a solid holiday season. The U.S. department store business is healthier than last year and our brands have created a wide selection of products offering compelling value. We believe consumers will find our products and unique services to be attractive in this environment. As we continue on our path of achieving sustainable profitable growth, we will bring our brands to more people. For example, M-A-C plans to open about 50 doors in international markets in the second quarter and La Mer and Aramis and Designer Fragrances expect to launch e-commerce in Japan. We will open more than 90 locations in China this fiscal year for our nine brands there. 
As a dynamic enterprise, we must constantly look ahead to be in the forefront to stay on top of our game, so we are reinvesting some of our profits in our future and pursuing our most promising opportunities by brand, by market, in China, backed by an unwavering commitment to innovation and to talent. Our focus this year centers on five areas embedded in our corporate strategy: Strengthening our creativity and innovation, expanding our High-Touch services, deepening our local relevance and widening our lead in the digital arena. We'll continue to tighten our costs and run our business in a smarter, more efficient and integrated manner. 
I want to thank my leadership team and our worldwide employees for their hard work and continuous innovation. We couldn't have accomplished any of these without you. As we continue to pursue our goals, William Lauder and I are working to preserve the company's solid foundation, its culture and the integrity instilled by the Lauder family for more than 60 years. We are in the unique position to leverage and draw inspiration from our historic strengths as we move forward to make our strategy a reality. The Estée Lauder Companies will always pride itself on creative thinking and entrepreneurial spirit and the will to win. It's wonderful for the entire organization to be able to leverage the success of the past, while participating in and embracing the company's bright future.
Now, I will turn the call over to Rick."

In local curr",1366,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and special charges. As Fabrizio said, we had a terrific quarter, driven by better-than-anticipated sales. In local currency, sales rose 14%. Adverse currency translation was less than one percentage point, resulting in reported sales growth of 13% to $2.09 billion. Net earnings for the quarter rose 16% to $194.4 million compared with $168 million in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $0.97 compared to $0.85. Sales growth was about four points more than our guidance. About two points of the upside was due to a weaker U.S. dollar than we had forecasted and another two points from stronger overall business. We are very pleased to see the sales momentum increase during the quarter, including the effect of targeted advertising behind key products in Estée Lauder and Clinique. We saw this especially in our Americas and European regions. The quarter also benefited from the sell-in of faster moving SKUs as part of the reassortment program in European perfumeries, after having taken a charge for returns of slow-moving products in the fiscal 2010 March quarter. This program is now essentially complete, and we do not expect to see incremental sales at the same level for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Additionally, our cost of goods were lower than anticipated due in part to a shift of some GWP and SAP shipments to the second quarter and better-than-expected improvements in obsolescence. Importantly, operating expenses came in where we expected, reflecting a more normalized cadence to our marketing spending. Three of our major categories grew double digits. Compared to last year, we saw the fastest growth in the strategically important Skin Care category. Sales rose 18% in local currency aided by product launches. Skin care sales grew by double digits in every region. In Makeup, local currency sales rose 11%, driven by growth in our M-A-C, Bobbi Brown and Estée Lauder brands, as well as the addition of Smashbox. This was partially offset by the discontinuation of Prescriptives in department stores. The category grew double digits in the Americas and European regions. Our Fragrance business grew 17%, excluding currency. Fragrance launches in the U.S. and U.K. helped growth in the Americas and Europe. In Hair Care, sales declined 3%, primarily due to soft results at Ojon. We are reformulating Ojon products and plan to relaunch the brand with a new marketing campaign later this fiscal year. 
On a geographic basis, all regions grew double digits. We are pleased with a 12% growth in the Americas, our best performance in a number of years. The strongest contributions came from our largest brands, Estée Lauder, Clinique, M-A-C and the Aramis and Designer Fragrance group. Additionally, Latin America grew more than 25%. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales rose 18% in local currency. Travel Retail grew 24% as the channel continued to benefit from improved traffic, led by Asia and Latin America. Our U.K. sales rose 12%, driven by good retail traction across the brand portfolio and positive response to our television advertising. Emerging markets in the region were up strong double digits. All of the Western European countries grew, although, many benefited from the perfumery reassortment program. We believe our underlying retail growth in the major Western European markets is mid-single digits. 
We continue to see overall sales growth in the Asia/Pacific region, which had a 10% rise in local currency. China rose 32%, fueled by 16% like retail growth and expanded distribution. The appetite of Chinese consumers for our products is also driving strong, double-digit gains in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Korea grew 6% but Japan and Australia declined, reflecting their tough economic environments. Our gross margin improved by 40 basis points this quarter to 76.7%. Contributing to the increase were lower obsolescence charges of 30 basis points and positive currency of 20 basis points. These figures include the benefit of our cost savings initiatives of $21 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, rose 10 basis points to 62.2%. Factors affecting operating expenses as a percentage of sales include lower selling and shipping costs of 130 basis points, partially offset by higher advertising merchandising and sampling and general administrative costs of about 110 basis points. These figures reflect savings of $28 million from our cost-reduction programs. As a result, operating income rose 15% to $302.6 million and operating margin rose 30 basis points to 14.5% of sales. Our cost-savings initiatives are moving ahead well and we achieved total savings of $49 million in the quarter. We now expect to save between $135 million and $145 million for the full year. Regarding net interest expense, we reported $16.1 million this quarter versus $19.6 million in last year's first quarter. The decrease is due to lower debt levels. The effective tax rate was 32.7%, within our projected range. We recorded $4.6 million in restructuring and other special charges, equal to $0.02 per share for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect to record charges of between $60 million and $70 million. 
Our fiscal first quarter cash flow typically reflect seasonal working capital levels as we gear up for the holiday season. This quarter, net cash used for operating activities was $39 million compared to $3 million of cash generated last year. The biggest driver of the variance is the increase in accounts receivable. Our days sales outstanding were 50 days this quarter, three days lower than last year. Inventory days were 177 days compared with 170 days last year, reflecting the expected second quarter sales growth. At the end of September, our SKU count was down 7% from a year earlier. However, we have experienced service issues as some vendors are having difficulty meeting the increased industry-wide demand for ingredients and components. As we continue to improve our forecasting and react to the increase in demand, we may build some additional inventories to address these service issues. We spent $58 million for capital expenditures, which includes our company-wide systems initiative. We also used $258 million primarily for the purchase of Smashbox. For fiscal 2011, we expect to generate around $850 million to $900 million of cash flow from operations and use about $350 million for capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program.
Looking ahead, we are balancing the better-than-expected sales and earnings in the first quarter with the risk of a possible consumer downturn after the holidays, more aggressive competition and volatile currency markets. However, we remain confident in our business and believe it is reasonable to raise our expectations. For the year, we expect local currency sales growth of 7% to 9%. Our fiscal year guidance builds in assumptions of approximately $1.30 for the euro, 85 for the yen and $1.55 for the pound. This scenario would reduce reported sales growth by about one percentage point. We expect to continue investing behind our strategic priorities in the remainder of the fiscal year to drive growth and increase share. At the same time, we continue to pursue the cost savings we previously laid out. We expect a 50 to 90 basis point improvement in operating margin this year. At this time, we continue to estimate an effective tax rate of between 32% and 34%. We are raising our full year, non-GAAP EPS forecast to between $2.90 and $3.10. 
Our outlook for the holiday season reflects an improvement in consumer spending compared to last year. Our sales growth for the second quarter is forecast to come in between 8% and 10% in local currency. The negative impact of foreign exchange translation is expected to decrease sales growth by about three percentage points. We expect EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2010, to be between $1.32 and $1.45. We are encouraged by our results for the first quarter, and we are optimistic about the response to our innovation and unique service that sets us apart. Longer-term, we are working hard to make our four-year strategy a reality. That concludes my comments for today, and we'll be happy to take your questions now."

The other important difference, these activities of extra advertising had been focused and concentrated on our most successful and biggest launches globally, which means there is another advantage versus the past model where the level of support that will most potentially win our activity having is dramatically increasing. And in fact, a lot of our accelerated growth came from the extraordinary success of some of our launches like Clinique Even Better Clinical or Lauder Advanced Night Repair or DKNY Pure, which is also the response to a concentrated effort of advertising on those initiatives. Obviously, the reduction of promotional activity and more push activity has influenced, meaning will reduce a little bit our volume.

First of all, we are very, very positive on our strategy, and we are getting every quarter more positive about our ability to execute in general.

First of all, we are very, very positive on our strategy, and we are getting every quarter more positive about our ability to execute in general. And also, we start seeing positive results in the important U.S. department store channel for us. So those are all positive and we are pretty bullish on those key aspects. However, we need to balance the results of this quarter with the expectation for the next say, quarter or within the fiscal year for the following reason. First of all, because also, in; fact for the supply chain which has been discussed, we have some of the gift with process promotions which are in holiday sales. Which originally had to be shipped in September, will be actually shipped in October. And this interestingly, is actually creating a better gross margin in the first quarter, and we create some worse gross margin in the second quarter. So this is an element of balancing that we are taking under account. The second important element is that the incremental orders that we got in Europe because of the reassortment program that have positively impacted our first quarter will not continue after early October. So we do not expect this positive trend to continue in the remaining part of the fiscal year. Next point is the low base. I mean, our first quarter last year was the worst in terms of growth. And so the comps are going to be much tougher for the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year. Importantly, then is currency. The currency rates has been more favorable than anticipated in this first quarter. We honestly, do not expect this trend to continue. As Rick has explained in the prepared remarks, we are assuming for the average of the remainder of the fiscal year, a euro at 1.30. And as you know, this has been pretty volatile and difficult to predict. And finally, but not less important, we are only one quarter into the year and we have some concerns for the external macro factors, specifically in the U.S., the expectation for the holiday season is pretty positive, but the January March or January June period is a big question mark. There are many factors that may generate a softening of the market after January, particularly, if the unemployment rate had remained at the current level. And then we continue to be pretty worried by the pocket of softness around the world, namely Japan and Australia, in Asia and Southern Europe in general, they remain very worried. To this worry, you can now use of the U.K. program. Now U.K. is our second biggest market. And so we are prudent on what will be the effect on consumption on the new measures in U.K. and the increase in January in the U.K. for the second six months of our fiscal year. So the combination of these factors is the reason why you see us taking the yearly guidance up, but not of the total amount that we've been doing better in the first quarter."

Actually, yes. I believe there is some similarities between the opportunity of getting the department store growing again in Japan and what is working today to get the department store traffic in cosmetic up again in the U.S. So we are definitely working on these. We are transferring some of our U.S. learnings into our Japan program and working with retailers there to generate a high level of learning. And particularly, the level of learning in how to improve the High-Touch, how to the differentiation versus the mass channel, how to improve the role of new initiative and make the launches to attract new consumers to the floor of beauty in big department stores. And finally, how to improve the cost structure to liberate the funds that needs to be invested in attracting new consumer and serving them with higher, higher quality. All elements that will definitely be used also in Japan to launch the second. However, the Japan economy is really under pressure. So this may take some time, because it requires some improvement of the business model. But at the same time, we'll require that the economy in Japan will be less stabilized or hopefully one day be turned around."

The result of this is that for a few years, every complete assortment is composed of high moving items, items that move very frequently in the course of the year and slow movers. After some time, the accumulation of too many slow movers in a relatively small door like European perfumeries creates the inability of those retailers then to buy in sufficient quantities than high movers. So we took the important strategic decision to help the retailers to eliminate the slow movers from their assortment so they could create space to get in the high movers. That's what reassortment is. This is having an amazing benefit because on one side, it's making our assortment better in each single perfumery. On the other side, it's giving to its single perfumery a competition of high mover, which makes their overall rotation increase and importantly, make better profit for the retailer and better profit for us. So it's been probably one of the smartest investments that we could have done, now the key challenge in front of us is to maintain the assortment in those stores with a right balance between completeness of the assortment and focus on high mover SKUs, which is the plan."

And we have one more thing that we do, which is we create products closest to the most demanding consumer and make them global hits. So what we're doing is creating products that could action and collaboration between two more different region buy creating products that satisfy that consumer which is extremely demanding, one of which for example is Asia, and then taking that idea globally, so that we have a very big hit.

And we've always said our priorities for cash are investing in our business, make strategic acquisitions and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So I mentioned share repurchase. Dividends really is part of a capital allocation discussion that we have with the board of directors, and we do that rather frequently. But the declaration of dividends is in their hands quite honestly. We're lucky that we do have a strong balance sheet that gives us a great deal of flexibility. Regarding material costs, we have seen some pressure in material costs, and we've mentioned this on earlier calls, quite honestly, the value of the materials that we buy is not so much in the raw materials but in the creative process, if you will, the construction of what we buy. So the creation of the caps or bottles or boxes that are specific for us, that's really the cost to add component, if you will, of our cost of goods.
