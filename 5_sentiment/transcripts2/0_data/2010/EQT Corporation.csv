In just a moment Phil will briefly review few topics related to our financial results for 2009 which were released this morning. Then Murry will provide an update of our 2009 reserves, drilling and infrastructure development programs and other operational matters. Following Murry's remarks we'll open the phone line up for questions.
But first I would like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to such matters as our well drilling and infrastructure development initiatives including the impact of technological developments, production and sales volumes, reserves the eliminated -- estimated ultimate recovery for our wells, financing plans, operating cash flow, capital budget, growth rate and other financial and operational matters. It should be noted that a variety of factors could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors are listed in the company's Form 10-K for year-end December 31, 2008 and in the company's Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2009 to be filed with the SEC. As updated by any subsequent form 10-Qs and on our website. 
Finally, this morning's call may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see this morning's earnings press release, a copy of which is available on our website for the reconciliations and other disclosures with respect to such non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will like to turn call over to Phil Conti.

The reduction in year-over-year EPS as well as cash flow comes as a result of the",1550,"Thanks Pat and good morning, everyone. What you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2009 earnings per share of $1.19 which compares with EPS of $2 in 2008. The reduction in year-over-year EPS as well as cash flow comes as a result of the lower commodity price environment as well as the stock based incentive compensation expense which we have talked about all year. And together I think there's nicely outstanding year EQT had from an operational standpoint. 
We show the impact of the incentive compensation swing and adjusted EPS table in this morning's release. But as well the 2009 financial results were also negatively impacted by the drop in natural gas prices which began in late '08 and continued throughout 2009. Lower NYMEX and it was about 56% lower year-over-year but to lower realized average wellhead natural gas prices. As we show in another table in the release this morning, EQT's realized average wellhead natural gas price was $5.44 per Mcfe in '09 or about 20% lower than the $6.82 we realized last year. 
These lower natural gas prices resulted in about a $141 million of less operating income in 2009 versus '08 and that includes the impact of our hedges. If you look behind cash flow on EPS however, '09 really was an exceptional operational year for the company in many ways including record produced natural gas cells and significantly lower drilling in per unit operating cost at production which by the way we're already among the best in the industry. We also had record volumes in gathering transmission and processing in our Midstream business and then record operating income at equitable gas. 
Between Murry's and my comments we will go into a little more detail on all of that so lets start out by briefly walking through the financial results by business unit starting with EQT Production. Production with the increasing sales of produced natural gas of almost 20% versus 2008 when you adjust for your extra day last year. I should point out that the majority of the very positive recent well is also in Marcellus and extended lateral Huron/Berea wells which Murry will elaborate upon in a minute were later in the year and did not show up in the 2009 results. 
So it was a great year from a sales volume growth standpoint but as I alluded to our front to significant volume increase was more than offset by an average NYMEX price that was again 56% lower year-over-year resulting in the large decrease in sales revenues. 
Just a moment on expenses at production, total operating expenses were higher in '08, sorry in '09 as a result of higher DD&A and exploration expense. Despite the almost 20% growth in volumes however, LOE was basically unchanged compared to '08. So on a unit basis LOE was actually down 14% and again that is excluding the impact of production taxes that were $17 million lower in 2009. And so we continue to see the benefits of scale in our production business. 
DD&A expense however was higher than '08 reflecting our drilling production volume as well as our higher DD&A rate associated with a recent drilling investment. The company also invested about $15 million in the purchase and interpretation of seismic data which shows up as exploration expense in the financial results. Exploration expense also included just under $3 million impairment on uncompleted Utica well as a result of our decision to abandon the unit and convert that well to a Marcellus well. 
Moving on to Midstream results, operating income there was up 40% consistent with the overall growth of gathered and processed volumes as well as increased revenues from a from our Big Sandy pipeline. Gathered volumes increased 11% mainly from gathering EQT Productions drilling sales volumes and combined with higher rates resulted with about an 18% increase in gathered net operating revenues. 
Transmission net operating revenues were also up about 49% versus last year, primarily because we had a full year contribution from Big Sandy which was completed in the second quarter of 2008. Processing volumes were also up here about 55% and again that was the result of a full year contribution from our Langley processing plant. And finally storage marketing and other net operating revenues were higher mainly from marketing activities related to Big Sandy capacity not yet being used by EQT Production. 
Expenses at Midstream were about $29 million higher than last year and that increase was expected based on a full year of running the freight infrastructure projects. DD&A expense accounted for about $19 million of that increase in expenses while increased electricity and labor to run our expanded compressor freight accounted for the remainder. Reported SG&A was down about $2 million, somewhat higher SG&A related to the growth in the Midstream business was more than offset by and not having a recurrence of the $5 million charge in the third quarter of '08 for the Lehman Brothers related bad debt expense. 
Moving on to distribution, operating income at distribution was a record $78.9 million in '09 or 32% higher than '08. Net operating revenues increased by about $9 million mainly due to higher rates that became effective at the end of February 2009 when we received final approval of our Pennsylvania base rate case. Distribution expenses were about $10 million lower as a result of lower bad debt expense, lower rent and lower corporate overhead allocations. 
A couple of other matters, first, incentive compensation expense, as you know the volatility in the EQT stock price over the last couple of years has led the quite a bit of compensation related volatility in our earning. In '08 when the stock price dropped 37% we realized almost a $42 million reversal of previously recorded executive compensation expenses and then in 2009 with the stock up 31% we recognized about $45 million of executive compensation expense leading to approximately an $87 million year over swing in executive compensation expense. Our current long-term executive incentive programs have been designed to eliminate such volatility going forward as the majority of this expense is set at the time of the grant. 
So if you are trying to predict the cost of incentive compensation in 2010. We estimate an annual long term incentive compensation expense of approximately $30 million. With a less volatile change of approximately $1 million for $1 change in EQT stock price. One thing that has not changed with our new program designed. Management payouts from the program will continue to be linked to shareholder returns. 
Couple of quick observations on the 4th quarter  result specifically like the full year the fourth quarter 09 was an excellent quarter from an operating standpoint which is seen above 19.5% production sales volume growth as well as considerable higher gathering, processing and transmission volumes in our midstream businesses. The fact that the fourth quarter sales volume growth rate and the full year growth rate are virtually the same again both shy of 20%.
I think I am a bit misleading in terms of our growth trajectory exiting 2009. Some of the earlier quarters in 09 had growth rates that were also in the 20% area however they were compared to quarters in 08 while volumes were somewhat suppressed as the big midstream projects either weren’t online yet or were just starting to come online. But by the time we take you to the fourth quarter of 2008 all of the midstream projects were online and we were hitting on all cylinders in the production business we actually achieved about 19% growth in the fourth quarter of 08. 
So growing almost 20% in 09 fourth quarter, versus that quarter I think is a very strong result for the company. All over again the favorable operating trends in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable market conditions from IMX natural gas. One other quick item of note in the quarter of distribution the fourth quarter 2008 revenues did include about $3.5 million related to a customer assistance program which did not reoccur in 2009 and that partially matched the revenue increase in the 2009 fourth quarter from the Pennsylvania rate case and then finally just a quick update on liquidity, we suggested during the third quarter call that our short net short term debt at year end 09 would be less than $100 million and as it turned out we ended with only $5 million of net short term debt on the balance sheet of 12.31.09 and that puts us in a great position as far as liquidity and financing flexibility as we head into 2010. In December in a press release we announced our 2010 CapEx estimate of about $850 million and we also estimated that 2010 operating cash flow would be about $650 to $700 million at the current strip and that included about $100 million we will receive from a tax refund as a result of the 5 year NOL carry back allowed by legislation that was an act of doing in the fourth quarter of 09.
The approximately $150 to $200 million difference between CapEx and cash flow we expect to find with our currently virtually undrawn $1.4 billion revolver and with that I will turn the call over to Murry .

269924,84219662,47434,"EQT Corporation, 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thanks Phil and good morning everybody as Phil mentioned we had a extremely strong operational quarter across all of our business lines and the year of course was a real good year for EQT and the headline statistic of course was of the nearly 20% growth i",1967,"Thanks Phil and good morning everybody as Phil mentioned we had a extremely strong operational quarter across all of our business lines and the year of course was a real good year for EQT and the headline statistic of course was of the nearly 20% growth in produced natural gas sales and as Phil mentioned at a lower capital costs with projecting sales of another 20% in 2010 at as he described lower cost this was all driven by aggressive horizontal air drilling in our Huron, Berea plant all with the drill bit. Significant progress in the development of the Marcellus also all with the drill bit is our sixth consecutive quarter of double digit natural gas sales growth and we had record throughput and operating income at midstream record operating income at distribution. In total we drilled in the fourth quarter about 184 wells, 702 for the year. And total horizontal wells spread in the fourth quarter was 132 and year-to-date was 403 wells. 
Turning to reserves. The 2009 reserve report was prepared in accordance with the SEC guidelines I wont repeat what is in the reserve press release but I did want to emphasize a couple of points. First un-risk potential is still about the same are we thought before about 26 Tcfe. However you are seeing with this release the continuation of the orderly progression of reserves up toward lower risk categories specifically for the proved reserve categories Marcellus reserves are up about 1 Tcfe due mostly as a result of 2009 drilling Huron, Berea reserves are up about 0.5 Tcfe because of new drilling and the new SEC rules. We recall perhaps that the vast majority of EQT drilling in recent years has been done on unproved locations. In 2009 for example 79% of our wells were drilled on unproved locations. Due both to the SEC rules and to our expanded drilling programs over the past few years most of our drilling in 2010 and beyond will take place on PUD locations. This again is an indication of orderly development. One other item worth discussing is the impact on the reserves of the SEC rules requiring locations to be drilled within five years to be included and approved undeveloped category. For obvious reasons the drilling assumptions used in the reserve calculation is an important variable. Our 2009 reserve report is based on a five year drilling schedule that costs $2.9 billion. Approximately five times our 2010 budget. 
This five year drilling schedule results in our booking approximately 2 Tcfe as probable reserves from locations which aside from the assumption of the timing of the drilling would have otherwise been booked as proved. For example you will note that our CBM other reserve category is down about 0.5 Tcfe this year that is because the presumed 5 year drilling schedule no longer includes many vertical conventional wells. Those locations are now included in unproved categories. 
The Huron and Berea update you know kind of a story that we drilled about 821 wells now in that program since the inception of the horizontal air drilling a few years ago a third of our production now comes from air drill horizontal Huron Berea wells and of course in 2006, 0% came from horizontal air drilled wells. 
To remind you of the scope of the play we reported 6.7 Tcfe of 3P and an estimate of 13 Tcfe of resource potential in the Huron, Berea. As I reported there in the last couple of quarters our latest application of new technology is the extended lateral design improvement in product technologies now allowing for 22 or more stages and so we have lengthened our laterals. 
To date we have successfully drilled and completed 5 extended lateral wells doubling our footage of play from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet. With this improvement, we believe we are doubling reserves and productivity per well for less than 40% more cost approximately 1.6 Bcf per well for about $1.4 million. Unit development cost is just a little less than $0.90. IRS for extended lateral we are currently estimating in the mid 30s at $7 NYMEX and greater than 20% at $6 pay back period interestingly is about $2.7 years which is a lot faster than Appalachia use to be clearly and we expect that this extended lateral design will be our standard operating procedure by year end. On the Marcellus play EQT now has approximately 445,000 acres in the core Marcellus play this is an increase of about 45,000 acres the increase is due to about 13,000 leased acres that we have acquired in P.A. and the rest is due to the impact of positive drilling results in West Virginia. Which expanded our understanding of the size of the area underlying by high pressure Marcellus. Improvements some dramatic in both drilling cost and completion effectiveness are causing us to become increasingly bullish on this play even in the current price environment a great credit to the EQT team. Here are the reasons why. Well costs for 1 as we discussed on the third quarter call have seen a marked improvement this year in 2009 on our third quarter we reported having achieved completed Marcellus well costs of about $3 million per well we still think $3 million per well is a good number for the current lateral design. On EUR our estimate of the average EUR from Marcellus wells is moving up. Our current view is that the average will be between 3.5 and 4 Bcf for all of our acreage and we wouldn’t be surprised given current data that the average EUR will edge up towards the top of that range. There are three important reasons for the improvement in our opinion about Marcellus EURs first on the completion side we have made several significant changes over the last 6 months which we feel have contributed to improve results first has to do with targeting. 
We are able to drill now in the most brittle section of the Marcellus and that seems to provide A, the most organic rig shale and B, the best place to frac. We have changed our frac casing from 4.5 inches to 5.5 inches which lowers our treatment pressures and allows us to more consistently pump the job as designed. Here we have also significantly reduced the spacing between pricked clusters from approximately 150 to 160 feet. So on the completion side we take in a number of steps that seem to be causing us to have more consistent jobs and less failure on our individual frac stages. The second important thing that's happened to effects Marcellus EURs is that we've encountered some prime geologic conditions for Marcellus production, particularly in Green County which I will discuss in a minute. 
Third and this is a bit more of subtle point. The combined effect of more effective and consistent completion techniques, better targeting and lower cost is intercepting to make more areas in the Marcellus attractive. This is particularly emphasized by our results in West Virginia, which I will also discuss briefly in a second. Another way to put this is that we here at EQT are now confident that regardless of the Marcellus geology put before us, we will find a way to exploit it profitably. 
Current economics show that unit development cost for Marcellus wells are about a little less than $0.85 our IRRs similar to the Huron/Berea are over 30% and at $7 NYMEX and greater than 20% at $6 NYMEX and payback period is about in the same range as in Huron/Berea about 2.9 years for the standard lateral design.
Specifically, on well results for the Marcellus, we have spent 53 horizontal wells to-date, 17 of those have been turned in line. We are expecting to drill 40 to 50 Marcellus wells in 2010. Green County in particular in the fourth quarter we turned in line our best Marcellus well, we call it the 167 well with which had a 30 day average initial production of 14 million cubic feet a day. This well has been in line for approximately 37 days and is currently producing in the 12 million cubic feet a day range. Based on the 30 day IP rates, this well to our knowledge is the most prolific well drilled by industry in the Marcellus place so far. 
Two adjacent wells the 168 and the 170 wells in Green had 24 hour flow rates similar to the 167 well but are shed in our way of completion of gathering capacity so we don't have those 30 day IPs yet. 12 wells are planned to be drilled on 3 pads within the 2 mile radius of these wells. And these wells are located on a pad that's approximately 8 miles away from another very prolific Green County well pad which I discussed in the third quarter. 
In Green County, more generally, we have about 380 drilling locations. Our EUR expectation in this area is about 4.5 Bcfe per well, obviously some wells would be higher and some lower than that presumed average. The Green County story for EQT is one of  confluence and excellent application of technology with prime geological conditions. 
Moving on to West Virginia, we are very pleased with what's being going on in the West Virginia Marcellus program. We have turned 10 wells in line to-date. While the 30 days IPs on these wells are not very flashy averaging about 2.1 million cubic feet. The decline curves are such that we expect EURs to be in the 3.5 Bcfe range. IRRs for the West Virginia wells are consistent with those of the Marcellus generally, greater than 30% at $7 NYMEX and again greater than 20% at $6. So that West Virginia program is looking really, really good to us at this point in time. 
Our Midstream in Equitrans as we previously mentioned in our third quarter 2009 call EQT's Midstream has successfully completed an open season for proposed expansion of Equitrans. We are still negotiating binding precedent agreements. We did submit, if you saw this, our FERC application for the phase I expansion involving about a 100,000 decks on January 25th, the 100 million a day on January 25th, phase one is expected to be on line this year. 
Phase II as we mentioned earlier takes the project up to the full 1.1 million decks, the total project cost including Phase 1 and 2 is currently estimated between $450 million and $500 million, that's a bit less than we talked about previously. And also, I did want to emphasize and we talked about this on the third quarter call. 
We are currently considering partnerships or ventures on various aspects of our Midstream business we are talking to a number of people about that. And obviously EQT has always been strong and desired to have control of Midstream and make sure that our gas gets to market, it's been a core issue for EQT over the years and we still adhere to that. But there are a number of people currently who are interested in Marcellus Midstream that wasn't the case now so many years ago, it is the case now and we are talking to a number of people to try to see what they can do for EQT without having to sacrifice the comfort of being able to get our gas to market. 
So that's really all I have to say, I mean it's a great quarter, great year. We still believe EQT is a very compelling investment; growth rates are good, industry leading cost structure is important particularly in times like today where commodity prices are a bit soft. And with that I will turn it back over to Pat and we will take your questions.

But I would say that we are not presuming that the average is going to be as high as what you might predict from those particular wells. Geologically, yeah, I think it is a couple of things perhaps but I don't think I would put a lot of emphasis on this right now because we are still learning but yes, it is a bit thicker, yes its broader which we think is an important fact for the Marcellus. 
The organic rich part of the Marcellus is also the most brittle part of the Marcellus and that seems to have an impact on the effectiveness on the fracs that near bore hole brittleness assuming to provide near bore hole permeability which seems to have an impact on flow rates. So that seems to be consistent, the question is how do you predict the actual presence of this brittle Marcellus and I am not so sure we are ready to be able to predict that in advance all that much. I mean we know it when we see it after the fact we are not sure yet we are able to predict it. 
The other thing that's happening in this area is not a lot of structural complexity. And therefore, there hasn't been a lot of structural events post the Marcellus deposition that would cause an extreme amount of fracturing or faulting to steal away the gas that might have been there earlier and kind of leaked out during successive stages of Mountain building. And that could also have an impact as well. So those were the couple of the geological factors.

It's just, we basically followed the rules just the way they are laid out by the SEC, Scott, there was no, we didn't take extraordinary measures to go beyond that. I think the factor that I mentioned in my comments which is actually the most important factor on this whole reserve booking calculation and I know you're going to see this with a number of other companies is the presumption of the number of wells that are going to be drilled in the five year period, that's going to swamp any of the stuff that you're talking about now and as you're comparing company-to-company results, you know I am going to make this long because Scott told me to be brief but the fact is that there is a lot more management judgment in the crude reserves now then there was. It used to be, a handed in reserve report, that was it. Now there is this question of the five year presumed drilling schedule and that's a big factor. Dave, did you want to?

The other thing too is if you recall, we were drilling along pipelines. We wanted to be able to assure that the wells we were drilling, we were going to get to market and so by definition, we were drilling a lot of unproved locations because the pipeline didn't necessarily fit right on the location that was previously classified as proved and we've been doing that for a couple of years now. That's why I think today's point for EQT it makes sense that there was such a large increase in reserves this year. So that's number one because of the rule change. And number two because we had drilled so many unproved locations in the last couple of years.

I think in again we are not getting too long with it, I think there are two issues, one is certainly the one you mentioned money and its really not so much money. We think the Midstream investments are quite profitable they make (EVA) but the question is where do we get the maximum leverage and at this point in time, it is very clear that we are getting the maximum leverage for dollars on the E&P side. And therefore given the fact that we don’t have enough capital to develop this as you mentioned, as quickly as we would like, there are some trade offs that we have to make. 
But I think it's more than the money. I mean we are not good and in the liquids business for example I mean not so much that we can’t build our extraction plant which we’ve done and we weren’t very successful as such but when you look at all the issues of fractionation, transporting of liquid, sale of liquid, etcetera, etcetera, these are core capabilities that EQT just does not have. So on that goal it makes no sense for EQT to develop that capability and so we are looking for somebody that can do that. 
Moving up stream into the high pressure gathering system, Equitrans, Big Sandy and then the large high pressure corridors that we built, downstream in the compressors frankly once those things are full those little additional EQT value that’s added to those pipes. And the problem in the past has been that we haven't been able and we knew that. And you can price those in MLP etcetera, etcetera we all get that. The problem is to build the full period, that if you are asking someone to build something fresh, with fresh capital; the costs of capital that we had seen in the past had been fairly high relative to EQT's cost of capital. 
Today I would say and Dave can comment on it but I would say we’ve seen an enormous amount of interest among people and potentially building those and so the rent payments we think might be coming down versus what we might have anticipated a couple of years ago even for projects that require fresh capital. 
So, Beck I think things have changed here in Appalachia there are a number of people in the liquid side that are capable and anxious to come in and EQT is a great partner and on the sort of the moving up stream a bit on the pipeline side there are also people who seem anxious to deploy capital in those pipes and we are talking to a lot of people to see if we can find something that’s suitable for us. I hope that’s a very long answer but it kind of frames what we are trying to do.

As you saw in the press release this morning EQT announced first quarter 2010 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share which was an 18% increase over share in the first quarter of 2009. That increase in EPS as well as the i",1207,"Thank Pat and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning EQT announced first quarter 2010 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share which was an 18% increase over share in the first quarter of 2009. That increase in EPS as well as the increase in cash flow that we mentioned comes as a result of another outstanding operational quarter across all three of EQT’s business units, including record produced natural gas sales and continued load drilling and per unit operating costs at production. Another record in gathering transmission and processing volumes in our Midstream business and solid operating income at gas. The result this quarter I think are pretty straight forward, so my comments about the financial performance will be relatively brief before turning the call over to Dave Porges.  
Starting out with EQT production, operating results, it is in the case for well over a year now, the big story in the quarter of EQT production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas. The growth rate as you saw hit almost 31% in the recently completed quarter over the first quarter of 2009. That growth rates was organic and was driven by sales from our Marcellus and Huron/Berea horizontal shale plays which together contributed over 40% of the volumes in the quarter, far exceeding the 25% contribution in the same quarter a year ago. Contribution from the Marcellus shale is growing rapidly and represented over 10% of the volume this quarter when it was really about 1%, it contributed about 1% in the first quarter of 2009 and only 3% for the full year of 2009.  
Gas prices were also up a little bit in the quarter. The realized prices at EQT production was slightly higher at $4.23 compared to $4.16 last year and at the corporate level EQT realized $6.62 per Mcfe or about 9% higher than last year. You may have noticed that we have slightly ordered our price reconciliation table included in the press release this morning. We did underline to reflect the full value of our produced liquids in the realized price and by the way those liquids come primarily from our Huron/Berea play.  
Our previous presentation did include the Btu premium at the price of natural gas. However any profit made when on Midstream group strips the liquids and realizes higher prices than the natural gas price was included in the processing that revenues at Midstream but it was not included in the average gathered price to EQT Corporation. While this additional detail does not change to reported financial results at all, we do think it only illustrates the full revenue generated from our producing wells.  
As you can see on the table EQT Corporation realized a $1.22 per Mcf on average above the price of dry gas. The $0.58 recognized the Btu premium at production and $0.64 recognize that Midstream. A brief moment on expenses at production, total operating expenses were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, SG&A and ROE, all consistent with the significant production growth. Production taxes were down a fair amount in the quarter especially on a unit basis, $0.26 per Mcfe in the recent quarter versus $0.36 per Mcfe a year ago.  
I think since that larger of a unit decrease may not be intuitive in the recent price environment, do remember that production taxes are the total of two price related taxes, one being severance taxes and the other being property taxes. Severance tax is a fairly straight forward calculation as it is just a percentage of our unhedged production revenue at current prices. Property tax is also price related but with the lag, so the property tax incurred in 2010 is primarily based on 2009 gas prices while the comparable 2009 property tax was primarily based on 2008 gas prices. So the significant decline in prices from ’08 to ’09 therefore resulted in lower property tax in 2010.  
Exploration expense was also $2 million, lower quarter-over-quarter as we reduce the size of our seismic program compared in the last year and we expect our exploration expense to be above $6 million for 2010. moving on to the Midstream business, operating income here was up37% consistent with the overall growth of gathered and processed volumes as well as the significantly higher liquid  scratch spreads which were driven by a 72% increase in average NGL prices quarter-over-quarter. Gathered volumes increased 16% mainly from gathering EQT productions growing sales volumes and combined with higher rates resulted in a 26% increase in gathering that operating revenue.  
In addition to improve prices, processing volumes were also up by about 21% as a result of higher production volumes from our wet gas Huron/Berea play in Kentucky. Transmission net operating revenues were also up a little bit primarily because of slightly higher rates and finally storage, marketing and other net operating revenues were lower mainly from lower third party marketing margins. In 2010, capacity constraints has eased somewhat in the (inaudible) Big Sandy quarter resulting in a somewhat smaller premium for marketing services.  
In addition first quarter 2009 margins on gas market utilizing in Big Sandy capacity included contracts that were negotiated in the 2008 price environment, by the first quarter of 2010, those have been replaced by lower margin contracts. Net operating expenses at Midstream were also about $6 million, 15% quarter-over-quarter. Higher DD&A expense associated with our increasing Midstream infrastructure accounted for about $2.7 million of that increase in expenses while increased electricity and labor to run our expanded compressor fleet accounted for the majority of the rest.  
Moving onto distribution, operating income at distribution was up about 8% mainly as a result of a full quarter of higher rates in Pennsylvania which went into effect last February. Weather was basically the same as last year, the only real variance of note this quarter was $1.8 million increase in bad debt expense which is reported in DD&A and that reflects a decrease in federal funding for customer assistance plans this winter compared to last winter. The collections history distribution actually improved somewhat quarter-over-quarter.  
And then finally our regular liquidity update, as a result of $538 million in net proceeds from the recent equity offering and by the way about $9 million of that came after 331, so it won't show up in the queue later today. But we’ve got $9 million when the small portion of the green shoe was exercised after the end of the month. And then coupled with that the receipt of a $120 million cash tax refund resulting from the five year NOL carry back allowed by legislation that was enacted during the first quarter of 2009.  
Those two together we closed the quarter with no short term debt and a net cash balance of about $553 million. As previously announced our 2010 capital expenditure estimate is about $1.2 billion and we estimate that 2010 operating cash flow at the current strip will be approximately $650 to $700 million including the $121 million we received from the tax refund. So we’re really in a great liquidity position to fund the remainder of the 2010 growth plan.

As I assume my new role EQT, I look forward to building upon the firm foundation laid by Murry during his 12 year tenure as CEO. Because of his leadership and passion EQT has transformed itself from a regional utility into one of the leading natural gas production companies in the nation. EQT and its predecessors have been around for over 100 years. In my opinion Murry Gerber, will be remembered as the finest CEO this company has ever had.
One of his greatest legacies has been developing a management team that can continue his fine work. As many of you know, I joined the company in 1998 along with Murry as Chief Financial Officer. Over the past 12 years, I’ve held various management positions, the most recent being President and COO. At the offset EQT strategy was set largely by the two of us and we view this effort as a partnership.  
Increasingly the management team that has built up and grown up around us has become much more involved in setting strategy and running the company. This is a team that is committed to the ultimate goal of increasing shareholder value. Aspects of achieving that goal is just in all of our businesses from accelerating our innovating shale drilling program to expanding and strengthening our Midstream capabilities to continuing our initiatives to be the most efficient and customer oriented gas distribution company we can possibly be.  
Still the core strategy that animates our upstream and midstream efforts is accelerating the monetization of our extensive reserves. We intend to accomplish this via the drill bit and other means as appropriate. Those other means could include anything from partnerships with strategic or financial parties to asset sales. However we feel that our ability to execute against an organic growth strategy will create more opportunities for other monetization alternatives. Therefore we plan to stay the course in terms of developing our shale assets and getting the produced hydrocarbons to market. Returning to the management team for a moment I would like to gradually introduce you to more of them.  
Today I’ll stop by mentioning the three individuals whose titles include being a Senior Vice President of EQT Corporation. You all know Phil Conti, who just spoke. Phil will continue as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of EQT. Steve Schlotterbeck, who runs our upstream business as Senior Vice President EQT Corporation and President, Exploration and Production. Steve and his team have demonstrated extraordinary innovation in developing both our Huron and Marcellus opportunities.  
You are all aware of our innovations and air drilling in the lower pressure Huron and an adapting horizontal drilling to our assets. These are not isolated innovations. They are part of the culture Steve and his team has build and I’ll mention more of their innovations in a few moments. Randy Crawford runs our Midstream and downstream businesses as Senior Vice President EQT Corporation and President Midstream, Distribution and Commercial. Randy personally along with his team developed the very notion of utilizing our Equitrans assets be the existing (inaudible) etcetera to assist in the critical role of getting our produced natural gas to market. Randy and his team are also leading our efforts to forge Midstream partnerships.  
Now onto the first quarter results, as Phil mentioned we had another strong quarter across our business lines, but the headlines statistic is the 31% growth in sales of produced natural gas quarter-over-quarter and 11% growth in average daily sales sequentially. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit natural gas sales growth. This growth is driven by horizontal drilling in our Marcellus and Huron/Berea plays.  
Including the anticipated close within the next few days on the previously announced Marcellus shale acquisition, EQT will have approximately a half million acres in the our Marcellus play. Improvements in both drilling cost and completion effectiveness have cost us to become quite bullish on this way even on the current price environment which is a great credit to the EQT team and here is a reason. As we’ve discussed over the past several quarters, we’ve seen a market improvement in well costs and EURs. On our yearend earnings call we reported having achieved completed our Marcellus well costs of about $3 million per well. This cost per well was based on a standard lateral well, 3,000 foot laterals and I’m referring to pay here with eight stage fracs.  
We are now drilling that link wells with ten fracs. Prospectively this is our new standard. This change cost about $300,000 per well. We are also witnessing increased steel and services cost which prospectively are likely to add in our $200,000 per well. These two effects both of which are consistent with the economics discussed as part of our recent equity offering mean that we now expect our Marcellus wells to cost between 3.3 and $3.5 million per well based on that 10 stage frac standard. Earlier this quarter our average  (inaudible) of Marcellus wells would increased to between 4 and 4.5 Bcfe across all of our Marcellus acreage. 
We will not be surprised if given the current data additional frac stages per well and with our drilling results, our Marcellus EUR per well continues to edge up.
Current economics include unit development cost for Marcellus wells of around $0.80 per ounce. Our all in after-tax IRRs are about 30% at the current NYMEX strip which is about $6 and about 10% and $4 for the life of the well.
We include nearly $2 for transportation and gathering in our calculations to reflect the needs from new infrastructure. This assumes that new infrastructure is required to move essentially all volumes. Obviously, once the infrastructure is in place, the actual marginal cost to keep the pipes full indefinitely is much lower, thereby improving the IRRs on subsequent drilling materially.
We believe treating all volumes as if they require a new infrastructure is a conservative approach to our capital investment decisions. We also believe it is the correct approach for us to take at this stage of the plays development. By the way, we estimate the payback period for Marcellus wells at the current strip price to be between three and 3.5 years. 
Regarding well reserves for the Marcellus, we have spud 74 horizontal wells to date including 21 in the recently completed quarter. Of those 74 wells, 28 has been turned in line. We are expecting to drill 100 Marcellus wells in 2010.
So far in 2010, we have 11 wells with at least 30 days of production data which are not artificially curtailed to takeaway constraints. The average 30-day IP of these wells is 6.6 million cubic feet per day. You can pretty safety assume that these were standard length laterals. However, we are expanding - we are experimenting with longer laterals.
We have successfully drilled, completed and fraced the Marcellus well with a 4,800 foot lateral in 16 stages. We are currently drilling up the frac plugs and we will begin flow testing after that. We have also just TD'd and cased a Marcellus well with 8,500 feet of lateral and we are planning a 28-stage completion. The casing is being set as we speak.
Eventually our definition of a standard well will likely change, but we see a most comfortable sticking with the 3,000 foot 10-stage frac as the 2010 standard. 
Moving to our Huron play. As previously reported, we are drilling the extended laterals in the Huron/Berea play. To date, we have drilled and completed nine extended lateral wells. Right now that means they have about 5,500 feet of laterals each. In 2010, we plan to drill 99 extended lateral in this play and fully expect that extended laterals will be our standard operating procedure in the Huron/Berea play by yearend.
Extended lateral wells are providing increased productivity which is expected to result in a per unit development cost of a little less than $0.90 per Mcfe. Our Huron/Berea wells are producing liquids rich gas which also has a positive impact on the economics.
Over the past few years, EQT has developed an innovative culture that has lead to several industry firsts and helped drive EQT’s F&D cost to amongst the lowest in the industry. These innovations include air drilling in the low pressure Huron. 
The first use of horizontal hammer drilling techniques, which has drastically lowered the cost of drill the hard rock formation such as the Berea, Big Line and Ravencliff. And the first use of a rotary steerable system on dry air, which allows us to drill significantly longer laterals in the Huron play. All of these technologies have proven themselves to add value for EQT.
Our latest focus has been on transferring our extensive knowledge and experience an air drilling our operations in the Marcellus. We have recently successfully completed the drilling of two Marcellus wells using air drilling techniques down to the beginning of the lateral. While this technique is still in the experimental stage, if successful, we see many potential benefits from this including the ability to use our smaller, cheaper and more mobile Huron rigs to drill a larger portion of our Marcellus wells.
This could provide a significant cost savings over our current practice as well as minimize the amount of mobilization of the larger and more complex Marcellus rigs. We will continue searching for new and better ways to drill complete and produce our wells. We will adopt and roll out the innovations that work and we will endeavor to learn from the experiments that do not work.
Switching to our midstream activities, we are clearly moving towards a modular approach to building infrastructure. I had mentioned in many forums that managing the midstream issues were such a rapidly growing play is likely to provide challenges on the ongoing basis as we seek to keep up with production growth without getting too far ahead. Broadly and our modular approach seems best suited to this involving situation and that is the approach we are adopting.
To give you a flavor for what this means, I would like to speak for a few moments about specific projects. In the first quarter, EQT midstream completed construction of the Ingram (ph) gathering system, which allows the delivery of 50,000 dekatherms per day of EQT production in Green County, Pennsylvania to two Equitrans pipelines. 
Midstream is now on track for the second phase of that project which will extend the system to East to nearby EQT production acreage. Once completed, this will provide a further 40,000 deks per day of capacity for EQT’s production by yearend. The necessary right-of-ways have been acquired and the pipe has been purchased.
In Northern West Virginia, EQT midstream is in the process of constructing a Doddridge (ph) gathering system expansion which will deliver EQT’s production from North Central West Virginia into the Western leg of the Equitrans system. Capacity additions of 50,000 deks per day will be made available by yearend bringing total gathering capacity in West Virginia to approximately 70,000 deks per day.
Turning to the regulated pipeline of storage business, we continue to make progress on our multiple expansion initiatives. As you recall, the Equitrans Marcellus expansion project is underway and given its significant scope is progressing in stages. Equitrans has secured the market commitments need to support the first phase of this project. FERC prior notice application authority for this space was received April 2nd. 
As a result, this space which consists of upgrades to the various segments on the existing Equitrans transmission system along with modifications to compression at the frac station is proceeding according to schedule. This $15 million phase allow us for about a 100,000 deks per day of incremental delivery capacity to Equitrans’ interconnections with five interstate pipeline facilities. Construction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.
We continue to work towards completing the rest of that large Equitrans project. And the fact that Equitrans is preparing a second quarter 2010 certificate pre-filing with the FERC for the balance of the project. A provisional in-service date of mid-2012 is anticipated. 
Consistent with my broader comments, this may well continue to progress in a - there is a series of small stages, thereby giving us more flexibility to meet market needs including the growing needs of EQT production. This will also buy us sometime in terms of funding for the project. Along those lines, we continue to have discussions with potential midstream partners. 
Initially, we are most focused on identifying a strategic partner for the liquids build out. This means that they must have experience in dealing with wet systems processing and downstream aspects of liquids, as well as being willing and able to fund a sufficient amount of the capital required for this build out. We are also opened of partnering on the dry gas aspects of our midstream business. 
In this instance, operating expertise is less important as our midstream unit has that know-how. Rather the focus is on a partner that brings funding capacity and willingness. As a result of the slight differences and desired attributes for the wet versus the dry, we may end up with more than one partner. And in either event, we remain committed to getting at least to the first stage by liquids aspect executed in 2010.
I would like to conclude my remarks by reiterating our production guidance. We recently upped the sales growth guidance to 26%. In the first quarter, we beat that number. But it was compared to a relatively - to relatively low volumes from 1Q09. 
As I have discussed earlier today and previously, our attitude on guidance in these rapidly growing plays is influenced by the belief that midstream constraints are a matter of when not if. This will not halt the trend toward sharp increases and volumes over the coming quarters and years, but does make it more difficult to forecast specific timing on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We would rather see how some of our efforts to ameliorate these midstream constraints during the summer play out before reassessing our relatively fresh production guidance.
While it is true that our midstream and commercial folks often figure something out to mitigate these concerns and I am confident in their ability to do so again. To growth track, we and the rest of the A-basin producers are on will make the issue of looming midstream constraints a recurring theme. 
We believe EQT is a very compelling investment. Growth rates and cost structure are industry leading, we receive a premium basis to NYMEX, we have an extensive acreage position to develop and we believe we have the most innovative group of employees in the basin, people who are committing to getting it done. 
Thank you. I will now turn it back over to Pat and we will take your questions.

In just a moment Phil will briefly review a few topics related to our financial results for the second quarter 2010 which we released earlier this morning then Dave will provide an update on our drilling and infrastructure development programs and other operational matters.
 
Following Dave's remarks, Dave, Phil, Steve and Randy will all be available to answer your questions. First I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to such matters as our well drilling and infrastructure development initiatives including Equitrans and the potential natural gas liquids joint venture, production, sales volumes, rates of return, operating cost, operating cash flow, growth rates and other financial and operational matters. 
It should be noted that variety of factors could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors are listed in the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 under risk factors, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website. 
Finally this morning's call may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures which are in this morning's press release. The reconciliations are in this morning's press release. And before introducing Phil, I would like to inform you that we posted our Marcellus decline curve to our website this morning. So now I'll turn the call over to Philip Conti.

As you read in the press release this morning EQT announced second quarter 2010 earnings of $0.20 per diluted share, which was unchanged from the second quarter of 2009. Operating cash flow however increased by 17% over the prior year quarter as a result of another outstanding operation of quarter at the EQT Production and Midstream. 
Sales of produced of natural gas production increased by 31% for the second quarter in a row while gathered volumes at EQT Midstream increased by 20%. On the downside, realized gas price were lower than last year, primarily as a result of having fewer hedges in place at a lower average heads price. 
As we show on the table on this morning release, the EQT average wellhead sales price, which is our realized natural gas price was $5.49 per Mcf in the quarter. We were only slightly lower than the $5.57 per Mcf we realized last year, as some of the negative impact of the hedge position was offset by higher liquids prices. 
Just to remind you, for segment reporting purposes that $5.49 of revenue realized by EQT Corp. is allocated as $3.10 per Mcfe to EQT production and $2.39 per Mcfe to Midstream. 
Overall, absolute costs increased as expected to support our outstanding growth rate put on our per Mcfe basis cost related to EQT's produced natural gas and NGLs were down about 8% versus the same quarter last year after adjusting for the water treatment capacity charge mentioned in the release. 
I will go into a bit more detail on all of that as I briefly discuss results by business units starting from EQT production. And there as has been the case for two years now, the big story in the quarter was the growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned the growth rate was north of 30% for the second straight quarter. That growth rate was all organic and was driven by sales from our Marcellus and Huron / Berea horizontal shale wells which together contributed 45% of the volumes in the quarter, far exceeding the 28% contribution in the quarter a year ago. 
Contribution from Marcellus shale play alone is growing rapidly and represented over 16% of our volume this quarter, and that was up from less than 2% in the second quarter of 2009 and 13% in the first quarter of this year.
A moment on expenses of production. Total operating expenses were higher quarter-over-quarter again consisting with the significant production growth. SG&A costs were $7 million higher than last year with the biggest cause of the increase being a $4.5 million charge to write-off approximately three years of contracted capacity for treatment and disposal of recovered frac water that we no longer need. 
We also incurred about $900,000 of LOE expense this quarter from those contract obligations. While we would obviously rather avoid contracting for unnecessary capacity, the good news is that as a result of our progress and recycling the recovered frac water rather than disposing of all of it, the economics of our Marcellus wells have improved.
The financial benefits of recycling have been incorporated into our improved well economics shown in table, this morning's release
Final point on the expenses of production. Exploration expense was $3.3 million well over quarter-over-quarter as we did reduce the size of our seismic program compared to last year. 
A quick moment on well count reporting. With the implementation of our extended lateral initiative, the lateral length of our wells are getting longer on average and we are very greatly depending on the geometry of our acreage blocks. Operationally, we increasingly think about feet of pay to measure progress in our drilling program and to help you better track our progress, we will provide average completed lateral lengths in addition to well counts going forward. 
So with that though in mind, year to date we have spud 62 horizontal Marcellus wells with a projective average feet of completed lateral of 3,550 feet and 143 Huron/Berea wells with a projected average feet of completed lateral of 3,920 feet. Based on those averages we plan to drill 96 Marcellus wells and 271 horizontal Huron/Berea wells in 2010.
Neither the development phase nor the capital budget has been materially impacted by the focus on the lot longer laterals. However, its expected well productivity and returns have improved considerably as demonstrated by the table in the press release. 
And then one last point on our Marcellus status, EQT has quite a total of 115 horizontal wells in the play, of which only 34 are currently in line. So of the 81 wells not yet in line, 27 are either currently drilling or have been pot holed, 38 are drilled and are waiting a frac job and 16 have been in fraced and are waiting pipeline hookups. 
The rather large number of wells that are still in progress is driven by the large number of pad wells we have drilled recently. While pad wells drilling is a key to improving our oil drilling and the Midstream cost, it does necessarily result into ways in getting wells online. 
At the current time, we are not sufficiently comfortable from a safety perspective with conducting simultaneous operations on our Marcellus pads, so basically, we cannot hookup the wells until we finish the activity on the pad. 
The good news is that we are still exceeding our production targets and have a lot of visibility vis-à-vis our Marcellus growth forecast. 
Onto mid stream results, operating income there was up 80% consistent with the overall growth of gathered and processed volumes as well as significantly higher liquid frac spreads which were driven by 70% increase and average NGL prices versus the same quarter last year. 
In addition to improved prices, processing volumes were also up by about 12% and we have the result of higher production volumes from our web cast here on Berea plain, Kentucky. 
Gathered volumes increased 20%, again mainly from gathering EQT's increasing production and combined with higher rates, resulted in a 25% in gathering net operating revenues. 
Storage marketing and other net operating revenues were also higher in the quarter and as the relative lack of seasonal volatility and spreads in the forward curve this year resulted in more contract settlement in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of the last several years. 
The timing of these settlements matched the fact that based on the current forward curve, we expect overall net revenues from that activity to be lower in 2010 than last year. Also, third party marketing margins continue to be lower than last year as contracts expire in an environment were capacity constrains have eased somewhat in the TICO Big Sandy corridor, resulting in a smaller premium for marketing services related to our current unused capacity. 
So in summary, net revenues from storage marketing and others was up for the quarter due to timing issues but as you saw flat year-to-date and we expect it to be down for the full year by approximately $10 million. 
Net operating expenses in Midstream were $4 million or about 8% higher quarter-over-quarter, higher DD&A expenses associated with our increasing Midstream infrastructure accounted for about $2.8 million of that $4 million increase, while increased electricity, materials and severance taxes accounted for the majority of the reminder. 
Moving briefly onto distribution, operating income at distribution was $4.3 million in the quarter or about $5 million lower than in the same quarter 2009. Approximately $2 million of the decrease was due to higher bad debt expense, mainly associated with a decrease in customer participation in state and federal low income assistance programs. 
Lower commodity prices resulted in lower bills and fewer customers qualifying for assistance programs and therefore, government grants the distribution companies have decreased in 2010. 
Weather, which usually does not impact result significantly in the second or the third quarter, turned out to be a some what significant factor for the quarter in utility, at least on a percentage basis, lowering revenues by about $1.9 million. 
According to Noah, the second quarter of 2010 in our service territory was the second one that's been over 50 years. And then finally, a quick liquidity update. We did close the second quarter of 2010 with no short-term debt, that's zero short term debt and headed into the second half of 2010 with a net cash balance of about $425 million and a fully available credit facility. A quick note on the credit facility, as of recently, the full $1.5 billion became available to us again when a new bank stepped into Lehman's former position. So we do have the full $1.5 million available.
Our 2010 CapEx estimate remains at 1.2 billion excluding acquisitions and we estimate that full year 2010 operating cash flow at the current strip will be approximately $650 million, including the $121 million we received from the tax refund earlier in the year. 
So we continue to be in a great liquidity position to fund the remainder of the 2010 growth plan
And with that I'll the call over to Dave Porges.

We have recently completed our annual internal strategic r",1443,"Thank you Phil. As the results from this quarter again demonstrate, we are delivering on our commitment to increase shareholder value by accelerating some optimization of our extensive reserves. 
We have recently completed our annual internal strategic review. No real surprises come out of the review but our areas of focus for the next couple of years are as anything even clearer. I will return to that topic after covering some of the operational highlights for the quarter. 
At EQT production, we posted our second consecutive quarter at 31% year-on-year growth in sales of produced natural gas. This growth was again driven by horizontal drilling in our Marcellus and Huron/Berea place. 
We may have been bit late to the party in terms of volume growth but this is now our eight consecutive quarter of double digit natural gas sales growth. These plays have become so extensive that we do not wish to focus too much on single well anecdotes but we do have a couple of Marcellus wins yet.
During the Q1 call, we mentioned a recently completed in frac well with a 5,300 foot lateral, 4,800 feet of pay and 16 frac stages. It is now been online for 90 days. It costs $5.3 million with an EUR of 8.8 Bcf. 
Also during that call, we mentioned the well with a 9,000 foot lateral and 8,400 feet of pay, which was recently TD'd and cased. Our 28 stage frac job is now underway and we will update you on the progress, next call. 
I would now like to provide an operational update on our Midstream business. As we announced a few weeks ago, we are negotiating with DCP to form a liquids oriented venture that will combine our existing liquids-related Midstream assets with DCP's industry leading expertise. We continue to target our third quarter signing for this venture which would reduce our need for internal capital for future liquids project. 
I would also like to provide update on projects we discussed last quarter. We are on track for the second phase of the Ingram gathering system, this would led 40,000 decks per day capacity in Pennsylvania for EQT's production by year-end, bringing total capacity to 90,000 bags. 
In Northern West Virginia we are constructing a Doddridge gathering system expansion. This will deliver EQT's production from North Central West Virginia into the western leg of the Equitrans system. This led 50,000 decks per day of capacity by year end, bringing total gathering capacity and [WFD] to about 70,000 decks. 
Finally upgrades to various segments on the existing Equitrans transmission system along with modifications to compression at the prep patient are proceeding on schedule. The $15 million initial phase will allow for about 100,000 decks per day of incremental delivering capacity to Equitrans' interconnections with five inter-state pipeline facilities. 
Construction is expected to be completed by year end. We continue to work towards completing the rest of that large Equitrans project. On May 28, 2010, Fark accepted Equitrans' request to initiate the pre-filing process for Phase II of the project. The professional in-service date is in 3Q 2012. 
As noted previously, this project is likely to continue to progress as a series of smaller stages unless we determine that we can identify a third-party interested in helping to fund our larger project. That's probably a reasonable segway into some bigger picture topics related to that annual strategy review. The biggest of these is that we have updated our assessment of Marcellus well economics in a way that has a significant impact on the overall return we expect in this play. These updates and improvement are in both the production and Midstream areas. 
In production we continue to improve drilling costs and completion effectiveness due impart to use some extended laterals. In Midstream, design and engineering work lead us to sharply reduce our cost estimates for gathering, processing when needed and transporting produced gas to market. We had perhaps conservatively estimated $1.98 per Mcf of Midstream cost in support of the Marcellus development; the new estimate $1.29. This reduction is due to fine internal work within our Midstream group and to the evolving nature of Marcellus production. 
Specifically, pad drilling combined with increased production per well allows a more compact efficient Midstream system. Also, as Pat mentioned, we have published to our website a Marcellus decline curve based on the midpoint of our EUR range. This improved curve further age in making Midstream investment sufficient, i.e., we can support large higher pressured pipes that move a lot of volume. So, applying the lower cost of development and lower Midstream costs, the Marcellus economic return estimates have been revised upward. 
We now expect to earn a 63% all-in after-tax return on average assuming a flat $6/MMBTU NYMEX. This is double our previous projections. Importantly a $4 NYMEX we can earn a 23% after tax return. Interpolation will give you a reasonable feel for the economics of prices between those two levels. Strategically this is making our current situation even clear than it was. We have an immense resource base.
We have demonstrated that we can economically develop this resource base. However, we do not have nearly enough capital to pursue all of these opportunities and we have no interest in issuing equity at anything like the current prices. So, we focused evermore intently on capital allocation issues. More specifically the most economic steps for us involve developing our Marcellus position and also developing our Huron/Berea position in a manner that keeps Midstream intensity low.
So what doesn't fit? Two investment opportunities that we believe have attractive return potential will struggle to make the cut in the near term. Most obvious are those Midstream opportunities whose prime focus is moving third party volumes. 
We are quite open to obtaining other peoples money to pursue those attractive opportunities but are not likely to pursue many of them without other people's money. Also large Midstream build-outs in the Huron/Berea and CBM place are not likely to get funded in the near term and the Huron/Berea, that still allows us to grow by focusing on projects with lower Midstream intensity but you should not expect to see initiatives that involve large expenditure of EQT capital on Midstream projects as it means to achieve that growth.
On a somewhat related topic we wish to tweak our volume growth guidance. We previously estimated 26% year-on-year sales growth. Obviously the first half of 2010 was ahead of that phase and we believe that we will now have sufficient Midstream capacity to increase our estimate for sales of produced natural gas in 2010 between 129 and 131 Bcfe. 
Though we manage a variety of risks in our business, the primary risk to volumes throughout the reminder of the year continues to be the timing of Midstream capacity increases. So far, we have done a better job managing through operational issues and curtailments this summer than we excepted or at least and I expected. But this will represent our ongoing timing risk given the growth rates we are experiencing. 
Finally I wish to touch on some environmental and regulatory issues with which the industry is dealing. There has been much discussion recently about the ingredients used in the hydrofracing of shale wells. EQT is committed to operating safely protecting our workers, neighbors and the environment. EQT has also committed transparency in our operations. To that end we will be disclosing the ingredients of our frac fillets. 
As most of you know this information is already available to the relevant regulators. We have determined that the best way to make the information more broadly available absent to an industry wide approach is to disclose those ingredients on our website, further again to the extent appropriate, we intend to post on our website significant communications with legislative or regulatory bodies regarding these issues. This will be a work in progress but again our intention is transparency. Its not something else will pre hosting on the same area on the website is our corporate sustainability reports and who you will be seeing a first draft of that. In summary EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization reserves by various means. 
In the second quarter alone we have continued to accelerate the pace of organic development, lowered the expected cost of developments and announced an expected partnership for handling our liquids which will allow us to leverage non-traditional sources of GAAP. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitments through our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.
And with that I will turn the call back over to Pat.

It's a mix but there is actually another risk that we were very concerned about in the summer and that is as the system starts filling up, I mean the storage etcetera starts filling up, the pressure starts changing in the system and that creates bottlenecks where didn't used to be bottlenecks.
 So, though we are putting in projects to resolve those problems, I explained in a number of cases, the projects were never scheduled to come in until say late third quarter and what we found throughout the middle of this year is we have been able to essentially come up with work-arounds to minimize the impact of some of those bottlenecks. 
So that's what I really meant about some of the middle of the year and its not that, that's always going to be the issue that we have that you are going to ramp up here and then once you get into the summer when we are into injection season, then the dynamics start changing on the storage front and also that is as you would imagine, the summer is the normal time for pipeline companies to take down their lines out of service temporarily for maintenance purposes. 
And there is actually been a little bit of less of that this summer than we are afraid and to the extent there has, we have been able to come up with a little bit walk arounds than we were anticipating. That's going to be, as we keep ramping up, this is something we talk about ever summer.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2010 earnings of $0.24 per diluted share compared to $0.02 per diluted share on the third quarter of 2009.Operating cash flow also increa",1354,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2010 earnings of $0.24 per diluted share compared to $0.02 per diluted share on the third quarter of 2009.
Operating cash flow also increased by $75 million to $137 million in the third quarter 2010. These results were driven by another outstanding operational quarter at EQT Production and EQT Midstream.
You should note that both EPS and cash flow in 2009 were impacted by $24.7 million in higher long-term incentive compensation expense. So to get a better sense for our normalized EPS and operating cash flow adjusting for the reduction in long-term comp by adding $24.7 million to last year’s totals, EPS was 71% higher and operating cash flow was 76% higher than the third quarter ‘09.
Leading the way on the operating performance was a 35% increase in sales of produced natural gas at EQT Production, our highest organic growth rate ever compared to the prior year period.
Because of that outstanding performance we have increased our sales guidance for full year 2010 to 134 Bcf, which represents growth of 34% over 2009 sales volumes.
Gathered volumes and processed liquid volumes at EQT Midstream also increased by 22% and 25% respectively following the higher volumes at Production. On the downside as we show on the table in this morning’s release, the EQT average wellhead sales price, which is our realized natural gas sales price was $5.63 per Mcf in the quarter or about $0.10 lower than we realized in the quarter a year ago.
The drop came as a result of having fewer hedges in place and a slightly lower average hedged price, much of which was offset by higher NYMEX price and higher natural gas liquids prices. And that is important, because approximately 10% of our total production is in the form of liquids.
Just to remind you for segment reporting purposes, of the $5.63 per Mcf of revenue realized by EQT Corp., $3.32 per Mcf has been allocated to EQT Production, with the remaining $2.31 per Mcf allocated to EQT Midstream.
Overall, absolute cost increased as expected, given our outstanding continued growth, but on a unit basis, the total cost to produce, gather, process, and transport EQT’s produced natural gas and NGLs was down about 13%. I will go into a bit more detail on all of that as I briefly discuss the results by business unit starting with EQT Production, and there as has been the case for about two years now, the big story continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas.
As I mentioned upfront, the growth rate was 35% and was north of 30% for the third straight quarter. That growth rate was all organic and was driven by sales from our Marcellus and Huron/Berea horizontal shale wells, which together contributed 48% of the volumes in the quarter.
Contribution from the Marcellus shale play alone is growing rapidly and represented nearly 20% of our volumes in this quarter, up from only 2% in the third quarter of 2009. The average daily sales of produced natural gas was just under $370 million cubic feet per day for the third quarter and post quarter end in the month of October, we did reach an important milestone of 400 million cubic feet per day for the first time in the company’s history.
Moving on to expenses, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $15 million higher quarter-over-quarter. Absolute DD&A, SG&A and production taxes were all higher consistent with the significant production growth. Exploration expense was $3.6 million lower quarter-over-quarter as we reduced the size of our seismic program compared to last year.
Absolute LOE, excluding production taxes was actually about $800,000 lower than last year, as the timing of the production operational activity tends to be a little bit lumpy throughout the year.
That said, the volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute LOE expenses, and as you would expect per unit LOE was lower year-to-date by 14% compared to the first nine months of 2009. For remodeling purposes we are currently estimating fourth quarter LOE to be about $0.22 per Mcf.
Finally, a note on production taxes, there has been a lot of discussion by the PA legislators about enacting a severance tax due to lack of cooperation between the Pennsylvania House and Senate, we do not know exactly how that all will turn out. However, you should know that our economic analysis for capital budgeting purposes continues to assume a 5% plus $0.054 per Mcf severance tax.
Just the Marcellus well status update quickly. Last quarter we did provide a breakdown of our spud Marcellus wells in various stages of completion, and based on feedback you give the pad that information was informative, so I will go ahead and update our current status.
EQT has spud a total of 132 horizontal wells in the Marcellus play of which 53 are currently online. Of the 79 wells not yet online, 18 are either currently drilling or have been pop-holed, 42 are drilled and awaiting a frac job and 19 have been fraced and are awaiting pipeline hookups.
Another way we look at our progress internally is by frac stages online or in the system for our Marcellus wells. As of the end of the quarter 595 frac stages are online 246 are completed, but not yet online. And 789 are planned for well spud, but the not yet fraced.
Moving out of the midstream business quickly, operating income here was up 36% consistent with the overall growth of gathered and processed volumes, as well as significantly higher liquid frac spreads which I had mentioned up front where driven by 28% increase in average NGL prices quarter-over-quarter.
In addition to improved prices processing volumes were also up by about 25%, mainly as a result of higher production volumes from our wet gas Huron/Berea play in Kentucky.
Gathered volumes increased 22%, again mainly from gathering EQT productions growing sales volumes and combined with high rates resulted in a 26% increase in gathering net operating revenues. On the other hand, with line items, storage, marketing and other net operating income was flat in the quarter and year-to-date.
This part of the midstream business relies on seasonal volatility and spreads in the forward curve and those have trended down this year versus last year. Also third party marketing margins and volumes for reselling unused pipeline capacity have been under pressure, resulting in a smaller premium for marketing services.
So in summary, although net revenue from storage, marketing and other were flat year-to-date we expect it to be down for the full year by about $15 million.
Net operating expenses at midstream, were about $7.7 million higher quarter over quarter, O&M expense represent the lion share of that increase running $5.2 million, higher quarter-over-quarter.
About half of which was related to an impairment for the de commissioning of some more compressors, while increased electricity materials and property taxes accounted for the majority of the remainder of the increase in O&M expense.
About $2.2 million of the remainder and the increase in total net operating expenses was due to higher the DD&A expense associated with our recent midstream investments.
Finally our standard liquidity update, we closed the quarter with no short term debt in fact we finished with a net cash balance of about $200 million and fully available $1.5 billion credit facility which expires in October 2011.
We have recently begun the process of renewing that credit facility and expect to have a new multi-year facility in place by year end. Our 2010 CapEx estimate remains at about $1.2 billion excluding acquisitions and we estimate that full year 2010 operating cash flow at the current strip will be approximately $650 million to $700 million including the $123 million we received from the tax refund earlier in the year.
We continue to be in a great liquidity position and expect minimal draws under the revolver at year end.
With that, I will turn the call over to David Porges.

At EQT Production we posted our third consecutive quarter of over 30% year-on-year growth in sales of produced natural gas.

At EQT Production we posted our third consecutive quarter of over 30% year-on-year growth in sales of produced natural gas. The Marcellus has quickly become our fastest growing and most important play as well as our most profitable one.
After having accounted for only 2% of our sales from our third quarter of 2009 and the Marcellus accounted for nearly 20% of our sales of produced natural from third quarter of 2010 and we expect Marcellus to account for about 30% of fourth quarter sales.
I will return to the topic of profitability shortly. On September 29, we announced the results of two prolific Marcellus wells in Pennsylvania. The Greene County well which had a 30 day production rate of 22 million cubic feet per day is currently constrained to allow for the fracing of 7 wells on the same pad. On the last full day of production October 12, the 37th day, this well had a 24 hour rate of 20.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day.
The Armstrong County well, which had a 24 hour correction rate of 15 million cubic feet per day is also turned in line. Due to capacity constraints in that area, this well is producing under 2 milling cubic feet per day right now, which happens to be the total takeaway capacity in that area. Given the takeaway constraints, we will not have meaningful initial 30 day production data from this well.
As we alluded to in our press release regarding this well, its primary purpose was to help us establish whether the new well geometry would result in sufficiently prolific wells to help us justify building out Midstream assets in this area. We’re now in the process of designing and sizing the gathering system needed to develop our 34,000 Armstrong County acres.
Our Midstream Group expects to have a gathering system in place to support development of the Armstrong area commencing in 2012. This impressive well result is additional evidence of the quality of our overall Marcellus acreage position. We’ve now fraced two wells using the new geometry and several more are planned.
As is typically the case with these innovations, the frac cost are higher on a per well basis, but lower on a per unit volume basis. It is too early to declare the new geometry a standard operating procedure, but we are pleased with the results.
Extended laterals, of course, are already standard operating procedure. 55 of our Huron/Berea wells have completed pay of more 4,000 feet, and the same is true of 10 of our Marcellus wells. Recoveries from extended laterals wells have been proportional to the length increase, while cost increases have been much less than proportional to length increases.
Implementation of extended laterals will be limited by land issues, which should become less of a limiter if we can pool our acreage with our neighbors entirely voluntarily or with the assistance of legislation. You should expect our average lateral length to continue increasing.
These results emanate from our culture of encouraging innovation. I believe this culture is more important than the well specifics. The Greene County well was the result of longer laterals. The Armstrong Country well was the result of trying new frac geometry.
These are just two of the many advancements made by our production group over the past few years, resulting in remarkable progress in lowering unit, capital and operating costs. Not all innovations are applicable everywhere, but our Production group is committed to finding the most profitable approach for developing each of our 500,000 Marcellus acres.
An important attribute of our acreage position is that nearly all of it is held by production or in fee. In the current capital constrained environment, if we had to drill to hold acreage, we would be using fewer multi-well pads and drilling only standard laterals to allow us to touch more leaseholds.
Instead, we develop our acreage in the most economic manner, meaning that we are drilling individual wells and pads that are more expensive but that help us achieve that most important of strategic objectives reducing our long-term cost structure.
A related issue is takeaway capacity. Our Midstream group completed the Ingram gathering system and added compression in Greene County, PA in the third quarter, adding 70 million cubic feet per day of takeaway capacity.
They are on schedule to add 50 million cubic feet of daily takeaway capacity in Doddridge, West Virginia in the fourth quarter. We are already drilling in Doddridge, so it’ll not be long before you hear about West Virginia Marcellus wells fueling our growth.
Finally, upgrades to various segments on the existing Equitrans transmission system along with modifications to compression at the Pratt Station are proceeding on schedule. The $15 million initial phase has been completed and provides about 100,000 Mcf per day of incremental delivery capacity to Equitrans’ interconnections with five pipeline facilities.
Midstream has done a great job of coordinating its capacity additions in support of Production’s development plans. Once again we achieved the best cost structure we can develop in way that concentrates volume at a handful of pads in order to allow us to build fewer larger midstream systems.
An additional success in our third quarter was from our Commercial group. The found takeaway capacity, while the Ingram project was being constructed, enabling EQT to avoid expected takeaway constraints and therefore exceed our internal sales projections, which assumed more takeaway constraints. For EQT to excel, the Production, Midstream and Commercial groups all must succeed. I’m confident that all three groups will continue to perform.
Moving on to some bigger picture topics related to our capital budget. Since April the five year strip for natural gas has fallen from nearly $6 per MMBtu to approximately $5 per MMBtu. I’m sure a number of you’ve noticed that.
The silver lining of this cloud is that we have been investment opportunities that earn respectable, even good returns at these prices. In fact, we have many more opportunities than we have available capital in the current environment.
At EQT, we are willing and able to live within operating cash flow and can achieve a five-year production sales growth CAGR in the mid-teens at that level. So we can afford to defer some of our projects with limited loss of shareholder value. This is our base case, but we think we can do better.
As we all know, this economic and price environment leads to the need to make some tough choices. To free up capital, to pursue the best opportunities, we are looking to monetize some of our assets.
Our focus is on assets that earned lower returns or are perhaps worth more to others, such as acreage that would not be drilled in a timely manner or midstream assets in lower growth areas or that are fully contracted, like our Big Sandy Pipeline. We are in the process of determining if there is an attractive market for some of these assets and opportunities.
We are pursuing this in a more determined manner right now so that by the time we finalize our 2011 budget in January we will have a better idea of whether we are spending in line with only our operating cash flow projections or if we will also have cash from asset monetization to re-deploy.
So we are not ready to discuss our capital budget for 2011, we can’t tell that it will be set by either operating cash flow or operating cash flow plus a reallocation of some of the proceeds from such monetization. We do not anticipate any new capital from capital market transactions.
Either way, we will invest in our highest return projects. Well our wet Huron/Berea developments still makes a credible return at current prices especially for wells drilled near existing pipe. Building significant additional takeaway capacity for Huron/Berea drilling does not seem prudent in the current pricing environment.
These are amongst the projects that look attractive economically, attractive enough to keep and develop but not so attractive that the shareholders loose much from deferring some of them until the economic conditions are more favorable.
These deferrals will result in a slower growth rate for our Huron/Berea Shale production. One consequence of this decision is that we will not need additional processing capacity in Kentucky as early as previously projected. This impacts the economics of the proposed liquids JV with DCP.
We continue to work with DCP to find a structure that works for both of us. However well our processing needs are reduced in the near term in Kentucky they have increased in Northern West Virginia where we have wet Marcellus gas.
Approximately 40% of our 500,000 Marcellus acres contain wet gas. Structurally one positive for EQT is that it appears unnecessary to invest our own capital even as part of a joint venture to process fractionate and transport our wet gas and liquids in the Marcellus.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves. The practical impact of that for the next year or so means an increased emphasis on sales of assets that are worth more to others than to us and reduced but still healthy drill bit development pace versus our previous notion of aggressive development.
As has been true since Murry and I came to EQT in 1998, we continue to be obsessed with earning the highest possible returns from our investments and doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.

Reason the CAGR gets lower as you go out over a longer period of time is the way this thing is always going to work, I’ve had this conversation with investors individually. But I am happy to have it broader. There is a lag of nine months or a year or something from changes in capital to volume changes. Lot of our investors felt that rather painfully two, three years ago when we were putting capital in it and it took a while for the volumes to pick up.
We’re now on the other position where regardless of what we do with capital volumes should start off in 2011 very strong. The cutting of the capital eventually starts affecting you as you get further out, so I wouldn’t focus so much on any concerns about 2011. The capital sensitivity is as you look further than 2011.
And then it dips, and then on the profile when we do it, if the second year is often the weakest and then starts picking up as the cash flows from the wells since there are high return wells even at these kinds of prices begin fueling more growth. That’s kind of the normal approach as to see kind of a pop up in the first year after slowing down and then it drops, and then it begins slowly climbing back up, and I am talking about the year-on-year production of growth rate.

Generally speaking, I think our view on the bottlenecks, and Midstream is about the same which is over long periods of time, it doesn’t create constraints. It’s just that you will frequently and we will continue to frequently go through periods where we plateau. I mean where the volume plateaus, as we’re drilling and we’re waiting for Midstream to come in because it’s just not economic to put all the Midstream in ahead of times so that as soon as the wells are ready to flow they can all flow.
So we’re going to continue to see these situations where the volumes will soar up which we’ve gone through just kind of recently and then they’ll plateau for a while as we’re putting the Midstream in and then they’ll spurred up again. So if you looked at sequential quarters I still think we’ve got the potential that there’ll be sequential quarters even in a very healthy growth rate environment that are close to flat.

It’s not all capital; of course, there is a judgment on which of these things look attractive if the prices stay low. I think that’s something probably a lot of us in this industry are struggling with.
We do need to get some of our cost structures down to make more of our Huron/Berea play as they tracked you as we know it can be. A lot of that is more getting gas from the well head to the market. So and I don’t know if the prices were low even if, if you just decided you wanted to give $1 billion or something. I am not sure that we’d actually want to go spend all of that right now.
I think we’d just assume work in some of these areas on improving the cost structure before we go spending too much of the additional money.

So, conceptually that’s how we work with the team and factor in the design.
