Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And before we get started, one housekeeping matter.
Our discussion with you today will contain forward-looking statements such as estimated production and timing, drilling and development plans, expected cost reductions, and planned capital expenditures. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, they are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Please see Newfield's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause actual results to vary.
In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with Newfield's earnings release, release regarding year-end 2009 reserves, and any other applicable disclosures are available on the Investor Relations page of Newfield's website at www.newfld.com.
At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Boothby. Please go ahead, sir.

Welcome to our year-end 2009 conference call. I’m joined in Houston this morning by other members of our leadership team, including Gary Packer, Terry Rathert, Bill Schneid",3319,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Newfield Exploration. Welcome to our year-end 2009 conference call. I’m joined in Houston this morning by other members of our leadership team, including Gary Packer, Terry Rathert, Bill Schneider, Brian Rickmers, John Jasek, Steve Campbell, and then we’ve got our Mid-Continent and Denver offices with George Dunn and Daryll Howard connected as well.
Last night we published our fourth quarter financial results and detailed operations update. Since I’m certain you have viewed these at this point, I will focus the majority of our time this morning on our plans for 2010 and how we plan to continue our focus on becoming a bigger, stronger and more profitable company. As you’ve come to expect, we will keep today’s call brief and leave ample time for your specific questions at the end.
Today’s call, there are main topics that I plan to cover. First, we will review our 2009 highlights and offer some insights into how we are approaching our business going into 2010. Second, we will detail our capital investment program for 2010. It’s important that you understand which projects are rising to the top of our portfolio of investment choices.
And third, I’ll wrap up with some details on our recent acquisition of assets from TXCO Resources and our 2010 plans to create value from them. We are very excited about the potential we see in this vast acreage position in the Maverick Basin, and this transaction certainly fits with our vision of where we are headed as a company.
Let’s start with the highlights. If required to pick just one highlight for 2009, I’d say it was improved capital and resource allocation. We funded the right projects in 2009 and proved that we could grow within cash flow, or simply stated, do more with less. The backdrop in commodities in the financial markets forced us to make some tough capital choices early in the year. As a result, we shifted our investment dollars to our highest return growth areas.
These decisions coupled with lower service costs and the deferral of some planned activities into future periods allowed us to repay nearly $200 million in bank debt. We were also able to add several new projects that better position us for the future. It should be apparent to our investors today are both the merits of having a diversified portfolio and having it underwritten by quality assets.
Since I don’t have to pick just one, I’ll give you few other highlights as well. Our fourth quarter and full year financial results were released last night. Throughout 2009, we exceeded First Call estimates and delivered on our production promises while reducing costs and expenses. The details are all included in today’s release, and I don’t plan to cover our financials in this call. We will be happy to take any questions at the end.
Our 2009 production increased 9% to 257 Bcf. As promised, our full-year 2009 production was in the upper half of our 250 Bcf to 260 Bcf equivalent forecast, despite the fact that we voluntarily curtailed 3 Bcf in the third quarter of 2009 with low natural gas prices. In addition, we deferred completions in the second half of the year on approximately 25 wells in the Mid-Continent that would have landed us well above 260 Bcf for 2009.
Our proved reserves grew 23% in 2009 and our reserve life index was lengthened 14 years. It’s also worth pointing out that despite very low gas prices, we grow our proved developed reserves by 4% as well. We issued a separate release yesterday, which details our year-end reserves. In summary, we added 1.4 Tcf of new reserves before revisions. About half of the additions were related to new SEC reporting rules. Our reported F&D costs were about $1.50 per Mcf equivalent. And we had a total of 374 Bcf equivalent of total revisions, the largest portion of which are price-related due to a significant drop in gas prices year-over-year.
Another important highlight, we added more than 500,000 net acres in domestic resource plays during the last six months. That is a telling statistic and offers a pretty clear roadmap as to where we are headed. These are our plays of the future. The largest transaction was our acquisition of assets from TXCO Resources, which closed last week. We captured over 300,000 net acres in the emerging Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shales. I’ll have more to say on this at the end of the call.
We also entered with Marcellus through a 2009 agreement with Hess Corporation. We now have interest in about 35,000 net acres in the Marcellus and are actively looking for attractive opportunities throughout the entirety of the play. We use our knowledge base from the Williston Basin and expand it into the geologically similar play in the Southern Alberta Basin and the Northern Montana.
Our recent transaction with the Blackfeet Nation adds about 156,000 net acres and increases our total position to about 220,000 net acres in Glacier County, Montana. We are targeting the oil-bearing Bakken, Three Forks and Lodgepole formations. We will test this acreage beginning in mid-2010.
In our maturing resource plays, which include the Granite Wash, Woodford Shale, and Monument Butte, we had some impressive highlights in 2009 as well. In the Granite Wash, we applied what we have learned in the Woodford and drilled our first horizontal wells. The results have far exceeded our early expectations.
In last night’s release, we disclosed results from six additional horizontal completions with production rates averaging about 20 million cubic feet a day. In the Woodford, we proved our ability to drill super-extended laterals and have now drilled 11 SXLs with lateral lengths as long as 10,000 feet. At year-end ‘09, the Woodford comprised more than half of our total company reserves.
Our operated Woodford production continues to reach new heights, and our recent feet rate was 329 million a day gross or about 191 million cubic feet a day net. A fun fact, it was less than five years ago that we first added the word Woodford in a public setting. This is a great play that continues to get better quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year.
In Monument Butte, the 2009 headline was clearly the early success we had in extending the legacy field north onto our Ute Tribal acreage. After drilling 75 wells, we are very encouraged by the well results. Recent wells have production rates that range from 100 to 1,500 barrels of oil per day. And many of the wells are performing significantly better than the 65 to 80 barrels of oil per day common throughout the main field area.
We have two rigs running on the acreage today, as we plan to continue to expand our field to the north. If we only develop the Ute acreage on 40-acre space, then this could be more than 1,000 high return drilling locations. Monument Butte is our company’s largest oil asset and it has material reserve and value upsides.
We made two significant offshore exploration discoveries during 2009; one in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and one in China’s Pearl River Mouth Basin. Although we are allocating far less capital these days to traditional prospect-based exploration, we think it remains important to continue to explore. We expect to invest about 10% of our annual budget in high potential exploration, and we have additional prospects to test in both of these regions in 2010. The development (inaudible) and Pearl will add significant gas and oil production growth in the 2011, 2012 timeframe.
There are other highlights that time precludes us from covering in today’s short call. Please reference our @NFX Publication on our website for additional details.
I’d like to focus the remainder of the call on our future and where we are headed as an organization. In today’s release, we announced a 2010 capital budget of $1.6 billion, including capitalized cost. This excludes our recent $215 million acquisition from TXCO and includes about $100 million of planned investments in these assets in 2010. In setting our budget, cash flow was our governor. Had TXCO closed in 2009, we could have funded the entirety of the acquisition within our 2009 capital budget.
When you look at 2009 and 2010 investments together, we expect that our total capital investments will be within cash flow. But let me clear. We are committed to setting our investments around cash flow. We expect that our investments will lead to production growth of 8% to 12% in 2010.
On a Bcf equivalent basis, that’s 278 Bcf to 288 Bcf equivalent. I’m confident that Newfield’s portfolio of assets is capable of delivering double-digit growth for years to come, just from the assets we already have in place today. We have certainly come a long way from the days when our proved reserve life index was less than five years.
In 2010, we will invest approximately $1 billion in domestic resources plays of scale. That’s nearly two-thirds of our total planned budget. Approximately 35% of the budget will be directed to oil plays. We continue to direct investments in favor of oil whenever possible and have the luxury of a portfolio with quality opportunities to do so.
More than half of our 2010 revenues are expected to come from oil. Approximately 40% of our 2010 budget will be directed to the Mid-Continent, substantially all going into the Woodford and Granite Wash foundational gas assets. These are our assets that are going to carry us into the future. We are benefiting from efficiency gains, and both are capable of sustained double-digit growth. Combined, we are looking for about 25% growth from our operated production from these plays in 2010.
In the Woodford, our efficiency gains are allowing us to do more with less. We expect to run 16 operated rigs in 2010. Although we are running fewer rigs than in 2009, the program is expected to result in the delivery of about 330,000 feet of completed lateral. When you compare this statistic to 2007 when we averaged an annual high of 13 operated rigs in the play and delivered just 225,000 feet of lateral, you can clearly see that our drilling operations are more efficient today.
Our average lateral length in the Woodford in 2010 is expected to be about 6,000 feet compared to 5,000 feet last year, 4,000 feet in 2008, and just 2,500 feet in the 2006/2007 timeframe. Please see the chart detailing these statistics in our @NFX Publication.
Moving to the Anadarko Basin, the Granite Wash, combined superior economics in running room and it will see continued emphasis in our portfolio. We expect to run a four-rig program in the play in 2010 and drill about 20 wells. We are assessing new areas of our field and establishing an accurate count of our future development locations, which today numbers about 250.
Nearly 25% of our 2010 budget will be allocated to the Rocky Mountains. More specifically, our development of the Monument Butte asset and our ongoing assessment and development work in the Williston Basin, and assessment work in the Southern Alberta Basin. We have recently increased our operated rig count in Monument Butte to five rigs, up from just three rigs a year ago.
Increased demand for black wax is evident in both our term sales and enterprising differentials. We now have term sales in place on nearly 100% of our expected 2010 volumes and nearly half of our 2011 volumes. We expect that a five-rig program will grow our Monument Butte volumes by 15% in 2010.
With the early successes on the 63,000 net acre Ute Tribal areas, it’s clear that this asset has lots of running room and potential for increased activity. We are doing everything that we can to expedite permits from the BLM and to work with our area refiners on increased capacity for this high-quality crude. Stay tuned as the year progresses.
In the Williston Basin, we have increased our operated rig count from one rig a year ago to three rigs today. We have an inventory of about 80 or so locations that are drill-ready in our development areas along the Nesson Anticline. Two rigs will be dedicated to development drilling while the third will continue to assess the early successes that we’ve had west of the Nesson.
In last night’s release, we disclosed our highest low rates to date, and today we are targeting better locations and optimizing our completions. We expect to drill 30 to 35 wells in the Williston Basin in 2010, and our production should grow about 40% year-over-year. In the Southern Alberta Basin, we plan to drill up to eight assessment wells with the first expected to spud by mid-year.
Moving to the Gulf of Mexico and international arena, these areas will comprise about 25% of our budget in 2010. Our activity here is largely concentrated on adding volumes from in-hand developments. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have five field developments underway that provide meaningful visible growth over the course of the next four years. In @NFX today you will find an update on these developments. In addition, we will be drilling three exploration wells, two of which will spud in the next few days.
Our international investments are focused on our oil development projects offshore China and Malaysia. Our net production at year-end 2009 was approximately 20,000 barrels a day. That was up 40% over 2008. We are currently benefiting from investments that we made in this region in 2006 to 2008 timeframe. Although our international production will decrease in 2010, it will be up significantly in the 2011, 2012 timeframe with Newfield developments coming online.
Our onshore Texas region will comprise about 10% of our total budget in 2010. A majority of this investment will go towards the acreage that we recently acquired from TXCO, which brings me to the final segment in today’s call. Last Thursday, we closed on our 215 million acquisition of assets from TXCO resources. As you know, TXCO was in bankruptcy in the road to closing spanned [ph] several months.
This was a true team effort, and both the technical staff and our legal team worked very hard to ensure that we’ve made it to closing. This large transaction marks our entry into Eagle Ford Shale and Maverick Basin of South Texas. We are excited about the tremendous opportunities that we see in this vast acreage position.
Over the last 12 months, we have significantly reduced our activities in conventional exploration plays in South Texas, electing to shift our capital toward material plays of scale in our portfolio. Throughout 2009, our onshore team was focused not only on maximizing the value of our existing property base, but also transforming itself by identifying plays of the future.
The Eagle Ford Shale, the Maverick Basin, and TXCO itself were specifically targeted in early 2009. So when the TXCO opportunity presented itself, we jumped on it. This acquisition allows us to apply core competencies we have developed across the organization as well as an asset base with lots of running room and upside.
Newfield has a proven history of creating value through similar transactions, and I would reference our EEX Corporation transaction in 2002 and the Inland Resources Monument Butte transaction in 2004 as relevant recent examples. So what did we buy? We now have more than 300,000 highly prospective net acres in Maverick and Dimmit counties, Texas.
Just saying 300,000 acres understates the value that we see in this acreage. We have multi-play, stacked potential on our acreage, and our ideas range, and formations in the gas window through the wet gas window and onto oil. Prospective targets range from 5,000 to 10,000 feet in the Austin Chalk, Eagle Ford Shale, Georgetown, Glen Rose formations, and Pearsall Shale.
All of these are known oil and gas producers, and recent industry successes in the Eagle Ford and Pearsall are extending the trend north and west. This acquisition also brings current production of about 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 90% of which is in the Maverick Basin and 60% of which is oil.
The acreage is vast. In fact, it’s more than 300,000 net acres and has a larger net acreage footprint than our Monument Butte, Woodford Shale, and Granite Wash plays combined. The chance to capture large contiguous position in an oil and gas from a state like Texas doesn’t come around very often. I’m very confident that we will continue to find additional opportunities in this acreage set, even beyond those we can see and contemplate today.
Our 2010 plans here are aggressive. We will immediately go to work on this acreage and we will invest more than $100 million in 2010. We expect to be running at least three operated rigs here by summer. Our early efforts will be primarily focused on three primary targets; the Eagle Ford and Pearsall shales and the Georgetown formation.
We have 300,000 net acres prospective for Eagle Ford. Our interest is greater than 90% or more than 300,000 acres in the Eagle Ford. By June, we expect that multiple rigs run in to assess this potential. Recent successes around us provide early encouragement as to the potential of our acreage. We plan to drill at least 12 wells in 2010 in the Eagle Ford, and we will test the formation in multiple depths, prospective for both gas and oil. We will apply our experiences in horizontal drilling and completions in the Woodford and Granite Wash, which will accelerate and compress the learning curve.
We have 167,000 net acres prospective for Pearsall Shale. Mid-summer we will kick off an assessment drilling program in the over-pressured Pearsall. Recent industry wells have been very encouraging, with lateral lengths pushing 5,000 feet or more. Our early drilling will focus on science, collecting data that will help us to better evaluate our average and select future locations. We expect to drill two to four wells in the Pearsall in 2010.
Our main goal for the Georgetown drilling program is clear, add cash flow. We expect to drill about a dozen wells in 2010, and that program is already underway. This formation is prospective for oil and gas across much of our acreage positions.
So this is a very competitive area today. That’s about all I want to say at this point. But I hope you will take away from the call is the fact we have multiple geologic opportunities in this vast acreage position. We have proven people to exploit it that are extremely excited about the opportunity that we have in front of us today. I look forward to reporting on our progress throughout the year.
Before we take your questions, let me reiterate one more time where we are headed in 2010 and beyond. We will continue to focus on domestic resource plays of scale. About two-thirds of our planned 2010 investments are about $1 billion, will be allocated to this portion of our portfolio.
We have projects and plays in hand today to deliver sustainable, visible future growth, and we intend to develop them using our cash flow as a guide. We will continue to allocate capital wisely. There will always be cycles in our business. We believe that our diverse portfolio of assets provides us with flexibility and investment choices that a single commodity-focused company can’t match.
And finally, we will maintain our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity levels. Our 2010 and 2011 hedge positions allow us to sleep pretty well these days. Our number one goal in 2010 will be to execute and continue to deliver on our commitments. I’m confident that we have the people and the assets to get it done.
Thanks for your investment in our company. We’ll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator?

So (inaudible) is certainly something we’ve looked at. We’ve quantified that. But I think it’s really round-off at the end of the day as far as what it could affect us in 2010. And then if we still see long-term low natural gas prices, we certainly think that’s going to take the edge off of any inflationary pressure we’d see.

I think as we communicated in this call, we’re seeing some surprisingly increased rates up there. In general, we think about Monument Butte proper in the waterflood portion of an average well being about 75,000 barrels or so. As we moved up into the tribal acreage position, we’re seeing improved primary production from these wells. And I think a number that we’ve thrown around, and this is very early days, we only have 75 wells drilled, being somewhere around 70,000 barrels. So clearly we’re seeing something a little better on the front end of these wells. Historically, we’ve thought that there may be some enhanced fracturing that exists up to the north. And also recall, as we get further and further away from the historical production, we may be seeing a little better reservoir pressure and maybe some improved rock properties up there. So it’s early days. But I’d tell you we’re quite surprise and it is exceeding our early expectations.

So the location itself could be a little bit misleading. The way we look at it when we talk about our foundational growth assets, kind of the test, the tale of the tape, as you got to be able to contribute to predictable, sustainable growth out through the next decade, so ten years. And I would tell you that when we talk about Woodford, Granite Wash and Monument Butte, without even getting into what we are going to talk about in terms of the tribal acreage, each of those foundational assets has an inventory capable at current drilling rates to drill out through the next decade. So that’s the first step for us.
In terms of thinking about the potential, we will provide additional color I guess as the year unfolds. We are watching things kind of like you are in terms of how the information is rolling off the tape. We are limited in terms of the SEC to a five-year inventory in terms of our proved and developed locations. And we’re going to go ahead and hold to that. So the proved reserves that we’ve got out there have a five-year inventory. We’ve got additional reserves behind that that would come in and replace those as that inventory has been drilled up over the course of the next five years. I think that’s probably the best I can do today in terms of color, and there will be more to come out as the year unfolds.

We actually can probably deliver about 25% of the acreage with the standup 640s under super-extended laterals.

Hopefully, we can get that approved at some point in the next couple of years and be able to properly exploit those assets. And that would take us to a third of the acreage.

But I would say we’ve had some great success, and statistically it is performing better than we see down in the field proper.

On Monday, we published the detailed operations report. This release carried lots of information about each of our focus areas. But more importantly, we announced a reallocation of our capital budget to allow for increased investments in all the projects in 2010. Newfield has real oil projects in its portfolio today, delivering real results. These projects are meaningful and offer us the ability to combine production growth and profitability. There are benefits to a diverse portfolio, and we fully intend to continue using these to our advantage to deliver value to our shareholders. Let me briefly summarize the most significant steps we are taking.
We plan to invest $700 million or about 45% of our 2010 budget on oil projects. These are projects we have in hand today. Keep in mind, our initial shift to oil actually began months ago as we accelerated development drilling in Malaysia, added rigs in Monument Butte and the Williston Basin at year end and significantly increased our natural gas hedges to protect returns. You are seeing the benefits of these positions in our guidance today. 
Second, we expect our domestic oil volumes to grow about 20% in 2010, with the most significant drivers being Monument Butte, Malaysia and the Williston Basin. I'll spend more time on this call discussing our improved outlook for Monument Butte growth. 
Third, our foundational gas assets are held by production and give us great flexibility in our investment timing. We plan to reduce our active rig count in the Woodford from the current pace of eight rigs to a 2010 exit of around four to five rigs. With continued great results from our Super Extended Laterals, we still expect that Woodford production should grow 20% in 2010. So when you combine all of the above, we expect that our production for 2010 will be more oily and will land in the upper half of our beginning-of-year guidance. We expect to grow at least 10% in 2010.
Last night, we published our first quarter financial results. From a financial reporting standpoint, it was a very simple quarter. Pre-FAS 133, we earned $1.19 per share, surpassing First Call estimates due primarily to lower operating expenses in the quarter. In yesterday's earnings release, we provided enhanced guidance for the remainder of the year, showing our second quarter expectations, as well as full year expectation for various metrics helpful in your modeling and analysis. As always, we'll be happy to take your questions at the end of the call.
The call today will be very brief, and our comments will be focused around three main topics. First, the benefits of a diverse portfolio. Although there are times that it would be fashionable to be 100% gas or 100% oil, we think that having a diverse and balanced portfolio to invest in at the appropriate times is the best formula to create long-term value. Second, I want to spotlight our in-hand oil projects that will drive top-tier production growth within cash flow in 2010 and 2011. The cornerstone of this program is Monument Butte, and the recent results from our Rockies teams are excellent. And finally, I'll quickly cover our planned activities in the new exploration areas that we are hopeful could become a play of the future for Newfield.
Many of you have visited our headquarters and regional offices and have seen our founding business principles prominently displayed in our lobbies. We talked often about these, and they are ingrained in our DNA. One of those principles is balance. And to us, that means a lot of things: balance between exploration and development, between onshore and offshore, conventional and unconventional. But perhaps the most important today is a balance between oil assets and gas assets. This is a great time to have oil opportunities to invest in. 
For some time, we've had a view that oil was good, and that we needed a solid representation in oil plays, both in the U.S. and in Southeast Asia. In 2004, we took two large steps on our path to transforming Newfield. We entered the shallow water arena in Malaysia, and we acquired the giant Monument Butte field in Utah. The time the Monument Butte acquisition, the field was producing about 7,000 barrels a day, and oil was about $30 per barrel. Today, both field production and oil prices have nearly tripled. This was a great acquisition and is the cornerstone of our domestic oil production growth. 
We're investing more in our oil projects today because it's the right economic choice. We're able to slower growth in gas developments and accelerate our oil plays. Our 2010 domestic oil production is now expected to grow about 20% over 2009 volumes. Because we are shifting more investments to oil early in the year, this will have a positive impact on our 2011 oil volumes as well. 
We have the flexibility to shift capital today because we have a very limited drilling obligations to hold our acreage and our gas plays. In the Woodford and Granite Wash plays, substantially all our acreage is held by production. Simply running one rig in the Woodford in 2010 and 2011 will keep us from losing any acreage. We're in a great position to let economics guide our drilling decisions, not lease expirations. Let's talk about the oil assets that are contributing to our growth today.
Monument Butte. What a great asset. We recently set a production record at the Monument Butte field of just under 20,000 barrels per day. 19,900 barrels, to be specific. That's up nearly 3,000 barrels a day since year-end 2009. We are combining improved drilling performance and higher production rates from recent wells drilled on our Ute Tribal acreage. We now estimate that our Monument Butte production will grow 20% in 2010, stronger than our beginning-of-year guidance of 15%. We talk often about Monument Butte, and one of the most common questions has been why can't you grow production at a faster pace. Well, today, we can. There's an increased demand for Black Wax from area refiners, and refining capacity expansions allow for more production. We comprise more than 50% of the Black Wax capacity in the region and are clearly the one capable of sizable future growth. Our 2010 production is sold under term sales, and 87% of our 2011 production is now termed. Current differentials are about $13 below NYMEX and remember, that includes around $6 of transportation expense.
Along with good demand, we have exemplary drilling performance in the field. Our drilling personnel are setting new records in days to depth. We recently drilled a well in three and a half days. Year-to-date, we are averaging four and a half days compared to a 2009 average of five and a half days. Today, our five-rig program is the efficient equivalent of running eight rigs back in 2006. We call these incremental rigs, virtual rigs, and their impact is showing up in our volumes today. We now expect that a five-rig program will allow us to drill more than 350 wells in 2010, up from earlier expectations of 275. An average well here costs about $800,000 to drill and complete. Monument Butte field level production is expected to exit 2010 at about 25,000 barrels of oil per day, and we expect to have very strong oil growth here in 2011 as well.
Our results in the Ute Tribal acreage continue to exceed original expectations, with higher early production rates and good drilling performance. This area covers 63,000 net acres immediately north and adjacent to our Monument Butte field. Over the last two years, we've drilled more than 125 wells in this acreage and are quickly assessing its potential. We believe we have more than 1,000 development locations in front of us on this acreage at 40-acre spacing and double that if the fields ultimately develop on 20s, like Monument Butte properties is today. Our interests on the Ute Tribal acreage runs about 70%. In total, we estimate there are approximately 4,700 development drilling locations remaining in the Monument Butte field area. 
Moving on to the Williston Basin, this is our second largest growth region in the Rockies where we have about 400,000 net acres, about half of which is currently in active development or appraisal. In our operations released Monday, we provided results from several recent development wells in our Westberg and Lost Bear development areas along the Nesson Anticline. Recent wells include our highest initial production rates achieved to date. 
Our Williston Basin production is expected to increase at least 40% in 2010. Our two most recent wells had initial production of more than 3,300 barrels of oil per day and a 30-day average production of more than 1,100 barrels of oil per day. Our team is clearly lining, and we have optimized our drilling and completion operations. We expect to drill 30 to 35 wells in the Williston Basin in 2010 and may elect to add an additional rig here later in the year. 
We have approximately 100,000 acres that are located west of the Nesson Anticline. To date, we've drilled three successful wells here, and they are online and producing today. We are encouraged by their success and plan to drill additional wells in these areas in 2010. Industry successes around our acreage provide encouragement, and we hope to have a more thorough update for you later this year.
Moving on now to Malaysia. This is one of our major oil-producing regions. We are benefiting today from investments made over the last several years to develop shallow water oil fields. In April, our productions had a gross record of 45,000 barrels of oil per day and which translates to about 20,000 barrels a day, net. The recent increase is due to higher-than-planned production volumes from the operated development at East Belumut and Chermingat, both located in the shallow water block PM 323. The increase has not happened since. 
In the second half of 2009, we accelerated by six months the timing of six planned development wells at East Belumut. Because of better drilling performance, we were able to drill a total of seven development wells during the time allotted for the rig and for the same budgeted amount for the original six wells in the program. This moved our East Belumut production to more than 24,000 barrels of oil per day gross, and we expect to maintain this level throughout the year. And importantly, we're utilizing our horizontal drilling and completions expertise internationally as well. 
So the bottom line is this: We had originally estimated Malaysia would decline in 2010 by about 18% due to natural field depletion. Our improved performance at East Belumut reduces this decline to less than half this amount. This is a great time to have the extra oil production coming out of Southeast Asia, and hats off to our team there who's doing a great job. 
Emphasis on the future. I'll remind you that we've added more than 500,000 net acres in domestic resource plays in the fourth quarter of '09, now through the early portion of 2010. It's important that we not lose sight of the future and that we continue to invest in plays that have a chance to be the next Monument Butte field or the next Woodford Shale. These are our plays of the future. 
The Maverick Basin. Important asset. We entered here earlier this year and closed an acquisition that brought to us more than 300,000 prospective net acres in Maverick and Dimmit Counties. We're very encouraged by the potential of our acreage and believe it will prove to be analogous to recent success being reported elsewhere in the play. We have a very thorough evaluation plan, and we'll know a lot more in late 2010. 
Beginning in June, we'll begin a multi-rig program to assess the Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shale formations, as well as other oil formations that are in perspective across the acreage. We plan to invest more than $100 million to drill about 25 wells in 2010 to assess the newly acquired acreage. We plan to test the Eagle Ford formation at multiple depths perspective for both gas and oil. Recent successes around us provide early encouragement as to the potential on our acreage, and we look forward to reporting on our progress later this year.
Moving north to the Southern Alberta Basin, we captured about 224,000 net acres of what we think is an area that has a potential to be a Williston Basin and Bakken look-alike. Our prospective formations of the Lodgepole, Middle Bakken, Sanish and the deeper Nisku. We spud our first well in a few days, waiting on a rig and expect to drill approximately eight wells here in the second half of the year. Depending on success, our activity levels here could be expanded in late 2010 or 2011. 
It is important that we also work to maintain a momentum in our gas plays. In the Monday operations release, we provided a good update on our foundational gas assets in the Mid-Continent, the Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash plays. We continue to drill Super Extended Laterals in the Woodford with lateral lines of about 9,000 feet and initial production rates averaging 9 million cubic feet per day. We are reducing our planned investments in the Woodford to allow for reallocation of capital to the oil plays we outlined moments ago. Despite the reduction in planned development drilling and capital, we still expect the Woodford Shale to grow 20% in 2010. In the Granite Wash, we continue to have excellent results on this play, and our current phase of four rigs will continue through the rest of 2010. More than half of our planned wells in the remainder of the year will be in the condensate-rich formations in the Granite Wash.
It's important also that we maintain healthy activity levels on our gas plays, but growth for growth's sake is not good business and certainly not Newfield business, particularly given the fact that we have alternative wall investments with better returns in today's market. But good momentum in our gas plays keeps our team sharp, constantly striving for new efficiency gains. We will continue to reap these benefits. There will come a time when increased investments in growth and gas plays are wanted economically, and Newfield will remain in a position to instantly ramp up our activities. 
As promised, we kept today's call short. This concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to take your questions at this time."

As we move in to the Rocky Mountains, Monument Butte is essentially all HBP. And the agreements that we have with the Ute Indian Tribe and our various joint ventures have very reasonable requirements that we're far ahead of exceeding. So there's no HBP issues there. As we step out of there into the Williston Basin, we have quite a bit term on our Southern Alberta positions there, on a majority of that acreage. So let's just say we're in probably a three- to five-year zip code on the majority of that. As we step over into the Williston Basin, that's the area that -- if there is an area that we need to make sure that we keep a healthy level of activity up to hold our acreage position, it would be there. Certainly, it's opportunistic at this time with oil prices where they are and elevating activity, we're able to hold our acreage position there on all of the appraisal and development areas. And that's typically in this three- to five-rig program. We see no issues there. Onshore, in the Maverick Basin, we have the $100 million investment that we have scheduled there this year. And our plans forward meet all of the requirements that we have for any lease maintenance issues there. So overall, we're sitting very comfortable with where we're at right now, and it really lends itself to our ability to allocate capital back and forth between areas."

And those wells primarily target the same Green River formations that we're playing in Monument Butte. They're a little deeper. Despite being a little thinner overall, we're seeing good pressure in the formations. And they appear to be a little bit better fractured than we see at the South, and we're actually seeing the benefits of that in our EURs. As far as the drilling efficiencies, it's pretty remarkable. And it's really some of the benefits we've realized by moving people around the organization. We made some changes earlier this year, some of the brave folks that came out of the Woodford went into the Rockies and working with our teams there. We've made mechanical enhancements to the rigs that we're employing there. We've added electronic monitoring of all our drilling parameters, consistent with maybe some of the more higher-tech rigs or offshore rigs. By having all this data available to it, we're analyzing it, and we've installed auto drillers in all the rigs. And we're able to maintain very precise drilling requirements on weight on bit, rotary speed, differential pressures, things like that. As a result of those small steps, we're seeing remarkable changes in the drilling efficiency. In combination with that, we further advanced working with some of the bit designers, some customized PDC bits that really performing quite well in these areas. And when we talk about these changes, you referenced, Dave, over the last year, I can tell you it's probably over the last three months we're seeing these changes."

Clearly, a portion of our performance is probably tied up in completion gains, normal learning.

Clearly we're, I think, anxious about the midterm for natural gas. We've seen, in other operators as well as ourselves, continued drilling efficiencies we've been talking about all morning, and what that means is lower and lower cost to develop reserves in these large resource spaces. That just signals to me that we could be in a commodity price environment that isn't very robust, and the forward curve gives us the opportunity to put some positions in place that begin to assure cash flow in those periods of time, which we know we can maintain a level of activity, continue to underpin growth. So philosophically, we're still I'd say predominantly 18 to 24 month horizon hedgers with 1/3 of our production in the market, 1/3 with a fixed price and 1/3, some type of a floor. So we can participate in 2/3 the upside and protect against 2/3 downside.

As you're well aware, we're the only company that's come out to my knowledge domestically and put our probable numbers out there in our financial reports. Part of the reasons we did that was to allow transparency in how we moved reserves between proved and probable as our activity shifted between areas. And I think this year is a perfect example as we see ourselves reallocating capital from gas to oil. What you will see is really no change in the overall 2P number other than what we add externally through the projects. And because of the five-year PUD rule, you'll see areas that were historically gas could back off on a proved basis, but stay whole on a 2P basis on which in the oil areas such as Monument Butte and others, you ought to see that same increase associated there and sort of redeploy the capital. All in all, it ought to be an NAV proved basis increase as we move more to oil and less out of gas. I guess coming back to your original question as it relates to the Mid-Continent, as you're probably aware -- and your numbers are in the right zip code, probably a little over 300 wells originally in there on a proved basis. I think it's safe to say that we have a similar number of wells that are technically proved that are actually sitting out there in probable just because of the PUD rule. So there ought to be, for the investment community, a high degree of confidence in the numbers that we see and are very comfortable with technically proved in the Woodford Shale. And we'll just see a little bit of noise that we've been very transparent in as we allocate monies back and forth between those."

And we've been very careful to try keep people from getting focused on individual well accounts or individual well types. And you can look at the Woodford as a great example at just how much a well has been modified over time. So we think about reserves. Our reserves on the books, I'll remind you that anything that showed up in the 2P reserves at year end 2009 had a $3.87 stress test. That's what I take comfort in, and that's what you ought to be thinking about when you're looking at portfolios. To give you a number, I think the number from memory, in terms of the probable component associated with the Woodford, is a number just over 800 Bs. So that didn't show up in the proved overs. It's just over 800 Bs or somewhere in that zip code. That's about $1.50. And in terms of F&Ds, if that's the way to think about the reserves and the economics, if you follow up with Steve, he can give you some additional color. You can go back to the 10-K. There's a pretty good description, I believe, in their. And on the overall acreage count, as far exposure to super extended laterals, we've talked about 25% to 33% of the acreage depending upon how some of the unit activities work out in Oklahoma, and those numbers still hold today. But I would be very careful with well counts. We can talk to you about reserves, and we'll give you some color on how all that fits together. But that's probably about all we can do today."

And generically, we've talked about 1,000 of those being up in the tribal areas on 40s. Now this is very early to talk about spacing and so forth. And the Ute's is pretty premature at this point. On the comingling, I'm not really following the question in that in these vertical wells, we go ahead and we comingle virtually all of the zones. Occasionally, we'll leave some out, and we'll come back in and add them later. But in the Green River formations, the vertical wells, then we typically conduct about five or six comingled fracs on a normal basis. Now occasionally, we'll encounter a Wasatch formation.

If we can continue to drive the natural gas cost down in the Woodford and commodity prices change a little bit, then you dramatically change the profitability. So it's a function, not just price but what is the cost. Today, we're seeing a rush to oil patch, literally, of rigs in activity. That could well translate into increased service costs, which would change the margin despite what commodity prices do to bring the two closer to alignment. I think it's a hard question to say what would they need to do, et cetera. But what I can tell you is we look at that almost on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And the majority of our activity is not term or obligations, but it's options. And we have the ability to in very, very short period of time shift those resources both capital and human resources to the thing that is most profitable. So we look at it on a regular basis. All the activity we talked about this morning I mean it shifted in some $200 million around here in the first couple of months of 2010. We did the same thing last year. If we need to, we can shift it back in a couple of months. We'll just be very opportunistic based upon what the margins are. It's really a margin question as compared to a commodity price question."

The vertical production we've seen in that area, out of those wells, exceed anything we were able to do in the early days of Stiles/Britt Ranch out in the Granite Wash play for a point of reference. So we're very excited about the potential there. And we've described it, without putting an absolute number on it, we said it's a multi-Tcf potential. It's in inventory, and the best part of it, it's held by production. So we have no compelling need to drill the well in 2010. And with our shift to oil, frankly we see it as a distraction and a low gas price market. We continue to be very excited about that potential, and it's one of many opportunities we've got in the portfolio to accelerate gas activity when the margins and the economics are favorable in that environment.

The condensate is 6:1 added to the gas, and we've reported all our production on MMcf equivalent basis. It is high Btu gas. The shallower sections approach 13,000 Btus, as I recall.

On Monday, we published the detailed operations report. This release carried lots of information about each of our focus areas. But more importantly, we announced a reallocation of our capital budget to allow for increased investments in all the projects in 2010. Newfield has real oil projects in its portfolio today, delivering real results. These projects are meaningful and offer us the ability to combine production growth and profitability. There are benefits to a diverse portfolio, and we fully intend to continue using these to our advantage to deliver value to our shareholders. Let me briefly summarize the most significant steps we are taking.
We plan to invest $700 million or about 45% of our 2010 budget on oil projects. These are projects we have in hand today. Keep in mind, our initial shift to oil actually began months ago as we accelerated development drilling in Malaysia, added rigs in Monument Butte and the Williston Basin at year end and significantly increased our natural gas hedges to protect returns. You are seeing the benefits of these positions in our guidance today. 
Second, we expect our domestic oil volumes to grow about 20% in 2010, with the most significant drivers being Monument Butte, Malaysia and the Williston Basin. I'll spend more time on this call discussing our improved outlook for Monument Butte growth. 
Third, our foundational gas assets are held by production and give us great flexibility in our investment timing. We plan to reduce our active rig count in the Woodford from the current pace of eight rigs to a 2010 exit of around four to five rigs. With continued great results from our Super Extended Laterals, we still expect that Woodford production should grow 20% in 2010. So when you combine all of the above, we expect that our production for 2010 will be more oily and will land in the upper half of our beginning-of-year guidance. We expect to grow at least 10% in 2010.
Last night, we published our first quarter financial results. From a financial reporting standpoint, it was a very simple quarter. Pre-FAS 133, we earned $1.19 per share, surpassing First Call estimates due primarily to lower operating expenses in the quarter. In yesterday's earnings release, we provided enhanced guidance for the remainder of the year, showing our second quarter expectations, as well as full year expectation for various metrics helpful in your modeling and analysis. As always, we'll be happy to take your questions at the end of the call.
The call today will be very brief, and our comments will be focused around three main topics. First, the benefits of a diverse portfolio. Although there are times that it would be fashionable to be 100% gas or 100% oil, we think that having a diverse and balanced portfolio to invest in at the appropriate times is the best formula to create long-term value. Second, I want to spotlight our in-hand oil projects that will drive top-tier production growth within cash flow in 2010 and 2011. The cornerstone of this program is Monument Butte, and the recent results from our Rockies teams are excellent. And finally, I'll quickly cover our planned activities in the new exploration areas that we are hopeful could become a play of the future for Newfield.
Many of you have visited our headquarters and regional offices and have seen our founding business principles prominently displayed in our lobbies. We talked often about these, and they are ingrained in our DNA. One of those principles is balance. And to us, that means a lot of things: balance between exploration and development, between onshore and offshore, conventional and unconventional. But perhaps the most important today is a balance between oil assets and gas assets. This is a great time to have oil opportunities to invest in. 
For some time, we've had a view that oil was good, and that we needed a solid representation in oil plays, both in the U.S. and in Southeast Asia. In 2004, we took two large steps on our path to transforming Newfield. We entered the shallow water arena in Malaysia, and we acquired the giant Monument Butte field in Utah. The time the Monument Butte acquisition, the field was producing about 7,000 barrels a day, and oil was about $30 per barrel. Today, both field production and oil prices have nearly tripled. This was a great acquisition and is the cornerstone of our domestic oil production growth. 
We're investing more in our oil projects today because it's the right economic choice. We're able to slower growth in gas developments and accelerate our oil plays. Our 2010 domestic oil production is now expected to grow about 20% over 2009 volumes. Because we are shifting more investments to oil early in the year, this will have a positive impact on our 2011 oil volumes as well. 
We have the flexibility to shift capital today because we have a very limited drilling obligations to hold our acreage and our gas plays. In the Woodford and Granite Wash plays, substantially all our acreage is held by production. Simply running one rig in the Woodford in 2010 and 2011 will keep us from losing any acreage. We're in a great position to let economics guide our drilling decisions, not lease expirations. Let's talk about the oil assets that are contributing to our growth today.
Monument Butte. What a great asset. We recently set a production record at the Monument Butte field of just under 20,000 barrels per day. 19,900 barrels, to be specific. That's up nearly 3,000 barrels a day since year-end 2009. We are combining improved drilling performance and higher production rates from recent wells drilled on our Ute Tribal acreage. We now estimate that our Monument Butte production will grow 20% in 2010, stronger than our beginning-of-year guidance of 15%. We talk often about Monument Butte, and one of the most common questions has been why can't you grow production at a faster pace. Well, today, we can. There's an increased demand for Black Wax from area refiners, and refining capacity expansions allow for more production. We comprise more than 50% of the Black Wax capacity in the region and are clearly the one capable of sizable future growth. Our 2010 production is sold under term sales, and 87% of our 2011 production is now termed. Current differentials are about $13 below NYMEX and remember, that includes about $6 of transportation expense.
Along with good demand, we have exemplary drilling performance in the field. Our drilling personnel are setting new records in days to depth. We recently drilled a well in three and a half days. Year-to-date, we are averaging four and a half days compared to a 2009 average of five and a half days. Today, our five-rig program is the efficient equivalent of running eight rigs back in 2006. We call these incremental rigs, virtual rigs, and their impact is showing up in our volumes today. We now expect that a five-rig program will allow us to drill more than 350 wells in 2010, up from earlier expectations of 275. An average well here costs about $800,000 to drill and complete. Monument Butte field level production is expected to exit 2010 at about 25,000 barrels of oil per day, and we expect to have very strong oil growth here in 2011 as well.
Our results in the Ute Tribal acreage continue to exceed original expectations, with higher early production rates and good drilling performance. This area covers 63,000 net acres immediately north and adjacent to our Monument Butte field. Over the last two years, we've drilled more than 125 wells in this acreage and are quickly assessing its potential. We believe we have more than 1,000 development locations in front of us on this acreage at 40-acre spacing and double that if the fields ultimately develop on 20s, like Monument Butte properties is today. Our interests on the Ute Tribal acreage runs about 70%. In total, we estimate there are approximately 4,700 development drilling locations remaining in the Monument Butte field area. 
Moving on to the Williston Basin, this is our second largest growth region in the Rockies where we have about 400,000 net acres, about half of which is currently in active development or appraisal. In our operations released Monday, we provided results from several recent development wells in our Westberg and Lost Bear development areas along the Nesson Anticline. Recent wells include our highest initial production rates achieved to date. 
Our Williston Basin production is expected to increase at least 40% in 2010. Our two most recent wells had initial production of more than 3,300 barrels of oil per day and a 30-day average production of more than 1,100 barrels of oil per day. Our team is clearly lining, and we have optimized our drilling and completion operations. We expect to drill 30 to 35 wells in the Williston Basin in 2010 and may elect to add an additional rig here later in the year. 
We have approximately 100,000 acres that are located west of the Nesson Anticline. To date, we've drilled three successful wells here, and they are online and producing today. We are encouraged by their success and plan to drill additional wells in these areas in 2010. Industry successes around our acreage provide encouragement, and we hope to have a more thorough update for you later this year.
Moving on now to Malaysia. This is one of our major oil-producing regions. We are benefiting today from investments made over the last several years to develop shallow water oil fields. In April, our productions had a gross record of 45,000 barrels of oil per day and which translates to about 20,000 barrels a day, net. The recent increase is due to higher-than-planned production volumes from the operated development at East Belumut and Chermingat, both located in the shallow water block PM 323. The increase has not happened since. 
In the second half of 2009, we accelerated by six months the timing of six planned development wells at East Belumut. Because of better drilling performance, we were able to drill a total of seven development wells during the time allotted for the rig and for the same budgeted amount for the original six wells in the program. This moved our East Belumut production to more than 24,000 barrels of oil per day gross, and we expect to maintain this level throughout the year. And importantly, we're utilizing our horizontal drilling and completions expertise internationally as well. 
So the bottom line is this: We had originally estimated Malaysia would decline in 2010 by about 18% due to natural field depletion. Our improved performance at East Belumut reduces this decline to less than half this amount. This is a great time to have the extra oil production coming out of Southeast Asia, and hats off to our team there who's doing a great job. 
Emphasis on the future. I'll remind you that we've added more than 500,000 net acres in domestic resource plays in the fourth quarter of '09, now through the early portion of 2010. It's important that we not lose sight of the future and that we continue to invest in plays that have a chance to be the next Monument Butte field or the next Woodford Shale. These are our plays of the future. 
The Maverick Basin. Important asset. We entered here earlier this year and closed an acquisition that brought to us more than 300,000 prospective net acres in Maverick and Dimmit Counties. We're very encouraged by the potential of our acreage and believe it will prove to be analogous to recent success being reported elsewhere in the play. We have a very thorough evaluation plan, and we'll know a lot more in late 2010. 
Beginning in June, we'll begin a multi-rig program to assess the Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shale formations, as well as other oil formations that are in perspective across the acreage. We plan to invest more than $100 million to drill about 25 wells in 2010 to assess the newly acquired acreage. We plan to test the Eagle Ford formation at multiple depths perspective for both gas and oil. Recent successes around us provide early encouragement as to the potential on our acreage, and we look forward to reporting on our progress later this year.
Moving north to the Southern Alberta Basin, we've captured about 224,000 net acres of what we think is an area that has a potential to be a Williston Basin and Bakken look-alike. Our prospective formations of the Lodgepole, Middle Bakken, Sanish and the deeper Nisku. We spud our first well in a few days, waiting on a rig and expect to drill approximately eight wells here in the second half of the year. Depending on success, our activity levels here could be expanded in late 2010 or 2011. 
It is important that we also work to maintain a momentum in our gas plays. In the Monday operations release, we provided a good update on our foundational gas assets in the Mid-Continent, the Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash plays. We continue to drill Super Extended Laterals in the Woodford with lateral lengths of about 9,000 feet and initial production rates averaging 9 million cubic feet per day. We are reducing our planned investments in the Woodford to allow for reallocation of capital to the oil plays we outlined moments ago. Despite the reduction in planned development drilling and capital, we still expect the Woodford Shale to grow 20% in 2010. In the Granite Wash, we continue to have excellent results on this play, and our current phase of four rigs will continue through the rest of 2010. More than half of our planned wells in the remainder of the year will be in the condensate-rich formations in the Granite Wash.
It's important also that we maintain healthy activity levels on our gas plays, but growth for growth's sake is not good business and certainly not Newfield business, particularly given the fact that we have alternative wall investments with better returns in today's market. But good momentum in our gas plays keeps our team sharp, constantly striving for new efficiency gains. We will continue to reap these benefits. There will come a time when increased investments in growth and gas plays are wanted economically, and Newfield will remain in a position to instantly ramp up our activities. 
As promised, we kept today's call short. This concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to take your questions at this time."

As we move in to the Rocky Mountains, Monument Butte is essentially all HBP. And the agreements that we have with the Ute Indian Tribe and our various joint ventures have very reasonable requirements that we're far ahead of exceeding. So there's no HBP issues there. As we step out of there into the Williston Basin, we have quite a bit term on our Southern Alberta positions there, on a majority of that acreage. So let's just say we're in probably a three- to five-year zip code on the majority of that. As we step over into the Williston Basin, that's the area that -- if there is an area that we need to make sure that we keep a healthy level of activity up to hold our acreage position, it would be there. Certainly, it's opportunistic at this time with oil prices where they are and elevating activity, we're able to hold our acreage position there on all of the appraisal and development areas. And that's typically in this three- to five-rig program. We see no issues there. Onshore, in the Maverick Basin, we have the $100 million investment that we have scheduled there this year. And our plans forward meet all of the requirements that we have for any lease maintenance issues there. So overall, we're sitting very comfortable with where we're at right now, and it really lends itself to our ability to allocate capital back and forth between areas."

And those wells primarily target the same Green River formations that we're playing in Monument Butte. They're a little deeper. Despite being a little thinner overall, we're seeing good pressure in the formations. And they appear to be a little bit better fractured than we see at the South, and we're actually seeing the benefits of that in our EURs. As far as the drilling efficiencies, it's pretty remarkable. And it's really some of the benefits we've realized by moving people around the organization. We made some changes earlier this year, some of the brave folks that came out of the Woodford went into the Rockies and working with our teams there. We've made mechanical enhancements to the rigs that we're employing there. We've added electronic monitoring of all our drilling parameters, consistent with maybe some of the more higher-tech rigs or offshore rigs. By having all this data available to it, we're analyzing it, and we've installed auto drillers in all the rigs. And we're able to maintain very precise drilling requirements on weight on bit, rotary speed, differential pressures, things like that. As a result of those small steps, we're seeing remarkable changes in the drilling efficiency. In combination with that, we further advanced working with some of the bit designers, some customized PDC bits that really performing quite well in these areas. And when we talk about these changes, you referenced, Dave, over the last year, I can tell you it's probably over the last three months we're seeing these changes."

Clearly, a portion of our performance is probably tied up in completion gains, normal learning.

Clearly we're, I think, anxious about the midterm for natural gas. We've seen, in other operators as well as ourselves, continued drilling efficiencies we've been talking about all morning, and what that means is lower and lower cost to develop reserves in these large resource spaces. That just signals to me that we could be in a commodity price environment that isn't very robust, and the forward curve gives us the opportunity to put some positions in place that begin to assure cash flow in those periods of time, which we know we can maintain a level of activity, continue to underpin growth. So philosophically, we're still I'd say predominantly 18 to 24 month horizon hedgers with 1/3 of our production in the market, 1/3 with a fixed price and 1/3, some type of a floor. So we can participate in 2/3 the upside and protect against 2/3 downside.

I guess coming back to your original question as it relates to the Mid-Continent, as you're probably aware -- and your numbers are in the right zip code, probably a little over 300 wells originally in there on a proved basis. I think it's safe to say that we have a similar number of wells that are technically proved that are actually sitting out there in probable just because of the PUD rule. So there ought to be, for the investment community, a high degree of confidence in the numbers that we see and are very comfortable with technically proved in the Woodford Shale. And we'll just see a little bit of noise that we've been very transparent in as we allocate monies back and forth between those."

And we've been very careful to try keep people from getting focused on individual well accounts or individual well types. And you can look at the Woodford as a great example at just how much a well has been modified over time. So we think about reserves. Our reserves on the books, I'll remind you that anything that showed up in the 2P reserves at year end 2009 had a $3.87 stress test. That's what I take comfort in, and that's what you ought to be thinking about when you're looking at portfolios. To give you a number, I think the number from memory, in terms of the probable component associated with the Woodford, is a number just over 800 Bs. So that didn't show up in the proved overs. It's just over 800 Bs or somewhere in that zip code. That's about $1.50. And in terms of F&Ds, if that's the way to think about the reserves and the economics, if you follow up with Steve, he can give you some additional color. You can go back to the 10-K. There's a pretty good description, I believe, in their. And on the overall acreage count, as far exposure to super extended laterals, we've talked about 25% to 33% of the acreage depending upon how some of the unit activities work out in Oklahoma, and those numbers still hold today. But I would be very careful with well counts. We can talk to you about reserves, and we'll give you some color on how all that fits together. But that's probably about all we can do today."

On the comingling, I'm not really following the question in that in these vertical wells, we go ahead and we comingle virtually all of the zones. Occasionally, we'll leave some out, and we'll come back in and add them later. But in the Green River formations, the vertical wells, then we typically conduct about five or six comingled fracs on a normal basis. Now occasionally, we'll encounter a Wasatch formation.

If we can continue to drive the natural gas cost down in the Woodford and commodity prices change a little bit, then you dramatically change the profitability. So it's a function, not just price but what is the cost. Today, we're seeing a rush to oil patch, literally, of rigs in activity. That could well translate into increased service costs, which would change the margin despite what commodity prices do to bring the two closer to alignment. I think it's a hard question to say what would they need to do, et cetera. But what I can tell you is we look at that almost on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And the majority of our activity is not term or obligations, but it's options. And we have the ability to in very, very short period of time shift those resources both capital and human resources to the thing that is most profitable. So we look at it on a regular basis. All the activity we talked about this morning I mean it shifted in some $200 million around here in the first couple of months of 2010. We did the same thing last year.

The Bakken play, in my view, is a little bit of a twin basin versus Williston. It's a little shallower and close to the thrust belt.

As far as the Monument Butte deep gas, yes, we're still excited about it. We've got half a dozen wells out there producing in the deep section. We proved that there's over 10,000 feet of gas saturated section below the Green River oil sands. The vertical production we've seen in that area, out of those wells, exceed anything we were able to do in the early days of Stiles/Britt Ranch out in the Granite Wash play for a point of reference. So we're very excited about the potential there. And we've described it, without putting an absolute number on it, we said it's a multi-Tcf potential. It's in inventory, and the best part of it, it's held by production. So we have no compelling need to drill the well in 2010. And with our shift to oil, frankly we see it as a distraction and a low gas price market. We continue to be very excited about that potential, and it's one of many opportunities we've got in the portfolio to accelerate gas activity when the margins and the economics are favorable in that environment.

As you're probably familiar with, if you think about where Glacier National Park is in the overthrust we're a considerable distance to the east of that. So is there some effects?

But it's very, very premature to think about, that we would have some understanding of that. As Lee alluded to earlier, we're going to drill eight wells this year, and that's going to allow us to better define what we think of our 227,000 acres. As far as conventional plays, early days, when we were looking at this play, we did identify some reef plays that are out there.

So our reported production is field level, natural gas production and condensate. So it's pretty simple to go ahead and put our numbers together, and we do the equivalent. It's just the condensate. The condensate is 6:1 added to the gas, and we've reported all our production on MMcf equivalent basis. It is high Btu gas. The shallower sections approach 13,000 Btus, as I recall.

On Monday, we published the detailed operations report. This release carried lots of information about each of our focus areas. But more importantly, we announced a reallocation of our capital budget to allow for increased investments in all the projects in 2010. Newfield has real oil projects in its portfolio today, delivering real results. These projects are meaningful and offer us the ability to combine production growth and profitability. There are benefits to a diverse portfolio, and we fully intend to continue using these to our advantage to deliver value to our shareholders. Let me briefly summarize the most significant steps we are taking.
We plan to invest $700 million or about 45% of our 2010 budget on oil projects. These are projects we have in hand today. Keep in mind, our initial shift to oil actually began months ago as we accelerated development drilling in Malaysia, added rigs in Monument Butte and the Williston Basin at year end and significantly increased our natural gas hedges to protect returns. You are seeing the benefits of these positions in our guidance today. 
Second, we expect our domestic oil volumes to grow about 20% in 2010, with the most significant drivers being Monument Butte, Malaysia and the Williston Basin. I'll spend more time on this call discussing our improved outlook for Monument Butte growth. 
Third, our foundational gas assets are held by production and give us great flexibility in our investment timing. We plan to reduce our active rig count in the Woodford from the current pace of eight rigs to a 2010 exit of around four to five rigs. With continued great results from our Super Extended Laterals, we still expect that Woodford production should grow 20% in 2010. So when you combine all of the above, we expect that our production for 2010 will be more oily and will land in the upper half of our beginning-of-year guidance. We expect to grow at least 10% in 2010.
Last night, we published our first quarter financial results. From a financial reporting standpoint, it was a very simple quarter. Pre-FAS 133, we earned $1.19 per share, surpassing First Call estimates due primarily to lower operating expenses in the quarter. In yesterday's earnings release, we provided enhanced guidance for the remainder of the year, showing our second quarter expectations, as well as full year expectation for various metrics helpful in your modeling and analysis. As always, we'll be happy to take your questions at the end of the call.
The call today will be very brief, and our comments will be focused around three main topics. First, the benefits of a diverse portfolio. Although there are times that it would be fashionable to be 100% gas or 100% oil, we think that having a diverse and balanced portfolio to invest in at the appropriate times is the best formula to create long-term value. Second, I want to spotlight our in-hand oil projects that will drive top-tier production growth within cash flow in 2010 and 2011. The cornerstone of this program is Monument Butte, and the recent results from our Rockies teams are excellent. And finally, I'll quickly cover our planned activities in the new exploration areas that we are hopeful could become a play of the future for Newfield.
Many of you have visited our headquarters and regional offices and have seen our founding business principles prominently displayed in our lobbies. We talked often about these, and they are ingrained in our DNA. One of those principles is balance. And to us, that means a lot of things: balance between exploration and development, between onshore and offshore, conventional and unconventional. But perhaps the most important today is a balance between oil assets and gas assets. This is a great time to have oil opportunities to invest in. 
For some time, we've had a view that oil was good, and that we needed a solid representation in oil plays, both in the U.S. and in Southeast Asia. In 2004, we took two large steps on our path to transforming Newfield. We entered the shallow water arena in Malaysia, and we acquired the giant Monument Butte field in Utah. The time the Monument Butte acquisition, the field was producing about 7,000 barrels a day, and oil was about $30 per barrel. Today, both field production and oil prices have nearly tripled. This was a great acquisition and is the cornerstone of our domestic oil production growth. 
We're investing more in our oil projects today because it's the right economic choice. We're able to slower growth in gas developments and accelerate our oil plays. Our 2010 domestic oil production is now expected to grow about 20% over 2009 volumes. Because we are shifting more investments to oil early in the year, this will have a positive impact on our 2011 oil volumes as well. 
We have the flexibility to shift capital today because we have a very limited drilling obligations to hold our acreage and our gas plays. In the Woodford and Granite Wash plays, substantially all our acreage is held by production. Simply running one rig in the Woodford in 2010 and 2011 will keep us from losing any acreage. We're in a great position to let economics guide our drilling decisions, not lease expirations. Let's talk about the oil assets that are contributing to our growth today.
Monument Butte. What a great asset. We recently set a production record at the Monument Butte field of just under 20,000 barrels per day. 19,900 barrels, to be specific. That's up nearly 3,000 barrels a day since year-end 2009. We are combining improved drilling performance and higher production rates from recent wells drilled on our Ute Tribal acreage. We now estimate that our Monument Butte production will grow 20% in 2010, stronger than our beginning-of-year guidance of 15%. We talk often about Monument Butte, and one of the most common questions has been why can't you grow production at a faster pace. Well, today, we can. There's an increased demand for Black Wax from area refiners, and refining capacity expansions allow for more production. We comprise more than 50% of the Black Wax capacity in the region and are clearly the one capable of sizable future growth. Our 2010 production is sold under term sales, and 87% of our 2011 production is now termed. Current differentials are about $13 below NYMEX and remember, that includes about $6 of transportation expense.
Along with good demand, we have exemplary drilling performance in the field. Our drilling personnel are setting new records in days to depth. We recently drilled a well in three and a half days. Year-to-date, we are averaging four and a half days compared to a 2009 average of five and a half days. Today, our five-rig program is the efficient equivalent of running eight rigs back in 2006. We call these incremental rigs, virtual rigs, and their impact is showing up in our volumes today. We now expect that a five-rig program will allow us to drill more than 350 wells in 2010, up from earlier expectations of 275. An average well here costs about $800,000 to drill and complete. Monument Butte field level production is expected to exit 2010 at about 25,000 barrels of oil per day, and we expect to have very strong oil growth here in 2011 as well.
Our results in the Ute Tribal acreage continue to exceed original expectations, with higher early production rates and good drilling performance. This area covers 63,000 net acres immediately north and adjacent to our Monument Butte field. Over the last two years, we've drilled more than 125 wells in this acreage and are quickly assessing its potential. We believe we have more than 1,000 development locations in front of us on this acreage at 40-acre spacing and double that if the fields ultimately develop on 20s, like Monument Butte properties is today. Our interests on the Ute Tribal acreage runs about 70%. In total, we estimate there are approximately 4,700 development drilling locations remaining in the Monument Butte field area. 
Moving on to the Williston Basin, this is our second largest growth region in the Rockies where we have about 400,000 net acres, about half of which is currently in active development or appraisal. In our operations released Monday, we provided results from several recent development wells in our Westberg and Lost Bear development areas along the Nesson Anticline. Recent wells include our highest initial production rates achieved to date. 
Our Williston Basin production is expected to increase at least 40% in 2010. Our two most recent wells had initial production of more than 3,300 barrels of oil per day and a 30-day average production of more than 1,100 barrels of oil per day. Our team is clearly lining, and we have optimized our drilling and completion operations. We expect to drill 30 to 35 wells in the Williston Basin in 2010 and may elect to add an additional rig here later in the year. 
We have approximately 100,000 acres that are located west of the Nesson Anticline. To date, we've drilled three successful wells here, and they are online and producing today. We are encouraged by their success and plan to drill additional wells in these areas in 2010. Industry successes around our acreage provide encouragement, and we hope to have a more thorough update for you later this year.
Moving on now to Malaysia. This is one of our major oil-producing regions. We are benefiting today from investments made over the last several years to develop shallow water oil fields. In April, our productions had a gross record of 45,000 barrels of oil per day and which translates to about 20,000 barrels a day, net. The recent increase is due to higher-than-planned production volumes from the operated development at East Belumut and Chermingat, both located in the shallow water block PM 323. The increase has not happened since. 
In the second half of 2009, we accelerated by six months the timing of six planned development wells at East Belumut. Because of better drilling performance, we were able to drill a total of seven development wells during the time allotted for the rig and for the same budgeted amount for the original six wells in the program. This moved our East Belumut production to more than 24,000 barrels of oil per day gross, and we expect to maintain this level throughout the year. And importantly, we're utilizing our horizontal drilling and completions expertise internationally as well. 
So the bottom line is this: We had originally estimated Malaysia would decline in 2010 by about 18% due to natural field depletion. Our improved performance at East Belumut reduces this decline to less than half this amount. This is a great time to have the extra oil production coming out of Southeast Asia, and hats off to our team there who's doing a great job. 
Emphasis on the future. I'll remind you that we've added more than 500,000 net acres in domestic resource plays in the fourth quarter of '09, now through the early portion of 2010. It's important that we not lose sight of the future and that we continue to invest in plays that have a chance to be the next Monument Butte field or the next Woodford Shale. These are our plays of the future. 
The Maverick Basin. Important asset. We entered here earlier this year and closed an acquisition that brought to us more than 300,000 prospective net acres in Maverick and Dimmit Counties. We're very encouraged by the potential of our acreage and believe it will prove to be analogous to recent success being reported elsewhere in the play. We have a very thorough evaluation plan, and we'll know a lot more in late 2010. 
Beginning in June, we'll begin a multi-rig program to assess the Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shale formations, as well as other oil formations that are in perspective across the acreage. We plan to invest more than $100 million to drill about 25 wells in 2010 to assess the newly acquired acreage. We plan to test the Eagle Ford formation at multiple depths perspective for both gas and oil. Recent successes around us provide early encouragement as to the potential on our acreage, and we look forward to reporting on our progress later this year.
Moving north to the Southern Alberta Basin, we've captured about 224,000 net acres of what we think is an area that has a potential to be a Williston Basin and Bakken look-alike. Our prospective formations of the Lodgepole, Middle Bakken, Sanish and the deeper Nisku. We spud our first well in a few days, waiting on a rig and expect to drill approximately eight wells here in the second half of the year. Depending on success, our activity levels here could be expanded in late 2010 or 2011. 
It is important that we also work to maintain a momentum in our gas plays. In the Monday operations release, we provided a good update on our foundational gas assets in the Mid-Continent, the Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash plays. We continue to drill Super Extended Laterals in the Woodford with lateral lengths of about 9,000 feet and initial production rates averaging 9 million cubic feet per day. We are reducing our planned investments in the Woodford to allow for reallocation of capital to the oil plays we outlined moments ago. Despite the reduction in planned development drilling and capital, we still expect the Woodford Shale to grow 20% in 2010. In the Granite Wash, we continue to have excellent results on this play, and our current phase of four rigs will continue through the rest of 2010. More than half of our planned wells in the remainder of the year will be in the condensate-rich formations in the Granite Wash.
It's important also that we maintain healthy activity levels on our gas plays, but growth for growth's sake is not good business and certainly not Newfield business, particularly given the fact that we have alternative wall investments with better returns in today's market. But good momentum in our gas plays keeps our team sharp, constantly striving for new efficiency gains. We will continue to reap these benefits. There will come a time when increased investments in growth and gas plays are wanted economically, and Newfield will remain in a position to instantly ramp up our activities.

As we move in to the Rocky Mountains, Monument Butte is essentially all HBP. And the agreements that we have with the Ute Indian Tribe and our various joint ventures have very reasonable requirements that we're far ahead of exceeding. So there's no HBP issues there. As we step out of there into the Williston Basin, we have quite a bit term on our Southern Alberta positions there, on a majority of that acreage. So let's just say we're in probably a three- to five-year zip code on the majority of that. As we step over into the Williston Basin, that's the area that -- if there is an area that we need to make sure that we keep a healthy level of activity up to hold our acreage position, it would be there. Certainly, it's opportunistic at this time with oil prices where they are and elevating activity, we're able to hold our acreage position there on all of the appraisal and development areas. And that's typically in this three- to five-rig program. We see no issues there. Onshore, in the Maverick Basin, we have the $100 million investment that we have scheduled there this year. And our plans forward meet all of the requirements that we have for any lease maintenance issues there. So overall, we're sitting very comfortable with where we're at right now, and it really lends itself to our ability to allocate capital back and forth between areas."

And those wells primarily target the same Green River formations that we're playing in Monument Butte. They're a little deeper. Despite being a little thinner overall, we're seeing good pressure in the formations. And they appear to be a little bit better fractured than we see at the South, and we're actually seeing the benefits of that in our EURs. As far as the drilling efficiencies, it's pretty remarkable. And it's really some of the benefits we've realized by moving people around the organization. We made some changes earlier this year, some of the brave folks that came out of the Woodford went into the Rockies and working with our teams there. We've made mechanical enhancements to the rigs that we're employing there. We've added electronic monitoring of all our drilling parameters, consistent with maybe some of the more higher-tech rigs or offshore rigs. By having all this data available to it, we're analyzing it, and we've installed auto drillers in all the rigs. And we're able to maintain very precise drilling requirements on weight on bit, rotary speed, differential pressures, things like that. As a result of those small steps, we're seeing remarkable changes in the drilling efficiency. In combination with that, we further advanced working with some of the bit designers, some customized PDC bits that really performing quite well in these areas. And when we talk about these changes, you referenced, Dave, over the last year, I can tell you it's probably over the last three months we're seeing these changes."

Gary's point that moving people around between the business units and the focus that we've had on optionality in the portfolio in gas versus oil and the fact that we've been on that hunt for a year and a half now across the organization, there are a lot of gains everywhere because our people are walking and working across geographic boundaries, sharing information that's much more timely, knowledge transfer. Clearly, a portion of our performance is probably tied up in completion gains, normal learning. But back to your earlier question in terms of Ute Tribal versus Monument Butte proper, we don't know absolutely why we're getting better results on average, but three of our five rigs are working on the Ute Tribal acreage.

Clearly we're, I think, anxious about the midterm for natural gas. We've seen, in other operators as well as ourselves, continued drilling efficiencies we've been talking about all morning, and what that means is lower and lower cost to develop reserves in these large resource spaces. That just signals to me that we could be in a commodity price environment that isn't very robust, and the forward curve gives us the opportunity to put some positions in place that begin to assure cash flow in those periods of time, which we know we can maintain a level of activity, continue to underpin growth. So philosophically, we're still I'd say predominantly 18 to 24 month horizon hedgers with 1/3 of our production in the market, 1/3 with a fixed price and 1/3, some type of a floor. So we can participate in 2/3 the upside and protect against 2/3 downside.

Part of the reasons we did that was to allow transparency in how we moved reserves between proved and probable as our activity shifted between areas. And I think this year is a perfect example as we see ourselves reallocating capital from gas to oil. What you will see is really no change in the overall 2P number other than what we add externally through the projects. And because of the five-year PUD rule, you'll see areas that were historically gas could back off on a proved basis, but stay whole on a 2P basis in which you ought to see in the oil areas such as Monument Butte and others, you ought to see that same increase associated there and sort of redeploy the capital.

I guess, coming back to your original question as it relates to the Mid-Continent, as you're probably aware, and your numbers are in the right zip code, probably a little over 300 wells originally in there on a proved basis.

And you look at the Woodford as a great example at just how much a well has been modified over time. So we think about reserves. Our reserves on the books, I'll remind you that anything that showed up in the 2P reserves at year-end 2009 had a $3.87 stress test. That's what I take comfort in, and that's what you ought to be thinking about when you're looking at portfolios. To give you a number, I think the number from memory is, in terms of the probable component associated with the Woodford, is a number just over 800 Bs. So that didn't show up in the proved numbers, just over 800 Bs or somewhere in that zip code. That's about $1.50, and in terms of F&Ds. So that's the way to think about the reserves and the economics. If you follow up with Steve, he can give you some additional color. You can go back to the 10-K. There's a pretty good description, I believe, in there. And on the overall acreage count, as far exposure to super extended laterals, we've talked about 25% to 33% of the acreage, depending upon how some of the unit activities work out in Oklahoma, and those numbers still hold today. But I would be very careful with well counts. We can talk to you about reserves, and we'll give you some color on how all that fits together, but that's probably about all we can do today."

As far as the level of activity in our drilling campaigns, historically, and this number holds true, about 70% of the drilling activity that takes place at Monument Butte is on a PUD location. And about 30% is on a new probable new reserve at type location. Just generically, we probably have on the order of half a Tcf or so of probable reserves associated with the Rocky Mountains, largely at this point confined to Monument Butte. So I can't give you an exact well count, probable versus others. I believe, if you refer to some of Steve's public releases, we've talked about as many as, now this is on a 3P basis, about 4,700 locations. And generically, we've talked about 1,000 of those being up in the tribal areas on Forties. Now this is very early to talk about spacing and so forth. And the Ute is pretty premature at this point. On the co-mingling, I'm not really following the question. In these vertical wells, we go ahead and we co-mingle virtually all of the zones. Occasionally, we'll leave some out, and we'll come back in and add them later. But in the Green River formations, the vertical wells, and we typically conduct about five or six co-mingled fracs on a normal basis. Now occasionally, we'll encounter a Wasatch formation. In those situations, we'll add those to the co-mingled section."

If we can continue to drive the natural gas cost down in the Woodford and commodity prices change a little bit, then you dramatically change the profitability. So it's a function, not just price, but what is the cost. Today, we're seeing a rush to oil patch, literally, of rigs in activity. That could well translate into increased service costs, which would change the margin, despite what commodity prices do to bring the two closer to alignment. I think it's a hard question to say what would they need to do, et cetera. What I can tell you is that we look at that almost on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And the majority of our activity is not term or obligations, but it's options. And we have the ability to, in very, very short period of time, shift those resources, both capital and human resources to the thing that is most profitable. So we look at it on a regular basis. All the activity we talked about this morning shifted in some $200 million around here in the first couple of months of 2010. We did the same thing last year. If we need to, we can shift it back in a couple of months. We'll just be very opportunistic based upon what the margins are. It's really a margin question as compared to a commodity price question."

But when I think about Monument Butte, the 75 MBO with all the data that we've got, hundreds, well over a thousand producing wells, 1,200, 1,300 producing wells, lots of data, lots of information, you can sleep good at night with that. But we're not injecting water out there for sport. And the secondary waterflood response, the things we're seeing early on are exciting. 75 is a safe assumption. The fact that Gary's telling me that there's upside from there, he's just telling me that we're not far enough along to tell you exactly what that looks like. But 75's good, and 75 times 4,000, 5,000 locations gets to a big number. The 10-acre question, yes, it's out there. And our people are all over it. And where does it stop? It'll be all about Terry's margin discussion that we had earlier. So we're excited about the Monument Butte asset. I think it's been, for a long time, an underappreciated part of the Newfield portfolio. The fact that we're able to show that we can drive production growth today, I don't think that'll be lost, I know you guys -- and we're going to keep the foot on the accelerator and hopefully the accelerator on the floor."

As far as the Monument Butte deep gas, yes, we're still excited about it. We've got half a dozen wells out there producing in the deep section. We proved that there's over 10,000 feet of gas saturated section below the Green River oil sands. The vertical production we've seen in that area, out of those wells, exceed anything we were able to do in the early days of Stiles/Britt Ranch out in the Granite Wash play for a point of reference. So we're very excited about the potential there. And we've described it, without putting an absolute number on it, we said it's a multi-Tcf potential. It's in inventory, and the best part of it, it's held by production. So we have no compelling need to drill the well in 2010. And with our shift to oil, frankly, we see it as a distraction in a low gas price market. We continue to be very excited about that potential, and it's one of many opportunities we've got in the portfolio to accelerate gas activity when the margins and the economics are favorable in that environment.

As Lee alluded to earlier, we're going to drill eight wells this year, and that's going to allow us to better define what we think of our 227,000 acres. As far as conventional plays, early days, when we were looking at this play, we did identify some reef plays that were out there.

So our reported production is field level, natural gas production and condensate. So it's pretty simple to go ahead and put our numbers together, and we do the equivalent. It's just the condensate. The condensate is 6:1 added to the gas, and we've reported all our production on MMcf equivalent basis. It is high Btu gas. The shallower sections approach 1,300 Btus, as I recall.

Malaysia and Southeast Asia, while there are costs associated with those operations that might be higher on a unit basis than some of the other areas, I would tell you that the operations there are very efficient. We've got a great team. All you have to do is look back at the third quarter, fourth quarter of last year. We saw the benefits of having those assets and the production in the portfolio. Clearly, there's a lot of interest in our assets in Southeast Asia as there should be. We've got a great team delivering great results, and it's an important part of the portfolio today. Having said that, we've also been very open, that we've shown a history here over the last several years that at the right time, for the right reasons, we will divest significant portions of the business. We sold the U.K. We sold a shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. We sold a coal bed methane business in the Mid-Con all in 2007, raised $1.8 billion in those transactions, redeployed them into the Rockies, in the Mid-Con and in these other growth areas that we're talking about today. Frankly, you've seen the benefits today of some of those decisions that were made yesterday. And we'll continue to look at the portfolio. In fact, all of our business unit leaders and their management teams are challenged with the grow, hold or divest mentality, and it's part of their day-to-day thinking. And our teams are looking at these activities. And at the right times, we'll certainly divest properties that don't have a place in the portfolio. But we have no plans, and I'll say this with emphasis, no plans and no needs to divest any portion of the portfolio today."

And welcome to our second quarter and mid-year 2010 update call. Thanks for your interest in Newfield. With me today in Houston, I have Bill Schneider, our Vice President of Gulf Coast of Mexico -- Gulf Coast and Interna",3007,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter and mid-year 2010 update call. Thanks for your interest in Newfield. With me today in Houston, I have Bill Schneider, our Vice President of Gulf Coast of Mexico -- Gulf Coast and International; John Jasek, Vice President of Gulf of Mexico; Steve Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer; and in Denver, we have Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; and Daryll Howard, our Vice President of the Rockies; and we’re joined in Tulsa by General Manager, Jim Addison.
Earlier this week, we published a detailed operations report, with lots of information from our core operating regions. I will keep my remarks today relatively brief leaving plenty of time for your questions at the end. So let’s get started.
Our focus today at Newfield is very clear. First, continue to target our investments towards oil projects. We’re uniquely positioned in our peer group today with real oil projects in our portfolio. Our second quarter oil production was up 16% when compared to the first quarter of this year. We are on target for a 30% growth in our 2010 domestic oil volumes. The returns in oil plays today are superior to natural gas and we’re combining growth with returns.
Second, we are assessing some major new plays that could become a significant part of our future growth. We’re drilling our third well in the Southern Alberta Basin and we currently have four rigs running in the Eagle Ford Shale assessment program down in the Maverick Basin. Combined these oil high-yield liquid plays cover more than 0.5 million net acres and hold tremendous upside potential.
And third and finally, we’re positioning ourselves for future performance. We continue to strive for efficiencies in our natural gas developments and we’ll be in a position to again accelerate growth and gas assets when we see the appropriate return on investments. Through our diverse portfolio of assets we have multiple options to effectively manage the up and downs in our business, and navigate through the challenging elements in our business today.
Our hedge position is strong and provides for strong cash flow and profitability over the next two years. Due to our strong capital structure, we were recently upgraded to an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor’s.
These are certainly interesting times in our business. Just days prior to our last conference call with you the deepwater horizon incident occurred. Loss of life, the oil spill and its impact on the Gulf of Mexico and its shore lines are all tragedies, and forceful reminders of why environment, health and safety are critically important functions that can’t be overemphasized throughout our work force and industry.
Although, Newfield has a long history in the Gulf of Mexico, today it represents just 4% of our proved reserves and about 10% of our production. Our 2010 work program in the Gulf was front-end loaded and the moratorium does not have any impact on our planned drilling programs for 2010.
We have several active developments in deepwater and we fully expect we will be allowed to advance these projects. We’re confident in our Gulf of Mexico team’s ability to continue to execute at a superlative level.
Without a doubt, there will be new permitting in regulatory requirement that will impact future exploration. We are following closing all the new bills and amendments being debated in Washington, D.C. and we’ll carefully weigh their impact on project economics and our future drilling plans.
As you will hear, in today’s call, we have a deep portfolio and plenty of options. We’re confident that the options we possess and our ability to shift capital and human resources between business units will enable us to navigate in certain times ahead and continue to deliver profitable growth.
By now, I hope you’ve had a chance to review our second quarter financial results. Our pre-FAS 133 numbers were $1.06 per share. Our production volumes were at the upper end guidance and our costs and expenses were within our guidance ranges. Terry Rathert, our CFO will be happy to take any questions you may have regarding our quarterly results at the end of this call.
For 2010, our capital budget remains at $1.6 billion, unchanged. For the remainder of the call, I will use our time to update you on recent developments in our most significant plays, starting with our growing oil developments.
For sometime now, we’ve had a view that oil would be advantaged over natural gas. We back this belief by hedging a substantial portion of our future natural gas production. In fact, we hedged a greater percentage over a longer time period than has typically been our norm. I would encourage you to take a look at our hedge disclosure in our NFX publication.
For long weakness in natural gas prices has been further exacerbated by continually rising rig count. Apparently the need to hold acreage by production to precede economics and gas supply remains stubbornly high today. We hedged strong gas prices for 2010 and 2011, but because we have options we are focusing on oil projects today to deliver impressive growth.
Recently, there have been lots of questions on NGLs and their recent price erosion. This is a very minor issue for Newfield, since most of our liquid production is oil. In the second quarter, natural gas liquids, NGLs represented 2.5 Bcf or about 3% of our total production. This is up from about 1.5 Bcf when compared to the second quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting our growth in the Granite Wash play.
But in short, weaker NGL pricing is not a material issue for Newfield since our growth stands largely from real oil not NGLs. Our domestic oil growth today is coming from the Rocky Mountains from Monument Butte and Williston assets. I will talk a little about those at this time.
Starting with Monument Butte. This is our most significant growth asset today. It is a giant oil resource play capable of many years of double-digit production increases. We recently set a production record at Monument Butte at about 22,600 barrels per day that’s up 5,600 barrels of oil per day since year end 2009. We’re well on our way to reaching our year end 2010 target, of at least 25,000 barrels of oil per day. This field is the largest contributor to our estimated 30% growth in domestic oil production in 2010.
Our drilling team in Monument Butte continues to impress and set a recent drilling record of 2.8 days. That’s rig up to rig release and it was on a 20-acre directional well. Our improved drilling efficiencies are allowing us to drill an estimated 375 wells this year, with a five-rig program. It really puts it in perspective when you realize that we are turning a new oil well to sales every day now. This is the essence of a resource play and we are fortunate to have won this oil.
About 95% of our expected 2010 Monument Butte production is sold under term sales and 85% of our 2011 forward production is termed. Current differentials remain about $13 to $14 below NYMEX including about $6 per barrel of transportation expense. We’re working with area refiners to ensure their capacity keeps pace with our future supply growth.
Our results, on our northern expansion acreage or strong and three of our five operated rigs continue drilling on this 63,000 net acre area. We’ve drilled 90 wells in this acreage in 2010 and 220 wells since 2007 when we started drilling in that region.
To give you an idea of the success we’re having, a recent well here posted initial average production of 350 barrels per day over its first 30 days of production. In total, we estimate that there are currently about 4700 development drilling locations remaining in the Monument Butte area.
I’ll move on now to the Williston Basin. Our production in this region is the head of original plans and has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year. That production today is more than 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent. We added a fourth operating rig to our program last week and expect that our net production at year end 2010 will be about 6,500 barrels per day in this region.
We have about 160,000 net acres under active development along the Nissan and west of the Nissan, and year-to-date we expect to drill 25 or so wells in the full-year of 2010 cycle. Most of our producing wells to date have had lateral lengths around 4,000 feet, we expect in the second half that half of these wells we will drill, will have extended lateral lengths up to as long as 9,000 feet.
We continue to involve our completion designs to achieve the best results. In our operations release we detail recent well results and you can see several of the wells of initial production rates in excess of 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 30 day averages of a 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or more.
In our Westberg development area on the Nesson Anticline, our recent Garvey Federal 1-29 well is our best to date and had an initial production rate of more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a 3,900-foot lateral.
We’re also seeing good results in our new assessment areas west of the Nesson in the Aquarium/Watford are a Bluefin well had an IP of about 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day and was our first Bakken well on this acreage area. More than half of remaining 120 wells this year will have lateral lengths of approximately 9,000 feet.
As a result of our improved drilling and completions we’re now seeing increased UR’s in the range of 500,000 to 750,000 barrels. Recent drilling complete cost for the Williston wells range from $6 to $8 million, gross.
I’ll move on now to Malaysia. Our international oil production was up nearly 10% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The primary driver was Malaysia. Our East Belumut field on PM 323 has performed ahead of expectation in the first half of the year.
In the second quarter, our net production from Malaysia averaged about 15,000 barrels of oil per day. Unfortunately, as we reported last week, our export pipeline was damaged by an unidentified marine vessel, working nearly 20 miles from our East Belumut field.
Repairs to the damaged pipeline are expected to take six to eight weeks and last week we estimated that the deferred production related to the downtime will total about 0.5 million net barrels. Repairs are now underway and we will update you again when production resumes. We have several new developments underway in Malaysia that are expected to provide additional growth in 2011 and 2012.
I’ll move on now to talk a little bit about building for the future. Our oil production is at record levels. We continue to build for the future and are assessing some significant new oil resource plays. Some of which you are aware of, some that you are not. Maverick Basin will be where I’ll start. Without a doubt Eagle Ford Shale is one of the hottest plays underway today in the U.S.
Rig counts continue to rise and access to completion services remains tight. We have more than 300,000 net acres in the highly perspective Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shale plays and are investing about a $100 million this year thoroughly assess our acreage.
As of this morning, we are now running five operated rigs in the Maverick Basin and expect to drill about 15 wells in the second half of this year. Nine of these wells will be targeted at the Eagle Ford Shale and remaining wells will be drill to the deepwater Pearsall Shale.
We’ve drilled two wells to date, about to TD a third. First well was a 5,000-foot lateral in the lower Eagle Ford oil window in the northern portion of our acreage. Second was also a 5,000-foot lateral in the west gas window in the southern portion of our acreage.
We have a frac crew scheduled to arrive next week and we’ll have our first flow rates very soon. Our completions will be arranged back-to-back, and we will utilize the completion crew that will work exclusively for Newfield.
This ensures that we get the best possible quality and control, the timing of our jobs. It’s important to understand that this is a true assessment program. Simply stated this means we are sampling our acreage from north to south and intend to be in a position to understand its potential later this year, early next. We will not be making individual well results public and plan to update you with a package of oil results in an appropriate time later this year or early next year.
I’ll move on now to the Southern Alberta Basin. We have a similar assessment program underway on our 230,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin of Northern Montana. Respected formations here are the Lodgepole, Middle Bakken, Spanish and the deeper Nisku. We’re preparing to start our third well now and plan to drill as many as eight wells before year end. We will test both vertical and horizontal wells in multiple formations.
Again, we will not be discussing individual oil results and plan to update you on package of wells when we have a comprehensive understanding of our acreage and it’s potential. Although, we’re not in a position to identify them yet, we’re applying our geological lessons learned to new oil plays. These are home grown plays that have significant potential.
Our geoscientists have done a great job of identifying these plays and positioning us early, as opposed to being a follower and paying a premium entry price. Acreage costs really do impact economics. I look forward to sharing results here in the future as we gain additional information.
I’ll move on and talk a little bit about our held by production gas plays. Plays that are capable of providing growth at the right time. Our operations release, we provided updates on our Mid-Continent resource plays the Granite Wash and the Woodford Shale.
Our Mid-Continent division recent production record of 360 million cubic feet per day net, we’ve been able to grow production over the last several quarters, despite a falling rig count in the region and the second quarter, we set a Woodford production record of more than 370 million cubic feet a day gross, and we expect that with the decreased rig count the Woodford production will still grow more than 20% this year.
The reallocation of capital, our gas directed rigged count has been slowed [result] acceleration in our oil plays. When stronger natural gas prices improve economics, we will be in a position to quickly grow our held-by-production gas assets with proven and predictable results.
Our rig count on the Woodford has decreased from nine rigs at the beginning of the year to four rigs operating today. But we continue to post efficiency gains. An example of this would be our lateral penetration rates, which have improved more than 20% year-to-date versus our average historical numbers. This significant gain in penetration rate allows us to do more with fewer rigs, for drilling longer laterals and we’re drilling them faster.
Our assessment of multiple perspective horizons in the Granite Wash play continues and by year end we expect to test at least 10 different horizons. We’re electing to conduct this comprehensive assessment this year to fully understand the [stake] potential on our acreage. It’s important to remember that we are not simply drilling in one sweet spot.
To date, we have drilled 26 horizontal wells across our 46,000 net acreage position. We recently drilled our longest lateral to date in the Granite Wash at nearly 360,000 feet, about half of our planned wells in the second half of 2010 will be drilled to the Monument formation where we have seen high liquid yield helping to improve economic. The Granite Wash is our highest return gas play and we currently plan to run four operated rigs through the balance of 2010. Our current net production in the region is around 80 million cubic feet per day.
Before I conclude our prepared remarks and moved to take your questions. Let me offer a few insights on what we believe, makes Newfield a preferred investment today. Number one, we have options. We have attractive oil and gas assets, and we’re pulling right levers to combine growth and returns. We’re confident that our diverse portfolio provides an advantage, as we navigate effectively through the challenges in our business environment today.
Number two, we’re making investment decisions around returns. We realize that growth is important, but it’s imperative that drilling decisions are based on economics. Our hedge position is very strong but we are not using our natural gas hedge position as rational for gas drilling. We’re slowing our gas developments because we can and channeling our dollars to oil to capitalize on our returns. We will be on a short list of companies that can grow domestic production in excess of 20% or more in 2010.
Number three, we’re building for our future. Although our budget in 2010 is driven by our expectations for cash flow and our commitment to live within cash flow. Keep in mind that there is more than $150 million allocated to assessing new oil and gas plays.
It would be easy to simply allocate these dollars for our current development plays but we must continue to build for the future. Our new assessments have the potential to rise to the top of our investment pyramid and if successful could be a significant part of our future growth and production, and reserves.
Thanks for your continued support to Newfield Exploration. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning, we’re happy to take your questions at this time.

We do have the option as the second half unfolds to defer some completions into 2011. And since we have done that before, we will monitor the market conditions as things play out and certainly that’s one of the tools in our tool kit and we will use it as we think it is appropriate. But at this time, all of the deferred completions from 2009 are behind us.

In the Woodford, we’re substantially held by production, up until this quarter, we reported a net acreage number of around 166,000 net acres. You’ll note in our release, it is up over 172,000 net acres. So, we have added to our position in the Woodford but of that, 155ish, somewhere in that zip code of those acres are held by production.
So we have very little requirements for HBP drilling in the Woodford. The same story is true in the Granite Wash. We have four rigs running in the Granite Wash as well. And I was careful to point out that our current plans relate to continue to have those rigs running now through the end of the year but as with the completions, we will continue to monitor the situation and we do have options in the portfolio. We’ve been shifting towards oil all year and something we will continue to consider on an on going basis in the second half of this year. The biggest variables there really are assessment programs in the Maverick Basin and Southern Alberta Basin but we really think those will be mostly a 2011-2012 type of event.

I think there were a half a dozen wells, maybe six or seven wells. And read the names of the wells very carefully, there were three wells with the name McCoy on it. They were all drilled into the same horizon in the Monument, one on the east side of the section and one on the west side of the section and I guess you can guess where the third one was, right in the middle.
We did that as an initial test early in the program to go ahead and ascertain two things. Number one, variability and deliverability, relative to petrophysics within individual target horizons. These two west side, while we had better petrophysics from the drilling program in the center, so, somewhat did Gary read in section and what we found is where we had good rocks on the east and west, they performed much better than the rock in the central portion of the section but all three wells were good wells and they continued to perform very well. So that’s - To my knowledge, the only three wells, single zone section. So you could say a couple of hundreds acres for well type volume allocations relative to the section that we found, but we did it early and we got that in our back pot in terms of performances, as we planned the future developments.
Our focus has been on assessing the individual horizons. We talked about there being as many as 30 individual horizons. And I think we’re about seven horizons in now to our testing. So if you think about 26 wells and take the three that I just told you, they were in the same zone out, you can get an appreciation that we got relatively sparse drilling, within individual target horizons. The point there is we want understand what the inventory looks like on our acreage, so that we can get it planned appropriately within our portfolio model and future plans. We will have about 10 of those sections and 10 of those horizons tested by year end, which is right in line with our pre 2010 expectations.

Oil country tubular goods has been up as much as 20% throughout the organization. Rig rates as you’re probably aware, depending on where you want to start from the ultimate low, could have seen somewhere between 30% to 50%. However, we have had - Much of that has been either baked into our numbers, as we entered the year or under rig contracts so, we haven’t seen that translate into the well cost, as much. But just as an industry number that’s probably pretty appropriate.
On the pumping services side that number could probably be and if it’s regionally variable, in areas like the Bakken and Eagle Ford, this has already been addressed, is extremely competitive. So you could have seen, certainly, 30, 35% annual increases in pumping services there. In some cases maybe hair more.
In other areas like the Monument Butte, the number would be less than that. So, on a completion basis you could probably that about half of those figures and say that’s where our completion costs were up, so that, if you know, on average I would say about 15%. On the drilling side, we have seen cost increases anywhere between 5% and 20% depending on where you’re at.

So let’s start with the Marcellus.
Our plan in the Marcellus we’ve been very clear. We built a team. It’s a quality team. We see the Marcellus as a substantially significant long-term source of supply in North America. We believe we need to be represented there but we’re going to be very judicious and diligent in terms our efforts and we expect it to be a multi-year effort to build the business in Appalachia.
So we haven’t changed our position relative to our thoughts on the Marcellus and the team continues to evaluate opportunities each and every day. Relative to natural gas and the decrease in the rig count in the Woodford, clearly, I go back to Terry’s comments on margin. I mean, our - We have got oil in the portfolio and we have options to accelerate and we have been exercising those options for most of the last year now. And you’re seeing the results come through in terms of growing domestic oil volumes. I think that is significant. It is driven by attractive margins so we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that we get the best investments at the front of the line and that we keep them there.
So, we monitor that on a real time basis and we will shift accordingly. And I think we have learned a lot over the last year and half or so in terms of our ability to shift, not just capital but human resources, around, within the organization and I think it is a real competitive advantage in the type of market that we’re in today. As far as the natural gas market, which I think was your other questions and the leadoff, we have been bearish as you will recall, since exiting 2008, or ‘9, ‘10 and ‘11. And I think that we have not been surprised by how things have played out. I think as long as the rig count continues to run up and we’re being driven by HBP efforts. And natural gas plays it is almost inevitable that you will continue to be oversupplied and obviously in a commodity market that is bearish and we tend to lead to low price outcomes in that regard.
Having said that, I think once the HBP flurry is behind the industry and we can get some folks through the flood of money coming in internationally, promoted dollars. Then maybe we can get back to a more normal situation where the balance industry is making economic decisions and making investments on the merits, as opposed to making investments for other reasons, which I think is a lot of what is driving the buoyant rig count that we see today. It’s not going to turnover until rig count turns over and if we get back to a more appropriate supply demand situation.

So it will be after 2011. That’s first, probably, chance that we might have some more positive view on this?

Let’s see, as we move to more reduced days, it actually ultimately requires increased cost in our overall capital budget because we’re drilling more wells. As a result of the efficiency gains this year off the top of my head when we went from five and half days down to four and half days we’re going to consume an extra $80 million this year in CapEx as a result of that.
Now the reason we have such a wide range in capital cost is the play actually gets deeper as you move south to north and then, not only that our infill wells are all directionally drilled and more specifically, remembering those costs also we have our infrastructure cost or tank batteries. So there’s a wide variety of factors that could affect a specific well outcome, size of the battery, depth, directional versus straight hole.
As far as spacing goes, on the tribal side we’re drilling many of these wells are on 40s or even as we step out, these wells could be the first well in a 640, okay? So the infrastructure cost could be higher as a result of that.
As we step back into Monument Butte, that is primarily a combination of 40-acre vertical wells as we continue to extend the play. But in addition to that we’re also drilling directional wells from existing paths which are 20 acres and that makes up the balance of the Monument Butte proper play.

So we reshaped that team and that’s kind of a normal cycle.
I think the IQ test is not what you’ve done historically but that production provides cash flow. It’s the incremental investments that you make, perspective -- on a perspective basis, do they make economic sense? Do they have attractive margins? Do they generate the required returns, so that you can be a healthy self sustaining business and I think that’s a question frankly that more people should ask themselves.

With me today in Houston, I have Bill Schneider, our Vice President of Gulf Coast and International; John Jasek, Vice",3016,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter and midyear 2010 update call. Thanks for your interest in Newfield. With me today in Houston, I have Bill Schneider, our Vice President of Gulf Coast and International; John Jasek, Vice President of Gulf of Mexico; Steve Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer; and in Denver, we have Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; and Daryll Howard, our Vice President, the Rockies; and we're joined in Tulsa by General Manager Jim Addison. 
Earlier this week, we published a detailed operations report with lots of information on our core operating regions. I will keep my remarks today relatively brief, leaving plenty of time for your questions at the end, so let's get started. 
Our focus today at Newfield is very clear. First, continue to target our investments toward oil projects. We are uniquely positioned in our peer group today with real oil projects in our portfolio. 
Our second quarter oil production was up 16% when compared to the first quarter of this year. We are on target for a 30% growth in our 2010 domestic oil volumes. The returns in oil plays today are superior to natural gas, and we're combining growth with returns. 
Second, we're assessing some major new plays that could become a significant part of our future growth. We're drilling our third well in the Southern Alberta Basin, and we currently have four rigs running in the Eagle Ford Shale assessment program down in the Maverick Basin. Combined, these oil high-yield liquid plays cover more than 500,000 net acres and hold tremendous upside potential. And third and finally, we are positioning ourselves for future performance. We continue to strive for efficiencies in our national gas developments, and we'll be in a position to again accelerate growth in gas assets when we see the appropriate return on investments. Through our diverse portfolio of assets we have multiple options to effectively manage the ups and downs in our business and navigate through the challenging elements in our business today. 
Our hedge position is strong and provides for strong cash flow and profitability over the next two years. Due to our strong capital structure, we were recently upgraded to an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's. 
These are certainly interesting times in our business. Just days prior to our last conference call with you, the Deepwater Horizon incident occurred. The loss of life, the oil spill and its impact on the Gulf of Mexico and its shorelines are all tragedies and forceful reminders of why environment, health and safety and are critically important functions that can't be over-emphasized throughout our workforce and industry. 
Although Newfield has a long history in the Gulf of Mexico, today, it represents just 4% of our proved reserves and about 10% of our production. Our 2010 work program in the Gulf was front-end loaded, and the moratorium does not have any impact on our planned drilling programs for 2010. 
We have several active developments in the deepwater, and we fully expect we will be allowed to advance these projects. We are confident in our Gulf of Mexico team's ability to continue to execute at superlative level. Without a doubt, there will be new permitting and regulatory requirements that will impact future explorations. We are following closely all the new bills and amendments being debated in Washington, D.C., and we'll carefully weigh their impact and project economics in our future drilling plans. 
As you will hear in today's call, we have a deep portfolio and plenty of options. We're confident that the options we possess and our ability to shift capital and human resources between business units will enable us to navigate the uncertain times ahead and continue to deliver profitable growth. 
By now, I hope you've had a chance to review our second quarter financial results. Our pre-FAS 133 numbers were $1.06 per share. Our production volumes were at the upper end of guidance, and our costs and expenses were within our guidance ranges. Terry Rathert, our CFO, will be happy to take any questions you may have regarding our quarterly results at the end of this call. 
For 2010, our capital budget remains at $1.6 billion, unchanged. For the remainder of the call, I will use our time to update you on recent developments in our most significant plays starting with our growing oil developments. 
For some time now, we've had a view that oil would be advantaged over natural gas. We backed this belief by hedging a substantial portion of our future natural gas production. In fact, we hedged a greater percentage over a longer time period than has typically been the norm. I would encourage you to take a look at our hedge disclosure in our NFX publications. The prolonged weakness in natural gas prices is being further exacerbated by a continually rising rig count. Apparently, the need to hold acreage by production supersedes economics, and gas supply remains stubbornly high today. 
We are hedged with strong gas prices for 2010 and 2011, but because we have options, we are focusing on our oil projects today to deliver impressive growth. Recently, there've been lots of questions on NGLs and the recent price erosion. This is a very minor issue for Newfield as most of our liquid production is oil. 
In the second quarter, natural gas liquids, NGLs, represented 2.5 BCF or about 3% of our total production. This is up from about 1 1/2 BCF when compared to the second quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting our growth in the Granite Wash play. So in short, weaker NGL pricing is not a material issue for Newfield since our growth stems largely from real oil, not NGLs. 
Our domestic oil growth today is coming from the Rocky Mountains through our Monument Butte and Williston assets, and I'll talk a little bit about those at this time starting with Monument Butte. This is our most significant growth asset today. It's a giant oil resource play capable of many years of double-digit production increases. We recently set a production record at Monument Butte of about 22,600 barrels per day. That's up 5,600 barrels of oil per day since year end 2009. We're well on our way to reaching our year end 2010 target of at least 25,000 barrels of oil per day. This field is the largest contributor to our estimated 30% growth in domestic oil production in 2010. 
Our 2010 joint team in Monument Butte continues to impress and set a recent drilling record of 2.8 days. That's rig up to rig release, and it was on a 20-acre directional well. Our improved drilling efficiencies are allowing us to drill an estimated 375 wells this year with a five-rig program. It really puts it in perspective when you realize that we are turning a new oil well to sales everyday now. This is the essence of a resource play, and we are fortunate to have one that's oil. 
About 95% of our expected 2010 Monument Butte production is sold under term sales, and 85% of our 2011 forward production has termed. Current differentials remain at about $13 to $14 below NYMEX, including about $6 per barrel of transportation expense. We're working with area refiners to ensure their capacity keeps pace with our future supply growth. 
Our results on our northern extension acreage are strong, and three of our five operated rigs continue drilling on a 63,000 net acre area. We've drilled 90 wells in this acreage in 2010 and 220 wells since 2007 when we started drilling in that region. 
To give you an idea of the success we're having, a recent well here posted initial average production of 350 barrels per day over its first 30 days of production. In total, we estimate that there are currently about 4,700 development drilling locations remaining in the Monument Butte area. 
I'll move on now to the Williston Basin. Our production in this region is ahead of original plans and has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year. Net production today is more than 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent. We added a fourth operated rig to our program last week and expect that our net production at year end 2010 will be about 6,500 barrels per day in this region. We have about 160,000 net acres under active development along the Nesson and the west of the Nesson, and year-to-date, we expect to drill 25-or-so wells in the full year 2010 cycle. 
Most of our producing wells today have had lateral lengths of around 4,000 feet. We expect in the second half that half of these wells we'll drill will have extended lateral lengths up to as long as 9,000 feet. We continue to evolve our completion designs to achieve the best results. 
In our operations release, we detailed recent well results, and you can see several of the wells with initial production rates in excess of 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 30-day averages of 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or more. In our Westberg development area on the Nesson Anticline, our recent Garvey Federal 1-29 well is our best to-date and had an initial production rate of more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a 3,900-foot lateral. 
We're also seeing good results in our new assessment areas west of the Nesson. In the Aquarium/Watford area, our Bluefin well had an IP of about 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day and was our first Bakken well on this acreage area. 
More than half our remaining 20-or-so wells this year will have lateral lengths of approximately 9,000 feet. As a result of our improved drilling and completions, we're now seeing increased EURs in a range of 500,000 to 750,000 barrels. 
Recent drilling complete costs for the Williston wells range from $6 million to $8 million gross. 
I'll move on now to Malaysia. Our international oil production was up nearly 10% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The primary driver was Malaysia. Our East Belumut field on PM 323 has performed ahead of expectations in the first half of the year. 
In the second quarter, our net production from Malaysia averaged about 15,000 barrels of oil per day. Unfortunately, as we reported last week, our export pipeline was damaged by an unidentified marine vessel working nearly 20 miles from our East Belumut field. Repairs to the damaged pipeline are expected to take six to eight weeks, and last week, we estimated that the deferred production related to the downtime will total about 500,000 net barrels. Repairs are now underway, and we will update you again when production resumes. We have several new developments underway in Malaysia that are expected to provide additional growth in 2011 and 2012. 
I'll move on now to talk a little bit about building for the future. While our oil production is at record levels, we continue to build for the future and are assessing some significant new oil resource plays, some of which you are aware of, some that you are not. Maverick Basin will be where I'll start. Without a doubt, the Eagle Ford Shale is one of the hottest plays underway today in the U.S. Rig counts continue to rise, and access to completion services remain tight. We have more than 300,000 net acres in the highly prospective Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shale plays and are investing about $100 million this year to thoroughly assess our acreage. 
As of this morning, we are now running five operated rigs in the Maverick Basin and expect to drill about 15 wells in the second half of this year. Nine of these wells will be targeted to Eagle Ford Shale, and the remaining wells will be drilled to the deeper Pearsall Shale. We've drilled two wells to-date, about to TD a third. The first well was a 5,000-foot lateral in the lower Eagle Ford oil window in the northern portion of our acreage. The second was also a 5,000-foot lateral in the wet gas window in the southern portion of our acreage. 
We have a frac crew scheduled to arrive next week, and we'll have our first flow rates very soon. Our completions will be arranged back to back, and we will utilize a completion crew that will work exclusively for Newfield. This ensures that we get the best possible quality and control the timing of our jobs. 
It's important to understand that this is a true assessment program. Simply stated, this means we are sampling our acreage from north to south and intend to be in a position to understand its potential later this year or early next. We will not be making individual well results public and plan to update you of the package of well results at an appropriate time later this year or early next year. 
I'll move on now to the Southern Alberta Basin. We have a similar assessment program underway on our 230,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin of Northern Montana. Prospective formations here are the Lodgepole, Middle Bakken, Sanish and the deeper Nisku. We are preparing to spud our third well now and plan to drill as many as eight wells before year end. We will test both vertical and horizontal wells in multiple formations. Again, we will not be discussing individual well results and plan to update you on the package of wells when we have a comprehensive understanding of our acreage and its potential. 
Although we're not in a position to identify them yet, we're applying our geological lessons learned to new oil plays. These are homegrown plays and have significant potential. Our geoscientists have done a great job of identifying these plays and positioning us early as opposed to being a follower and playing at premium entry price. Acreage costs really do impact economics. I look forward to sharing results with you in the future as we gain additional information. 
I'll move on and talk a little bit about our held-by-production gas plays, plays that are capable of providing growth at the right time. In our operations release, we provided updates on our Mid-Continent resource plays, the Granite Wash and the Woodford Shale. 
Our Mid-Continent division set a recent production record of 360 million cubic feet per day, net. We've been able to grow production over the last several quarters despite a falling rig count in the region 
In the second quarter, we set a Woodford production record of more than 370 million cubic feet a day gross, and we expect that with the decreased rig count, the Woodford production will still grow more than 20% this year. The reallocation of capital, our gas directed rig count, has been slowed to facilitate acceleration in our oil plays. When stronger national gas prices improve economics, we will be in a position to quickly grow our held-by-production gas assets with proven and predictable results. 
Our rig count at the Woodford has decreased from nine rigs at the beginning of the year to four rigs operating today, so we continue to post efficiency gains. An example of this would be our lateral penetration rates, which have improved more than 20% year-to-date versus our average historical numbers. This significant gain in penetration rate allows us to do more with fewer rigs. We're drilling the longer laterals, and we're drilling them faster. 
Our assessment of multiple prospective horizons in the Granite Wash play continues, and by year end, we expect to have tested at least 10 different horizons. We are electing to conduct this comprehensive assessment this year to fully understand the stock potential on our acreage. It's important to remember that we are not simply drilling in one sweet spot. 
To-date, we have drilled 26 horizontal wells across our 46,000 net acre position. We recently drilled our longest lateral to-date in the Granite Wash with nearly 6,300 feet. About half of our planned wells in the second half of 2010 will be drilled to the Marmaton formation where we've seen high liquid yields, helping to improve economics. 
The Granite Wash is our highest return gas play, and we currently plan to run four operator rigs through the balance of 2010. Our current net reduction in the region is around 80 million cubic feet per day. 
Before I conclude our prepared remarks and move to take your questions, let me offer a few insights on what we believe makes Newfield a preferred investment today. Number one, we have options. We have attractive oil and gas assets, and we're pulling the right levers to combine growth and returns. We're confident that our diverse portfolio provides an advantage as we navigate effectively through the challenges in our business environment today. 
Number two, we're making investment decisions around returns. We realize that growth is important, but it's imperative that drilling decisions are based on economics. Our hedge position is very strong, but we are not using our natural gas hedge position as rationale for gas drilling. We are slowing our gas developments because we can and channeling our dollars to oil to capitalize on returns. We will be on a very short list of companies that can grow domestic production in excess of 20% or more in 2010. 
Number three, we are building for our future. Although our budget in 2010 is driven by our expectations for cash flow and our commitment to live within cash flow, keep in mind that there is more than $150 million allocated to assessing new oil and gas plays. It would be easy to simply allocate these dollars for our current development plays, but we must continue to build for the future. Our new assessments have the potential to rise to the top of our investment pyramid and if successful could be a significant part of our future growth in production and reserves. 
Thanks for your continued support of Newfield Exploration. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We're happy to take your questions at this time."

They were all drilled into the same horizon in the Marmaton, one on the east side of the section, one on the west of the section, and I guess you can guess where the third one was, right in the middle. We did that as an initial test early in the program to go ahead and ascertain two things. Number one, variability and deliverability relative to petrophysics within individual target horizons. The east and west sides of that block, we had better petrophysics from the vertical drilling program. In the center, we saw a somewhat deteriorated section. What we found is where we had good rock on the east and west. They performed much better than the rock in the central portion of the section. But all three wells were very good wells, and they've continued to perform very well. So that's, to my knowledge, the only three wells, single-zone section. So you could say a couple hundred acres per well-type volume allocation, relative to the section that we've done. But we did it early, and we've got that in our back pocket in terms of performance as we plan the future development. Our focus has been on assessing the individual horizons. We've talked about there being as many as 30 individual horizons. And I think we're about seven horizon had been now through our testing. So if you think about 26 wells and take the three that I just told you they were in the same zone out, you can get it in appreciation that we've got a relatively sparse drilling within the individual target horizons. And the point there is, we want to understand what the inventory looks like on our acreage, so that we can get it planned appropriately within our portfolio model and future plans. We'll have about 10 of those horizons tested by year end, which is right in line with our pre-2010 expectations."

Oil country tubular goods has been up as much as 20% throughout the organization. Rig rates, as you're probably aware, depending on where you want to start from the ultimate low, could have seen somewhere between 30% to 50%. However, we've had much of that has been either baked into our numbers as we entered the year or under rig contracts. So we haven't seen that translate into the well cost as much. But just as an industry number, that's probably pretty appropriate. On the pumping services side, that number could probably be in its regionally variable in areas like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, as has already been addressed, as extremely competitive. So you could have seen certainly 30%, 35% annual increases in pumping services there. In some cases, maybe you hear more. In other areas, like the Monument Butte, the number would be less than that. So on a completion basis, you can probably take about half of those figures and say, that's what our completion costs are up. So that, on average, I'd say about 15%. On the drilling side, we've seen cost increases anywhere between 5% and 20%, depending on where you're at."

So we haven't changed our position relative to our thoughts on the Marcellus and the team continues to evaluate opportunity each and everyday.

I mean, we've got oil in the portfolio and we've options to accelerate, and we've been exercising those options for most of the last year now, and your seeing the results come through in terms of growing domestic oil volumes.

So we monitor that on a realtime basis and we'll shift accordingly, and I think we've learned a lot over the last year and half or so in terms of our ability to shift, not just capital, but human resources around within the organization. And I think it's a real competitive advantage in the type of market that we're in today. As far as the natural gas market, which I think was your other question in the leadoff, we've been bearish, as you'll recall, since exiting 2008, '09, '10 and '11, and I think that we've not been surprised by how things have played out. I think as long as the rig count continues to run up, and we're being driven by HBP efforts and natural gas plays, it's almost inevitable that you'll continue to be oversupplied. And obviously, in a commodity market, that's bearish and would tend to lead to low-price outcomes in that regard. Having said that, I think once the HBP flurry is behind the industry, and we can get some folks through the flood of money coming in internationally, promoted dollars, then maybe we can get back to more a normal situation where the balanced industry is making economic decisions and making investments on the merits as opposed to making investments for other reasons, which I think is a lot of what's driving the buoyant rig count that we see today. So it's not going to turn over until the rig count turns over and if we get back to a more appropriate supply-demand situation."

As we move to more reduced days, it actually, ultimately requires increased cost in our overall capital budget because we're drilling more wells. As a result of the efficiency gains this year, off the top of my head, when we went from 5.5 days down to 4.5 days, we're going to consume about an extra $80 million this year and CapEx as a result of that. Now the reason we have such a wide range in capital cost is the play actually gets deeper as you move south to north and then not only that, our in-fill wells are all directionally drilled. And more specifically, remember in those costs also, we have our infrastructure costs or tank batteries. So there's a wide variety of factors that could affect a specific well outcome, size of the battery, depth, directional versus straight hull. As far as the spacing goes, on the tribal side, we're drilling many of these wells are on 40s or even, as we step out, these wells could be the first well in a 640, okay? So the infrastructure cost could be higher as a result of that. As we step back into Monument Butte, that is primarily a combination of 40-acre vertical wells as we continue to extend the play. But in addition to that, we're also drilling directional wells from existing pads, which are 20 acres, and that makes up the balance of the Monument Butte proper play."

And today, our Gulf Coast onshore is managing the production associated with those producing assets, which generate really attractive cash flow that's going into our resource plays today. But all of our drilling investments are directed towards assessment programs relative to the Maverick Basin. So we've reshaped that team, and that's kind of a normal cycle. I think the IQ test is, not what you've done historically if that production provides cash flow, it's the incremental investments that you make on a perspective basis. Do they make economic sense? Do they have attractive margins? Do they degenerate the required returns so that you can be a healthy self-sustaining business?

Go back to when my earlier comments, if we remain in the sub-$4 gas price environment and we don't have competitive and other pressures pushing service costs and cost corrected to a $4 environment, so like rolling back to 2003, right? And we have that kind of cost environment, these things are tremendously exciting in terms of returns. $4 with gas price with the day rates that you have to pay if you were drilling in the Haynesville, it doesn't get very exciting. So if the rig is back to that margin question and when you have a dislocation in the service cost side because of abnormal forces driving pumping service, cost or drilling rig rate cost, things of that nature, kind of distorts the return and you get this little dislocation for a period of time.

Very quickly, by way of introduction, I'll announce that Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer; Brian Rickmers, our Controller; Steve Campbell, VP of Investor Relations; and John Jasek, VP of Gulf of Mexico with me here in Houston. And remotely, we have George Dunn, who runs our Mid-Continent business on the line as well.
Along with our earnings release, we issued a separate operations release yesterday updating you on our core focus areas. We don't address your questions on our prepared remarks this morning. We have plenty of time at the end of the call.
If you've seen us recently on the road, you know that our focus is clear. We are delivering on our promises and have our sights fixed on meeting our 2010 year end objectives. From our guidance, you'll see that our production growth will not be less than 11% year-over-year, the upper end of our original guidance range entering 2010.
We are investing in our oil projects and slowering our activities in natural gas plays. Our most recent tally shows that more than 50% of this year's $1.6 billion capital budget is now oil directed. And I'm proud to report that the $1.6 billion remains unchanged since our beginning of the year announcement.
Our domestic oil volumes are expected to increase nearly 25% in 2010 over 2009. We've improved our portfolio management and our margins have increased. Better margins are result of higher returns in the oil plays at constant efforts to lower costs and improve efficiencies and a strong oil and gas hedge position.
Through the optionality of our diversified portfolio of assets, we're able to make improve capital allocation choices while continuing to live within cash flow. And finally, we are committed to building for our future. We have several significant assessments underway that could provide additional options and have a material positive impact on our future.
We continue to look for attractive deals or buttons [ph] in our current focus areas and we are steadfast in our focus to build a portfolio that can outperform through the inevitable cycles.
2011, well, it's now just around the corner. So for the remainder of today's call, I would like to focus on 2011 and our assets that will continue to drive our valuation and performance.
Our entire management team spent three days together in an off-site meeting last week working in our initial game plan for 2011. Our collective work product will go to the Board of Directors in early November. So here's a brief summary of our current thoughts.
First, the macro environment will remain challenged. In our view, 2011 will be a challenging environment in E&P. Natural gas supply continues to exceed demand, the domestic rig count, particularly the horizontal gas directed rig count, remains higher than warranted by pure economics.
We recognized this [indiscernible] early enough to build a strong hedge position. We're well insulated by these hedges and have oil opportunities in our portfolio today that are delivering both growth and excellent returns. Next, we'll continue to stay focused on oil over gas. It's all oil over gas once again. We remain far more constructive on oil than we do natural gas going into 2011.
We will continue to defer significant new investments in our natural gas developments, which are substantially held by production today and require limited drilling to retain our primary turn acreage. The Rocky Mountains will remain the centerpiece of our domestic oil story, and we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong oil growth in 2011.
We are fortunate that our acceleration of oil investments began back in 2009. Because of this, we are guiding toward a 25% increase in our 2010 domestic oil volumes, and a 12% increase on our total company oil volumes. With this, we'll have great momentum on the oil growth as we move into 2011.
Our domestic oil growth since largely from the mining at Butte field [Monument Butte] and the Williston Basin. A continuing installation [ph] of our drilling programs here create strong incremental net present value by shortening our full field development cycle.
At Monument Butte, we have optimized our drilling program to drill more wells, more efficiently than previously thought possible. We will drill about 375 wells this year at Monument Butte, and grow production more than 20%.
Our pace today provides us with operational momentum as we enter 2011. Our development drilling continues in the Williston Basin with four operated rigs running today. Three of these rigs are working on our off Anticline acreage. We have successfully assessed our Catwalk, Aquarium and Watford areas west of the Nesson, and have moved these project areas into the development drum phase.
Our assessment phase is focused on 4,000-foot laterals year-to-date. Our IPs for the 17 wells drilled and completed so far in 2010 averaged about 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As we transition into development, we plan to drill primarily 9,000-foot long laterals. We are currently drilling or completing five long laterals in our off Anticline acreage and expect to complete our first 32 stage frac job later this month in the Watford area. We will have lots of new information from our Williston program late this year. We continue to be excited about the potential of our acreage and expect that our 2011 Williston Basin net production will exceed 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in late 2011.
Our Granite Wash play in the Mid-Continent region continues to be an active focus area for us as well. The Granite Wash play generates superior economics through a combination of high early flow rates, quick payout and the rich gas condensate that makes up the flow stream. 
In the third quarter, just 3.5% of our total company production came in the form of NGLs. Internationally, our production is 100% oil. We averaged nearly 14,000 barrels of oil per day net in the third quarter and are guiding to 20,000 barrels of oil per day net in the fourth quarter.
In Malaysia, our oil projects are very profitable. Keep in mind that our PACS provide for surety of returns in low price environments, as well as a healthy participation in times like today. We break out our international cost structure separately in our release, so that you can better understand our profitability. Today, we are also developing a new field in Malaysia on PM 329 called East Piatu. This oil development will add about 15,000 barrels of oil per day gross late in 2011. Nearly 70% operating interest in this field, which will allow us to grow our Malaysian production in 2012.
Improving margins, growing cash flow per share will be differentiating factors ahead. More than 60% of our current revenues in 2010 will be derived from our oil volumes. Our V tax rate of returns today in the Williston Basin and Monument Butte range from 50% to 90%. Our Granite Wash play is delivering returns of 20% to 60% depending on the NGL condensate contribution.
There is a chart in our recent handouts that shows our margin improvement over the last two years. This is data pulled from public financials where 18 of our peer companies including our self. We moved from 12th place in 2008 to fourth place today. And today, there's only 2% margin difference in the top four names. If you haven't seen the slide, I encouraged you take a look at it.
We are quite proud of this accomplishment. Margins matter and our results can be attributed to aggressive portfolio management quality oil assets, a diligent focus on cost reduction, optimization withdrawing completion programs and a strong hedge position that has added more than $300 million in additional revenues year-to-date.
Natural gas is a great commodity, but not today. Long term, we remain gas fulls [ph]. Natural gas will have a vital role in our domestic energy policy and our energy future. And we will look for ways to improve margins within our gas directed portfolio. It's clean, it's abundant and it's the only logical source of domestic energy that we have to meet our growing future power generation needs.
Short term, we have an oversupply condition. We will continue to slower investment levels in natural gas place until fundamentals provide reason for acceleration. Let me be clear. We have a substantial Woodford Shale portfolio that is profitable at current low gas prices. And I suspect and most operators in our peer group companies have a sweet spot or two in their gas plays as well and we'll provide them with the same option. But with oil assets delivering superior economics, our investment choice is obvious today. We are focused on oil over gas and delivering profitable growth from oil.
We've reduced our gas drilling activities dramatically. In fact, we are only running four dry gas rigs across the company today. If gas prices continue to remain at low levels, we will allocate even less capital to natural gas in 2011.
As a result of lower levels in investment in natural gas plays, you can see in our financials that our gas production is now declining as expected. We anticipate this will continue into 2011. It's the right choice economically. More than 70% of our gas production is hedged for 2011 at about $6. But we will not subsidize less economic drilling with hedges when we have better alternatives in our portfolio and our focus will continue to be profitable growth through oil.
I'm confident that we can deliver healthy production growth for our domestic oil plays and defer our ramp up in natural gas developments into the future.
Service costs align with today's demand, but not tomorrow's. We've seen significant service cost increases in many of our focus areas, namely the Williston Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. Cost increases have come in the form of pressure pumping, day rate increases, oil country tubular goods pricing increases. We've seen increases at 15% to 45% in these areas, and economic margins have contracted. We will continue to align the size of our operations, the steady nature of our drilling programs and our quality of relationships with key service providers to ensure that we get the most competitive price available in our oil plays.
We also rely on our staff a team of professional that continue to impress with an ability to maximize margins. They are diligent in creative efforts and the application of technology. 
For 2011, our game plan will be very simple. Number one, focus on oil growth. Number two, maximize our cash margins. Three, provide consistent and predictable results for our shareholders. And four, continue to build for the future.
We are confident that we have the portfolio of assets in place as we deliver on our game plan and are proven team Newfield will continue delivering Operational Excellence.
Let me briefly cover our financial results for the quarter. For the third quarter, our earning for FAS 133 were $1.10 per share. Our production for the third quarter was 71 Bcf equivalent and includes the impact of approximately 300,000 barrels of deferred production in Malaysia, related to a damaged export pipeline. Our Malaysian team works had and fast and the line was repaired and returned to service in four weeks.
Our 2010 capital budget, as I said earlier, remains unchanged at $1.6 billion. Terry Rathert, our CFO, will be happy to take any questions you may have regarding our quarterly results at the end of this call.
Now I'll move on to give you brief highlights on our assessment programs. In addition to our ongoing operations, I highlighted earlier in the call, we have active assessments underway today in several new areas. I will comment today on two of them, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Southern Alberta Basin.
These oil plays have the potential to game changers in the future for Newfield. The Eagle Ford Shale is one of the hottest plays underway in the U.S. today. We have more than 300,000 net acres in the highly prospective Eagle Ford Shale. And this acreage is added less than one year ago in a very attractive entry costs of approximately $400 per acre.
We're investing about $120 million this year to thoroughly assess our acreage. Our operator rig count has ranged from three to five rigs in recent months and our plans call for 15 wells to be drilled and completed by year end 2010. Today, four of these wells have been completed and turned to sales, and eight of these wells are growing or in various stages of completion today.
As we've consistently stated, we do not plan to make any public announcements about our results until we have comprehensive assessment program completed. We expect to have results to share with you very soon most likely in early 2011. What I can say is that our results today have been consistent with our pre-drill planning and we remain encouraged about the potential of this new area.
We have a similar assessment program underway on our more than 260,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin. We recently PD-ed our fifth well in this region and have completed our first horizontal well.
We will drill as many as eight wells in our assessment campaigns to test multiple formations [ph] across our Southern Alberta acreage block. We're executing our original plan and I'm pleased with our team's operational performance. Again, we will not be discussing individual well results, and we will update you when we have a comprehensive understanding of our acreage and its potential.
I'll move on now to talk about the Gulf of Mexico. As you're all aware last week, the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico was lifted this was a great first step to return our industry back to work in the Gulf.
We have a great track record of safety and environmental stewardship that spans decades. And I am confident that their horrific at Macondo was an isolated event and not indicative of our industry and more specifically how Newfield operates.  Although the moratorium has lifted, lots of uncertainty remains.  We will carefully review the new rules and regulations. We will carefully assess the implied economic changes and use this information to help determine our path forward in the deep water Gulf of Mexico exploration arena.
In the meantime, our development programs are all on track. Initial gross production from Gladden project is scheduled for December 2010 at about 4,750 barrels of oil per day. We have a 57½% working interest at Gladden. Our Pyrenees project is slated for first production in the fourth quarter of next year and our Dalmatian and Axe projects are currently scheduled to come online in 2013.
In closing, as we enter the homestretch in 2010, I want to reflect on the slide that we provided in our IR presentations at the beginning of the year. We listed our vision for 2010 as follows: Number one, continue to focus on domestic resource plays at scale. We are clearly doing so and are simultaneously assessing two significant plays that cover more than 500,000 net acres. We're also continuing to expand our footprint at the Monument Butte field. We wanted to focus on oil over gas and the proof is on our oil growth numbers for both 2010 and in our expected 2011 oil production volumes.
The second item was harvest assets and optimize the portfolio. We have [indiscernible] our conventional South Texas teams to focus on unconventional basins. The cash flow from our conventional assets is helping to fund this transformation. Thirdly, deploy people and capital to the best growth opportunities. From our improvement in margins, the results of capital discipline and more effective capital allocation are readily apparent. Our people are focused on the right assets and on doing the right things right.
Lastly, maintain financial strength. Early this year, we retired some term debt and our first maturity is now [indiscernible] until 2014. We have recently upgraded to Investment Grade by S&P. Our balance sheet is strong, our revolver is undrawn and we have one of the most valuable hedge position in oil and gas in our peer group.
I like where we sit today, and I'm truly looking forward to 2011. Thanks for your continued support of Newfield Exploration. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're happy to take your questions at this time."

So that's interrupted some of the volumes that will result in the build of inventory that we would anticipate taking out first quarter. And then also, related to your prior question, on the completions in the Williston Basin. I'd say, through the bulk of 2010, we were sitting in about 25 days or so when we took the well from TD to being placed on production. We've seen that slide as activities increase today. We'll probably sit at about 45 or 50 days. And we've anticipated in the fourth quarter that, that number could expand a little bit due to the winter conditions, as well as some of the pressure on services. Again, we'll see that improve as we move into the first quarter. And then maybe, finally, anytime we step into these assessment programs early on, takeaway capacity is a little less predictable. As a result of that, infrastructure has to keep up with your completions. And that's probably been a minor amount of the difference.

Welcome to the third quarter conference call. I'd like to thank all of you for your continued interest in Newfield. Very quickly, by way of introduction, I'll announce that Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer; Brian Rickmers, our Controller; Steve Campbell, VP of Investor Relations; and John Jasek, VP of Gulf of Mexico are with me here in Houston. And remotely, we have George Dunn, who runs our Mid-Continent business on the line as well.
Along with our earnings release, we issued a separate operations release yesterday updating you on our core focus areas. If we don't address your questions on our prepared remarks this morning, we'll have plenty of time at the end of the call.
If you've seen us recently on the road, you know that our focus is clear. We are delivering on our promises and have our sights fixed on meeting our 2010 year end objectives. From our guidance, you'll see that our production growth will not be less than 11% year-over-year, the upper end of our original guidance range entering 2010.
We are investing in our oil projects and slowing our activities in natural gas plays. Our most recent tally shows that more than 50% of this year's $1.6 billion capital budget is now oil directed. And I'm proud to report that the $1.6 billion remains unchanged since our beginning of year announcement.
Our domestic oil volumes are expected to increase nearly 25% in 2010 over 2009. We've improved our portfolio management and our margins have increased. Better margins are a result of higher returns in the oil plays at constant efforts to lower costs and improve efficiencies and a strong oil and gas hedge position.
Through the optionality of our diversified portfolio of assets, we were able to make improved capital allocation choices while continuing to live within cash flow. And finally, we are committed to building for our future. We have several significant assessments underway that could provide additional options and have a material positive impact on our future.
We continue to look for attractive deals or bolt-ons in our current focus areas and we are steadfast in our focus to build a portfolio that can outperform through the inevitable cycles.
2011, well, it's now just around the corner. So for the remainder of today's call, I would like to focus on 2011 and our assets that will continue to drive our valuation and performance.
Our entire management team spent three days together in an off-site meeting last week working on our initial game plan for 2011. Our collective work product will go to the Board of Directors in early November. So here's a brief summary of our current thoughts.
First, the macro environment will remain challenged. In our view, 2011 will be a challenging environment in E&P. Natural gas supply continues to exceed demand, the domestic rig count, particularly the horizontal gas directed rig count, remains higher than warranted by pure economics.
We recognized this dilemma early enough to build a strong hedge position. We're well insulated by these hedges and have oil opportunities in our portfolio today that are delivering both growth and excellent returns. Next, we'll continue to stay focused on oil over gas. It's oil over gas once again. We'll remain far more constructive on oil than we do natural gas going into 2011.
We will continue to defer significant new investments in our natural gas developments, which are substantially held by production today and require limited drilling to retain our primary turn acreage. The Rocky Mountains will remain the centerpiece of our domestic oil story, and we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong oil growth in 2011.
We are fortunate that our acceleration of oil investments began back in 2009. Because of this, we are guiding toward a 25% increase in our 2010 domestic oil volumes, and a 12% increase on our total company oil volumes. With this, we'll have great momentum on the oil growth as we move into 2011.
Our domestic oil growth stems largely from the mining at Butte field [Monument Butte] and the Williston Basin. A continuing acceleration of our drilling programs here create strong incremental net present value by shortening our full field development cycle.
At Monument Butte, we have optimized our drilling program to drill more wells, more efficiently than previously thought possible. We will drill about 375 wells this year at Monument Butte, and grow production more than 20%.
Our pace today provides us with operational momentum as we enter 2011. Our development drilling continues in the Williston Basin with four operated rigs running today. Three of these rigs are working on our off Anticline acreage. We have successfully assessed our Catwalk, Aquarium and Watford areas west of the Nesson, and have moved these project areas into the development drum phase.
Our assessment phase is focused on 4,000-foot laterals year-to-date. Our IPs for the 17 wells drilled and completed so far in 2010 average about 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As we transition into development, we plan to drill primarily 9,000-foot long laterals. We are currently drilling or completing five long laterals in our off Anticline acreage and expect to complete our first 32 stage frac job later this month in the Watford area. We will have lots of new information from our Williston program late this year. We continue to be excited about the potential of our acreage and expect that our 2011 Williston Basin net production will exceed 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in late 2011.
Our Granite Wash play in the Mid-Continent region continues to be an active focus area for us as well. The Granite Wash play generates superior economics through a combination of high early flow rates, quick payout and the rich gas condensate that makes up the flow stream. 
In the third quarter, just 3.5% of our total company production came in the form of NGLs. Internationally, our production is 100% oil. We averaged nearly 14,000 barrels of oil per day net in the third quarter and are guiding to 20,000 barrels of oil per day net in the fourth quarter.
In Malaysia, our oil projects are very profitable. Keep in mind that our PACS provide for surety of returns in low price environments, as well as a healthy participation in times like today. We break out our international cost structure separately in our release, so that you can better understand our profitability. Today, we are also developing a new field in Malaysia on PM 329 called East Piatu. This oil development will add about 15,000 barrels of oil per day gross late in 2011. Nearly 70% operating interest in this field, which will allow us to grow our Malaysian production in 2012.
Improving margins, growing cash flow per share will be differentiating factors ahead. More than 60% of our current revenues in 2010 will be derived from our oil volumes. Our V tax rate of returns today in the Williston Basin and Monument Butte range from 50% to 90%. Our Granite Wash play is delivering returns of 20% to 60% depending on the NGL condensate contribution.
There is a chart in our recent handouts that shows our margin improvement over the last two years. This is data pulled from public financials for 18 of our peer companies including our self. We moved from 12th place in 2008 to fourth place today. And today, there's only 2% margin difference in the top four names. If you haven't seen this slide, I encourage you take a look at it.
We are quite proud of this accomplishment. Margins matter and our results can be attributed to aggressive portfolio management, quality oil assets, a diligent focus on cost reduction, optimization where [ph] (0:23:47) drilling the completion programs and a strong hedge position that has added more than $300 million in additional revenues year-to-date.
Natural gas is a great commodity, but not today. Long term, we remain gas fulls [ph]. Natural gas will have a vital role in our domestic energy policy and our energy future. And we will look for ways to improve margins within our gas directed portfolio. It's clean, it's abundant and it's the only logical source of domestic energy that we have to meet our growing future power generation needs.
Short term, we have an oversupply condition. We will continue to slow our investment levels in natural gas place until fundamentals provide reason for acceleration. Let me be clear. We have a substantial Woodford Shale portfolio that is profitable at current low gas prices. And I suspect and most operators in our peer group companies have a sweet spot or two in their gas plays as well and we'll provide them with the same option. But with oil assets delivering superior economics, our investment choice is obvious today. We are focused on oil over gas and delivering profitable growth from oil.
We've reduced our gas drilling activities dramatically. In fact, we are only running four dry gas rigs across the company today. If gas prices continue to remain at low levels, we will allocate even less capital to natural gas in 2011.
As a result of lower levels of investment in natural gas plays, you can see in our financials that our gas production is now declining as expected. We anticipate this will continue into 2011. It's the right choice economically. More than 70% of our gas production is hedged for 2011 at about $6. But we will not subsidize less economic drilling with hedges when we have better alternatives in our portfolio and our focus will continue to be profitable growth through oil.
I'm confident that we can deliver healthy production growth from our domestic oil plays and defer our ramp up in natural gas developments into the future.
Service costs align with today's demand, but not tomorrow's. We've seen significant service cost increases in many of our focus areas, namely the Williston Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. Cost increases have come in the form of pressure pumping, day rate increases, oil country tubular good price increases. We've seen increases at 15% to 45% in these areas, and economic margins have contracted. We will continue to rely on the size of our operations, the steady nature of our drilling programs and our quality of relationships with key service providers to ensure that we get the most competitive price available in our oil plays.
We also rely on our staff, a team of professionals that continue to impress with an ability to maximize margins through their diligent and creative efforts and the application of technology. 
For 2011, our game plan will be very simple. Number one, focus on oil growth. Number two, maximize our cash margins. Three, provide consistent and predictable results for our shareholders. And four, continue to build for the future.
We are confident that we have the portfolio of assets in place to deliver on our game plan and our proven team Newfield will continue delivering Operational Excellence.
Let me briefly cover our financial results for the quarter. For the third quarter, our earning for FAS 133 were $1.10 per share. Our production for the third quarter was 71 Bcf equivalent and includes the impact of approximately 300,000 barrels of deferred production in Malaysia, related to a damaged export pipeline. Our Malaysian team works hard and fast and the line was repaired and returned to service in four weeks.
Our 2010 capital budget, as I said earlier, remains unchanged at $1.6 billion. Terry Rathert, our CFO, will be happy to take any questions you may have regarding our quarterly results at the end of this call.
Now I'll move on to give you brief highlights on our assessment programs. In addition to our ongoing operations, I highlighted earlier in the call, we have active assessments underway today in several new areas. I will comment today on two of them, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Southern Alberta Basin.
These oil plays have the potential to be game changers in the future for Newfield. The Eagle Ford Shale is one of the hottest plays underway in the U.S. today. We have more than 300,000 net acres in the highly prospective Eagle Ford Shale. And this acreage was added less than one year ago and their very attractive entry costs were approximately $400 per acre.
We're investing about $120 million this year to thoroughly assess our acreage. Our operator rig count has ranged from three to five rigs in recent months and our plans call for 15 wells to be drilled and completed by year end 2010. To date, four of these wells have been completed and turned to sales, and eight of these wells are growing or in various stages of completion today.
As we've consistently stated, we do not plan to make any public announcements about our results until we have comprehensive assessment program completed. We expect to have results to share with you very soon most likely in early 2011. What I can say is that our results today have been consistent with our pre-drill planning and we remain encouraged about the potential of this new area.
We have a similar assessment program underway on our more than 260,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin. We recently TDed our fifth well in this region and have completed our first horizontal well.
We will drill as many as eight wells in our assessment campaigns to test multiple formations across our Southern Alberta acreage block. We're executing our original plan and I'm pleased with our team's operational performance. Again, we will not be discussing individual well results, and we will update you when we have a comprehensive understanding over acreage and its potential.
I'll move on now to talk about the Gulf of Mexico. As you're all aware last week, the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico was lifted this was a great first step to return our industry back to work in the Gulf.
We have a great track record of safety and environmental stewardship that spans decades. And I am confident that the horrific tragedy at Macondo was an isolated event and not indicative of our industry and more specifically how Newfield operates.  Although the moratorium has lifted, lots of uncertainty remains.  We will carefully review the new rules and regulations. We will carefully assess the implied economic changes and use this information to help determine our path forward in the deep water Gulf of Mexico exploration arena.
In the meantime, our development programs are all on track. Initial gross production from Gladden project is scheduled for December 2010 at about 4,750 barrels of oil per day. We have a 57½% working interest at Gladden. Our Pyrenees project is slated for first production in the fourth quarter of next year and our Dalmatian and Axe projects are currently scheduled to come online in 2013.
In closing, as we enter the homestretch in 2010, I want to reflect on the slide that we provided in our IR presentations at the beginning of the year. We listed our vision for 2010 as follows: Number one, continue to focus on domestic resource plays of scale. We are clearly doing so and are simultaneously assessing two significant plays that cover more than 500,000 net acres. We're also continuing to expand our footprint at the Monument Butte field. We wanted to focus on oil over gas and the proof is in our oil growth numbers for both 2010 and in our expected 2011 oil production volumes.
The second item was harvest assets and optimize the portfolio. We have refueled our conventional South Texas teams to focus on unconventional basins. The cash flow from our conventional assets is helping to fund this transformation. Thirdly, deploy people and capital to the best growth opportunities. From our improvement in margins, the results of capital discipline and more effective capital allocation are readily apparent. Our people are focused on the right assets and on doing the right things right.
Lastly, maintain financial strength. Earlier this year, we retired some term debt and our first maturity is now not until 2014. We were recently upgraded to Investment Grade by S&P. Our balance sheet is strong, our revolver is undrawn and we have one of the most valuable hedge position in oil and gas in our peer group.
I like where we sit today, and I'm truly looking forward to 2011. Thanks for your continued support of Newfield Exploration. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're happy to take your questions at this time."

As we entered the winter market, the Salt Lake City refineries typically enter in a turnaround period, whether converted to their winter diesels, which have different cost point.  Two of our refineries encountered that, and we'll be encountering that as we move into the fourth quarter. So that's interrupted some of the volumes that will result in a build of inventory that we would anticipate taking out the first quarter. And then also, related to your prior question, on the completions in the Williston Basin. I'd say, through the bulk of 2010, we were sitting at about 25 days or so when we took the well from TD to being placed on production. We've seen that slide as activities increase today. We'll probably sitting at about 45 or 50 days. And we've anticipated in the fourth quarter that, that number could expand a little bit due to the winter conditions, as well as some of the pressure on services. Again, we'll see that improve as we move into the first quarter. And then maybe, finally, anytime we step into these assessment programs early on, takeaway capacity is a little less predictable. As a result of that, infrastructure has to keep up with your completions. And that's probably been a minor amount of the difference.

The other thing that we're looking at out there is rail. That is certainly an option for us. Historically, we can all go back several years and it was kind of a last minute and we saw that this differentials attributed to rail are relatively high. But we're looking at it from a longer range planning view and I think it presents an opportunity that's more cost-effective than maybe what it historically was thought to be. And that's another option for us right now.

And those of who had to call back in, I appreciate you calling back in. So I apologize for the delay, but we'll get moving with the call.
Welcome to the third quarter conference call. I'd like to thank all of you for your continued interest in Newfield. Very quickly, by way of introduction, I'll announce that Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer; Brian Rickmers, our Controller; Steve Campbell, VP of Investor Relations; and John Jasek, VP of Gulf of Mexico are with me here in Houston. And remotely, we have George Dunn, who runs our Mid-Continent business on the line as well.
Along with our earnings release, we issued a separate operations release yesterday updating you on our core focus areas. If we don't address your questions on our prepared remarks this morning, we'll have plenty of time at the end of the call.
If you've seen us recently on the road, you know that our focus is clear. We are delivering on our promises and have our sights fixed on meeting our 2010 year end objectives. From our guidance, you'll see that our production growth will not be less than 11% year-over-year, the upper end of our original guidance range entering 2010.
We are investing in our oil projects and slowing our activities in natural gas plays. Our most recent tally shows that more than 50% of this year's $1.6 billion capital budget is now oil directed. And I'm proud to report that the $1.6 billion remains unchanged since our beginning of year announcement.
Our domestic oil volumes are expected to increase nearly 25% in 2010 over 2009. We've improved our portfolio management and our margins have increased. Better margins are a result of higher returns in the oil plays at constant efforts to lower costs and improve efficiencies and a strong oil and gas hedge position.
Through the optionality of our diversified portfolio of assets, we were able to make improved capital allocation choices while continuing to live within cash flow. And finally, we are committed to building for our future. We have several significant assessments underway that could provide additional options and have a material positive impact on our future.
We continue to look for attractive deals or bolt-ons in our current focus areas and we are steadfast in our focus to build a portfolio that can outperform through the inevitable cycles.
2011, well, it's now just around the corner. So for the remainder of today's call, I would like to focus on 2011 and our assets that will continue to drive our valuation and performance.
Our entire management team spent three days together in an off-site meeting last week working on our initial game plan for 2011. Our collective work product will go to the Board of Directors in early November. So here's a brief summary of our current thoughts.
First, the macro environment will remain challenged. In our view, 2011 will be a challenging environment in E&P. Natural gas supply continues to exceed demand, the domestic rig count, particularly the horizontal gas directed rig count, remains higher than warranted by pure economics.
We recognized this dilemma early enough to build a strong hedge position. We're well insulated by these hedges and have oil opportunities in our portfolio today that are delivering both growth and excellent returns. Next, we'll continue to stay focused on oil over gas. It's oil over gas once again. We'll remain far more constructive on oil than we do natural gas going into 2011.
We will continue to defer significant new investments in our natural gas developments, which are substantially held by production today and require limited drilling to retain our primary turn acreage. The Rocky Mountains will remain the centerpiece of our domestic oil story, and we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong oil growth in 2011.
We are fortunate that our acceleration of oil investments began back in 2009. Because of this, we are guiding toward a 25% increase in our 2010 domestic oil volumes, and a 12% increase on our total company oil volumes. With this, we'll have great momentum on the oil growth as we move into 2011.
Our domestic oil growth stems largely from the mining at Butte field [Monument Butte] and the Williston Basin. A continuing acceleration of our drilling programs here create strong incremental net present value by shortening our full field development cycle.
At Monument Butte, we have optimized our drilling program to drill more wells, more efficiently than previously thought possible. We will drill about 375 wells this year at Monument Butte, and grow production more than 20%.
Our pace today provides us with operational momentum as we enter 2011. Our development drilling continues in the Williston Basin with four operated rigs running today. Three of these rigs are working on our off Anticline acreage. We have successfully assessed our Catwalk, Aquarium and Watford areas west of the Nesson, and have moved these project areas into the development drum phase.
Our assessment phase is focused on 4,000-foot laterals year-to-date. Our IPs for the 17 wells drilled and completed so far in 2010 average about 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As we transition into development, we plan to drill primarily 9,000-foot long laterals. We are currently drilling or completing five long laterals in our off Anticline acreage and expect to complete our first 32 stage frac job later this month in the Watford area. We will have lots of new information from our Williston program late this year. We continue to be excited about the potential of our acreage and expect that our 2011 Williston Basin net production will exceed 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in late 2011.
Our Granite Wash play in the Mid-Continent region continues to be an active focus area for us as well. The Granite Wash play generates superior economics through a combination of high early flow rates, quick payout and the rich gas condensate that makes up the flow stream. 
In the third quarter, just 3.5% of our total company production came in the form of NGLs. Internationally, our production is 100% oil. We averaged nearly 14,000 barrels of oil per day net in the third quarter and are guiding to 20,000 barrels of oil per day net in the fourth quarter.
In Malaysia, our oil projects are very profitable. Keep in mind that our PACS provide for surety of returns in low price environments, as well as a healthy participation in times like today. We break out our international cost structure separately in our release, so that you can better understand our profitability. Today, we are also developing a new field in Malaysia on PM 329 called East Piatu. This oil development will add about 15,000 barrels of oil per day gross late in 2011. Nearly 70% operating interest in this field, which will allow us to grow our Malaysian production in 2012.
Improving margins, growing cash flow per share will be differentiating factors ahead. More than 60% of our current revenues in 2010 will be derived from our oil volumes. Our V tax rate of returns today in the Williston Basin and Monument Butte range from 50% to 90%. Our Granite Wash play is delivering returns of 20% to 60% depending on the NGL condensate contribution.
There is a chart in our recent handouts that shows our margin improvement over the last two years. This is data pulled from public financials for 18 of our peer companies including our self. We moved from 12th place in 2008 to fourth place today. And today, there's only 2% margin difference in the top four names. If you haven't seen this slide, I encourage you take a look at it.
We are quite proud of this accomplishment. Margins matter and our results can be attributed to aggressive portfolio management, quality oil assets, a diligent focus on cost reduction, optimization where [ph] (0:23:47) drilling the completion programs and a strong hedge position that has added more than $300 million in additional revenues year-to-date.
Natural gas is a great commodity, but not today. Long term, we remain gas fulls [ph]. Natural gas will have a vital role in our domestic energy policy and our energy future. And we will look for ways to improve margins within our gas directed portfolio. It's clean, it's abundant and it's the only logical source of domestic energy that we have to meet our growing future power generation needs.
Short term, we have an oversupply condition. We will continue to slow our investment levels in natural gas place until fundamentals provide reason for acceleration. Let me be clear. We have a substantial Woodford Shale portfolio that is profitable at current low gas prices. And I suspect and most operators in our peer group companies have a sweet spot or two in their gas plays as well and we'll provide them with the same option. But with oil assets delivering superior economics, our investment choice is obvious today. We are focused on oil over gas and delivering profitable growth from oil.
We've reduced our gas drilling activities dramatically. In fact, we are only running four dry gas rigs across the company today. If gas prices continue to remain at low levels, we will allocate even less capital to natural gas in 2011.
As a result of lower levels of investment in natural gas plays, you can see in our financials that our gas production is now declining as expected. We anticipate this will continue into 2011. It's the right choice economically. More than 70% of our gas production is hedged for 2011 at about $6. But we will not subsidize less economic drilling with hedges when we have better alternatives in our portfolio and our focus will continue to be profitable growth through oil.
I'm confident that we can deliver healthy production growth from our domestic oil plays and defer our ramp up in natural gas developments into the future.
Service costs align with today's demand, but not tomorrow's. We've seen significant service cost increases in many of our focus areas, namely the Williston Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. Cost increases have come in the form of pressure pumping, day rate increases, oil country tubular good price increases. We've seen increases at 15% to 45% in these areas, and economic margins have contracted. We will continue to rely on the size of our operations, the steady nature of our drilling programs and our quality of relationships with key service providers to ensure that we get the most competitive price available in our oil plays.
We also rely on our staff, a team of professionals that continue to impress with an ability to maximize margins through their diligent and creative efforts and the application of technology. 
For 2011, our game plan will be very simple. Number one, focus on oil growth. Number two, maximize our cash margins. Three, provide consistent and predictable results for our shareholders. And four, continue to build for the future.
We are confident that we have the portfolio of assets in place to deliver on our game plan and our proven team Newfield will continue delivering Operational Excellence.
Let me briefly cover our financial results for the quarter. For the third quarter, our earning for FAS 133 were $1.10 per share. Our production for the third quarter was 71 Bcf equivalent and includes the impact of approximately 300,000 barrels of deferred production in Malaysia, related to a damaged export pipeline. Our Malaysian team works hard and fast and the line was repaired and returned to service in four weeks.
Our 2010 capital budget, as I said earlier, remains unchanged at $1.6 billion. Terry Rathert, our CFO, will be happy to take any questions you may have regarding our quarterly results at the end of this call.
Now I'll move on to give you brief highlights on our assessment programs. In addition to our ongoing operations, I highlighted earlier in the call, we have active assessments underway today in several new areas. I will comment today on two of them, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Southern Alberta Basin.
These oil plays have the potential to be game changers in the future for Newfield. The Eagle Ford Shale is one of the hottest plays underway in the U.S. today. We have more than 300,000 net acres in the highly prospective Eagle Ford Shale. And this acreage was added less than one year ago and their very attractive entry costs were approximately $400 per acre.
We're investing about $120 million this year to thoroughly assess our acreage. Our operator rig count has ranged from three to five rigs in recent months and our plans call for 15 wells to be drilled and completed by year end 2010. To date, four of these wells have been completed and turned to sales, and eight of these wells are growing or in various stages of completion today.
As we've consistently stated, we do not plan to make any public announcements about our results until we have comprehensive assessment program completed. We expect to have results to share with you very soon most likely in early 2011. What I can say is that our results today have been consistent with our pre-drill planning and we remain encouraged about the potential of this new area.
We have a similar assessment program underway on our more than 260,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin. We recently TDed our fifth well in this region and have completed our first horizontal well.
We will drill as many as eight wells in our assessment campaigns to test multiple formations across our Southern Alberta acreage block. We're executing our original plan and I'm pleased with our team's operational performance. Again, we will not be discussing individual well results, and we will update you when we have a comprehensive understanding over acreage and its potential.
I'll move on now to talk about the Gulf of Mexico. As you're all aware last week, the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico was lifted this was a great first step to return our industry back to work in the Gulf.
We have a great track record of safety and environmental stewardship that spans decades. And I am confident that the horrific tragedy at Macondo was an isolated event and not indicative of our industry and more specifically how Newfield operates.  Although the moratorium has lifted, lots of uncertainty remains.  We will carefully review the new rules and regulations. We will carefully assess the implied economic changes and use this information to help determine our path forward in the deep water Gulf of Mexico exploration arena.
In the meantime, our development programs are all on track. Initial gross production from Gladden project is scheduled for December 2010 at about 4,750 barrels of oil per day. We have a 57½% working interest at Gladden. Our Pyrenees project is slated for first production in the fourth quarter of next year and our Dalmatian and Axe projects are currently scheduled to come online in 2013.
In closing, as we enter the homestretch in 2010, I want to reflect on the slide that we provided in our IR presentations at the beginning of the year. We listed our vision for 2010 as follows: Number one, continue to focus on domestic resource plays of scale. We are clearly doing so and are simultaneously assessing two significant plays that cover more than 500,000 net acres. We're also continuing to expand our footprint at the Monument Butte field. We wanted to focus on oil over gas and the proof is in our oil growth numbers for both 2010 and in our expected 2011 oil production volumes.
The second item was harvest assets and optimize the portfolio. We have refueled our conventional South Texas teams to focus on unconventional basins. The cash flow from our conventional assets is helping to fund this transformation. Thirdly, deploy people and capital to the best growth opportunities. From our improvement in margins, the results of capital discipline and more effective capital allocation are readily apparent. Our people are focused on the right assets and on doing the right things right.
Lastly, maintain financial strength. Earlier this year, we retired some term debt and our first maturity is now not until 2014. We were recently upgraded to Investment Grade by S&P. Our balance sheet is strong, our revolver is undrawn and we have one of the most valuable hedge position in oil and gas in our peer group.
I like where we sit today, and I'm truly looking forward to 2011. Thanks for your continued support of Newfield Exploration. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're happy to take your questions at this time."

And then also, related to your prior question, on the completions in the Williston Basin. I'd say, through the bulk of 2010, we were sitting at about 25 days or so when we took the well from TD to being placed on production. We've seen that slide as activities increase today. We'll probably sitting at about 45 or 50 days. And we've anticipated in the fourth quarter that, that number could expand a little bit due to the winter conditions, as well as some of the pressure on services. Again, we'll see that improve as we move into the first quarter. And then maybe, finally, anytime we step into these assessment programs early on, takeaway capacity is a little less predictable. As a result of that, infrastructure has to keep up with your completions. And that's probably been a minor amount of the difference.

And then with that, I guess, operationally, the debottlenecking that we did at PM 323 has been very successful. The team's done a great job. Not only in returning that pipeline to production but also maximizing the production out of our East Belumut field."

To be clear, we have not drilled and completed a 9,000-foot lateral yet. So some of that is an estimation of what we will spend at this point in time with the higher completion costs factored in. Absolutely, as I look into next year, I would anticipate our team as we drill the 9,000-foot laterals, 32-stage completions, we'll be able to push back on those costs.

And then as we move the next -- and I'm not talking about our assessment plays at this point, I'm just focus on development plays. It would be the Granite Wash, specifically the Marmaton. I would say that the Marmaton drilling in the Granite Wash competes favorably improbably, and probably right behind our Williston program. And as referenced earlier, if it continues to see cost pressures, it may depending on the well that we'd select it could actually, maybe rise above that. And then this would be followed by the Atoka drilling. So I'd say generically, V tax, today you could probably see as much as a 50%, 60% return, if we drill Britt [ph] (0:57:15) like wells targeting the proven Marmaton section."

We've talked a lot over the course of the last year about portfolio model that how we built and how we're using it to help manage the business day-to-day. I think if you go back and look at Newfield's history, we've made a number of strategic moves on off cycle periods when the market's not frothy. Frankly, we like the look of gas and frothy oil market in terms of adding to the portfolio. But our mission is going to be the same. Nothing will be added to the Newfield's portfolio that can't compete at the front of the line. I think that's a healthy perspective for us to have and that's the guidance that we give our hunters that are out there chasing opportunities everyday of the week. We ended this year saying that we were going to continue to build for the future, and I've already told you we're going to continue to keep that focus for 2011.

And those of you who had to call back in, I appreciate you calling back in. So I apologize for the delay, but we’ll get moving with the call.
Welcome to the third quarter conference call. I’d like to thank all of you for your continued interest in Newfield. Very quickly, by a way of introduction, I’ll announce that Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer; Brian Rickmers, our Controller; Steve Campbell, VP of Investor Relations; and John Jasek, VP of Gulf of Mexico are with me here in Houston. And, remotely, we have George Dunn, who runs our Mid-Continent Business on the line as well.
Along with our earnings release, we issued a separate operations release yesterday, updating you on our core focus areas. We don’t address your questions in our prepared remarks this morning. We’ll have plenty of time at the end of the call.
If you’ve seen us recently on the road, you know that our focus is clear. We are delivering on our promises and have our sights fixed on meeting our 2010 year-end objectives. From our guidance, you will see that our production growth will not be less than 11% year-over-year, the upper end of our original guidance range entering 2010.
We’re investing in our oil projects and soaring our activities in natural gas plays. Our most recent tally shows that more than 50% of this year’s $1.6 billion capital budget is now oil directed. And I’m proud to report that the $1.6 billion remains unchanged since our beginning of year announcement.
Our domestic oil volumes are expected to increase nearly 25% in 2010 over 2009. We’ve improved our portfolio management and our margins have increased. Better margins are a result of higher returns in the oil plays, they’re constant efforts of lower costs and improved efficiencies, and a strong oil and gas hedge position. Through the optionality of our diversified portfolio of assets, we’re able to make improved capital allocation choices while continuing to live within cash flow.
And, finally, we are committed to building for our future. We have several significant assessments underway that could provide additional options and have a material positive impact on our future. We continue to look for attractive deals or bolt-ons in our current focus areas and we are steadfast in our focus to build a portfolio which can outperform through the inevitable cycles.
2011, well it’s now just around the corner. So for the remainder of today’s call, I would like to focus on 2011 and our assets that will continue to drive our evaluation and performance.
Our entire management team spent three days together in an offsite meeting last week working on our initial game plan for 2011. Our collective work product will go to the Board of Directors in early November. So here is a brief summary of our current thoughts.
First, the macro environment will remain challenged. In our view, 2011 will be a challenging environment in E&P. Natural gas supply continues to exceed demand, the domestic rig count particularly the horizontal gas directed rig count remains higher than warranted by pure economics. We recognized this climate [ph] early enough to build a strong hedge position. We’re very well insulated by these hedges and have oil opportunities and our portfolio today that is delivering both growth and excellent returns.
Next, we will continue to stay focused on oil over gas. It’s oil over gas once again. We will remain far more constructive on oil than we do natural gas going into 2011. We will continue to defer significant new investments in our natural gas development which were substantially held by production today and require limited drilling to retain primary term acreage. The Rocky Mountains will remain a centerpiece of our domestic oil story. And we are confident that we can continue deliver strong oil growth in 2011.
We are fortunate that our acceleration of oil investments began back in 2009. Because of this, we are guiding toward a 25% increase in our 2010 domestic oil volumes and a 12% increase from our total company oil volumes. With this, we will have great momentum on the oil growth as we move into 2011.
Our domestic oil growth stems largely from the Monument Butte Field in the Williston Basin. A continuing acceleration of our drilling programs here creates strong incremental net present value by shortening our full fuel development cycle. At Monument Butte, we have optimized our drilling programs to drill more well more efficiently and previously thought possible. We will drill about 375 wells this year at Monument Butte and grow production more than 20%.
Our pace today provides us with operational momentum as we enter 2011. Our development drilling continues in the Williston Basin with four operated rigs running today. Three of these rigs are working on our off Anticline acreage. We have successfully assessed our Catwalk, Aquarium and Watford areas, west of the Nesson and have moved these project areas into the development drilling phase.
Our assessment phase is focused on 4,000 foot laterals year-to-date. Our IPs for the 17 wells drilled and completed so far in 2010 average about 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As we transition into development we’ve planned to drill primarily 9,000 foot long laterals. We are currently drilling or completing five long laterals in our off Anticline acreage and expect to complete our first 32-stage frac job later this month in the Watford area.
We have lots of new information from our Williston program late this year. We continue to be excited about the potential of our acreage and expect that our 2011 Williston Basin net production will exceed 10,000 barrels oil equivalent per day in late 2011. 
Our Granite Wash play in the Mid-Continent range continues to be an active focus area for us as well. The Granite Wash play generates superior economics through a combination of high early flow rates, quick payout, and the rich gas condensate that makes up the flow stream. In the third quarter, just 3.5% of our total company production came in the form of NGLs.
Internationally, our production is 100% oil. We average nearly 14,000 barrels of oil per day net in the third quarter and are guiding to 20,000 barrels of oil per day net in the fourth quarter. In Malaysia, our oil projects are very profitable. Keep in mind that our PSEs provide for surety of returns in low-priced environments, as well as a healthy participation in times like today. We break out our international cost structure separately in our release, so that you can better understand our profitability.
Today, we are also developing a new field in Malaysia on PM 329 called East Piatu. This oil development will add about 15,000 barrels of oil per day gross, late in 2011. We have a 70% operator interest in this field which will allow us to grow our Malaysian production in 2012.
Improving margins, growing cash flow per share will be differencing aiding factors ahead. We are in a 60% of our current revenues in 2010 will be derived from our oil volumes. Our B tax rate of returns today in the Williston Basin and Monument Butte range from 50% to 90%. Our Granite Wash play is delivering returns of 20% to 60% depending on the NGO count as a contribution.
There is a charge in our recent handouts that shows our margin improvement over the last two years. This is data pooled from public financials for 18 of our peer companies including ourselves. We moved from 12th place in 2008 to 4th place today. And today there is only 2% margin difference in the top four names. If you haven’t seen the slide, I will encourage you to take a look at it. 
We are quite proud of this accomplishment. Margins matter and our results can be attributed to aggressive portfolio management, quality oil assets, a diligent focus on cost reduction, optimization of our drilling completion programs, and a strong hedge position that has added more than $300 million in additional revenues year-to-date.
Natural gas is a great commodity but not today. Long term, we remain gas bulls. Natural gas will have a vital role in our domestic energy policy and our energy future. And we will look for ways to improve margins within our gas directed portfolio. It’s clean, it’s abundant and it’s the only logical source of domestic energy that we have to meet our growing future power generation needs.
Short-term, we have an oversupply condition. We will continue to slow our investment levels in natural gas plays until fundamentals provide reason for acceleration. Let me be clear, we have a substantial Woodford Shale portfolio that is profitable at current low gas prices. And I suspect, and most operators in our peer group companies have a sweet spot or two in their gas plays as well that will provide them with the same option.
But with oil assets delivering superior economics, our investment choice is obvious today. We are focused on oil over gas and delivering profitable growth from oil. We produced our gas drilling activities dramatically. In fact, we are only running four dry gas rigs across the company today. As gas prices continue to remain at low levels, we will allocate even less capital to natural gas in 2011.
As a result of lower levels in investment in natural gas plays, you can see in our financials that our gas production is now declining as expected. We anticipate this will continue into 2011. It’s the right choice economically. More than 70% of our gas production is hedged for 2011 at about $6, but we will not subsidize less economic drilling with hedges when we have better alternatives in our portfolio, and our focus will continue to be profitable growth through oil. I am confident that we can deliver healthy production growth from our domestic oil plays and defer our ramp-up in natural gas developments into the future.
Service costs align with today’s demand, but not tomorrow’s. We have seen significant service cost increases in many of our focus areas, mainly the Williston Basin in Eagle Ford Shale. Cost increases have come in the form of pressure pumping, day rate increases, oil country tubular goods price increases, we’ve seen increases of 15% to 45% in these areas and economic margins has contracted.
We will continue to rely on the size of our operations, the steady nature of our drilling programs, and our quality relationships with key service providers to ensure that we get the most competitive price available in our oil plays. We also rely on our staff, a team of professionals that continue to impress with an ability to maximize margins through their diligent and creative efforts and the application of technology.
For 2011, our game plan will be very simple. Number one, focus on oil growth; number two, maximize our cash margins; three, provide consistent and predictable results for our shareholders; and four, continue to build for the future. We are confident that we have the portfolio of assets in place to deliver on our game plan and our proven team Newfield will continue delivering operational excellence.
Let me briefly cover our financial results for the quarter. For the third quarter, our earnings before our FAS 133 were $1.10 per share. Our production for the third quarter was 71 Bcf equivalent and includes the impact of approximately 3 million - and 300,000 barrels of defer production in Malaysia related to a damage export pipeline. Our Malaysian team worked hard and fast and the line was repaired and returned to service in four weeks.
Our 2010 capital budget, as I said earlier, remains unchanged at $1.6 billion. Terry Rathert, our CFO will be happy to take any questions you may have regarding our quarterly results at the end of this call.
Now, I will move on and give you a brief highlights in our assessment programs. In addition to our ongoing operations as I highlighted earlier in the call, we have active assessments underway today in several new areas. I will comment today on two of them, Eagle Ford Shale and the Southern Alberta Basin. 
These oil plays have the potential to be game-changers in the future for Newfield. The Eagle Ford Shale is one of the hottest plays underway in the US today. We have more than 300,000 net acres in the highly prospective Eagle Ford Shale. And this acreage is has added less than one year ago, and a very attractive entry costs were approximately $400 per acre. We are investing about a $120 million this year to totally assess our acreage. Our operated rig count has ranged from three to five rigs in recent months, and our plans call for 15 wells to be drilled and completed by yearend 2010.
To date, four of these wells have been completed and turned to sales, and eight of these wells are growing or in various stages of completion today. As we have consistently stated, we do not plan to make any public announcements about our results until we have comprehensive assessment program completed. We expect to have results to share with you very soon, most likely in early 2011. What I can say is that our results to date have been consistent with our pre-drill planning, and we remain encouraged about the potential of this new area.
We have a similar assessment program underway on our more than 260,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin. We recently TD’d our fifth well in this reason and has completed our first horizontal well. We will drill as many as eight wells in our assessment campaign, to test multiple formations across our Southern Alberta acreage block. We are executing our original plans and I am pleased with our team’s operational performance. Again we will not be discussing individual well results and we will update you when we have a comprehensive understanding of our acreage and its potential.
I will move on now to talk about the Gulf of Mexico. As you’re aware, last week, the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico was lifted. This was a great first step to return our industry back to work in the Gulf. We had a great track of safety and environmental stewardship that spans decades, and I am confident that the horrific tragedy at Macondo, was an isolated event, and not indicative of our industry, and more specifically how Newfield operates.
Although, the moratorium is lifted, lots of uncertainty remains. We will carefully review the new rules and regulations. We will carefully assess the implied economic changes and use this information to help determine our passport in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration arena. 
In the meantime, our development programs are all on track. Initial gross production from Gladden project is scheduled for December 2010 at about 4,750 barrels of oil per day. We have a 57.5% working interest at Gladden. Our Pyrenees project is slated for first production in the fourth quarter of next year, and our Dalmatian and Axe projects are currently scheduled to come on line in 2013.
So in closing, as we enter the homestretch in 2010, I want to reflect on a slide that we provided in our IR presentations at the beginning of the year. We listed our vision for 2010 as follows. 
Number one, continue to focus on domestic resource plays to scale. We are clearly doing so and are simultaneously assessing two significant plays that cover more than a 0.5 million net acres. We are also continuing to expand our footprint at the Monument Butte field. We wanted to focus on oil over gas and the proof is on our oil growth numbers for both 2010 and in our expected 2011 oil production volumes.
The second item was harvest assets and optimizing portfolio. We have refueled our conventional South Texas team to focus on unconventional basins. The cash flow from our conventional assets is helping to fund this transformation. 
Thirdly, deploy people and capital to the best growth opportunities. From our improvement in margins, the results of capital discipline and more effective capital allocation are readily apparent. Our people are focused on the right assets and on doing the right things right.
And lastly, maintain financial strength. Early this year we added some term debt and our first maturity is - we retired some debt and our first maturity is now not until 2014. We were recently upgraded to investment grade by S&P. Our balance sheet is strong, our revolver is undrawn, and we have one of the most valuable hedge position in oil and gas in our peer group.
I like where we sit today and I am purely looking forward to 2011. Thanks for your continued support of Newfield Exploration. Concludes our prepared remarks, and we re happy to take your questions at this time.

I guess suffice it to say that completion costs certainly are up relative to the time period that we’ve entered the play there, we’ve seen a material increase in drilling activity. 
And, quite honestly, much of this was expected any time you enter a new basin whether it’s the Southern Alberta Basin or the Maverick Basin where infrastructure and the services don’t expect, you can almost anticipate this kind of early increase. 
I anticipate 2011 as those services comeback into the areas, there will be a lot more readily available and we will see some softening in some of those areas, and as we lock into certain preferred service providers. But you hit the two where we’re seeing the most pressure, both in the Williston Basin and Mav Basin. 30%, 40% certainly would not be out of the question.

As we head into winter market, the Salt Lake City refineries typically enter in a turnaround period, where they're converting to their winter diesels which have a different cost point. 
Two of our refineries encountered that and will be encountering that as we move into the fourth quarter, so that’s interrupted some of the volumes that will result in the build of inventory that we would anticipate taking out in the first quarter. 
And then, also related to your prior question on the completions in the Williston Basin, I would say through the bulk of 2010, we were sitting at about 25 days or so when we took a well from TD to being placed on production. We’ve seen that slide as activities increased. 
Today, we’re probably sitting about 45 days or 50 days and we’ve anticipated in the fourth quarter that that number could expand a little bit due to winter conditions as well as some of the pressure and services. 
Again, we will see that improved as we move into the first quarter. And it maybe finally anytime we step into these assessment programs early on, takeaway capacity is a little less predictable. 
As a result of that infrastructure has to keep up with your completions. And that’s probably been a minor amount of the difference. But at the end of the day, I think we’re only talking about 200,000 barrels or so.

Historically, we’ve been out there drilling these 4,000-foot laterals and the results that you - and we’ve posted on our website are all consistent with those shorter laterals. And I think those well cost at $5.5 million or so are very reasonable. 
Now, as we head into the longer laterals and I think in the call we referenced about an $8 million well cost, to be clear, we have not drilled and completed a 9,000-foot lateral yet. So some of that is an estimation of what we will spend at this point in time with the higher completion costs factored in.

But while I have a whole lot of information on the shorter laterals that we can talk about.

If you actually go back and look at the well results that we saw in the Westberg and Lost Bear area, we saw steady increase and improvement in well results overtime due to the tweaking of our completion practices. Kind of the average wells that you referenced are still 1,800, 2,000 barrels a day IP. 
The area that we don’t and have not posted a lot of well results personally is in the Catwalk area. And I know we identified it as a development phase. We’ve now drilled off-late two or three wells in Catwalk, we’re just completing them at this time. 
But there’s been eight wells drilled by industry across the acreage position that kind of has given us a lot confidence in what those well results will be. So I wouldn’t read too much into some of those IPs at this point, kind of let us drill few more wells and then we’ll report them what we think.

We can handle the non-HBP acreage with about one rig. We’ve been trying to balance out. We feel it responsibility on our main operating areas to work with their service providers and the other people that are all part of a development activities, we’ll try to balance the needs of a healthy service environment with our desire to shift towards oil. And we’re rapidly accelerating in that regard. But we’ve gone from nine rigs to four rigs today. 
The statement was made that if gas prices continue to stay very soft or deteriorate further, we’ll continue to rotate rigs out of the dry gas portion of our portfolio into the oil components. 
The four rigs, the four dry gas rigs that we have running are drilling super extended lateral wells in the Woodford. And we’ve told you guys we’ve got a good strong core position there in those SXL wells work. And we’ve got a portfolio, but we prefer the margins that we see in oil and we’re going to continue to monitor that situation and be nimble with regard to our responses.

I think it’s important that we maintain a relatively consistent level of activity in each of our areas not only for the benefit of the key service providers that we’ve aligned ourselves with, but also to maintain this trajectory and efficiency gains that we’ve referred to a few times this morning. You can’t take a program back to nothing and expect to capture those when you ramp back up again. 
So, yes, I would anticipate a slowdown in the Woodford capital allocation, but will stay have a material presence there, and we will be in a position when gas prices do rally and they will, then we’ll be able to drive a very profitable growth out there long into the future.

And, in that regard, year-over-year there is an improvement all up in those well cost and F&D costs improvement, and therefore, a slightly lower threshold. But I would say the 400 to 450 is not a bad range to be thinking about Woodford Shale 10% plus B tax.
