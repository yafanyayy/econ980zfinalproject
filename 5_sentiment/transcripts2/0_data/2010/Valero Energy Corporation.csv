As noted in the release, we reported a fourth quarter 2009 loss from continuing operations of $155 million or $0.28 per share. This number excludes a $7 million in after-tax cost for severance and early retirement at the Paulsboro refinery, and $20 million in after-tax asset-impairment loss. Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter was a loss from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.32 per share. I should note that the loss from discontinued operations, shown in the financial tables, relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the $1.2 billion after-tax charge consists of $66 million operating loss after taxes, and an asset impairment and other shutdown charges of $1.1 billion after-tax.The fourth quarter 2009 operating loss was $179 million, excluding the special items already noted versus $1.3 billion of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2008, which excludes the goodwill impairment taking last year. The key drivers of the decline in operating income was smaller discounts on sour crude oil and other feedstock, combined with lower margins on diesel and jet fuel. To put the smaller discounts in perspective, Maya discounts versus WTI decreased 50% year-over-year. Comparing the same periods for benchmark Gulf coast margins versus WTI, the ULSD [ultra-low-sulfur diesel] margins decreased 66% year-over-year. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was the unfavorable effect from a year-end LIFO debt decrement of $66 million before taxes in 2009 versus a favorable effect from the LIFO increment of $327 million before taxes in 2008.The fourth quarter refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.1 million  barrels per day, which is in line with our guidance since Delaware City is 113,000 barrels per day of throughput is excluded. However, fourth quarter 2009 volumes from continuing operations were 371,000 barrels per day below the fourth quarter of 2008 mainly due to lower-utilization rates across our refinery system caused by lower demand, planned downtime for maintenance at our Wilmington and Paulsboro refineries, and the continued idle status of our Aruba refinery. Refinery cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $4.03 per barrel or $0.16 per barrel, lower than the fourth quarter 2008 results due mostly to lower energy costs. But our focus on other cost reductions has also been successful. Comparing the full year 2008 versus 2009, our refinery operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were down $900 million. Much of this was due to lower energy and natural gas prices, but we estimate more than $215 million was due to our aggressive cost-reduction efforts.Looking at our other business segments, Retail has continued to produce strong results with operating income in the fourth quarter of 2009 at $61 million, which is less though than the $163 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, mainly due to lower-fuel margins in the U.S., which were partially offset by lower selling expenses. For the full year 2009, retail earned, $293 million of operating income, making it the second best year for Retail.Our Ethanol segment had an excellent fourth quarter with $94 million of operating income, which is nearly double the $49 million reported in the third quarter of 2009. The continued strong performance was due to higher margins and increased production volumes from the prior quarter. Our timing with the initial acquisition could not have been better in less than three quarters of operations. The initial seven ethanol plants have earned $165 million in operating income, and had yielded impressive returns on the $477 million purchased price.General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $137 million in the fourth quarter, which was $30 million lower than the third quarter and in line with our guidance. For the fourth quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $356 million, which was lower than our guidance of $390 million, mainly due to the reclassification of the Delaware City refinery into discontinued operations.Net interest expense was $113 million, which was in line with our guidance, but down from the third quarter due to lower interest expense on several tax matters. The effective tax rate benefit on continued operations in the fourth quarter was 39.5%, which was higher than our guidance. In the fourth quarter, we had a loss, which means an increase in the tax rate as a benefit. The increase in the tax rate of benefit resulted from a gain on the liquidation of Aruba inventory, which is not taxed. The gain lowered our consolidated loss but because it is not taxed, it increased the tax-rate benefit. In addition, Congress passed a law in November 2009 allowing companies to carry back 2009 losses of five years instead of two years. Carrying back five years to 2004 enabled us to reduce certain recapture tax items, such as the Section 199 manufacturing deduction and this, also, resulted in additional favorable tax-rate benefits.Regarding cash flows for the fourth quarter, capital spending was $600 million, which includes $114 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, capital spending was $2.7 billion, which is a sizable decrease of nearly $600 million when compared to 2008. With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, total debt was $7.4 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $825 million. And we had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. In addition to this existing liquidity, as previously mentioned, the 2009 net operating loss for taxes can be carried back up to five years to offset previously-paid taxes. This will allow Valero to claim a sizable tax refund that we expect to receive in the second quarter of 2010.At the end of 2009, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 31%, which is far below the credit-facility covenant that requires a ratio below 60%. In addition, we do not have any covenants with coverage-type ratios.When you look back on 2009, it was clearly a very challenging year for the refining industry and Valero. Refined product demand shrink in the face of a deep recession of driving down margins and discounts in a very competitive environment. Given these conditions, we took action and reduced cost. We cut capital spending, and we shut down plants that were dragging down our profitability. We also stepped up and made a significant investment to enter the ethanol industry by buying seven plants out of bankruptcy at 30% of replacement cost. The returns have been outstanding so far and we recently acquired two more plants, and expect to close on the third plant this quarter. The consensus-industry outlook shows that 2010 will be another difficult year for refining margins and discounts. However, the strategic actions we have taken should enable to be profitable in 2010 even if we have another year of low margins like 2009. But due to the poor conditions and uncertainty of our industry, a high priority at Valero will be to maintain our financial strength in 2010. As part of this effort, we reduced our capital-spending budget to $2 billion, which is a $700 million reduction from 2009 spending, and we reduced our dividend rates. Throughout our system, we will continue to reduce cost, optimize our operations and upgrade our portfolio of assets to improve our competitiveness. So far in 2010, we've had a couple of positive items to announce. Last week, we agreed with the government of Aruba on a framework for a stable tax structure. The agreement will become effective upon approval by the Aruba Parliament and other Aruba authority. The framework, once fully effective, is expected to resolve all prior tax disputes with the payment of $111 million, which was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2009. The $111 million payment is fully escrowed as restrictive cash, separate from our year-end cash balance of $825 million. The framework will also effectively tax income at a rate of less than 10% with an annual-minimum tax payment of $10 million beginning mid-2012. We believe this structure has the potential to enhance Valero's strategic alternatives for the refinery and provide certainty, as Valero's tax holiday was set to expire at the end of this year. In addition, we announced last week that we are in advanced negotiations to sell the shutdown refinery and terminal operations in Delaware City. Our discussions are ongoing, so I cannot provide more details at this point. But we will keep you informed when we finalized the terms. Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings-model assumptions."

So modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect that refinery throughput volumes to fall between the following ranges: the Gulf coast should be at 1.1 million to 1.15 million barrels per day; the Mid-Continent should be at 360,00",236,"Thanks, Mike. So modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect that refinery throughput volumes to fall between the following ranges: the Gulf coast should be at 1.1 million to 1.15 million barrels per day; the Mid-Continent should be at 360,000 to 370,000 barrels per day; the Northeast should be at 340,000 to 350,000 barrels per day and the West Coast should be at 260,000 to 270,000 barrels per day. Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.45 per barrel, which is higher than last quarter due mainly to lower throughput volumes combined with slightly higher expected energy, catalyst and chemical cost. Regarding our ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 2.4 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to some of the other items for the first quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation to be around $135 million, net interest expense should be around $115 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million.Regarding our tax rate, in this margin environment, small changes in assumptions are yielding a very wide range of results to the effective tax rate. But at this point, we prefer not to provide guidance, which may not prove to be meaningful. We will now open the call for questions."

We're going to take the opportunity to make some tank repairs at the same time. Following that, we will take the Memphis cat cracker down in March for a 45-day turnaround. This will provide an opportunity to do a large revamp project over $200 million on this cat cracker, which actually is one of our strategic projects should increase operating income at Memphis over $100 million a year. And then finally, in the first quarter, we have a cracker I engaged in Corpus Christie in March for 18 days. Beyond first quarter, then turnaround activity will subside but then it ramps up against in the fourth quarter and the main activity there will be the Venezia refinery plant like turnaround, which is scheduled for November."

As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million after-tax loss from discontinued operation",945,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million after-tax loss from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in the fourth quarter.
The first quarter 2010 operating loss was $32 million versus $593 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2009. The decline in operating income was mainly due to lower margins on most of our refined products in all four of our operating regions. Looking at our highest volume region, benchmark, Gulf Coast, ultra-low-sulfur diesel margins versus WTI, decreased 41% from $12.61 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.49 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010. While Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI decreased 12% from $8.42 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.13 per barrel in the first quarter of 2006, the hardest hit region was the West Coast where gasoline margins versus WTI fell 45% and diesel margins versus WTI fell 38% in the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the first quarter of last year. 
So far in April, margins have improved versus the first quarter in most of our regions. For example, the Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel margin versus WTI has increased 33% to $9.95 per barrel while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI increased 20% to $8.58 per barrel. On the West Coast, diesel margins versus WTI increased 40% to $11.83 per barrel, while the gasoline margins have remained relatively flat. 
Our first quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.1 million barrels per day which is in line with our guidance. However, compared to the first quarter of 2009, volumes were down 254,000 barrels per day mainly due to the continued idled status of the Aruba refinery. Our first quarter 2010 results were negatively impacted by downtime at some of our key refineries. We estimate the lost income from the first quarter downtime was just over $200 million. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $4.41 per barrel in line with our guidance but were $0.41 per barrel higher than our first quarter of 2009 results, due mostly to lower throughput volumes.
Looking at our other business segments, Retail had a record first quarter with operating income at $71 million, which is $15 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher fuel margins in both the U.S. and Canadian operation. Our Ethanol segment had $57 million of operating income in the first quarter, which is our second best quarter since we entered the Ethanol business. I should also point out that we purchased three additional plants in the first quarter, taking our total to 10 plants with 1.1 billion gallons per year capacity.  Like our previous acquisitions, these are large plants located in the Corn Belt and we bought them at deep discounts to replacement cost. Two of the plants were idle, but we have restarted them, and all 10 plants are now operating. 
General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $97 million in the first quarter, which was $40 million lower than the fourth quarter and lower than our guidance due to a favorable insurance settlement of $40 million. For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $357 million, which was in line with our guidance. 
Net interest expense was $127 million, which was higher than our guidance in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to increased interest expense related to our recent debt offering.  The effective tax rate benefit on continuing operations in the first quarter was 32%. 
Regarding cash flows for the first quarter, capital spending was $611 million, which includes $229 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. And for the year, our capital spending target remains at $2 billion. 
We received a Federal income tax refund of $923 million and we spent $260 million to acquire three ethanol plants. The ethanol spending includes $9 million of working capital, so the total cost to acquire these plants comes to $281 million, which includes a $21 million deposit that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009.  We also paid $28 million in dividends in the first quarter. 
Also during the quarter, we completed a debt offering totaling $1.25 billion and subsequently called $473 million of debt. Including the premium, we've spent $294 million in the first quarter to redeem $287 million of debt. And in the second quarter, we will pay $190 million to redeem $186 million. These redemptions will result in lower interest expense over the life of the note. 
With respect to our balance sheet, at the end of March, total debt was $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and we had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. And at the end of the quarter, our debt-to-capratio net of cash was 31%.
In summary, our financial health and liquidity remain very good despite the challenging environment we have experienced. We expect to be profitable in April and make money for the full quarter. Our priorities continue to be reducing costs, running our assets safely and reliably and maintaining our financial strength. We continue to believe that our cost savings initiatives and the strategic actions that we have taken should make the company profitable in 2010, even if we were to experience a low margin environment and it's like 2009. 
So now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumption."

For modeling our second quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.275 million to 1.325 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 390,000 barrels p",216,"Okay, thanks, Mike.  For modeling our second quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.275 million to 1.325 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 390,000 barrels per day; the Northeast at 330,000 to 340,000 barrels per day; and the West Coast at 260,000 to 270,000 barrels per day.  Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.15 per barrel, which is lower than last quarter due mainly to higher expected throughput volume. 
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon, which include $0.03 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. 
With respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $135 million; net interest expense should be around $120 million; and total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. 
Regarding our tax rate, in this margin environment, small changes and assumptions are yielding a very wide range of results with effective tax rate. So at this point, we prefer not to provide guidance which may not be meaningful. 
We will now open the call for questions, Angelique."

But on this point, the spread for light versus Maya seems to have widened more than to some of the other global heavy crude oils. So my question is twofold:  First, what are you guys seeing that supports widening of this spread; and second, what if any implication do you think the difference in spreadsbetween for regional heavy crude oil such as Maya or maybe Aruba heavy or something hold for sustainability of this improvement,meaning do you think that Maya can continue to trade at record low levels to Aruba heavy or some of the others, and, if so, why?  So could you just spend a minute on that spread?"

One, we had Maya length; two, we had fuel length in Singapore; and third, we had a flat market structure. Now, you know the Maya discounts look pretty good today, we’re showing about $10 a barrel when compared to WTI.  And that's a little bit distorted, they’re actually stronger than that if you compare them to some of the foreign suites, okay, because we've got the dislocation of WTI. So we had factors that affected the discount and improved it. Now, today, if you look at that, the primary one that still remains is the fuel oil length. The Maya length has cleaned up a little bit. And the market structure is in carry. But here again, if you compare Maya to a foreign suite, it looks more attractive than it would relative to WTI. 
Now, as far as the foreign barrels go, like Aruba heavy, Doug, we're just not seeing those barrels over here anymore, and you know that. If I compare Maya to some of the other heavy sours that we do look at running, it's right in the ballpark. Venezuelan grades, some of the Colombian grades, we're not seeing a disjoiner relative to those."

Today, in distillates, we are seeing farm demand and railroad demand very strong. Trucking is lacking. On gasoline, unemployment is still at this nine, seven or whatever the number is, being this very high number, and the high prices are a restraint on gasoline. However, we do see, as the economy recovers, the volume is picking up. So that part of it, yes, we're optimistic here.  We have better margins today.  And, as Joe just said, we have better sour discounts today. We're making money here, as our release says, in April.  And we expect to be profitable, as Mike said, in the second quarter. And then I've told everyone that we expect to be profitable for the year. 
Looking at our thoughts on Aruba, we still do not have what we would call solid economics to operate Aruba. So we continue to look at our alternatives there. Most likely, the alternatives that we tend to be looking at go along the line of processing. We'll make that decision here as to how that plant goes forward, most likely in June. 
You asked a question about ethanol.  We are very pleased with our ethanol business.  Gene Edwards and the team have done an excellent job getting us in that business. It's been a solid contributor for us.  It's still in the profit.  I think, as many of you know, there is a huge lending margin today. Ethanol is economic. And so, we continue to look at opportunities in that business. We’ve built a strong staff here. And so, we feel, one, that ethanol is going to be part of the fuel mix in the United States; and two, there is still some opportunity out there for us to continue to grow that business. 
Capital spending.  Our number this year, our target's about $2 billion. We complete several big projects this year.  The scrubber at Benicia and here,the furnace that’s associatedwith it, it’s very large. We complete [indiscernible] by the end of the year, so that will give us the ability to come in with a lower capital. However, we do have some big turnarounds next year. 
But having said that, we also have a couple of projects that we are halfway through. And so, we are scaling those into our view. So if our profitability continues, as I stated a few minutes ago, and we have the cash, it is our intent to eventually complete our [indiscernible] projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles, with the timing being somewhere late 2012 at Port Arthur and somewhere in the late to 2013 at St. Charles. These projects still have very good rates of return, so we’re going to work on them."

And then the next segment that’s going to be worked on is the segment that runs from Cushing down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and our thoughts are that we may be able to get volume on that before the entire bullet line is complete, at the end of '12 or the beginning of 2013. 
In addition to the Canadian crude, it would be beneficial for us longer term that we’ve got the increases in the Columbian production; we've got the Brazilian heavy sweep coming into the market;of course we've got the Canadian; and then we’ve got the medium sour production increases that we’re going to see out of Iraq. So as we look at the market for the medium sours and the heavy sours going forward, we tend to be fairly optimistic."

As noted in the release we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million aftertax loss from discontinued operations shown in the financials tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in the fourth quarter. The first quarter 2010 operating loss was $32 million versus $593 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2009. The decline in operating income was mainly due to lower margins on most of our refined products in all four of our operating regions.
Looking at our highest volume region, Benchmark Gulf Coast, ultralow sulfur diesel margins versus WTI decreased 41% from $12.61 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.49 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010. While Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI decreased 12% from $8.14 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.13 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010.
The hardest hit region was the West Coast where gasoline margins versus WTI fell 45% and diesel margins versus WTI fell 38% in the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the first quarter of the last year. So far in April, margins have improved versus the first quarter in most of our regions, for example the Gulf Coast ultralow sulfur diesel margin versus WTI has increased 33% to $9.95 per barrel while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI increased to 20% to $8.58 per barrel.
On the West Coast, diesel margins versus WTI increased to 40% to $11.83 per barrel while the gasoline margins have remained relatively flat. Our first quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.1 million barrels per day which is in line with our guidance. However compared to the first quarter of 2009, volumes were down 254,000 barrels per day mainly due to the continued idle status of the Aruba refinery.
Our first quarter 2010 results were negatively impacted by downtime at some of our key refineries. We estimate the lost income from the first quarter downtime was just over $200 million. Refinery cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $4.41 per barrel in line with our guidance, but were $0.41 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2009 results due mostly to the lower throughput volumes.
Looking at other business segments, retail had a record first quarter with operating income at $71 million which is $15 million higher than the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to higher fuel margins in both the US and Canadian operation. Our ethanol segment had $57 million of operating income in the first quarter which was our second best quarter since we entered the ethanol business.
I should also point out that we purchased 3 additional plants in the first quarter taking our total to 10 plants with 1.1 billion gallons per year of capacity. Like our previous acquisition these are large plants located in the corn belt and we bought them at deep discounts to replacement costs. Two of the plants were idle, but we have restarted them and ten plants are now operating.
General and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation were $97 million in the first quarter which was $40 million lower than the fourth quarter and lower than our guidance due to a favorable insurance settlement of $40 million. For the first quarter total depreciation and amortization expense was $357 million which was in line with our guidance, net interest expense was a $127 million which was higher than our guidance and the fourth quarter of 2009 due to increased interest expense related to our recent debt offered.
The effective tax rate benefit on continuing operations in the first quarter was 32%. Regarding cash flows for the first quarter, capital spending was $611 million which includes $229 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures and for the year our capital spending target remains at $2 billion. We received a federal income tax refund of $923 million and we spent $260 million to acquire 3 ethanol plants. The ethanol spending includes $9 million of working capital. So the total cost to acquire these plants comes to $280 million which includes a $21 million deposit that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009.
We also paid $28 million in dividends in the first quarter. Also during the quarter we completed a debt offering totaling $1.25 billion and subsequently called $473 million of debt. Including the premium we spent $294 million in the first quarter to regain $287 million of debt and in the second quarter we will pay $190 million to regain a $186 million. These redemptions will result to lower interest expense over the life of the note. 
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of March total debt was $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and we had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. And at the end of the quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 31%. In summary, our financial health and liquidity remained very good despite the challenging environment we have experienced. We expect to be profitable in April and make money for the fourth quarter. Our priority is continue to reducing costs running our assets safely and reliably and maintaining our financial strength. We continue to believe that our cost savings initiative and the strategic actions that we have taken should make the company profitable in 2010 even if we were to experience a low margin environment like 2009.
So now I will turn it over Ashley to cover the earnings model assumption.

Gulf Coast at 1.275 million to 1.325 million barrels per day. Mid-continent at 3,80,000 to 3,90,000 barrels per day, North East at 3,30,000 to 3,40,000 barrels per day and West coast at 2,60,000 to 2,70,000 barrels per day.
Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.15 per barrel which is lower than last quarter due mainly to higher expected throughput volumes. Regarding our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of other items in the second quarter we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $135 million. Net interest expense should be around $120 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. Regarding our tax rate in this margin environment, small changes and assumptions are yielding a very wide range of results from effective tax rates. So at this point we prefer not to provide guidance which may not be meaningful. We will now open call for questions Angelic.

One we had in (inaudible), two we had fuel-length in Singapore and third we had a flat market structure. Now you have the Maya discounts looked pretty good today. We were shown about $10 a barrel when compared to WTI and that’s a little bit distorted, they are actually stronger than that if you compare them to some of the foreign suite, because we got the dislocation of WTI. So we had factors that affected the discount and improved it. Now today if you look at that, the primary one that still remains is the fuel oil length.
The Maya length is cleaned up a little bit and the market structures [didn’t carry], but here again if you compare Maya to a foreign suite, it looks more attractive and it would relative to WTI.
Now as far as the foreign barrels go, like [big] heavy, Doug we are not seeing those barrels over here anymore and you know that. If I compare Maya to some of the other heavy sours that we do look at running is right in the ballpark. Venezuelan grades, some of the Columbian grades, we are not seeing it disjointed relative to those.

But as a goal if we are operating full rate, we’d like to get our cash operating costs down to $3.50 when you have natural gas in its price range. But it’s hard to say give you a good number when we have reduced operating rates.

Today in distillates, we're seeing farm demand, railroad demand very strong. Trucking is lacking. On gasoline, unemployment still at the 9.7% or whatever the number is. Being very high number and the high prices are restrained on gasoline. 
However we do see as the economy recovers, the volume's picking up. So, yes we are optimistic, here, we have better margins today. As Joe just said we have better seller discounts today, we are making money here as our releases says in April and we expect to be profitable as Mike said in the second quarter. And I’ve told everyone that we expect to be profitable for the year.
Looking at our thoughts on Aruba, we still do not have what we would call solid economics to operate Aruba. So we can tell you to look at our alternatives there. Most likely the alternatives that we tend to be looking at goal on the line of processing. We’ll make that decision here as to how that plan goes forward, most likely in June.
About ethanol, we are very pleased with our ethanol business. Gene Edwards and the team have done an excellent job getting us in that business. It's been a solid contributor for us, it’s still in the profit. I think some of you know there is a huge blending margin today. Ethanol’s economic and so we continue to look at opportunities in that business. We have built a strong staff here and so we feel one, that ethanol is going to be part of fuel mix in the United States and two, there is still some opportunity out there for us to continue to grow that business.
Capital spending, our number this year, out target is about $2 billion. We complete several big projects this year, the scrubber at Venetia and the heater furnace that's associated with it is very large. We completed MSAT-2 by the end of the year so that will give us the ability to come in with a lower capital. However we do have some big turnarounds next year. But having said that, we also have a couple of projects that we are halfway through and so we are scaling those into our view.
So if our profitability continues as I stated a few minutes ago and we have the cash. It is our intent to eventually complete our hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles with the timing being somewhere late 2012 at Port Arthur and somewhere in the late 2013 at St. Charles. These projects still have very good rates of return, so we are going to work on them.

As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million after-tax loss from discontinued operation",945,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million after-tax loss from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in the fourth quarter.
The first quarter 2010 operating loss was $32 million versus $593 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2009. The decline in operating income was mainly due to lower margins on most of our refined products in all four of our operating regions. Looking at our highest volume region, benchmark, Gulf Coast, ultra-low-sulfur diesel margins versus WTI, decreased 41% from $12.61 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.49 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010. While Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI decreased 12% from $8.42 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.13 per barrel in the first quarter of 2006, the hardest hit region was the West Coast where gasoline margins versus WTI fell 45% and diesel margins versus WTI fell 38% in the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the first quarter of last year. 
So far in April, margins have improved versus the first quarter in most of our regions. For example, the Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel margin versus WTI has increased 33% to $9.95 per barrel while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI increased 20% to $8.58 per barrel. On the West Coast, diesel margins versus WTI increased 40% to $11.83 per barrel, while the gasoline margins have remained relatively flat. 
Our first quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.1 million barrels per day which is in line with our guidance. However, compared to the first quarter of 2009, volumes were down 254,000 barrels per day mainly due to the continued idled status of the Aruba refinery. Our first quarter 2010 results were negatively impacted by downtime at some of our key refineries. We estimate the lost income from the first quarter downtime was just over $200 million. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $4.41 per barrel in line with our guidance but were $0.41 per barrel higher than our first quarter of 2009 results, due mostly to lower throughput volumes.
Looking at our other business segments, Retail had a record first quarter with operating income at $71 million, which is $15 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher fuel margins in both the U.S. and Canadian operation. Our Ethanol segment had $57 million of operating income in the first quarter, which is our second best quarter since we entered the Ethanol business. I should also point out that we purchased three additional plants in the first quarter, taking our total to 10 plants with 1.1 billion gallons per year capacity.  Like our previous acquisitions, these are large plants located in the Corn Belt and we bought them at deep discounts to replacement cost. Two of the plants were idle, but we have restarted them, and all 10 plants are now operating. 
General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $97 million in the first quarter, which was $40 million lower than the fourth quarter and lower than our guidance due to a favorable insurance settlement of $40 million. For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $357 million, which was in line with our guidance. 
Net interest expense was $127 million, which was higher than our guidance in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to increased interest expense related to our recent debt offering.  The effective tax rate benefit on continuing operations in the first quarter was 32%. 
Regarding cash flows for the first quarter, capital spending was $611 million, which includes $229 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. And for the year, our capital spending target remains at $2 billion. 
We received a Federal income tax refund of $923 million and we spent $260 million to acquire three ethanol plants. The ethanol spending includes $9 million of working capital, so the total cost to acquire these plants comes to $281 million, which includes a $21 million deposit that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009.  We also paid $28 million in dividends in the first quarter. 
Also during the quarter, we completed a debt offering totaling $1.25 billion and subsequently called $473 million of debt. Including the premium, we've spent $294 million in the first quarter to redeem $287 million of debt. And in the second quarter, we will pay $190 million to redeem $186 million. These redemptions will result in lower interest expense over the life of the note. 
With respect to our balance sheet, at the end of March, total debt was $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and we had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. And at the end of the quarter, our debt-to-capratio net of cash was 31%.
In summary, our financial health and liquidity remain very good despite the challenging environment we have experienced. We expect to be profitable in April and make money for the full quarter. Our priorities continue to be reducing costs, running our assets safely and reliably and maintaining our financial strength. We continue to believe that our cost savings initiatives and the strategic actions that we have taken should make the company profitable in 2010, even if we were to experience a low margin environment and it's like 2009. 
So now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumption."

For modeling our second quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.275 million to 1.325 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 390,000 barrels p",216,"Okay, thanks, Mike.

Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.15 per barrel, which is lower than last quarter due mainly to higher expected throughput volume. 
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon, which include $0.03 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. 
With respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $135 million; net interest expense should be around $120 million; and total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. 
Regarding our tax rate, in this margin environment, small changes and assumptions are yielding a very wide range of results with effective tax rate. So at this point, we prefer not to provide guidance which may not be meaningful.

But on this point, the spread for light versus Maya seems to have widened more than to some of the other global heavy crude oils. So my question is twofold:  First, what are you guys seeing that supports widening of this spread; and second, what if any implication do you think the difference in spreadsbetween for regional heavy crude oil such as Maya or maybe Aruba heavy or something hold for sustainability of this improvement,meaning do you think that Maya can continue to trade at record low levels to Aruba heavy or some of the others, and, if so, why?

One, we had Maya length; two, we had fuel length in Singapore; and third, we had a flat market structure. Now, you know the Maya discounts look pretty good today, we’re showing about $10 a barrel when compared to WTI.  And that's a little bit distorted, they’re actually stronger than that if you compare them to some of the foreign suites, okay, because we've got the dislocation of WTI. So we had factors that affected the discount and improved it. Now, today, if you look at that, the primary one that still remains is the fuel oil length. The Maya length has cleaned up a little bit. And the market structure is in carry. But here again, if you compare Maya to a foreign suite, it looks more attractive than it would relative to WTI. 
Now, as far as the foreign barrels go, like Aruba heavy, Doug, we're just not seeing those barrels over here anymore, and you know that. If I compare Maya to some of the other heavy sours that we do look at running, it's right in the ballpark.

We also have on top of that, optimization, molecule management, strategic sourcing, many other initiatives that will bring it down.

Today, in distillates, we are seeing farm demand and railroad demand very strong. Trucking is lacking. On gasoline, unemployment is still at this nine, seven or whatever the number is, being this very high number, and the high prices are a restraint on gasoline. However, we do see, as the economy recovers, the volume is picking up. So that part of it, yes, we're optimistic here.  We have better margins today.  And, as Joe just said, we have better sour discounts today. We're making money here, as our release says, in April.  And we expect to be profitable, as Mike said, in the second quarter. And then I've told everyone that we expect to be profitable for the year. 
Looking at our thoughts on Aruba, we still do not have what we would call solid economics to operate Aruba. So we continue to look at our alternatives there. Most likely, the alternatives that we tend to be looking at go along the line of processing. We'll make that decision here as to how that plant goes forward, most likely in June. 
You asked a question about ethanol.  We are very pleased with our ethanol business.  Gene Edwards and the team have done an excellent job getting us in that business. It's been a solid contributor for us.  It's still in the profit.  I think, as many of you know, there is a huge lending margin today. Ethanol is economic. And so, we continue to look at opportunities in that business. We’ve built a strong staff here. And so, we feel, one, that ethanol is going to be part of the fuel mix in the United States; and two, there is still some opportunity out there for us to continue to grow that business. 
Capital spending.  Our number this year, our target's about $2 billion. We complete several big projects this year.  The scrubber at Benicia and here,the furnace that’s associatedwith it, it’s very large. We complete [indiscernible] by the end of the year, so that will give us the ability to come in with a lower capital. However, we do have some big turnarounds next year. 
But having said that, we also have a couple of projects that we are halfway through. And so, we are scaling those into our view. So if our profitability continues, as I stated a few minutes ago, and we have the cash, it is our intent to eventually complete our [indiscernible] projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles, with the timing being somewhere late 2012 at Port Arthur and somewhere in the late to 2013 at St. Charles. These projects still have very good rates of return, so we’re going to work on them."

As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million after-tax loss from discontinued operation",947,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2010 loss from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.18 per share. I should note that the $12 million after-tax loss from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in the fourth quarter.
The first quarter 2010 operating loss was $32 million versus $593 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2009. The decline in operating income was mainly due to lower margins on most of our refined products in all four of our operating regions. Looking at our highest volume region, benchmark Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel margins versus WTI, decreased 41% from $12.61 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.49 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010. While Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI decreased 12% from $8.42 per barrel in the first quarter of 2009 to $7.13 per barrel in the first quarter of 2006, the hardest hit region was the West Coast where gasoline margins versus WTI fell 45% and diesel margins versus WTI fell 38% in the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the first quarter of last year. 
So far in April, margins have improved versus the first quarter in most of our regions. For example, the Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel margin versus WTI has increased 33% to $9.95 per barrel while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI increased 20% to $8.58 per barrel. On the West Coast, diesel margins versus WTI increased 40% to $11.83 per barrel, while the gasoline margins have remained relatively flat. 
Our first quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.1 million barrels per day, which is in line with our guidance. However, compared to the first quarter of 2009, volumes were down 254,000 barrels per day mainly due to the continued idle status of the Aruba refinery. Our first quarter 2010 results were negatively impacted by downtime at some of our key refineries. We estimate the lost income from the first quarter downtime was just over $200 million. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $4.41 per barrel in line with our guidance but were $0.41 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2009 results, due mostly to lower throughput volumes.
Looking at our other business segments, Retail had a record first quarter with operating income at $71 million, which is $15 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher fuel margins in both the U.S. and Canadian operation. Our Ethanol segment had $57 million of operating income in the first quarter, which is our second best quarter since we entered the Ethanol business. I should also point out that we purchased three additional plants in the first quarter, taking our total to 10 plants with 1.1 billion gallons per year of capacity. Like our previous acquisitions, these are large plants located in the Corn Belt and we bought them at deep discounts to replacement cost. Two of the plants were idle, but we have restarted them, and all 10 plants are now operating. 
General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $97 million in the first quarter, which was $40 million lower than the fourth quarter and lower than our guidance due to a favorable insurance settlement of $40 million. For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $357 million, which was in line with our guidance. 
Net interest expense was $127 million, which was higher than our guidance in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to increased interest expense related to our recent debt offering. The effective tax rate benefit on continuing operations in the first quarter was 32%. 
Regarding cash flows for the first quarter, capital spending was $611 million, which includes $229 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. And for the year, our capital spending target remains at $2 billion. 
We received a Federal income tax refund of $923 million and we spent $260 million to acquire three ethanol plants. The ethanol spending includes $9 million of working capital, so the total cost to acquire these plants comes to $281 million, which includes a $21 million deposit that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009. We also paid $28 million in dividends in the first quarter. 
Also during the quarter, we completed a debt offering totaling $1.25 billion and subsequently called $473 million of debt. Including the premium, we've spent $294 million in the first quarter to redeem $287 million of debt. And in the second quarter, we will pay $190 million to redeem $186 million. These redemptions will result to lower interest expense over the life of the note. 
With respect to our balance sheet, at the end of March, total debt was $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and we had over $4 billion of additional liquidity available. And at the end of the quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 31%.
In summary, our financial health and liquidity remain very good despite the challenging environment we have experienced. We expect to be profitable in April and make money for the full quarter. Our priorities continue to be reducing costs, running our assets safely and reliably and maintaining our financial strength. We continue to believe that our cost savings initiatives and the strategic actions that we have taken should make the company profitable in 2010, even if we were to experience a low margin environment and it's like 2009.

For modeling our second quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.275 million to 1.325 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 390,000 barrels per day; the Northeast at 330,000 to 340,000 barrels per day; and the West Coast at 260,000 to 270,000 barrels per day. Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $4.15 per barrel, which is lower than last quarter due mainly to higher expected throughput volume. 
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the second quarter. We expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.37 per gallon, which include $0.03 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. 
With respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $135 million; net interest expense should be around $120 million; and total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. 
Regarding our tax rate,in this margin environment, small changes and assumptions are yielding a very wide range of results with effective tax rate. So at this point, we prefer not to provide guidance which may not be meaningful. 
We will now open the call for questions, Angelique."

But on this point, the spread for light versus Maya seems to have widened more than for some of the other global heavy crude oils. So my question is twofold:  First, what are you guys seeing that supports widening of this spread; and second, what if any implication do you think the difference in spreads between for regional heavy crude oil such as Maya or maybe Aruba heavy or something hold for sustainability of this improvement, meaning do you think that Maya can continue to trade at record low levels to Aruba heavy or some of the others, and if so, why? So could you just spend a minute on that spread?"

One, we had Maya length; two, we had fuel length in Singapore; and third, we had a flat market structure. Now you know the Maya discounts look pretty good today, we’re showing about $10 a barrel when compared to WTI. And that's a little bit distorted, they’re actually stronger than that if you compare them to some of the foreign suites, okay, because we've got the dislocation of WTI. So we had factors that affected the discount and improved it. Now, today, if you look at that, the primary one that still remains is the fuel oil length. The Maya length has cleaned up a little bit. And the market structure is in carry. But here again, if you compare Maya to a foreign suite, it looks more attractive than it would relative to WTI.  Now, as far as the foreign barrels go, like Aruba heavy, Doug, we're just not seeing those barrels over here anymore, and you know that. If I compare Maya to some of the other heavy sours that we do look at running, it's right in the ballpark. Venezuelan grades, some of the Colombian grades, we're not seeing a disjoiner relative to those."

Today, in distillates, we are seeing farm demand and railroad demand very strong. Trucking is lacking. On gasoline, unemployment is still at this nine, seven or whatever the number is, being this very high number, and the high prices are a restraint on gasoline. However, we do see, as the economy recovers, the volume is picking up. So that part of it, yes, we're optimistic here.  We have better margins today.  And, as Joe just said, we have better sour discounts today. We're making money here, as our release says, in April.  And we expect to be profitable, as Mike said, in the second quarter. And then I've told everyone that we expect to be profitable for the year. Looking at our thoughts on Aruba, we still do not have what we would call solid economics to operate Aruba. So we continue to look at our alternatives there. Most likely, the alternatives that we tend to be looking at go along the line of processing. We'll make that decision here as to how that plant goes forward, most likely in June. You asked a question about ethanol.  We are very pleased with our ethanol business.  Gene Edwards and the team have done an excellent job getting us in that business. It's been a solid contributor for us.  It's still in the profit.  I think, as many of you know, there is a huge lending margin today. Ethanol is economic. And so, we continue to look at opportunities in that business. We’ve built a strong staff here. And so, we feel, one, that ethanol is going to be part of the fuel mix in the United States; and two, there is still some opportunity out there for us to continue to grow that business. Capital spending.  Our number this year, our target's about $2 billion. We complete several big projects this year.  The scrubber at Benicia and here,the furnace that’s associated with it, it’s very large. We complete [indiscernible] by the end of the year, so that will give us the ability to come in with a lower capital. However, we do have some big turnarounds next year.  But having said that, we also have a couple of projects that we are halfway through. And so, we are scaling those into our view. So if our profitability continues, as I stated a few minutes ago, and we have the cash, it is our intent to eventually complete our hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles, with the timing being somewhere late 2012 at Port Arthur and somewhere in the late to 2013 at St. Charles.

I should note that the $53 million after-tax gain from discontinued operatio",1050,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $530 million or $0.93 per share. I should note that the $53 million after-tax gain from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in 2009 and sold in June of this year.
Second quarter 2010 operating income was $921 million versus an operating loss of $192 million in the second quarter of 2009. The $1.1 billion increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for distillate and secondary products, such as petrochemicals, asphalt and lube oils as well as improved sour crude discounts. 
The improvement we saw in diesel margins was most significant. If you look at the benchmark ULSD [ultra-low-sulfur diesel] margins on the Gulf Coast, they nearly doubled from $6.16 per barrel in the second quarter of 2009 to $12.14 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010. Secondary margins also made strong contributions. For example, propylene margins improved 156%, and lube oil margins increased 104% versus the second quarter of the 2009.
Sour crude oil discounts also improved during the second quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discount to WTI [West Texas Intermediate] expanded from $4.57 in the second quarter of 2009 to $9.75 in the second quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of the WTI price, so the Maya discount increased from 7.7% of WTI in the second quarter of 2009 to 12.5% of WTI in the second quarter of 2010, which is a 62% improvement year-over-year.
Our second quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.3 million barrels per day, which is slightly higher than the top end of our guidance as the strong margins incentivized higher run rates. However, compared to the second quarter of last year, volumes were down 55,000 barrels per day, mainly due to the continued idle status of our Aruba refinery. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were $3.55 per barrel, which was well below our guidance. This was primarily due to the higher throughput volumes and lower-than-expected maintenance, catalyst and chemicals and energy costs. 
We are pleased to see that our focus on cost reductions is showing results. In fact, we're on pace to exceed our target of $100 million in pretax cost savings in 2010. The combinations of numerous company-wide initiatives and commitment by our employees has yielded nearly $90 million in cost savings through June and there is more to come.
Looking at our other business segments. Retail had its best-ever second quarter, with operating income at $109 million which is 68% higher than the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher fuel margins in the U.S. Our Canadian Retail operations also performed well during the quarter. 
Our Ethanol segment had $35 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2010, which is $13 million higher than the second quarter of 2009, but down from the first quarter of this year due mainly to compression in margins between ethanol and corn prices. Despite very competitive industry conditions, our Ethanol business has been profitable and we are pleased with the performance of this business.
General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $131 million in the second quarter and in line with our guidance. So we're $34 million higher than the first quarter, due mainly to the favorable effect of a $40 million insurance settlement during the first quarter. 
For the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $367 million which was in line with our guidance. Net interest expense was $116 million, which was slightly below our guidance and lowered in the first quarter of 2010, due partly to lower interest rates and higher-than-anticipated capitalized interest. The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the second quarter was 34.2%. 
Regarding cash flows for the second quarter. Capital spending was $517 million, which includes $140 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target has been revised to $2.3 billion to incorporate spending for various strategic projects, including hydrocracker projects at our St. Charles and Port Arthur refineries and additional turnaround maintenance at our Benicia, Aruba, Memphis and Port Arthur refineries. 
Also during the second quarter, we spent $223 million to pay down debt, paid $28 million in dividends and received $220 million in proceeds from the sale of the Delaware City assets.
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of June, total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion, and we had over $4.4 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 28.6%.
So far in the third quarter, benchmark margins have moderated versus the second quarter of 2010 in most of our regions. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have decreased to 22% to $9.51 per barrel, while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI has increased 17% to $8.47 per barrel. We're continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts, with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the second quarter. 
One region that is up versus the last quarter is the West Coast, where gasoline margins versus WTI increased 23% to $20.36 per barrel, partially offset by diesel margins that had decreased 12% to $12.69 per barrel. Unfortunately, ongoing maintenance work at our Benicia refinery is limiting our ability to capture this margin, but we anticipate being back up to full rates by late August.
In summary, we had a really good second quarter that demonstrated the earnings power of our assets, following the strategic actions and cost-reduction efforts we've taken over the last 12 months. No doubt, there is more work to be done to continue to improve our competitiveness, but we've made great progress and we are proud of what our employees have accomplished so far. 
Going forward, we will remain focused on running our assets safely and reliably, maintaining our financial strength and investment-grade credit rating, reducing our costs and improving our portfolio of assets. And now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions."

Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel, which is higher than the second quarter due mainly to refinery maintenance expenses at Benicia and Aruba and higher expected energy prices. 
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.36 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for noncash COGs such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of the other items in the third quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $135 million. Net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 35%.

And I conceded to all of you that we were having trouble achieving that goal. So we have basically dropped that program and it pulled it much closer in, and are working on what we've been giving as guidance more recently. I mean, that's been an issue we're going to get $100 million savings. Last year, we got -- I'm looking around the room here. We'll give you a number. $215 million. And we have a very detailed list of where this is coming from, and we will exceed the $100 million this year. We'll probably be much closer to over $200 million again. Sounds like it comes on the revenue lines, so it's not at all just costs. But we molecule management and things looking along those lines. But we have a very diligent, focused approach here, but we've pulled that whole goal structure in much closer. When you look at the Salomon benchmarking though, we have a goal in this company that we're going to be first quartile. And that's going to take us a few more years, but we are going to be a first-quartile refiner throughout our portfolio."

As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $530 million or $0.93 per share. I should note that the $53 million after-tax gain from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in 2009 and sold in June of this year.
Second quarter 2010 operating income was $921 million versus an operating loss of $192 million in the second quarter of 2009. The $1.1 billion increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for distillate and secondary products, such as petrochemicals, asphalt and lube oils as well as improved sour crude discounts. 
The improvement we saw in diesel margins was most significant. If you look at the benchmark ULSD [ultra-low-sulfur diesel] margins on the Gulf Coast, they nearly doubled from $6.16 per barrel in the second quarter of 2009 to $12.14 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010. Secondary margins also made strong contributions. For example, propylene margins improved 156%, and lube oil margins increased 104% versus the second quarter of the 2009.
Sour crude oil discounts also improved during the second quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discount to WTI [West Texas Intermediate] expanded from $4.57 in the second quarter of 2009 to $9.75 in the second quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of the WTI price, so the Maya discount increased from 7.7% of WTI in the second quarter of 2009 to 12.5% of WTI in the second quarter of 2010, which is a 62% improvement year-over-year.
Our second quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.3 million barrels per day, which is slightly higher than the top end of our guidance as the strong margins incentivized higher run rates. However, compared to the second quarter of last year, volumes were down 55,000 barrels per day, mainly due to the continued idle status of our Aruba refinery. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were $3.55 per barrel, which was well below our guidance. This was primarily due to the higher throughput volumes and lower-than-expected maintenance, catalyst and chemicals and energy costs. 
We are pleased to see that our focus on cost reductions is showing results. In fact, we're on pace to exceed our target of $100 million in pretax cost savings in 2010. The combinations of numerous company-wide initiatives and commitment by our employees has yielded nearly $90 million in cost savings through June and there is more to come.
Looking at our other business segments. Retail had its best-ever second quarter, with operating income at $109 million which is 68% higher than the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher fuel margins in the U.S. Our Canadian Retail operations also performed well during the quarter. 
Our Ethanol segment had $35 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2010, which is $13 million higher than the second quarter of 2009, but down from the first quarter of this year due mainly to compression in margins between ethanol and corn prices. Despite very competitive industry conditions, our Ethanol business has been profitable and we are pleased with the performance of this business.
General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $131 million in the second quarter and in line with our guidance. So we're $34 million higher than the first quarter, due mainly to the favorable effect of a $40 million insurance settlement during the first quarter. 
For the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $367 million which was in line with our guidance. Net interest expense was $116 million, which was slightly below our guidance and lowered in the first quarter of 2010, due partly to lower interest rates and higher-than-anticipated capitalized interest. The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the second quarter was 34.2%. 
Regarding cash flows for the second quarter. Capital spending was $517 million, which includes $140 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target has been revised to $2.3 billion to incorporate spending for various strategic projects, including hydrocracker projects at our St. Charles and Port Arthur refineries and additional turnaround maintenance at our Benicia, Aruba, Memphis and Port Arthur refineries. 
Also during the second quarter, we spent $223 million to pay down debt, paid $28 million in dividends and received $220 million in proceeds from the sale of the Delaware City assets.
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of June, total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion, and we had over $4.4 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 28.6%.
So far in the third quarter, benchmark margins have moderated versus the second quarter of 2010 in most of our regions. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have decreased to 22% to $9.51 per barrel, while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI has increased 17% to $8.47 per barrel. We're continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts, with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the second quarter. 
One region that is up versus the last quarter is the West Coast, where gasoline margins versus WTI increased 23% to $20.36 per barrel, partially offset by diesel margins that had decreased 12% to $12.69 per barrel. Unfortunately, ongoing maintenance work at our Benicia refinery is limiting our ability to capture this margin, but we anticipate being back up to full rates by late August.
In summary, we had a really good second quarter that demonstrated the earnings power of our assets, following the strategic actions and cost-reduction efforts we've taken over the last 12 months. No doubt, there is more work to be done to continue to improve our competitiveness, but we've made great progress and we are proud of what our employees have accomplished so far. 
Going forward, we will remain focused on running our assets safely and reliably, maintaining our financial strength and investment-grade credit rating, reducing our costs and improving our portfolio of assets. And now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.

Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel, which is higher than the second quarter due mainly to refinery maintenance expenses at Benicia and Aruba and higher expected energy prices. 
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.36 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for noncash COGs such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of the other items in the third quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $135 million. Net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 35%.

We are a much more stable tax environment there for the next 20 years. And so I think the value of the asset has been approved, and the government of Aruba has worked with us very well for Aruba and helped us with the asset.

Venezuela still struggles to export both gasoline and diesel and are continuing to get it from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refineries are still down. Mexico's demand exceeds its supply, and it continues to import products. So although we've seen we are close to Europe, for example, now, we still do have significant volumes swimming out on the water.

So kind of revisiting the prior question that's been asked before, I mean, do you have any color on how you see deployment of cash, whether it be buyback, strategic acquisitions or just continuing to kind of run with a higher cash balance until we see in a more macro certainty?

Our capital spending, we had in the release, were about $2.3 billion. And we expect to progress on our Port Arthur hydrocracker project here. So we continue to work on our assets. By the end of this year, we'll finish the big scrub in Benicia and also have the MSA too. And then next year, you'll see us do more strategic projects that we really can improve our basic business. But basically to your question, we're going to run with a higher cash balance.

And we have a very detailed list of where this is coming from, and we will exceed the $100 million this year. We'll probably be much closer to over $200 million again. Sounds like it comes on the revenue lines, so it's not at all just costs. But we molecule management and things looking along those lines. But we have a very diligent, focused approach here, but we've pulled that whole goal structure in much closer.

I should note that the $53 million after-tax gain from discontinued operatio",1055,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $530 million or $0.93 per share. I should note that the $53 million after-tax gain from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in 2009 and sold in June of this year.
Second quarter 2010 operating income was $921 million versus an operating loss of $192 million in the second quarter of 2009. The $1.1 billion increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for distillate and secondary products, such as petrochemicals, asphalt and lube oils as well as improved sour crude discounts. 
The improvement we saw in diesel margins was most significant. If you look at the benchmark ULSD [ultra-low-sulfur diesel] margins on the Gulf Coast, they nearly doubled from $6.16 per barrel in the second quarter of 2009 to $12.14 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010. Secondary margins also made strong contributions. For example, propylene margins improved 156%, and lube oil margins increased 104% versus the second quarter of the 2009.
Sour crude oil discounts also improved during the second quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discount to WTI [West Texas Intermediate] expanded from $4.57 in the second quarter of 2009 to $9.75 in the second quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of the WTI price, so the Maya discount increased from 7.7% of WTI in the second quarter of 2009 to 12.5% of WTI in the second quarter of 2010, which is a 62% improvement year-over-year.
Our second quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.3 million barrels per day, which is slightly higher than the top end of our guidance as the strong margins incentivized higher run rates. However, compared to the second quarter of last year, volumes were down 55,000 barrels per day, mainly due to the continued idle status of our Aruba refinery. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were $3.55 per barrel, which was well below our guidance. This was primarily due to the higher throughput volumes and lower than expected maintenance, catalyst and chemicals and energy costs. 
We are pleased to see that our focus on cost reductions is showing results. In fact, we're on pace to exceed our target of $100 million in pretax cost savings in 2010. The combinations of numerous company-wide initiatives and commitment by our employees has yielded nearly $90 million in cost savings through June and there is more to come.
Looking at our other business segments. Retail had its best ever second quarter, with operating income at $109 million which is 68% higher than the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher fuel margins in the U.S. Our Canadian Retail operations also performed well during the quarter. 
Our Ethanol segment had $35 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2010, which is $13 million higher than the second quarter of 2009, but down from the first quarter of this year due mainly to compression in margins between ethanol and corn prices. Despite very competitive industry conditions, our Ethanol business has been profitable and we are pleased with the performance of this business.
General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $131 million in the second quarter and in line with our guidance. So we're $34 million higher than the first quarter, due mainly to the favorable effect of a $40 million insurance settlement during the first quarter. 
For the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $367 million, which was in line with our guidance. Net interest expense was $116 million, which was slightly below our guidance and lowered in the first quarter of 2010, due partly to lower interest rates and higher than anticipated capitalized interest. The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the second quarter was 34.2%. 
Regarding cash flows for the second quarter. Capital spending was $517 million, which includes $140 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target has been revised to $2.3 billion to incorporate spending for various strategic projects, including hydrocracker projects at our St. Charles and Port Arthur refineries and additional turnaround maintenance at our Benicia, Aruba, Memphis and Port Arthur refineries. 
Also during the second quarter, we spent $223 million to pay down debt, paid $28 million in dividends and received $220 million in proceeds from the sale of the Delaware City assets.
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of June, total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion, and we had over $4.4 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 28.6%.
So far in the third quarter, benchmark margins have moderated versus the second quarter of 2010 in most of our regions. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have decreased to 22% to $9.51 per barrel, while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI has increased 17% to $8.47 per barrel. We're continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts, with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the second quarter. 
One region that is up versus the last quarter is the West Coast, where gasoline margins versus WTI increased 23% to $20.36 per barrel, partially offset by diesel margins that had decreased 12% to $12.69 per barrel. Unfortunately, ongoing maintenance work at our Benicia refinery is limiting our ability to capture this margin, but we anticipate being back up to full rates by late August.
In summary, we had a really good second quarter that demonstrated the earnings power of our assets, following the strategic actions and cost-reduction efforts we've taken over the last 12 months. No doubt, there is more work to be done to continue to improve our competitiveness, but we've made great progress and we are proud of what our employees have accomplished so far. 
Going forward, we will remain focused on running our assets safely and reliably, maintaining our financial strength and investment-grade credit rating, reducing our costs and improving our portfolio of assets. And now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions."

Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel, which is higher than the second quarter due mainly to refinery maintenance expenses at Benicia and Aruba and higher expected energy prices. 
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.36 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for noncash COGs such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of the other items in the third quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $135 million. Net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 35%.

I should note that the $53 million after-tax gain from discontinued operatio",1055,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $530 million or $0.93 per share. I should note that the $53 million after-tax gain from discontinued operations shown in the financial tables relates to the Delaware City assets that were shut down in 2009 and sold in June of this year.
Second quarter 2010 operating income was $921 million versus an operating loss of $192 million in the second quarter of 2009. The $1.1 billion increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for distillate and secondary products, such as petrochemicals, asphalt and lube oils as well as improved sour crude discounts. 
The improvement we saw in diesel margins was most significant. If you look at the benchmark ULSD [ultra-low-sulfur diesel] margins on the Gulf Coast, they nearly doubled from $6.16 per barrel in the second quarter of 2009 to $12.14 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010. Secondary margins also made strong contributions. For example, propylene margins improved 156%, and lube oil margins increased 104% versus the second quarter of the 2009.
Sour crude oil discounts also improved during the second quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discount to WTI [West Texas Intermediate] expanded from $4.57 in the second quarter of 2009 to $9.75 in the second quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of the WTI price, so the Maya discount increased from 7.7% of WTI in the second quarter of 2009 to 12.5% of WTI in the second quarter of 2010, which is a 62% improvement year-over-year.
Our second quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.3 million barrels per day, which is slightly higher than the top end of our guidance as the strong margins incentivized higher run rates. However, compared to the second quarter of last year, volumes were down 55,000 barrels per day, mainly due to the continued idle status of our Aruba refinery. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were $3.55 per barrel, which was well below our guidance. This was primarily due to the higher throughput volumes and lower than expected maintenance, catalyst and chemicals and energy costs. 
We are pleased to see that our focus on cost reductions is showing results. In fact, we're on pace to exceed our target of $100 million in pretax cost savings in 2010. The combinations of numerous company-wide initiatives and commitment by our employees has yielded nearly $90 million in cost savings through June and there is more to come.
Looking at our other business segments. Retail had its best ever second quarter, with operating income at $109 million which is 68% higher than the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher fuel margins in the U.S. Our Canadian Retail operations also performed well during the quarter. 
Our Ethanol segment had $35 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2010, which is $13 million higher than the second quarter of 2009, but down from the first quarter of this year due mainly to compression in margins between ethanol and corn prices. Despite very competitive industry conditions, our Ethanol business has been profitable and we are pleased with the performance of this business.
General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $131 million in the second quarter and in line with our guidance. So we're $34 million higher than the first quarter, due mainly to the favorable effect of a $40 million insurance settlement during the first quarter. 
For the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense was $367 million, which was in line with our guidance. Net interest expense was $116 million, which was slightly below our guidance and lowered in the first quarter of 2010, due partly to lower interest rates and higher than anticipated capitalized interest. The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the second quarter was 34.2%. 
Regarding cash flows for the second quarter. Capital spending was $517 million, which includes $140 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target has been revised to $2.3 billion to incorporate spending for various strategic projects, including hydrocracker projects at our St. Charles and Port Arthur refineries and additional turnaround maintenance at our Benicia, Aruba, Memphis and Port Arthur refineries. 
Also during the second quarter, we spent $223 million to pay down debt, paid $28 million in dividends and received $220 million in proceeds from the sale of the Delaware City assets.
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of June, total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion, and we had over $4.4 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 28.6%.
So far in the third quarter, benchmark margins have moderated versus the second quarter of 2010 in most of our regions. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have decreased to 22% to $9.51 per barrel, while the Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI has increased 17% to $8.47 per barrel. We're continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts, with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the second quarter. 
One region that is up versus the last quarter is the West Coast, where gasoline margins versus WTI increased 23% to $20.36 per barrel, partially offset by diesel margins that had decreased 12% to $12.69 per barrel. Unfortunately, ongoing maintenance work at our Benicia refinery is limiting our ability to capture this margin, but we anticipate being back up to full rates by late August.
In summary, we had a really good second quarter that demonstrated the earnings power of our assets, following the strategic actions and cost-reduction efforts we've taken over the last 12 months. No doubt, there is more work to be done to continue to improve our competitiveness, but we've made great progress and we are proud of what our employees have accomplished so far. 
Going forward, we will remain focused on running our assets safely and reliably, maintaining our financial strength and investment-grade credit rating, reducing our costs and improving our portfolio of assets. And now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions."

Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel, which is higher than the second quarter due mainly to refinery maintenance expenses at Benicia and Aruba and higher expected energy prices. 
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.15 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.36 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for noncash COGs such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of the other items in the third quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $135 million. Net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $365 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 35%.

And the things that I mentioned, the factors that I mentioned that continue to support the exports are there. And it's anybody's guess at what point in time there might be stabilization of some of those activities. I don't know when and if the Venezuelans are going to restart and run Isla in a reliable way, and when they will improve their internal operations. Addition to the supply issues there, we also have demand increasing down in those markets. And so if the Gulf Coast, because of its low-cost structure and its complex refineries, it's very competitive and allows us with decent cost of products to move into those markets.

As noted in the release, we reported a third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.51 per share. Third quarter 2010 operating income was $571 million versus an operating",1261,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.51 per share. 
Third quarter 2010 operating income was $571 million versus an operating loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2009. The $809 million increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for diesel and better discounts for low-quality feedstocks, combined with higher throughput volumes compared to the third quarter of 2009. 
Diesel margins improved significantly versus last year. If you look at the benchmark, ULSD margin on the Gulf Coast, it increased from $6.97 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $11.69 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 or a 68% increase. The sour crude oil discounts also improved during the third quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts to WTI expanded from $5.02 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $8.47 in the third quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of WTI, so the Maya discount increased from 7.4% of WTI in the third quarter of last year to 11.1% of WTI in the third quarter of '10, which is a 50% improvement year-over-year.
So far in the fourth quarter, benchmark margins have remained relatively strong for this time of year. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have increased from $5.83 per barrel in October 2009 to $12.91 per barrel in October of this year or 121%. Meanwhile, Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI were strong early in the month, but have moderated recently. We are continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the third quarter levels and are which 8% higher than October 2009 levels. 
Our third quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged at 2.4 million barrels a day, which is in line with our guidance. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, volumes were up 136,000 barrels per day due to higher throughput at many of our refineries as a result of the better margin environment. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were $3.76 per barrel, which is favorably below our guidance. Cash operating expenses were higher then in the second quarter, primarily due to extra maintenance expense at Aruba and the Benicia. If you exclude the $35 million in extra expense for maintenance at Aruba in the third quarter, our systemwide cash operating expenses were only $3.60 per barrel, and our Gulf Coast cash costs were only $3.36 per barrel.
Our company-wide focus on cost reduction is continuing to yield results. Since the beginning of 2010, we have achieved approximately $140 million in pretax cost reduction through numerous initiatives and great execution by our employees. We are on pace to reduce pretax cost by a total of $185 million in 2010, and our goal for 2011 is an additional $100 million in pretax cost reduction. 
As part of our efforts to reduce costs, we remain committed to improving our operating performance. We set goals and measure our progress using Salomon ranking, which are benchmark surveys across the refining industry that cover key operating categories. Salomon rankings are by quartile, with first quartile indicating that you are performing among the top 25% in the industry. We are proud that our Refining portfolio has achieved first quartile performance in 2010 in two categories: nonenergy cash operating expenses and personnel. Although we are second quartile in the categories of reliability, maintenance expense and energy efficiency, we are making consistent progress towards first quartile performance.
Turning back to our third quarter results. Our Non-refining business segments also performed well. Retail nearly maxed last year's record earnings with operating income at $105 million, mostly due to increase fuel volumes. Our Ethanol segment had $47 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2010, which was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2009, but up $12 million from the second quarter of this year due mainly to an increase in Ethanol margin. 
In the third quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $139 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $372 million, and net interest expense was $119 million, all in line with our guidance. The effective tax rate on continued operations in the third quarter was 38%.
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of September. Total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, and we had nearly $4.2 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 27%.
Regarding cash flows for the quarter, we paid $28 million in dividends. Capital spending was $508 million, which includes $67 million for turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target is $2.3 billion, and for 2011, our preliminary estimate for capital spending is $2.6 billion. This includes a $502 million decrease in regulatory spending being partially offset by a $305 million increase in sustained and reliability spending on projects that should improve our operations, such as coke drum replacement at Port Arthur and FCC maintenance at our McKee refinery. In addition in 2011, we plan to increase spending for economic growth projects by $525 million. 
As illustrated in recent investor presentations that are available on our website, we have several large projects that we estimate will provide significant earnings power using a reasonable set of price assumptions. In general, these projects capitalize on our outlook for relatively high crude oil prices and low natural gas prices. For example, the Port Arthur Hydrocracker project, which should be complete near the end of 2012 should generate $485 million of estimated incremental EBITDA and yield an internal rate of return of 21% on an unlevered basis. This is just one example of several economic growth projects in which we will continue investing over the next few years. 
Portfolio optimization also remains a strategic priority, and we continue to execute on this. In the third quarter, we announced an agreement to sell the Paulsboro refinery for $360 million, consisting of $180 million in cash and a note for $180 million, plus $275 million in cash for estimated net working capital and inventories. We anticipate closing this transaction in the fourth quarter. The potential sale of the Paulsboro refinery will result in a non-cash, pretax charge of approximately $920 million, and the tax loss will be $155 million. 
Also we announced an agreement yesterday to sell our 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System for $330 million, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. When completed, the disposition will result in a book gain of $56 million and a tax gain of $235 million. This system primarily consists of two crude oil pipelines running from the deep water Gulf of Mexico to the Texas coast. We believe the sale of this non-core asset will realize hidden value for our shareholders. 
At Aruba, we are continuing our maintenance activities and plan to have the refinery ready for restart in mid-December. I should note that these activities include many important improvements to the long-term reliability of the refinery, storage terminal and the docks. And in the first quarter of 2011, the Aruba refinery will be able to supply intermediate feedstocks to our Gulf Coast refineries during the planned turnaround. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions."

Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.80 per barrel, including Paulsboro and the costs at Aruba.
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.3 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.33 per gallon, which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash COGS, such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of the other items for the fourth quarter, we expect general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $155 million. Net interest expense should be around $118 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $380 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 40%.

Gasoline actually picked up in the third quarter, and we're doing about 65,000 barrels a day there, and we expect that to continue also. So generally, the export markets have continued to be strong. Going forward, what do we think? Well, yes, you still got global demand for products that's growing faster than our U.S. demand. You still have some supply issue with Venezuela struggling. Mexico demand continues to exceed their supply, and so they're importing products. We're seeing more diesel [ph] now going down to Brazil, and their economy has been very strong. During the second quarter, Brazil imports reached almost 200,000 barrels a day. And then we expect that they could be importing gasoline here at some point in the future. And then you've got just these, well, temporary issues like this French strike that took place, which we don't see it having a major impact on the market. I would tell you, I think what we've seen is that it's probably supported the New York Harbor market a little bit. And then perhaps longer term, there'll be a restocking that takes place as they depleted some of their reserves. But for other than that, we just don't see much.

Probably, if we were to say a 75-25 split, that would be a fair assessment. And if you look, we talked about the fact that they may continue going forward. Last year at this time, we had significant amount of inventories being stored on the water. Those inventories are down today, and we are very strong here South America where they pull volumes. And winter is coming in the rest of the world. So just looking at the outlook right now, it looks like things have shaped up pretty well internationally for this growth to be strong. If you look more domestically where our demand is up from last year and we're seeing data that supports increasing activity, truck tonnage is up, rail productivity has increased, and all these serve as leading indicators for industrial growth.

It is the first law in the United States that's actually addressing this. But we'll see what happens when people vote on Tuesday.

We think we'll have a better year than we've had this year. And this year, considering it's worked out reasonably well. So with that in mind, we believe that. Now on the hydrocrackers, if you look at the world, diesel fuel is growing at least 2x faster than gasoline's growing. It's already a 25 million barrel a day business in the world versus gasoline in the 22 million or 23 million barrels a day. We've mentioned that of the U.S. Gulf Coast, we believe we can export. And these hydrocrackers, well, let me add one other point, you can see that the diesel [ph] crack today is at least twice the gasoline crack. It may be almost 3x the gasoline crack in the Gulf Coast. So it's clearly advantageous to make our growth spec relatively [indiscernible] for diesel. That part said, we also believe, as Mike said in his speaker notes, that natural gas prices are going to stay low for the foreseeable future. And in a hydrocracker, you convert a natural gas to hydrogen and you put the hydrogen in a hydrocracker, we get a liquid volume gain of about 30%, 25% to 30%. So in a way, it's a gas-to-liquids operation. So we see these projects as good value-added projects for our shareholder. We already are basically halfway into them. All the equipment sitting at the site. So we think it is on our shareholders' interest to finish these. So between the economy getting better, selling fuel, diesel, thinking natural gas, we think they're the kind of projects that we think we were right on.

We're seeing no imports today. Brazilian ethanol is actually more expensive than U.S. ethanol even without the import tariff, so it's kind of a nonfactor. If anything we're seeing, this export of ethanol, may be into Canada, some into Europe because the U.S. is really the lowest ethanol prices around. So all in all, I think the business is doing good just on economic alone. The subsidy is not really a factor today, so there is blending economic, and the tariff is not a factor because of Brazilian ethanol being more expensive than U.S."

Yes, potentially, it could come here. But I don't see that happening over the near-term. Their demand keeps going up faster than their supply to us. So I don't see that changing over the near to intermediate term, long term. As far as the subsidy, most of this year, yes, ethanol is actually cheaper than gasoline. So the subsidy is really not a factor today. It allows the blender to capture some of the tax that ethanol is selling above gasoline. It goes back and forth. So I think the fact that mandate is actually higher so the ethanol plants will have to run and have to have margins to run. It always emphasize the fact that our plans, given the corn bill, we don't have drilling cost to get the corn bill market. We actually buy our corn, our actual corn caps right now is about $30.50 per bushel under the seedbox, which gives us about $0.11 under the seedbox right there. And if you look at some of these destination plants, they have to actually rail the seed from Chicago area or the Midwest to destinations. They're paying above the boxes. I feel like we have at least $0.20 a gallon margin advantage over the ethanol plant. So I think that we've got a very low cost base in our plants. We are taking advantage on location and the costs."

As noted in the release, we reported a third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.51 per share. Third quarter 2010 operating income was $571 million versus an operating",1261,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.51 per share. 
Third quarter 2010 operating income was $571 million versus an operating loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2009. The $809 million increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for diesel and better discounts for low-quality feedstocks, combined with higher throughput volumes compared to the third quarter of 2009. 
Diesel margins improved significantly versus last year. If you look at the benchmark, ULSD margin on the Gulf Coast, it increased from $6.97 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $11.69 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 or a 68% increase. The sour crude oil discounts also improved during the third quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts to WTI expanded from $5.02 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $8.47 in the third quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of WTI, so the Maya discount increased from 7.4% of WTI in the third quarter of last year to 11.1% of WTI in the third quarter of '10, which is a 50% improvement year-over-year.
So far in the fourth quarter, benchmark margins have remained relatively strong for this time of year. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have increased from $5.83 per barrel in October 2009 to $12.91 per barrel in October of this year or 121%. Meanwhile, Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI were strong early in the month, but have moderated recently. We are continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the third quarter levels and are which 8% higher than October 2009 levels. 
Our third quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged at 2.4 million barrels a day, which is in line with our guidance. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, volumes were up 136,000 barrels per day due to higher throughput at many of our refineries as a result of the better margin environment. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were $3.76 per barrel, which is favorably below our guidance. Cash operating expenses were higher then in the second quarter, primarily due to extra maintenance expense at Aruba and the Benicia. If you exclude the $35 million in extra expense for maintenance at Aruba in the third quarter, our systemwide cash operating expenses were only $3.60 per barrel, and our Gulf Coast cash costs were only $3.36 per barrel.
Our company-wide focus on cost reduction is continuing to yield results. Since the beginning of 2010, we have achieved approximately $140 million in pretax cost reduction through numerous initiatives and great execution by our employees. We are on pace to reduce pretax cost by a total of $185 million in 2010, and our goal for 2011 is an additional $100 million in pretax cost reduction. 
As part of our efforts to reduce costs, we remain committed to improving our operating performance. We set goals and measure our progress using Salomon ranking, which are benchmark surveys across the refining industry that cover key operating categories. Salomon rankings are by quartile, with first quartile indicating that you are performing among the top 25% in the industry. We are proud that our Refining portfolio has achieved first quartile performance in 2010 in two categories: nonenergy cash operating expenses and personnel. Although we are second quartile in the categories of reliability, maintenance expense and energy efficiency, we are making consistent progress towards first quartile performance.
Turning back to our third quarter results. Our Non-refining business segments also performed well. Retail nearly maxed last year's record earnings with operating income at $105 million, mostly due to increase fuel volumes. Our Ethanol segment had $47 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2010, which was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2009, but up $12 million from the second quarter of this year due mainly to an increase in Ethanol margin. 
In the third quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $139 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $372 million, and net interest expense was $119 million, all in line with our guidance. The effective tax rate on continued operations in the third quarter was 38%.
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of September. Total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, and we had nearly $4.2 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 27%.
Regarding cash flows for the quarter, we paid $28 million in dividends. Capital spending was $508 million, which includes $67 million for turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target is $2.3 billion, and for 2011, our preliminary estimate for capital spending is $2.6 billion. This includes a $502 million decrease in regulatory spending being partially offset by a $305 million increase in sustained and reliability spending on projects that should improve our operations, such as coke drum replacement at Port Arthur and FCC maintenance at our McKee refinery. In addition in 2011, we plan to increase spending for economic growth projects by $525 million. 
As illustrated in recent investor presentations that are available on our website, we have several large projects that we estimate will provide significant earnings power using a reasonable set of price assumptions. In general, these projects capitalize on our outlook for relatively high crude oil prices and low natural gas prices. For example, the Port Arthur Hydrocracker project, which should be complete near the end of 2012 should generate $485 million of estimated incremental EBITDA and yield an internal rate of return of 21% on an unlevered basis. This is just one example of several economic growth projects in which we will continue investing over the next few years. 
Portfolio optimization also remains a strategic priority, and we continue to execute on this. In the third quarter, we announced an agreement to sell the Paulsboro refinery for $360 million, consisting of $180 million in cash and a note for $180 million, plus $275 million in cash for estimated net working capital and inventories. We anticipate closing this transaction in the fourth quarter. The potential sale of the Paulsboro refinery will result in a non-cash, pretax charge of approximately $920 million, and the tax loss will be $155 million. 
Also we announced an agreement yesterday to sell our 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System for $330 million, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. When completed, the disposition will result in a book gain of $56 million and a tax gain of $235 million. This system primarily consists of two crude oil pipelines running from the deep water Gulf of Mexico to the Texas coast. We believe the sale of this non-core asset will realize hidden value for our shareholders. 
At Aruba, we are continuing our maintenance activities and plan to have the refinery ready for restart in mid-December. I should note that these activities include many important improvements to the long-term reliability of the refinery, storage terminal and the docks. And in the first quarter of 2011, the Aruba refinery will be able to supply intermediate feedstocks to our Gulf Coast refineries during the planned turnaround. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.

Thanks, Mike. For modeling our fourth quarter operation, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf Coast should be at 1.325 million to 1.375 million barrels per day, excluding Aruba; Mid-Continent should be at 410,000 to 420,000 barrels per day; the Northeast should be at 370,000 to 380,000 barrels per day, including Paulsboro; and the West Coast should be at 280,000 to 290,000 barrels per day. 
Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.80 per barrel, including Paulsboro and the costs at Aruba.
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.3 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.33 per gallon, which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash COGS, such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of the other items for the fourth quarter, we expect general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $155 million. Net interest expense should be around $118 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $380 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 40%.
We will now open the call for questions, Brandis.

Valero, we're a refining company. You guys recommend us. Our investors invest in us. They want exposure to the segment. We refine products and commodities. We believe that we can add shareholder value to profitable growth. Expanding our footprint will help us perform more profitably, hence we optimize our system. It also will support our trading efforts in the sense of an asset-backed trading portfolio. Our focus of late is obviously Europe. And since you guys know what assets are for sale, it's obviously the U.K. But Europe is a large market. It is long gasoline, short diesel. We've said in many of our presentations that we've been exporting diesel to Europe. The U.S. is still importing gasoline. At some capacity, we'll have to shut down, but other capacity, we'll survive, and it will prosper. We have one advantage, being large, in the sense that we get to look at our portfolio and we can see the variability among assets. The quality assets that's coming to market in this round of announced assets for sale is much better than what we've seen previously in the Western Europe, U.K. markets. We still expect to see even some more assets come to market, especially as some of the majors are beginning to question the integrated business model that they followed in which you guys have already been questioning whether the integrated business model is the right model going forward. Valero is unique. We're different than all the rest of the independents and that we're very, very large. And so we think there's opportunities, and we've said this for the last several years that we keep looking. And now with the quality assets on the market, yes, we're actively looking at.

Gasoline actually picked up in the third quarter, and we're doing about 65,000 barrels a day there, and we expect that to continue also. So generally, the export markets have continued to be strong. Going forward, what do we think? Well, yes, you still got global demand for products that's growing faster than our U.S. demand. You still have some supply issue with Venezuela struggling. Mexico demand continues to exceed their supply, and so they're importing products. We're seeing more diesel [ph] now going down to Brazil, and their economy has been very strong. During the second quarter, Brazil imports reached almost 200,000 barrels a day. And then we expect that they could be importing gasoline here at some point in the future. And then you've got just these, well, temporary issues like this French strike that took place, which we don't see it having a major impact on the market. I would tell you, I think what we've seen is that it's probably supported the New York Harbor market a little bit. And then perhaps longer term, there'll be a restocking that takes place as they depleted some of their reserves. But for other than that, we just don't see much.

Last year at this time, we had significant amount of inventories being stored on the water. Those inventories are down today, and we are very strong here South America where they pull volumes. And winter is coming in the rest of the world. So just looking at the outlook right now, it looks like things have shaped up pretty well internationally for this growth to be strong. If you look more domestically where our demand is up from last year and we're seeing data that supports increasing activity, truck tonnage is up, rail productivity has increased, and all these serve as leading indicators for industrial growth.

And we've seen some encouraging news here over the last week or so. The State Department, I think, has come to a conclusion that Canadian crude is really important to our national energy security. Hillary Clinton in a speech just a week or so ago made a comment that although she's not signed off on the permit for the project that she is inclined to do so. And the following day, four of the international labor unions, which are representing a significant number of workers, tell that or urging the State Department to approve the permit to Keystone. So we expect now that sometime after the elections, we're going to see that presidential permit getting executed. It might be as late as the second quarter of '11, but we expect it to happen. Now that was just about three to six players of the original plan, which have [indiscernible] being completed by the end of 2012. Now we're looking probably at quarter 2 of 2013. And just by way of an update on the status of the project, they've got 100% of the pipe into pump stations that have been purchased. 60% of the right of way for the entire project has been taken care of, and the 75% of the piece from Cushing to the Gulf Coast is in place. The labor contracts have been signed. The construction contracts are close to being awarded. And so everything is just proceeding as we would expect. Now the link from Cushing to Port Arthur, which is the one we're interested in is going to be complete about the second quarter of 2012. Now that would bring a certain volume of the heavy sour Canadian into the market for us to be able to run it at Port Arthur in advance of the completion of the overall Keystone, which again would be the second quarter of '13.

But for those who don't know, AB32 is a cap and trade, low-carbon fuel that reduces it back to 1990 levels [indiscernible] power where 1/3 has to be renewable. It is really an anti-fossil fuel law. It was only 13  pages, but it's more seem to have very large potential impact. If we fail to win Prop 23, the cost to the consumer in California is clearly going to go up. And I guess we'll get the opportunity down the road to say, ""We told you so."" And it will all be passed through to the consumer as the companies aren't going to able to absorb this or they're going to go out of business or makes the playing field on level with imports. Valero has 1,600 employees in California because people ask us why are we involved. We employ on average about 900 contractors permanently. We've invested this year in California about $500 million. Our investment in California is $3.8 billion. We pay taxes. We pay property taxes of $27 million, sales and use taxes of $20-some million. So obviously, we are in California as a good neighbor, and some of the [indiscernible] are extremely disappointing. The opposition has been able to characterize this issue as Texas oil companies. We've been flattered as I'm sure Tesoro is that we're now a big oil. We thought we're independent. This is about George really [ph] on dirty companies and dirty polluters, yet this is about CO2. It's not about other stuff, it's CO2. We talked about the green -- the opposition talks about the green industry, and I'll say to you what jobs? If this continues, the jobs are going to be in Nevada, Arizona and China. The building trades in Northern California have unemployment in the range of 30%. Those are real jobs for real people. I'm surprised no one really asked why the Silicon Valley and venture capitalists are throwing so much money at this. They have though been able to shift the debate away from the consumer impacts to the issues I just mentioned. People really don't understand that this is a CO2 regulation bill. It is the first law in the United States that's actually addressing this. But we'll see what happens when people vote on Tuesday.

I think if you look at least our 2009 data, 81% of our output is gasoline, diesel and jet. So we're fuel, and so we need people back to work. We need people driving their cars and trucks moving and people flying. So we see the economic recovery happening, it's just slow. So we think our margins will be good next year. We think we'll have a better year than we've had this year. And this year, considering it's worked out reasonably well. So with that in mind, we believe that. Now on the hydrocrackers, if you look at the world, diesel fuel is growing at least 2x faster than gasoline's growing. It's already a 25 million barrel a day business in the world versus gasoline in the 22 million or 23 million barrels a day. We've mentioned that of the U.S. Gulf Coast, we believe we can export. And these hydrocrackers, well, let me add one other point, you can see that the diesel [ph] crack today is at least twice the gasoline crack. It may be almost 3x the gasoline crack in the Gulf Coast. So it's clearly advantageous to make our growth spec relatively [indiscernible] for diesel. That part said, we also believe, as Mike said in his speaker notes, that natural gas prices are going to stay low for the foreseeable future. And in a hydrocracker, you convert a natural gas to hydrogen and you put the hydrogen in a hydrocracker, we get a liquid volume gain of about 30%, 25% to 30%. So in a way, it's a gas-to-liquids operation. So we see these projects as good value-added projects for our shareholder. We already are basically halfway into them. All the equipment sitting at the site. So we think it is on our shareholders' interest to finish these. So between the economy getting better, selling fuel, diesel, thinking natural gas, we think they're the kind of projects that we think we were right on. We just weren't anticipating the collapse in 2008.

And even though corn prices are up, they're up to about $5.60 a bushel, ethanol prices, they've been even faster. It's been good demand. Ethanol is now selling above gasoline by about $0.35 a gallon. So with the $0.45 blender's credit, it's still possible to win by about $0.10 a gallon. So we're seeing our margins do quite well. The demand is up. And as far as the be E15, I don't think that's going to have any short-term impact at all because the warranty situation, and that is really good for 2007, newer cars, it's kind of a problem. Retail has offered multiple grades. So I think E10 is going to be the predominant fuel over the near term. As far as the import tariff, $6.25 a gallon, I think it's irrelevant. We're seeing no imports today. Brazilian ethanol is actually more expensive than U.S. ethanol even without the import tariff, so it's kind of a nonfactor. If anything we're seeing, this export of ethanol, may be into Canada, some into Europe because the U.S. is really the lowest ethanol prices around. So all in all, I think the business is doing good just on economic alone. The subsidy is not really a factor today, so there is blending economic, and the tariff is not a factor because of Brazilian ethanol being more expensive than U.S.

Yes, potentially, it could come here. But I don't see that happening over the near-term. Their demand keeps going up faster than their supply to us. So I don't see that changing over the near to intermediate term, long term. As far as the subsidy, most of this year, yes, ethanol is actually cheaper than gasoline. So the subsidy is really not a factor today. It allows the blender to capture some of the tax that ethanol is selling above gasoline. It goes back and forth. So I think the fact that mandate is actually higher so the ethanol plants will have to run and have to have margins to run. It always emphasize the fact that our plans, given the corn bill, we don't have drilling cost to get the corn bill market. We actually buy our corn, our actual corn caps right now is about $30.50 per bushel under the seedbox, which gives us about $0.11 under the seedbox right there. And if you look at some of these destination plants, they have to actually rail the seed from Chicago area or the Midwest to destinations. They're paying above the boxes. I feel like we have at least $0.20 a gallon margin advantage over the ethanol plant. So I think that we've got a very low cost base in our plants. We are taking advantage on location and the costs.

As noted in the release, we reported a third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.51 per share. Third quarter 2010 operating income was $571 million versus an operating",1261,"Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.51 per share. 
Third quarter 2010 operating income was $571 million versus an operating loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2009. The $809 million increase in operating income was mainly due to higher margins for diesel and better discounts for low-quality feedstocks, combined with higher throughput volumes compared to the third quarter of 2009. 
Diesel margins improved significantly versus last year. If you look at the benchmark, ULSD margin on the Gulf Coast, it increased from $6.97 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $11.69 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 or a 68% increase. The sour crude oil discounts also improved during the third quarter. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts to WTI expanded from $5.02 per barrel in the third quarter of 2009 to $8.47 in the third quarter of 2010. Another way to look at this is as a percentage of WTI, so the Maya discount increased from 7.4% of WTI in the third quarter of last year to 11.1% of WTI in the third quarter of '10, which is a 50% improvement year-over-year.
So far in the fourth quarter, benchmark margins have remained relatively strong for this time of year. For example, the Gulf Coast ULSD margin versus WTI have increased from $5.83 per barrel in October 2009 to $12.91 per barrel in October of this year or 121%. Meanwhile, Gulf Coast gasoline margins versus WTI were strong early in the month, but have moderated recently. We are continuing to see good sour crude oil discounts with Maya discounts as a percentage of WTI holding fairly steady with the third quarter levels and are which 8% higher than October 2009 levels. 
Our third quarter 2010 refinery throughput volume averaged at 2.4 million barrels a day, which is in line with our guidance. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, volumes were up 136,000 barrels per day due to higher throughput at many of our refineries as a result of the better margin environment. 
Refinery cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were $3.76 per barrel, which is favorably below our guidance. Cash operating expenses were higher then in the second quarter, primarily due to extra maintenance expense at Aruba and the Benicia. If you exclude the $35 million in extra expense for maintenance at Aruba in the third quarter, our system-wide cash operating expenses were only $3.60 per barrel, and our Gulf Coast cash costs were only $3.36 per barrel.
Our company-wide focus on cost reduction is continuing to yield results. Since the beginning of 2010, we have achieved approximately $140 million in pretax cost reduction through numerous initiatives and great execution by our employees. We are on pace to reduce pretax cost by a total of $185 million in 2010, and our goal for 2011 is an additional $100 million in pretax cost reduction. 
As part of our efforts to reduce costs, we remain committed to improving our operating performance. We set goals and measure our progress using Salomon ranking, which are benchmark surveys across the refining industry that cover key operating categories. Salomon rankings are by quartile, with first quartile indicating that you are performing among the top 25% in the industry. We are proud that our Refining portfolio has achieved first quartile performance in 2010 in two categories: nonenergy cash operating expenses and personnel. Although we are second quartile in the categories of reliability, maintenance expense and energy efficiency, we are making consistent progress towards first quartile performance.
Turning back to our third quarter results. Our Non-refining business segments also performed well. Retail nearly maxed last year's record earnings with operating income at $105 million, mostly due to increased fuel volumes. Our Ethanol segment had $47 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2010, which was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2009, but up $12 million from the second quarter of this year due mainly to an increase in Ethanol margin. 
In the third quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $139 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $372 million, and net interest expense was $119 million, all in line with our guidance. The effective tax rate on continued operations in the third quarter was 38%.
With respect to our balance sheet at the end of September. Total debt was $8 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, and we had nearly $4.2 billion of additional liquidity available. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 27%.
Regarding cash flows for the quarter, we paid $28 million in dividends. Capital spending was $508 million, which includes $67 million for turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the year, our capital spending target is $2.3 billion, and for 2011, our preliminary estimate for capital spending is $2.6 billion. This includes a $502 million decrease in regulatory spending being partially offset by a $305 million increase in sustained and reliability spending on projects that should improve our operations, such as coke drum replacement at Port Arthur and FCC maintenance at our McKee refinery. In addition in 2011, we plan to increase spending for economic growth projects by $525 million. 
As illustrated in recent investor presentations that are available on our website, we have several large projects that we estimate will provide significant earnings power using a reasonable set of price assumptions. In general, these projects capitalize on our outlook for relatively high crude oil prices and low natural gas prices. For example, the Port Arthur Hydrocracker project, which should be complete near the end of 2012 should generate $485 million of estimated incremental EBITDA and yield an internal rate of return of 21% on an unlevered basis. This is just one example of several economic growth projects in which we will continue investing over the next few years. 
Portfolio optimization also remains a strategic priority, and we continue to execute on this. In the third quarter, we announced an agreement to sell the Paulsboro refinery for $360 million, consisting of $180 million in cash and a note for $180 million, plus $275 million in cash for estimated net working capital and inventories. We anticipate closing this transaction in the fourth quarter. The potential sale of the Paulsboro refinery will result in a non-cash, pretax charge of approximately $920 million, and the tax loss will be $155 million. 
Also we announced an agreement yesterday to sell our 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System for $330 million, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. When completed, the disposition will result in a book gain of $56 million and a tax gain of $235 million. This system primarily consists of two crude oil pipelines running from the deep water Gulf of Mexico to the Texas coast. We believe the sale of this non-core asset will realize hidden value for our shareholders. 
At Aruba, we are continuing our maintenance activities and plan to have the refinery ready for restart in mid-December. I should note that these activities include many important improvements to the long-term reliability of the refinery, storage terminal and the docks. And in the first quarter of 2011, the Aruba refinery will be able to supply intermediate feedstocks to our Gulf Coast refineries during the planned turnaround. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions."

Refinery cash operating expenses are expected to be around $3.80 per barrel, including Paulsboro and the costs at Aruba.
Regarding our Ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.3 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average approximately $0.33 per gallon, which includes $0.03 per gallon for non-cash COGS, such as depreciation and amortization.
With respect to some of the other items for the fourth quarter, we expect general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $155 million. Net interest expense should be around $118 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $380 million. And our effective tax rate should be approximately 40%.

And since you guys know what assets are for sale, it's obviously the U.K. But Europe is a large market. It is long gasoline, short diesel. We've said in many of our presentations that we've been exporting diesel to Europe. The U.S. is still importing gasoline. At some capacity, we'll have to shut down, but other capacity, we'll survive, and it will prosper. We have one advantage, being large, in the sense that we get to look at a portfolio and we can see the variability among assets. The quality assets that's coming to market in this round of announced assets for sale is much better than what we've seen previously in the Western Europe, U.K. markets. We still expect to see even some more assets come to market, especially as some of the majors are beginning to question the integrated business model that they followed in which you guys have already been questioning whether the integrated business model is the right model going forward. Valero is unique. We're different than all the rest of the independents in that we're very, very large.

Gasoline actually picked up in the third quarter, and we're doing about 65,000 barrels a day there, and we expect that to continue also. So generally, the export markets have continued to be strong. Going forward, what do we think? Well, yes, you still got global demand for products that's growing faster than our U.S. demand. You still have some supply issue with Venezuela struggling. Mexico demand continues to exceed their supply, and so they're importing products. We're seeing more distillate now going down to Brazil, and their economy has been very strong. During the second quarter, Brazil imports reached almost 200,000 barrels a day. And then we expect that they could be importing gasoline here at some point in the future.

They wouldn't be able to bring imports in anyway because the ports were closed. And if I can be generic on the volumes because, again, I think Doug asked this out of curious analysis from the last call that we'd really rather not be specific, but I can tell you right now that our exports are primarily headed to Europe, and then some lower volumes to South America. Probably, if we were to say a 75-25 split, that would be a fair assessment. And if you look, we talked about the fact that they may continue going forward. Last year at this time, we had significant amount of inventories being stored on the water. Those inventories are down today, and we are very strong year South America where they pull volumes. And winter is coming in the rest of the world. So just looking at the outlook right now, it looks like things have shaped up pretty well internationally for this growth to be strong. If you look more domestically where our demand is up from last year and we're seeing data that supports increasing activity, truck tonnage is up, rail productivity has increased, and all these serve as leading indicators for industrial growth. So I would say that we certainly think things will stay supported for the time being."

Now we would expect some of that to continue, so the question becomes are these stocking for the Christmas holidays or these are actually solid economic growth? But clearly, that was up significantly in August. And then you've seen data which spills over into cars as well, but the vehicle miles traveled has actually increased in the United States as well. So between Germany, between the French, between some of the South American countries and some domestic activity here and then the turnarounds, diesel has continued strong.

And we've seen some encouraging news here over the last week or so. The State Department, I think, has come to a conclusion that Canadian crude is really important to our national energy security. Hillary Clinton in a speech just a week or so ago made a comment that although she's not signed off on the permit for the project that she is inclined to do so. And the following day, four of the international labor unions, which are representing a significant number of workers, sent a letter urging the State Department to approve the permit to Keystone. So we expect now that sometime after the elections, we're going to see that presidential permit getting executed. It might be as late as the second quarter of '11, but we expect it to happen. Now that was just about three to six players of the original plan, which had excelled being completed by the end of 2012. Now we're looking probably at quarter 2 of 2013. And just by way of an update on the status of the project, they've got 100% of the pipe into pump stations that have been purchased. 60% of the right of way for the entire project has been taken care of, and the 75% of the piece from Cushing to the Gulf Coast is in place. The labor contracts have been signed. The construction contracts are close to being awarded. And so everything is just proceeding as we would expect. Now the link from Cushing to Port Arthur, which is the one we're interested in is going to be complete about the second quarter of 2012. Now that would bring a certain volume of the heavy sour Canadian into the market for us to be able to run it at Port Arthur in advance of the completion of the overall Keystone, which again would be the second quarter of '13."

However, Governor Schwarzenegger and the Mayor of L.A., they don't see any problems with what they think. But for those who don't know, AB32 is a concentrated, low-carbon fuel that reduces it back to 1990 levels. It’s a power where 1/3 has to be renewable. It is really an anti-fossil fuels law. It was only 13  pages, but it's more seem to have very large potential impact. If we fail to win Prop 23, the cost to the consumer in California is clearly going to go up. And I guess we'll get the opportunity down the road to say, ""We told you so."" And it will all be passed through to the consumer as the companies aren't going to able to absorb this or they're going to go out of business or it makes the playing field on level with imports. Valero has 1,600 employees in California because people ask me why are we involved. We employ on average about 900 contractors permanently. We've invested this year in California about $500 million. Our investment in California is $3.8 billion. We pay taxes. We pay property taxes of $27 million, sales and use taxes of $20-some million. So obviously, we are in California as a good neighbor, and some of the rhetoric is extremely disappointing. The opposition has been able to characterize this issue as Texas oil companies. We've been flattered as I'm sure Tesoro is that we're now a big oil. We thought we're independent. This is about George really are dirty companies and dirty polluters, yet this is about CO2. It's not about other stuff, it's CO2. We talked about the green -- the opposition talks about the green industry, and I'll say to you what jobs? If this continues, the jobs are going to be in Nevada, Arizona and China. The building trades in Northern California have unemployment in the range of 30%. Those are real jobs for real people. I'm surprised no one really asked why the Silicon Valley and venture capitalists are throwing so much money at this. They have though been able to shift the debate away from the consumer impacts to the issues I just mentioned. People really don't understand that this is a CO2 regulation bill. It is the first law in the United States that's actually addressing this. But we'll see what happens when people vote on Tuesday.

I think if you look at least our 2009 data, 81% of our output is gasoline, diesel and jet. So we're fuel, and so we need people back to work. We need people driving their cars and trucks moving and people flying. So we see the economic recovery happening, it's just very slow. So we think our margins will be good next year. We think we'll have a better year than we've had this year. And this year, considering it's worked out reasonably well. So with that in mind, we believe that. Now on the hydrocrackers, if you look at the world, diesel fuel is growing at least 2x faster than gasoline's growing. It's already a 25 million barrel a day business in the world versus gasoline in the 22 million or 23 million barrels a day. We've mentioned that of the U.S. Gulf Coast, we believe we can export. And these hydrocrackers, well, let me add one other point, you can see that the distillate crack today is at least twice the gasoline crack. It may be almost 3x the gasoline crack in the Gulf Coast. So it's clearly advantageous to make our growth spec relatively distillate for diesel. That part said, we also believe, as Mike said in his speaker notes, that natural gas prices are going to stay low for the foreseeable future. And in a hydrocracker, you convert a natural gas to hydrogen and you put the hydrogen in a hydrocracker, we get a liquid volume gain of about 30%, 25% to 30%. So in a way, it's a gas-to-liquids operation. So we see these projects as good value-added projects for our shareholder. We already are basically halfway into them. All the equipment sitting at the site. So we think it is on our shareholders' interest to finish these. So between the economy getting better, selling fuel, diesel, thinking natural gas, we think they're the kind of projects that we think we were right on.

And even though corn prices are up, they're up to about $5.60 a bushel, ethanol prices, they've been even faster. It's been good demand. Ethanol is now selling above gasoline by about $0.35 a gallon. So with the $0.45 blender's credit, it's still possible to win by about $0.10 a gallon. So we're seeing our margins do quite well. The demand is up. And as far as the E15, I don't think that's going to have any short-term impact at all because the warranty situation, and that fact it’s only good for 2007, newer cars, it's kind of a problem. Retail has offered multiple grades. So I think E10 is going to be the predominant fuel over the near term. As far as the import tariff, $0.64 a gallon, I think it's irrelevant. We're seeing no imports today. Brazilian ethanol is actually more expensive than U.S. ethanol even without the import tariff, so it's kind of a nonfactor. If anything we're seeing, this export of ethanol, mainly into Canada, some into Europe because the U.S. is really the lowest ethanol prices around. So all in all, I think the business is doing good just on economics alone. The subsidy is not really a factor today, so there is blending economic, and the tariff is not a factor because of Brazilian ethanol being more expensive than U.S."

Yes, potentially, it could come here. But I don't see that happening over the near-term. Their demand keeps going up faster than their supply to us. So I don't see that changing over the near to intermediate term, long term. As far as the subsidy, most of this year, yes, ethanol is actually cheaper than gasoline. So the subsidy is really not a factor today. It allows the blender to capture some of the tax that ethanol is selling above gasoline. It goes back and forth. So I think the fact that mandate is actually higher so the ethanol plants will have to run and have to have margins to run. It always emphasize the fact that our plants, given the corn bill, we don't have drilling cost to get the corn bill market. We actually buy our corn, our actual corn caps right now is about $30.50 per bushel under the seedbox, which gives us about $0.11 under the seedbox right there. And if you look at some of these destination plants, they have to actually rail the seed from Chicago area or the Midwest to destinations. They're paying above the boxes. I feel like we have at least $0.20 a gallon margin advantage over the ethanol plant. So I think that we've got a very low cost bases in our plants.
