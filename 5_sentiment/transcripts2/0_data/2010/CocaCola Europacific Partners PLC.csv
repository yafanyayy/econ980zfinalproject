We welcome the opportunity to discuss with you our results for 2009 and our outlook for 2010 as we work to build on last year's significant progress.We began 2009 in a ver",1415,"Thank you, Thor, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us. We welcome the opportunity to discuss with you our results for 2009 and our outlook for 2010 as we work to build on last year's significant progress.We began 2009 in a very difficult economic environment. Guided by our global operating framework, we work to strengthen profitability as we responded to the ongoing challenges in the marketplace.  That work truly succeeded, as we exceeded our growth expectations and achieved outstanding results for the year. We accomplished this by building on a combination of solid marketplace initiatives, strong execution and improved operating effectiveness. Most importantly, our success reflects the outstanding work of our employees and our leadership team to maximize our results in the face of very difficult operating conditions.Our people have demonstrated a consistent, dedicated drive to make our company better through outstanding day-to-day marketplace execution, solid cost control and the industry's best service to our customers. This combination of skill and will to win made possible the excellent results we are reporting today.As you read in our news release this morning, we achieved comparable earnings per diluted share of $1.60 and comparable net income of $788 million. These earnings, up more than 20% from a year ago, are the highest in our history, and demonstrate significant profit improvement in North America and a third consecutive year of strong balanced growth in Europe. Our profitability growth exceeds our long-term targets, and enhances our ability to deliver on our most important objective, increasing value for our share owners.There were several key factors in these outstanding results. For example, we successfully executed key marketplace programs across our territories, with a combination of solid execution and revenue management. This created our first year of consolidated margin expansion since 2003, reversing consistent gross profit margin declines. Long term, we remain committed to protecting or enhancing margins.In North America, we also improved the effectiveness of our operations through efforts, such as Coca-Cola Supply, which was created to maximize the total effectiveness of the Coca-Cola system and to enhance supply chain synergy. Our Selling and Merchandising Optimization program or SMO is a key element of our work to strengthen our go-to-market model by lowering inventory, reducing out-of-stocks and aligning sales and supply chain activities to meet customer goals. For the full year in North America, net pricing per case grew 6.5% while volume declined 5%. Full year cost of sales per case increased 4%. Fourth quarter volume declined 3%, while net pricing per case declined 0.5%. These declines are due primarily to the mix impact of slower sales of still beverages and single-serve packages. Bill will discuss these specific results with you in just a minute.Before I close our discussion of North America, I want to make it clear that we fully understand the long-term importance of restoring volume growth. Over time, we remain confident that we can generate an effective balance of volume and pricing growth in North America. This will require a combination of the brand development, world-class customer service and even higher levels of marketplace execution. In conjunction with The Coca-Cola Company, we believe there are important opportunities ahead, and we're both committed to restoring this operating balance to North America.Turning to Europe, our success reflects strong results for each of our core ""Red, Black, and Silver” brands, with combined growth of more than 7%. Coca-Cola Zero grew more than 15%. We also had growth of approximately 70% in energy with the addition of Monster and the continued development of Burn, Netloop [ph] and Relentless. In water, the addition of Schweppes Abbey Well in Great Britain and solid growth for Chaudfontaine created overall growth of more than 15%.These successful brands helped drive full year volume growth up 5.5% in Europe. Comparable net pricing per case grew 4%. This is an outstanding balance of volume and pricing growth. Overall, we're confident that we have the brand and operating plans in place to capture the full value of the substantial marketplace opportunities ahead.Now as we look to the remainder of 2010, we continue to believe we will achieve profits in line with our long-term growth targets. In our release today, we affirm our currency neutral guidance of mid to high single-digit growth in operating income with a high single-digit increase in earnings per diluted share. Given the economic challenges of our operating environment, reaching these earnings levels will require the continued success of key operating initiatives. We will drive even greater effectiveness, building on efforts such as Coca-Cola supply and optimization programs for finance and human resources. Our ownership cost management initiative will also continue to deliver cost savings throughout the company. In addition, we must continue to develop our brand and product portfolio and achieve ongoing success in marketplace actions that enable us to more fully capture the value of our brands.For example, in North America, we will complete the rollout of the two-liter contour package, execute a variety of can and PET configurations, including sleek mini cans, and continue to strengthen our revenue management capabilities. We will also double the number of Boost Zones, which drive incremental value and profit. In Europe, we will continue to improve our price package architecture to target specific customer and consumer needs. This will enhance inventory management, reduce out-of-stocks and drive better proportional productivity. We will also continue to improve our brand portfolio, building on the success of our “Red, Black, and Silver” initiative, and continuing to expand our presence in energy. In addition, we'll continue to develop our still beverage offerings, in part, by expanding distribution of Capri-Sun and Ocean Spray. Europe, which of course created the Boost Zone concept several years ago, will continue to add zones in 2010 with more than 70 additional zones planned this year.We'll also continue to link our corporate responsibility and sustainability or CRS efforts to our business performance. Across our territories, we are embedding CRS in every function of our business and holding ourselves to a clear, sound standard of success. This is our Commitment 2020, which outlines specific sustainability targets, including a 15% reduction of our carbon footprint, water neutrality and recovering and recycling the equivalent of 100% of the packaging we place in the market. Going forward, we'll continue to make CRS an integral element of everyday business decisions. Now as we look longer term, we have been reaching our financial targets on a consistent basis is essential to continue driving improved share-owner value. As you know, we made significant progress in 2009. We ended the year with a strongest balance sheet in our history with lower debt and strong free cash flow.Based on this success, we announced plans in 2009 to rebalance the use of our free cash flow toward increasing returns to share owners. Our plans include the repurchase of up to $600 million of shares by the end of this year. In addition, we expect to continue to implement the type of consistent dividend increases that have allowed us to double our dividend per share over the past three years.Our ability to reach the goal of increasing share-owner value is strengthened by our relationship with The Coca-Cola Company. More and more, we share a similar approach to the market through operations and customer service. We will continue our joint efforts to strategically align our system. One example is the incidence pricing model that we and The Coca-Cola Company implemented for North America in 2009. This model demonstrates our combined commitment to win in the marketplace, and it improves the alignment between our linked North American marketplace interests. We are pleased with its success, and have mutually agreed to continue an incidence model in 2010.This model is but one factor behind our confidence in our 2010 outlook. We believe we can achieve results in line with our long-term growth objectives through our operating plans, our brands and, most importantly, the talent and drive of our employees. We have a great team that proved in 2009 that they can deliver impressive results, despite the demands of a changing industry and volatile economic conditions.The strengths of our people, coupled with the greatest beverage brands and products in the world and sound operating principles, leaves us optimistic about our future. Even as we face current challenges, we see significant opportunities for growth and for enhanced share-owner value. Thanks again for joining us today. And now I'll turn the call over to Bill for a review of our financial results."

I'm pleased to provide more detail on our full year 2009 results and our outlook for 2010. 2009 was a year highlighted by record profitability and very strong free cash flow. As you read this morning, on a comparable basis, fourth quarter",913,"Thank you, John. I'm pleased to provide more detail on our full year 2009 results and our outlook for 2010. 2009 was a year highlighted by record profitability and very strong free cash flow. As you read this morning, on a comparable basis, fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.22 while full year diluted EPS was $1.60. Revenue for the year grew 3%, excluding the negative currency impact.For the full year, comparable net income was $788 million with a negative currency impact of approximately $0.15 per share. Fourth quarter results include the negative impact of four fewer selling days, offset by currency benefits of approximately $0.01 per share for the quarter. Let me add one quick note on the fourth quarter in North America. As John mentioned, net revenue per case declined one half of 1% for the quarter. This decline was driven primarily by the mix impact of reduced sales of higher priced still drinks and single-serve beverages. In addition, the 5% decline in cost of goods sold per case was driven primarily by year-over-year declines in commodity cost, though there was some mix impact.The mix impact includes a relative decrease in the sale of purchased finished goods and an increase in the mix of lower-priced cans. Looking at commodity cost for 2010, we would expect cost versus '09 to be flat to down slightly.Now looking again at our positive 2009 results, we also achieved strong full year free cash flow of $872 million. This number includes incremental pitch in contributions during the year of approximately $300 million. The primary factors in achieving this level of free cash flow include solid operating income improvement, as well as benefits from working capital.During 2009, we continued to use free cash flow, primarily for debt reduction. As a result, net debt at the end of the year totaled $7.7 billion, our lowest debt balance in more than 13 years. With a cash position of just over $1 billion, we begin 2010 with our strongest balance sheet ever. As you know, in December, we announced a change in our approach to the use of our free cash flow going forward. While in past years, we have put focused on debt reduction, we are now well positioned to diversify our use of cash, and begin returning additional funds to share owners. In fact, we expect that current cash on hand, coupled with the expected free cash flow over the next three years, will provide more than $3 billion in available cash for a combination of share repurchase, debt reduction, increased dividends as well as potential acquisitions.As we also announced in December, we intend to repurchase up to 600 million of our common stock by the end of 2010. Repurchased shares will be added to treasury stock, and made available for general corporate purposes, including acquisition financing and the funding of various employee benefit and compensation plans. These share repurchase plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating and other factors including acquisition opportunities. We will update you on our progress of our share repurchase plan during our first quarter earnings call in April.In addition to share repurchase, we also expect to continue to consistently increase our dividends annually. So despite the challenges created by continued macroeconomic weakness, our results in 2009 were strong. The key elements of these results were solid margin expansion, driven by the success of marketplace initiatives in both Europe and North America, much improved effectiveness. Perhaps most importantly, our employees continue to perform at very high levels, with an unyielding customer focus and intense dedication towards improving our company each and every day.As we announced this morning, we have affirmed our prior year guidance for 2010. We continue to expect EPS growth in a high single-digit range, excluding currency impact. We expect this growth to be somewhat weighted to the back half of the year. At current exchange rates, currency would have a negligible impact on EPS for the full year. This does represent a change in our view from December, when at that time, we expected $0.04 of favorability based on current FX rates at that point. We continue to expect operating income to increase at a mid to high single-digit range, with mid single-digit operating income growth from North America and Europe. Total revenue should increase at a low single-digit rate with mid single-digit growth in Europe and essentially flat revenue growth in North America.We continue to expect strong free cash flow of approximately $800 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion. Interest expense will decline modestly, and the effective tax rate for 2010 is estimated to be approximately 26%.We are confident in our outlook for the year, though we remain cautious about the ongoing impact of weak economic conditions. Key channels, particularly the on-premise channel, continue to be soft. While these factors are integrated in our current guidance, additional deterioration in economic trends could impact full year results. Long term, we remain committed to achieving our growth objectives of 4% to 5% revenue growth, 5% to 6% operating income growth and high single-digit earnings per share growth.In closing, we remain focused on the value drivers designed to protect margins, manage volume and value growth, improve free cash flow, deliver on our long-term objectives and, most importantly, continue driving share-owner value. That wraps up our prepared remarks. Again, like to thank you for joining us today. And now, we will be happy to open the line up for questions."

The biggest issue we face is some channel shifting, on-premise continues to be very, very difficult. But in the fourth quarter, we saw some mitigation of the overall trends in future consumption, where if you look at our ""Red, Black and Silver"" performance in the fourth quarter, it was actually flat. So all that being said, we would say 2% to 3% pricing growth in North America, and striving to flattish performance in terms of volume."

But Europe is pretty much covered for the majority of their commodity exposures excluding PET for 2010. And North America is 50-plus percent covered.

But as we continue that program into 2010, once it's stable and going forward, I would answer absolutely yes, as we take pricing in the market, the concentrate we track that pretty closely."

In terms of your question about what we can do to mitigate some of the economic trends that we see out there that continued for the next four to six months, which by the way we are forecasting that they will continue and are prepared for that. As John mentioned in the opening, we're doubling the number of Boost Zones that we have in North America from roughly 50 to more than 100 right now. They've proven to be very, very successful and they help us sell our higher margin immediate consumption brands. So that's working very well for us. The Fountain Harmony program that we're working together with The Coca-Cola Company is right on track and that's delivering results. And again, on this important on premise immediate consumption channel. And then overall, the things we're doing to help fuel our growth through The Coca-Cola supply, through the incident pricing model, which Bill mentioned. And all of the incremental price package architecture program that started in 2009 and continue in 2010 gives us reason to be further -- to be more optimistic, especially things like two-liter contour as we take that throughout the rest of the country. It's proven to be a huge success for us. And the continuation of entry-level pack at $0.99, which really speaks to consumer who have pressures on their indispensable income. So we think we've got the right programs in place at the right time, directed to consumers who are challenged. So we're ready for 2010, we're forecasting continued challenges but optimistic we'll overcome them."

In the first quarter we achieved comparable earnings per share of $0.2",1433,"Thank you Thor, and we thank each of you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2010 results and also review the progress of the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company. 
In the first quarter we achieved comparable earnings per share of $0.27, which is up $0.07 from our results for the first quarter a year ago. This includes a $0.01 per share currency benefit. Comparable consolidated operating income grew 9.5% though revenue declined just over 1%. Overall we’re encouraged by these results, which were achieved through continued solid growth in Europe and our ability to manage through difficult operating conditions in North America. In light of these results and our outlook for the remainder of our year, we’ve increased our full year guidance. We now expect comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of about 10%. Bill will provide more detail on this in a moment.
Now, let’s look at our territory results. In Europe, currency neutral operating income was up 9% through a combination of balanced volume and pricing growth. In addition, we continue to execute against initiatives that are driving both efficiency and effectiveness. Much like last year, our Red, Black and Silver Sparkling portfolio remains a key growth driver throughout our European territories, with volume up 3.5%. Brand Coca-Cola continues to generate a majority of this growth, even as we continue to develop Coca-Cola Zero as a key brand. 
We also achieved a strong 30% growth in Energy. In addition, we’re improving our still portfolio with the introduction of Ocean Spray juice drinks into both Great Britain and France, continued growth from Glacéau, and the introduction of Capri Sun in both Belgium and the Netherlands. 
Going forward this year we will focus on key areas of our business in Europe. First, we will fully realize the benefits of our World Cup opportunity, and in fact execution has already begun against this initiative. The World Cup is a tremendous marketing asset and we know that our execution plans for the event are exceptionally strong, with programs tailored to the needs of key customers and to specific markets. This creates significant store placement opportunities which we will seize with world class execution.
Second, we will continue to grow our Energy segment, which offers excellent opportunities through the addition of Monster, as well as the ongoing strength in Burn and Relentless. And third, we will execute our initiatives to drive increasing levels of effectiveness, both in terms of how we operate and how we interface with our customers. 
We’ll also benefit from initiatives that will continue to optimize key business functions. One example here is our cooler service initiative to improve operations, create savings and strengthen service. In addition, we also continue to transform our go to market models, building direct store delivery, quality service and availability into our system where it’s appropriate, and improving levels of customer service.
Now let’s turn to North America. Our first quarter results reflect a challenging quarter with difficult economic conditions, weak consumer spending trends, and severe weather that limited our overall performance. In the first quarter comparable operating income declined 2%, revenue declined about 5%. Revenue was negatively affected by pricing, mix and a decline in volume. Pricing reflects the mix impact of slower single serve sales, volume declines in higher price still drinks and increased multi serve volume, driven in part by the shift of Easter into the first quarter. In addition, pricing was affected by the challenge of hurdling 10% pricing growth in the quarter a year ago. This pricing level benefited in part from the overlap of selling both Rockstar and Monster as we transitioned away from Rockstar. Excluding these factors, the overall rate for sparkling drinks was up, although the increase was more modest than expected.
Despite this pricing softness, we achieved our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in North America. We remain dedicated to protecting margins and expanding them over time. As we’ve discussed, a key element of our operating strategy is to maximize the value of our brands through strong implementation of our price, package, architecture initiatives which are creating important benefits. For example, we continue to achieve positive results with our two liter contour bottle, which is rolling out nationwide, and then with small bottle PET initiatives in immediate consumption channels. 
Going forward, North America will benefit from several key programs. In stills for example we’ve added vitaminwater Zero and we will re-introduce Dasani Flavored Waters in on premise channels, and we’ll implement important promotions supporting Fuze. We expect packaging initiatives to accelerate our performance in sparkling drinks as we launch new can configurations and realize the benefits of our two liter contour conversion.
In addition, we continue to benefit from the overall strength of our Red, Black and Silver portfolio, which achieved flat volume during the quarter, driven by Coca-Cola Zero which grew by more than 12%, which was importantly a 16th consecutive quarter of double digit growth for that brand. A key element of our North American strategy remains strong execution, both on the field and in our day to day operations.
In future consumption, cases on display increased and we continue to attain excellent field level support for our cold drink packaging initiatives. We also continue to achieve excellent results through ownership cost management, which provided important operating expense favorability during the quarter.
So in summary, though we face a challenging consumer spending environment in North America, we are encouraged by the steady sequential operating improvement that we achieved through the quarter. Coupled with the operating and marketplace strategies we have in place, this improvement gives us confidence in our full year outlook and we remain on track to achieve our North American operating income targets and objectives.
So as we move forward in 2010 we remain focused on the key elements of our business, which will drive long-term success. That is building brand value, driving improved operating efficiency and effectiveness, strengthening customer service and providing our employees with the tools they need to succeed. Our success this year and beyond continues to depend on our ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions while driving ongoing operating improvement. We accomplished this in the first quarter and as a result we are in an excellent position to deliver our full year objectives, building on the outstanding profitability that we achieved last year. Our work toward being the best beverage, sales and customer service company both in North America and Europe is not finished, but we have an outstanding team of employees at every level of this company that will continue to drive improved performance and execute our plan for 2010.
Before I close I’d like to give you a brief update on the status of our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company. It has been two months since our announcement and to date our work to complete this transaction is on track. In North America, Muhtar Kent announced last week his intention to name Steve Cahillane as President and Chief Executive Officer of the new North American entity called Coca-Cola Refreshments. Steve is truly an outstanding choice, and we’re very excited that he will lead CCR going forward. We’re confident that his tremendous skills and dedication will make a very positive impact on the future of Coca-Cola in North America.
At CCE, we’re preparing for changes created by this transaction in Europe. We have teams working with the Coca-Cola Company to enable the integration of operations in both Norway and Sweden. In fact, earlier this month we met with employees in both of those territories and received a very positive and warm response. Overall, we are on schedule and employees are embracing this change. 
And then finally, within our corporate headquarters we have dedicated teams in place and we’ve just announced the intended appointments for the next level of our management team for new CCE. Throughout our company our employees are working exceptionally hard to deliver our plans for the year, demonstrating both their professionalism and commitment every day. They look forward to providing the highest levels of customer service in support of the world’s best brands, and ultimately winning in the marketplace. We are fortunate to have such a talented and dedicated group. 
This transaction is a positive step for our shareholders, our customers and our employees and we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months ahead.
Thanks again for your time and attention. Now I’ll turn it over to Bill to give a bit more detail on our financial results and our outlook for 2010.

In the first quarter, we achieved reported earnings per share of $0.21. After adjusting for items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $0.27. These items include $0.01 for restructuring, $0.02 for costs related to our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, $0.01 for net tax items and $0.02 for legal settlements. Currency was favorable and added $0.01 to the comparable results for the quarter.
In the first quarter, total revenues declined 1.5%, primarily due to earlier year softness in North America as conditions in key channels, particularly the on premise channel, remained difficult. However, we have seen some signs of renewed economic and consumer activity in North America as John earlier mentioned.
We also saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. This performance, combined with our positive results and outlook in Europe, and expected year-over-year reductions in corporate expenses, enables us to increase our 2010 EPS growth guidance to approximately 10%. This revised number includes operating income growth in a high single digit range and low single digit growth in revenue. 
Please note that our improved full year guidance also takes into account an increase in diluted shares outstanding. As previously announced, we have halted our planned share repurchase due to the transaction. This combined with recent market prices has resulted in fully diluted shares outstanding increasing approximately 3% to 504 million shares. This may continue to trend upward for the remainder of the year.
Currency, based on recent rates, would have a negative EPS impact of approximately $0.03 per common share for the rest of the year, equating to a net $0.02 negative impact for the full year. 
We have also raised our full year free cash flow guidance to more than $850 million. For the full year we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, while interest expense is expected to decline. The effective tax rate for 2010 will be approximately 26%. Additionally, we expect transaction costs to total approximately $100 million. This garnets its structure from the current makeup of CCE. As John mentioned, we expect to close our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company in the fourth quarter of this year, and later on this year we will provide new guidance that will reflect CCE after the close of the transaction. We do not plan to provide specific details for either Norway or Sweden, though we understand these markets are on track to achieve their respective full year objectives.
Now as John discussed, we have made good progress towards finalizing the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company and remain on track for a Q4 close. There are several key steps that remain, including receiving various regulatory approvals as well as shareowner approval. Given the nature of these steps, we cannot provide a specific timeline as to how the deal would progress, but again overall we are on track with our plans and importantly, expect to file our S-4 by the end of May.
Looking at the capital structure, net debt for new CCE at close will fluctuate based on currency, cash from operations and other factors, but currently we expect net debt at closing to be in a range of $2 to $2.5 billion. After closing, new CCE expects to return cash to shareowners via a planned share repurchase program of approximately $1 billion over the 18 months after close. We also anticipate establishing an initial annual dividend of $0.50 per share. 
So to review, we are making excellent progress in moving toward a fourth quarter closing for the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, and in addition we are on pace to deliver our full year results and achieve the increased objectives we set for the company for 2010. Our first quarter results demonstrate a solid step forward towards achieving our goals, and we remain confident in our ability to reach our full year objectives.
Thank you very much for joining us, and now Steve, John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions.

And it’s been a collective result, which we’ve been very pleased with. I think as we look to the balance of 2010 we are again optimistic about the growth profile that we see ahead of us, and frankly even beyond 2010. We think Western Europe is a market that’s got significant potential. The upper capitas are, per capita consumption numbers for Coca-Cola brands are modest when you compare them to global standards, and we think it looks encouraging.
Hubert, would you like to add some perspective to that?

In the overall result of 2% down for the quarter is clearly not where we want to be, but I think John did some important context setting that I’ll elaborate on. We did have the Easter shift into Q1 this year, which obviously drives more multi packs but also drives more promotional activity. We did see a mix away from higher priced single serve driven by the continued challenges in the economy. Importantly, we’re starting to see some sequential improvement in that. Our on premise business has shown some very favorable signs and our overall IC business has shown lately some very positive signs, so you know we are cautiously optimistic that the margin mix pressure we’re seeing there is improving. Rockstar was in our results for Q1 of ’09 and not for Q1 of ‘010 obviously, so that has an effect. And obviously we’re lapping a 10% increase that we had last year. And if you remove all those items, adjust for all those items, sparkling was actually slightly positive although below our expectations.
I think it’s also important to note that based on Nielsen data for the first quarter of 2010, we experienced less retail price decline than our closest competitor did. Having said all that, we remain cautiously optimistic that a more rational pricing environment will rule the day for the balance of 2010. That’s clearly the way that we are trying to drive our own business going forward. That along with the improving trends as I said in IC, and all the activities that we put in place for the course of last year in terms of boost zones, new packages in 14 and 16 ounce, if we see some improvement in the economy that we’ve seen the last couple of weeks, if that continues to improve, I think we’re well set to continue to drive a more positive price mix equation for the balance of the year.

We had some early supply chain problems, but vitaminwater Zero is exceeding our expectations from a consumer standpoint perspective and helping us drive our overall still business. Our Smartwater brand continues to grow at double digit rates and those are important parts of our still mix. We’re seeing some improvement in flatwater as well, as we get our price package architecture in a place where we want it to be.

I agree with everything he just said, but I think it’s important for us to keep in mind as we think about our European business that packaging mix is not nearly as important as it is in some parts of the world. And the difference between future consumption and immediate consumption is fairly modest, frankly. So that’s one of the reasons the economy and the shift from IC to future consumption has not been as profound from a profit standpoint in Europe as it is in some other places in the world. So I think it’s really important to keep that in mind.

And we thank each of you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2010 results and also review the progress of the transaction with the Coca-Cola  Company.In the first quarter, we achieved comparable earnings per share of",1417,"Thank you, Thor. And we thank each of you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2010 results and also review the progress of the transaction with the Coca-Cola  
Company.
In the first quarter, we achieved comparable earnings per share of $0.27, which is up $0.07 from our results for the first quarter a year ago. This includes a $0.01 per share  
currency benefit. Comparable consolidated operating income grew 9.5%, though revenue declined just over 1%.
Overall, we are encouraged by these results, which are achieved through a continued solid growth in Europe and our ability to manage through difficult operating conditions in  
North America.
In light of these results, and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full-year guidance. We now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share  
growth of about 10%. Bill will provide more detail on this in a moment.
Now, let's look at our territory results. In Europe, currency-neutral operating income was up 9% through a combination of balanced volume and pricing growth. In addition, we  
continue to execute against  initiatives that are driving both efficiency and effectiveness.
Much like last year, our ""Red, Black and Silver"" sparkling portfolio remains a key growth driver throughout our European territories, with volume up 3.5%. Brand Coca-Cola  
continues to generate a majority of this growth, even as we continue to develop Coca-Cola Zero as a key brand.  We also achieved a strong 30% growth in Energy.
In addition, we're improving our still portfolio with the introduction of Ocean Spray juice drinks into both Great Britain and France, continued growth from Glaceau and the  
introduction of Capri-Sun in both Belgium and the Netherlands. Going forward this year, we will focus on key areas of our business in Europe. First, we will fully realize the  
benefits of our World Cup opportunity and in fact, execution has already begun against this initiative.
The World Cup is a tremendous marketing asset, and we know that our execution plans for the event are exceptionally strong with programs tailored to the needs of key customers  
and to specific markets. This creates significant store placement opportunities which we will seize with world-class execution.
Second, we'll continue to grow our energy segment, which offers excellent opportunities through the addition of Monster, as well as the ongoing strength in Burn and Relentless.  
And third, we will execute our initiatives to drive increasing levels of effectiveness, both in terms of how we operate and how we interface with our customers. 
We'll also benefit from initiatives that will continue to optimize key business functions. One example here is our cooler service initiative to improve operations, create  
savings and strengthen service.
In addition, we also continue to transform our go-to-market models, building direct store delivery quality service and availability into our system where it's appropriate and  
improving levels of customer service.
Now let's turn to North America. Our first quarter results reflect a challenging quarter with difficult economic conditions, weak consumer spending trends and severe weather  
that limited our overall performance.
In the first quarter, comparable operating income declined 2%, revenue declined about 5%. Revenue was negatively affected by pricing, mix and a decline in volume. Pricing  
reflects the mixed impact of slower single-serve sales, volume declines in higher-priced still drinks and increased multi-serve volume, driven in part by the shift of Easter  
into the first quarter.
In addition, pricing was affected by the challenge of hurdling 10% pricing growth in the quarter a year ago. This pricing level benefited in part from the overlap of selling  
both Rockstar and Monster as we transitioned away from Rockstar. Excluding these factors, the overall rate for sparkling drinks was up, although the increase was more modest  
than expected.
Despite this pricing softness, we achieved our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in North America. We remain dedicated to protecting margins and expanding them over  
time. As we've discussed, a key element of our operating strategy is to maximize the value of our brands through strong implementation of our price package architecture  
initiatives, which are creating important benefits. For example, we continue to achieve positive results with our 2-liter contour bottle, which is rolling out nationwide, and  
then with small model PET initiatives in the media consumption channels.
Going forward, North America will benefit from several key programs. In stills, for example, we've added vitaminwater Zero and we will reintroduce DASANI flavored waters in  
on-premise channels and we'll implement important promotion supporting FUZE. 
We expect packaging initiatives to accelerate our performance in sparkling drinks as we launch new can configurations and realize the benefits of our 2-liter contour conversion.
In addition, we continue to benefit from the overall strength of our ""Red, Black and Silver"" portfolio, which achieved flat volume during the quarter, driven by Coca-Cola Zero  
which grew more than 12%, which was importantly a 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for that brand.
The key element of our North American strategy remains strong in execution, both in the field and in our day-to-day operations. In future consumption, cases on display  
increased, and we continue to attain excellent fuel level support for our cold drink packaging initiatives. We also continue to achieve excellent results through Ownership Cost  
Management, which provided important operating expense favorability during the quarter.
So in summary, though we faced a challenging consumer spending environment in North America, we're encouraged by the steady, sequential operating improvement that we achieved  
through the quarter. Coupled with the operating and market place strategies we have in place, this improvement gives us confidence in our full-year outlook and we remain on  
track to achieve our North American operating income targets and objectives.
So as we move forward in 2010, we remain focused on the key elements of our business which will drive long-term success, that is building brand value, driving improved operating  
efficiency and effectiveness, strengthening customer service and providing our employees with the tools they need to succeed. Our success this year and beyond continues to  
depend on our ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions, while driving ongoing operating improvement. We accomplished this in the first quarter  
and as a result, we are in excellent position to deliver our full-year objectives, building on the outstanding profitability that we achieved last year. 
Our work toward being the best beverage sales and customer service company both in North America and Europe is not finished. But we have an outstanding team of employees at  
every level of this company that will continue to drive improved performance and execute our plan for 2010.
Before I close, I'd like to give you a brief update on the status of our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company. It has been two months since our announcement and to date our  
work to complete this transaction is on track.
In North America, Muhtar Kent announced last week his intention to name Steve Cahillane as President and Chief Executive Officer of the new North American entity called  
Coca-Cola Refreshments. Steve is truly an outstanding choice and we're excited, very excited, that he will lead CCR going forward. We're confident that his tremendous skills and  
dedication will make a very positive impact on the future of Coca-Cola in North America.
At CCE, we're preparing for changes created by this transaction in Europe. We have teams working with the Coca-Cola Company to enable the integration of operations in both  
Norway and Sweden. In fact, earlier this month, we met with employees in both of those territories and received a very positive and warm response. Overall, we are on schedule  
and employees are embracing this change. And then finally, within our corporate headquarters, we have dedicated teams in place and we have just announced the intended  
appointments for the next level of our management team for new CCE.
Throughout our company our employees are working exceptionally hard to deliver our plans for the year, demonstrating both their professionalism and commitment everyday. They  
look forward to providing the highest levels of customer service in support of the world's best brand and ultimately winning in the marketplace. We are fortunate to have such a  
talented and dedicated group. This transaction is a positive step for our shareholders, our customers and our employees, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you in  
the months ahead. 
Thanks again for your time and attention. Now I'll turn it over to Bill to give a bit more detail on our financial results and our outlook for 2010."
109130811,100364521,57919,"Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC","Executives","Thank you, John, and we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us today.  I'm actually in Paris joining Hubert in the call today. In the first quarter, we achieved reported earnings per share of $0.21. After adjusting for items affecting comp",681,"Thank you, John, and we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us today.  I'm actually in Paris joining Hubert in the call today. 
In the first quarter, we achieved reported earnings per share of $0.21. After adjusting for items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $0.27. These items include  
$0.01 for restructuring, $0.02 for costs related to our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, $0.01 for net tax items and $0.02 for legal settlements. Currency was favorable  
and added $0.01 to the comparable results for the quarter.
In the first quarter, total revenues declined 1.5%, primarily due to earlier year softness in North America, as conditions in key channels, particularly the on-premise channel,  
remained difficult. However, we have seen some signs of renewed economic and consumer activity in North America as John earlier mentioned.
We also saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. This performance, combined with our positive results and outlook in Europe and expected year-over-year reductions in  
corporate expenses, enables us to increase our 2010 EPS growth guidance to approximately 10%. This revised number includes operating income growth in a high single-digit range  
and low single-digit growth in revenue.
Please note that our improved full-year guidance also takes into account an increase in diluted shares outstanding. As previously announced, we have halted our planned share  
repurchase due to the transaction. This combined with recent market prices has resulted in fully diluted shares outstanding, increasing approximately 3% to 504 million shares.  
This may continue to trend upward through the remainder of the year.
Currency based on recent rates would have a negative EPS impact of approximately $0.03 per common share for the rest of the year, equating to a net $0.02 negative impact for the  
full year. We have also raised our full-year free cash flow guidance to more than $850 million. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1  
billion, while interest expense is expected to decline. The effective tax rate for 2010 will be approximately 26%.
Additionally, we expect transaction cost to total approximately $100 million. This guidance is structured for the current makeup of CCE. As John mentioned, we expect to close  
our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company in the fourth quarter this year and later on this year, we will provide new guidance that will reflect CCE after the close of the  
transaction.
We do not plan to provide specific details for either Norway or Sweden, but we understand these markets are on track to achieve their respective full-year objectives.
Now as John discussed, we have made good progress towards finalizing the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company and remain on track for a Q4 close. There are several key steps  
that remain, including receiving various regulatory approvals, as well as share owner approval.  Given the nature of these steps, we cannot provide a specific timeline as to how  
the deal will progress. But again, overall, we are on track with our plans and, importantly, expect to file our S-4 by the end of May.
Looking at the capital structure, net debt for new CCE at close will fluctuate based on currency, cash from operation and other factors. But currently, we expect net debt at  
closing to be in a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. After closing, new CCE expects to return cash to share owners via a planned share repurchase program of approximately $1  
billion over the 18 months after close.  We also anticipate establishing an initial annual dividend of $0.50 per share. 
To review, we are making excellent progress in moving toward a fourth quarter closing for the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company. And in addition, we are on pace to deliver  
our full-year results and achieve the increase objectives we set for the company for 2010. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate a solid step forward towards achieving our goals, and we remain confident in our ability to reach our full-year objectives.
Thank you very much for joining us. And now Steve, John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions."

But I think John did some important context setting that I will elaborate on. We did have  
the Easter shift into Q1 this year, which obviously drives more multi-packs, but it also drives more promotional activity. We did see a mix away from higher-priced single serve  
driven by the continued challenges in the economy. Importantly, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in that. Our on-premise business has shown some very favorable  
signs and our overall IC business has shown lately some very positive signs. So we are cautiously optimistic that the margin mix pressure we're seeing there is improving.  
Rockstar was in our results for Q1 of '09 and not for Q1 of '10 obviously, so that has an effect. And obviously, we're lapping a 10% increase that we had last year. And if you  
remove all those items, adjust for all those items, sparkling was actually slightly positive, although below our expectations. I think it's also important to note that based on  
Neilsen data for the first quarter of 2010, we experienced less retail price decline than our closest competitor did. Having said all that, we remain cautiously optimistic that  
a more rational pricing environment will rule the day for the balance of 2010. That's clearly the way that we are trying to drive our own business going forward. That along with  
the improving trends as I said in IC, and all the activities that we put in place for the course of last year in terms of Boost Zones, new packages and 14-ounce and 16-ounce, if  
we see some improvement in the economy that we've seen in the last couple of weeks, if that continues to improve, I think we're well set to continue to drive a more positive

And we thank each of you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2010 results and also review the progress of the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company.In the first quarter, we achieved comparable earnings per share of $0.",1417,"Thank you, Thor. And we thank each of you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2010 results and also review the progress of the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company.
In the first quarter, we achieved comparable earnings per share of $0.27, which is up $0.07 from our results for the first quarter a year ago. This includes a $0.01 per share currency benefit. Comparable consolidated operating income grew 9.5%, though revenue declined just over 1%.
Overall, we are encouraged by these results, which are achieved through a continued solid growth in Europe and our ability to manage through difficult operating conditions in North America.
In light of these results, and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year guidance. We now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of about 10%. Bill will provide more detail on this in a moment.
Now let's look at our territory results. In Europe, currency-neutral operating income was up 9% through a combination of balanced volume and pricing growth. In addition, we continue to execute against  initiatives that are driving both efficiency and effectiveness.
Much like last year, our Red, Black and Silver sparkling portfolio remains a key growth driver throughout our European territories, with volume up 3.5%. Brand Coca-Cola continues to generate a majority of this growth, even as we continue to develop Coca-Cola Zero as a key brand. We also achieved a strong 30% growth in Energy.
In addition, we're improving our Still portfolio with the introduction of Ocean Spray juice drinks into both Great Britain and France, continued growth from Glacéau and the introduction of Capri-Sun in both Belgium and the Netherlands. Going forward this year, we will focus on key areas of our business in Europe. First, we will fully realize the benefits of our World Cup opportunity. And in fact, execution has already begun against this initiative.
The World Cup is a tremendous marketing asset, and we know that our execution plans for the event are exceptionally strong with programs tailored to the needs of key customers and to specific markets. This creates significant store placement opportunities, which we will seize with world-class execution.
Second, we'll continue to grow our Energy segment, which offers excellent opportunities through the addition of Monster, as well as the ongoing strength in Burn and Relentless. And third, we will execute our initiatives to drive increasing levels of effectiveness, both in terms of how we operate and how we interface with our customers. 
We'll also benefit from initiatives that will continue to optimize key business functions. One example here is our cooler service initiative to improve operations, create savings and strengthen service.
In addition, we also continue to transform our go-to-market models, building direct store delivery quality service and availability into our system, where it's appropriate, and improving levels of customer service.
Now let's turn to North America. Our first quarter results reflect a challenging quarter with difficult economic conditions, weak consumer spending trends and severe weather that limited our overall performance. In the first quarter, comparable operating income declined 2%, revenue declined about 5%. Revenue was negatively affected by pricing, mix and a decline in volume. Pricing reflects the mixed impact of slower single-serve sales, volume declines in higher-priced still drinks and increased multi-serve volume, driven in part by the shift of Easter into the first quarter.
In addition, pricing was affected by the challenge of hurdling 10% pricing growth in the quarter a year ago. This pricing level benefited in part from the overlap of selling both Rockstar and Monster as we transitioned away from Rockstar. Excluding these factors, the overall rate for sparkling drinks was up, although the increase was more modest than expected.
Despite this pricing softness, we achieved our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in North America. We remain dedicated to protecting margins and expanding them over time. As we've discussed, a key element of our operating strategy is to maximize the value of our brands through strong implementation of our price/package architecture initiatives, which are creating important benefits. For example, we continue to achieve positive results with our 2-liter contour bottle, which is rolling out nationwide, and then with small bottle PET initiatives in immediate consumption channels.
Going forward, North America will benefit from several key programs. In stills, for example, we've added vitaminwater Zero, and we will reintroduce DASANI flavored waters in on-premise channels, and we'll implement important promotions supporting FUZE. We expect packaging initiatives to accelerate our performance in sparkling drinks, as we launch new can configurations and realize the benefits of our 2-liter contour conversion.
In addition, we continue to benefit from the overall strength of our Red, Black and Silver portfolio, which achieved flat volume during the quarter, driven by Coca-Cola Zero which grew more than 12%, which was importantly a 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for that brand.
The key element of our North American strategy remains strong in execution, both in the field and in our day-to-day operations. In future consumption, cases on display increased, and we continue to attain excellent field-level support for our cold drink packaging initiatives. We also continue to achieve excellent results through Ownership Cost Management, which provided important operating expense favorability during the quarter.
So in summary, though we faced a challenging consumer spending environment in North America, we're encouraged by the steady, sequential operating improvement that we achieved through the quarter. Coupled with the operating and marketplace strategies we have in place, this improvement gives us confidence in our full year outlook, and we remain on track to achieve our North American operating income targets and objectives.
So as we move forward in 2010, we remain focused on the key elements of our business, which will drive long-term success, that is building brand value, driving improved operating efficiency and effectiveness, strengthening customer service and providing our employees with the tools they need to succeed. Our success this year and beyond continues to depend on our ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions while driving ongoing operating improvement. We accomplished this in the first quarter. And as a result, we are in an excellent position to deliver our full year objectives, building on the outstanding profitability that we achieved last year. 
Our work toward being the best beverage sales and customer service company both in North America and Europe is not finished. But we have an outstanding team of employees at every level of this company that will continue to drive improved performance and execute our plan for 2010.
Before I close, I'd like to give you a brief update on the status of our transaction with The Coca-Cola Company. It has been two months since our announcement, and to date, our work to complete this transaction is on track.
In North America, Muhtar Kent announced last week his intention to name Steve Cahillane as President and Chief Executive Officer of the new North American entity called Coca-Cola Refreshments. Steve is truly an outstanding choice, and we're excited, very excited, that he will lead CCR going forward. We're confident that his tremendous skills and dedication will make a very positive impact on the future of Coca-Cola in North America.
At CCE, we're preparing for changes created by this transaction in Europe. We have teams working with The Coca-Cola Company to enable the integration of operations in both Norway and Sweden. In fact, earlier this month, we met with employees in both of those territories and received a very positive and warm response. Overall, we are on schedule, and employees are embracing this change. And then finally, within our corporate headquarters, we have dedicated teams in place, and we have just announced the intended appointments for the next level of our management team for new CCE.
Throughout our company, our employees are working exceptionally hard to deliver our plans for the year, demonstrating both their professionalism and commitment everyday. They look forward to providing the highest levels of customer service in support of the world's best brand and ultimately winning in the marketplace. We are fortunate to have such a talented and dedicated group. This transaction is a positive step for our shareholders, our customers and our employees, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months ahead. 
Thanks again for your time and attention. Now I'll turn it over to Bill to give a bit more detail on our financial results and our outlook for 2010."

I'm actually in Paris joining Hubert in the call today. In the first quarter, we achieved reported earnings per share of $0.21.

In the first quarter, we achieved reported earnings per share of $0.21. After adjusting for items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $0.27. These items include $0.01 for restructuring, $0.02 for costs related to our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, $0.01 for net tax items and $0.02 for legal settlements. Currency was favorable and added $0.01 to the comparable results for the quarter.
In the first quarter, total revenues declined 1.5%, primarily due to earlier year softness in North America, as conditions in key channels, particularly the on-premise channel, remained difficult. However, we have seen some signs of renewed economic and consumer activity in North America as John earlier mentioned.
We also saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. This performance, combined with our positive results and outlook in Europe and expected year-over-year reductions in corporate expenses, enables us to increase our 2010 EPS growth guidance to approximately 10%. This revised number includes operating income growth in a high single-digit range and low single-digit growth in revenue.
Please note that our improved full-year guidance also takes into account an increase in diluted shares outstanding. As previously announced, we have halted our planned share repurchase due to the transaction. This combined with recent market prices has resulted in fully diluted shares outstanding, increasing approximately 3% to 504 million shares. This may continue to trend upward through the remainder of the year.
Currency based on recent rates would have a negative EPS impact of approximately $0.03 per common share for the rest of the year, equating to a net $0.02 negative impact for the full year. We have also raised our full-year free cash flow guidance to more than $850 million. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, while interest expense is expected to decline. The effective tax rate for 2010 will be approximately 26%.
Additionally, we expect transaction cost to total approximately $100 million. This guidance is structured for the current makeup of CCE. As John mentioned, we expect to close our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company in the fourth quarter this year and later on this year, we will provide new guidance that will reflect CCE after the close of the transaction.
We do not plan to provide specific details for either Norway or Sweden, but we understand these markets are on track to achieve their respective full-year objectives.
Now as John discussed, we have made good progress towards finalizing the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company and remain on track for a Q4 close. There are several key steps that remain, including receiving various regulatory approvals, as well as share owner approval. Given the nature of these steps, we cannot provide a specific timeline as to how the deal will progress. But again, overall, we are on track with our plans and, importantly, expect to file our S-4 by the end of May.
Looking at the capital structure, net debt for new CCE at close will fluctuate based on currency, cash from operation and other factors. But currently, we expect net debt at closing to be in a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. After closing, new CCE expects to return cash to share owners via a planned share repurchase program of approximately $1 billion over the 18 months after close.  We also anticipate establishing an initial annual dividend of $0.50 per share. 
To review, we are making excellent progress in moving toward a fourth quarter closing for the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company. And in addition, we are on pace to deliver our full-year results and achieve the increase objectives we set for the company for 2010. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate a solid step forward towards achieving our goals, and we remain confident in our ability to reach our full-year objectives.
Thank you very much for joining us. And now Steve, John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions."

And it's been a collective result, which we've been very pleased with. I think as we look to the balance of 2010, we are again optimistic about the growth profile that we see ahead of us. And frankly, even beyond 2010. We think Western Europe is a market that's got significant potential. The per capita consumption numbers for Coca-Cola brands are modest when you compare them to global standards. And we think it looks encouraging.

But I think John did some important context setting that I will elaborate on. We did have the Easter shift into Q1 this year, which obviously drives more multi-packs, but it also drives more promotional activity. We did see a mix away from higher-priced single serve driven by the continued challenges in the economy. Importantly, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in that. Our on-premise business has shown some very favorable signs and our overall IC business has shown lately some very positive signs. So we are cautiously optimistic that the margin mix pressure we're seeing there is improving. Rockstar was in our results for Q1 of '09 and not for Q1 of '10 obviously, so that has an effect. And obviously, we're lapping a 10% increase that we had last year. And if you remove all those items, adjust for all those items, sparkling was actually slightly positive, although below our expectations. I think it's also important to note that based on Nielsen data for the first quarter of 2010, we experienced less retail price decline than our closest competitor did. Having said all that, we remain cautiously optimistic that a more rational pricing environment will rule the day for the balance of 2010. That's clearly the way that we are trying to drive our own business going forward. That along with the improving trends as I said in IC, and all the activities that we put in place for the course of last year in terms of Boost Zones, new packages and 14-ounce and 16-ounce, if we see some improvement in the economy that we've seen in the last couple of weeks, if that continues to improve, I think we're well set to continue to drive a more positive price mix equation for the balance of the year."

We're seeing some improvement in flatwater as well, as we get our price package architecture in a place where we want it to be. So you put all that in the mix and I'd say for 2010 I don't think we'll see a return to the type of growth rates we saw, and still there was the driver of our overall business because sparkling continues to perform very well, and I would see that continuing in the future. But I see the challenges around still that we faced last year mitigated some from the innovations we have in the marketplace, but also from an overall improving macro economy."

Last year, volume in the first quarter was up close to 13%, an increase which was driven by Iceland's promotional activity, furthermore, and for the Coca-Cola core brand and also the introduction of new products. We had last year at the same time the launch of Abbey Well water, the extension of Glacéau and the launch of Monster in GB. And again, this was compounded by unusually difficult winter weather in the first quarter of this year. Just to differentiate it, British retail estimate that they have lost something like GBP 601 billion [ph] due to weather in the first quarter.

As you know from our news release this morning, we achieved strong growth in the quarter with comparable earnings per share of $0.79 and net income of $405 million. Based on our results through the first half of the year and on our outlook for the remainder of 2010, we have raised our full year guidance. We now expect earnings per share in the range of $1.73 to $1.77, which includes a negative currency impact of about $0.06 and that excludes nonrecurring items.
We are pleased with this progress achieved as we continue to navigate a difficult economic and marketplace environment, and as we prepare for the close of the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company. This is a testament to the dedication and the ability of our teams in both North America and Europe, who continue to focus on delivering our full year objectives even as we work to transform the structure of our operations.
Our financial results for the second quarter include revenue growth of 1% and consolidated comparable operating income growth of 21%, both excluding the impact of currency. On a territory basis, Europe produced solid growth driven primarily by volume. Comparable revenues increased 5% excluding currency and volume was about 5.5%. We continue to achieve significant growth with our key Coca-Cola trademark brands including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, and Coca-Cola Zero. These brands grew a combined 3.5% including importantly 14% growth for Coke Zero. At the heart of this growth has been a combination of outstanding marketplace execution and excellent support of promotions for the World Cup, which captured Europe’s attention with three European teams in the final four.
In addition to volume growth, there were several factors at work in Europe’s operating results including a modest decline in cost of goods per case, the ongoing benefits of our effectiveness initiatives, operating savings created through our ownership cost management program, and beneficial weather conditions. We also benefited from a stronger marketplace presence in stills, which were up more than 15% during the quarter. This reflects the addition to our portfolio of Capri-Sun in Belgium and the Netherlands, and of Ocean Spray in France and Great Britain.
Overall continued success in Europe will demand increasing levels of executional excellence. We must continue to meet individual customer needs and work to improve customer service. Towards this goal, we are broadening our go-to-market model, as we find new ways to meet the needs of each customer and channel. For example, we are working with customers to tailor in-store execution to their unique needs, an approach that is vital to meet the requirements of a changing retail environment, and to be our customers’ most valued supplier.
Now, let us turn to North America, which achieved comparable operating profit growth of 21% with essentially flat revenue growth. This positive operating income growth is the result of a combination of modest volume growth, gross margin improvement driven by a decline in the cost of goods sold per case, and ongoing cost control and effectiveness efforts. Overall, operating conditions in North America do remain challenging, and though we have begun to see some slight improvement in overall economic activity, retailers remain challenged to increase activity in their stores.
In an effort to spur in-store consumer activity, early in the quarter some retailers adopted promotional price points on our products creating heightened demand with the concurrent negative mix impact. Throughout this period, we continued to focus on our price package architecture initiatives. And as a result, our overall sparkling pricing was positive offset by negative mix and we continued to see an overall rational pricing environment going forward.
As a result of these promotional efforts, volume per core brand such as Coca-Cola, Coke Zero, and Sprite grew during the quarter. In addition, POWERade grew more than 15% during the quarter and our Monster energy drinks grew more than 12%. Importantly, our single-serve segment achieved growth for the first time in more than three years. And furthermore in the on-premise channel, a challenge which is really important for single-serve beverages and includes outlets such as work and education, we began to see improving trends as we expand the number of outlets we serve.
Going forward, we will continue to work to strengthen core sparkling brands. We will build on the success of our boost zones, which are performing solidly, and we will work to continue to improve performance in key categories such as on-premise that have lagged through the recession. In addition, we will continue to drive operating savings through efficiency efforts such as ownership cost management, which is delivering impressive bottom line results as well as our successful work to reduce product losses in warehouses and production centres which in fact has reduced losses by more than 25%.
Despite these gains, the North American operating environment remains challenging. Much work remains to strengthen performance in key channels. As we prepare for the close of our transaction with the Coca-Cola Company we remain committed to our operating strategies, and to maximizing our performance as we manage through dynamic marketplace conditions.
Now, I would like to discuss our progress in finalizing the transaction. As you know, the Coca-Cola Company will purchase all of our North American business while CCE will retain our European business and acquire the Norway and Sweden territories. This will create a new CCE Company with revenue of over $7 billion and volume of about $600 million physical cases with 18 manufacturing sites and a workforce of about 13,000 people. Most importantly, the new CCE will have the size and scope to provide increased customer service and will be an even more effective competitor in attractive and growing European markets.
We will have an improved growth profile, financial flexibility and the operational focus to deliver attractive returns and to pursue growth opportunities. I can also tell you that our employees in Europe are very positive about this change and are embracing the future with excitement. There is a clear sense of pride as they look forward and this complements their outstanding skills and dedication. This is also demonstrated in their work to prepare for the integration of Norway and Sweden into our operations. We have made excellent progress towards this objective.
Now, overall the transaction remains on track to close in the fourth quarter. The transaction must have shareowner approval, and we expect to schedule a meeting of shareowners for this purpose soon. Going forward, we will continue to be guided by our global operating framework, which is providing clear strategic priorities and financial objectives for our people as we move through this transaction. The key elements of this vision, which are growing brand value, expanding our portfolio, transforming our go-to-market model with increasing effectiveness, and creating a winning culture for our employees will remain our foundation.
As we build a new CCE, our vision remains to be the best beverage sales and customer service company. Our focus on this vision will continue to help us drive improving value for our shareowners. As evidenced by the positive results of this quarter, our employees in all areas are focused on delivering outstanding results, maximizing value for customers, and providing the highest levels of service. The growth we have achieved in the quarter is a testament to their dedication and their skill. We are really fortunate to have such a talented and dedicated group.
Thank you again for joining us today, now I would like to turn the call over to Bill, who will give you more detail on our financial results as well as our full year outlook.

Today, we announced strong quarterly results with reported earnings of $0.69 per share in the second quarter. After adjusting for restructuring and transaction costs, comparable earnings per share were $0.79. These comparable results include a negative currency impact of approximately $0.03 per share for the quarter. On a currency neutral basis, second quarter revenues increased 1% and comparable operating income was up over 20%.
Our second quarter results were achieved through volume growth and margin expansion in both Europe and North America. In Europe, we achieved volume growth of 5.5% with modest pricing per case growth and a one-half percent decline in cost of goods sold per case. Pricing per case growth was impacted by promotional mix, including World Cup as well as prior year hurdles. Cost of goods per case benefitted from modest commodity declines.
North America had modest volume growth and continued to achieve solid margin improvement benefitting from a 3% cost of goods sold per case decline. Though pricing overall had a modest decline, sparkling pricing was up despite negative mix. We also continued to benefit from effectiveness initiatives that enabled us to achieve lower operating expenses, and from ownership cost management, which is driving important bottom line savings.
These results, coupled with our positive first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year have enabled us to increase our full year guidance with comparable earnings per share now expected in a range of $1.73 to $1.77 including an expected negative currency impact of approximately $0.06 per share for the full year at recent rates.
Looking at the full year outlook for our business units, on a comparable and currency neutral basis, we expect Europe to achieve high single-digit operating income growth with a mid single-digit increase in revenue. In North America we expect a mid single-digit increase in operating income, and a flat to low single-digit decline in revenue. We have also increased our 2010 expected free cash flow to approximately $900 million. Our outlook for capital expenditures remains at approximately $1 billion.
We continued to expect interest rates to decline for the year and our expected tax rate to be approximately 26%. This guidance is based on CCE’s current business structure. One note consistent with our first quarter earnings call, we do not plan to provide specific guidance for either Norway or Sweden though we do understand these markets are broadly on track to achieve their respective full year financial objectives.
Overall, we are encouraged by our positive results for the first six months, but we must continue to execute the remainder of the summer selling season and maintain our focus on the strategies that have allowed us to limit cost and excel in the marketplace as we face challenging economic conditions in both Europe and North America.
Now, as John discussed, we have made good progress towards the finalizing the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company and remain on track to close in the fourth quarter. We have received positive notification from the European Commission, we are still awaiting a ruling from the internal revenue service. We are still waiting United States and Canadian antitrust approval, and of course, ultimately the deal must be approved by shareowners. However, we are optimistic that these steps will occur on a timely basis in keeping with our goal of a fourth quarter close. Also of importance, we have made good progress in preparing for the integration of the Norway and Sweden businesses.
Turning to our capital structure, we continue to expect net debt at close to be in a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, though this could fluctuate based on currency, cash from operations, and other factors. Also we expect to have financing in place for new CCE by the end of the third quarter. After closing, new CCE expects to return cash to shareowners via a planned share repurchase program of approximately $1 billion over the following 18 months and establish an initial annual dividend of $0.50 per share. This is in addition to a one-time $10 per share cash distribution that will be paid to shareownes at closing.
So, to summarize, we are pleased with our progress in the first half and the success of our marketplace strategies and operating initiatives. This reflects the excellent efforts and dedication of our employees who have continued to focus on delivering strong results while we work to transform our business to the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company.
Again, thanks for joining us today and now John, Steve, Hubert and I will be happy to take your questions.

The brands, the Coca-Cola brands are stronger now than they have been in quite some time.
The advantage we have over our primary competitor is as wide as it has been for quite some time and the fact that people are willing to pick up in a single-serve channel more than they were for the course of the last couple of years I think points to an improving accruing economy, which also has been very helpful for us.

First of all, from the portfolio standpoint, POWERade has had a terrific first half of the year. Our POWERade business is up 15%. On the strength of POWERade Zero, which continues to gain momentum but also base POWERade business is also up low single-digits. So, we are very, very pleased about the POWERade performance, and the momentum around POWERade.
From a water perspective, our single-serve water business was also up nicely in the first half of the year which is again a turnaround from the long-term trends, and our case pack water, we have been much more deliberate about how we promote case pack water, we are not chasing the very deep discount in case pack water, so the volume that we are losing there is non value-added volume, and we are very - I would not say we are very happy with that but it is a deliberate strategy and one that is working for us.
So overall - and vitaminwater, the launch of Vitaminwater Zero has been very successful and we returned that brand to growth so we are very pleased about that. So, overall, our still portfolio, which has been like everybody else affected by the recession over the last couple of years has now got renewed momentum across all the brands and categories. So, we are very pleased with that.
In terms of our overall execution, right execution daily has now been rolled out nationally, and it is a very successful program. It allows us to look at store-by-store changes over time, and setting objectives on a store-by-store basis, and when you look at our cases on display, we were up last year from cases on display perspective, and we are lapping that successfully this year. So our cases on display continue to grow. Our outlet level segmentation and our outlet level execution is going from strength to strength. So we acknowledge that we have a long way to go and we like to be humble about our performance, but we are pleased that we are making significant progress, and we have got momentum and we feel it is making a real difference in our business.
In terms of the boost zones, as I mentioned earlier, we are going to have over 100 boost zones by the end of the year. It is a program that is working for us. When we measure our boost zone performance on a store-by-store basis versus the control group, it is up substantially. So, it represents big investment for us but it is an investment that is paying off in better retail execution, better consumer satisfaction, better customer satisfaction, and a volume lift that is very pleasing for us.

We’ve had an excellent start over the past three weeks. We’ve made progress in increasing value for each of our stakeholders, which includes of course, shareowners, customers, consumers, and employees.
We have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us at new CCE. Our European territories represent a vibrant marketplace for our beverage brands and products, and our team of employees and managers have the experience, skill and dedication needed to seize the many opportunities that lie ahead.
For more than four years, we have consistently grown and improved our business. We have confidence in our ability to continue moving this business forward as a new company. This confidence is enhanced by our solid results for the first three quarters of the year.
As we worked to close our transaction with the Coca-Cola company, we maintained focus on the need to deliver strong 2010 results in all territories, which of course is Europe as well as North America. The results we’ve announced today demonstrate that we are clearly on track to deliver a strong 2010.
Before I start our discussion of new CCE’s results, I’d like to express our appreciation to the Coca-Cola Company for their collaboration in working to close the transaction over the past several months. This was really a coordinated effort and is an excellent example of the type of positive relationship we have. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the Coca-Cola Company to drive sustained growth in Europe.
Now let’s take a look at the results for the third quarter, which as previously announced do not include North America, or our newly acquired territories in Norway and Sweden. For the quarter, we achieved very positive results through solid volume growth, modest pricing, controlled cost, and a stable commodity environment.
Revenue grew 4.5% with operating income growth of 7.5%. These results were driven by solid volume growth of 5%, which was balanced across all of our territories. Net revenue per case was up 1% and cost of goods sold per case was flat both on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
These results were driven by a combination of sparkling and still beverage volume growth. Sparkling drinks were up 3.5% on the performance of core Coca-Cola trademark, as well as solid growth in sparkling flavors, including energy.
For example, Coca-Cola trademark brands increased 3%, which is driven by Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero, which in fact was up more than 15% versus last year. In flavors, energy grew more than 20% as we continued to expand distribution of Monster brands. In stills, wider distribution of Capri Sun, and the introduction of Ocean Spray helped to drive growth of some 15%.
In Great Britain, volume grew 3.5%, which is an improvement from the second quarter as we continue to manage through the impact of soft economic conditions. This growth reflects increases in sparkling flavors, energy, and still beverages. Dr. Pepper achieved growth of more than 15%, while the energy category was up more than 30%.
Volume for our Coca-Cola trademark portfolio was up 1% and we have strong plans underway to accelerate growth in this segment, with activation around our Christmas marketing programs and increased display space.
Continental Europe volume increased 6%, with excellent results both sparkling and still beverages. Brand Coca-Cola grew 2.5%, while Coke Zero was up more than 20%. Still beverages grew more than 20% through brand expansion and increased distribution.
Importantly our ability to seize future brand opportunities and to drive continued growth relies on our success in achieving even higher levels of service for our customers and in turn providing outstanding marketplace execution. We are working on ways to improve service through fresh looks at our routes to market.
We’re also enhancing segmented outlet execution that is tailored store-by-store to specific customer and consumer needs and better matching products and displays with local demand.
In addition, we continue to have an unwavering focus on managing cost. Ownership cost management remains an essential part of our day-to-day operations and a real priority across all CCE functions.
Now let’s briefly examine our outlook for the remainder of 2010. For legacy Europe today, we have confirmed our operating guidance from early September of high single-digit to low double-digit operating income growth, with mid single-digit revenue growth. We also expect Norway and Sweden to perform in line with expectations. This will translate in pro forma comparable earnings per diluted common share in a range of $1.74 to $1.78, which does include results from Norway and Sweden, and excludes non-recurring items.
Bill will provide a bit more color on our financial outlook in a few minutes. For just a moment I want to turn now to North America, which was a part of legacy CCE throughout the third quarter until the close of the transaction.
North America had a really outstanding quarter with volume growth of 2.5%, net revenue per case up 1%, and operating income growth of more than 20%. This represents a solid step forward for North America and demonstrates the skill and dedication of our employees and our management team.
This group delivered outstanding results amid continuing challenging economic conditions. I am very proud of the North American group and proud of the hard work and professionalism that they bring to the marketplace every day. They will be a tremendous asset to the Coca-Cola Company and we wish them the very best in the years ahead.
I also want to thank two former members of our CCE executive team for their leadership and support. John Downs, our Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and Communications has been with CCE since its earliest days. He has provided great counsel and direction, and we offer him our very best as he begins his new role at the Coca-Cola Company.
We are very pleased that Steve Cahillane is President of Coca-Cola Refreshments. Steve’s tremendous insight and leadership skills will be invaluable in building on the recent improvement in North American operating results.
While we will miss both John and Steve, we’re certain that the Coca-Cola Company and the entire Coca-Cola system will benefit from their knowledge and their experience.
Now going forward, a key step is to complete the integration of the Norway and Sweden territories. We are on track with excellent teams in place in both territories and we appreciate their hard work and their commitment. As we build our new CCE, our vision remains to be the best beverage sales and customer service company.
To accomplish this, we will continue to rely on our three key strategic priorities. Grow the value of our existing brands and expand our product portfolio, and be number one or number two in every category where we choose to compete.
Secondly, to continually transform the way we go to market and improve efficiency and effectiveness, so that we will be our customers most valued supplier. And third, to create a winning inclusive culture that attracts, develops and retains a highly talented and diverse workforce.
Today, CCE is a dramatically different company than we were a few months ago with an improved growth outlook yet these priorities remain essential to our success as the ultimate goal remains the same to drive consistent sustainable growth and ultimately create a superior investment return for our shareowners.
Throughout our company, there is a growing sense of pride and enthusiasm for achieving our objectives and our goals. We have great opportunities before us and the people of Coca-Cola Enterprises are prepared to create the value we expect and that our shareowners and customers deserve.
Thank you for joining us today, and now I’ll turn it over to Bill to go into more detail on our financials.

I’m very pleased to discuss third quarter results for new CCE. As John mentioned, this is our first quarterly report and follows the close of the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company on October, the 2.
Before I turn to the results, it is worth noting that just eight months ago, we announced this transaction with the target of a fourth quarter close. We reached that goal and in fact closed on the first day of the fourth quarter and I’m extremely proud of everyone who was involved in the process.
Many members of our team at CCE as well as colleagues from the Coca-Cola Company devoted significant time and effort to make this happen. While many, many others focused on delivering our 2010 operating results, and important to note both were critical to our success.
The result is a new company with a significantly stronger balance sheet, a flexible capital structure, expected strong free cash flow potential, and new higher long-term growth targets. By any measure, this transaction has been a solid success, and we very much appreciate the work of all who had a hand in its realization.
A key element of our success has been our ability to secure the debt needed by new CCE going forward. Total gross debt is now approximately $2.4 billion with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3%, and net debt of approximately $1.9 billion.
We also successfully completed the $10 per share cash distribution, returning approximately $3.4 billion to shareowners. As a result of the transaction new CCE has approximately 339 million common shares outstanding or approximately 347 million diluted common shares outstanding on a pro forma basis.
Recently, our Board authorized our inaugural quarterly dividend payable at $0.12 per common share, which is more than 30% above legacy CCE’s prior dividend level.
Looking ahead to 2011, we continue to expect to achieve our annualized dividend rate of $0.50 per share subject to Board approval. Now let’s look at our third quarter performance which as John mentioned produced excellent results.
Looking at our legacy European territories on a currency neutral basis third quarter revenues increased 4.5% and comparable operating income increased 7.5%. On a comparable and pro forma basis, including Norway and Sweden, we achieved earnings of $0.58 per diluted common share with pro forma net income up $202 million.
These comparable pro forma results include a negative currency impact of just over $0.05 per share for the quarter, and an estimated $0.08 negative impact for the first three quarters.
These results coupled with our outlook for the rest of the year have enabled us to establish new CCE’s pro forma full year guidance with comparable earnings per common share in a range of $1.74 to $1.78.
This earnings per share outlook includes an expected full year negative currency impact of approximately $0.09 per share based on year-to-date currency translation impact at actual rates and expected fourth quarter currency translation at recent rates.
Pro forma revenue is expected to be approximately $7.4 billion, with operating income slightly more than $900 million. Both on a comparable basis and including the expected currency translation impact.
Please note this outlook also includes expectations for recurring items, capital structure, tax rate, and results from Norway and Sweden, and importantly excludes non-recurring items as well as all North American results.
Going forward, we continue to expect long-term revenue growth of 4% to 6%, operating income growth of 6% to 8% with high single-digit earnings per share growth.
We expect these results to be driven by a balance of volume and pricing growth coupled with disciplined operational efficiencies and cost containment.
Share repurchase will be a factor in near term EPS growth, we expect the program will begin in this quarter, and we continue to expect to repurchase up to $1 billion of our shares over the next 18 months, based on current plans and subject to economic factors.
Looking ahead to 2011, though very early we believe we will likely exceed our long-term EPS target driven by the before mentioned share repurchase program. We will provide more details on our 2011 outlook in mid-December.
Overall, we are encouraged by the results we’ve accomplished and especially the quality of these results. We have great opportunities ahead of us with solid brands, vibrant markets, significant growth prospects, and world class strategies.
Again, thanks for joining us today, and now John, Hubert and I will be happy to open the line up for questions. Operator?

We, I think you could probably say, had more challenges to deal with in North America to begin with than we did in Europe. We’ve had an ongoing positive relationship in Europe and it continues, it gets better all the time.
So we can give you a couple of examples we’ve had on incidence pricing model in Europe in place for a long time and as part of this transaction, we memorialized it now for five years, and that’s obviously a good thing. We have active ongoing discussions with KO about major new initiatives.
We’re really pleased with the kind of marketing programs that are coming. I think the consumer relevance of brand Coca-Cola is improving dramatically. I think the quality of the advertising that’s coming out of the Coca-Cola Company is better than it’s been in a long time, and we’re very excited about that. Our teams worked together very effectively day in and day out.
I think as you look to the future, yes, there are opportunities for us to think about, and we’ll work on those. We don’t have our portfolio in Europe exactly where we’d like for it to be, and that’s true from both our standpoint and Coke’s, and though we continue to look at opportunities, but of course those opportunities have to be ones that make sense and they create value for everybody involved. And so, we’re going to be smart and disciplined about it, but we also realize this in categories where we don’t play and we’d like to.
And obviously, as we go forward, we’ve got the whole Germany situation to deal with and we plan to do that in a very positive, disciplined fashion. We’ll have more to say about that obviously in days to come. But I think I would sum it up as a very positive relationship, and I really intend to see it get better as we go forward.

I think in terms of any other opportunities in Western Europe, they are not in the hands of the Coca-Cola Company. So, we certainly would remain willing and ready to explore opportunities, but in those kinds of situations you’ve got to have two people, a seller and a buyer, and so we’ll just have to wait and see where that goes. In terms of geography outside of Western Europe, I think that’s a meaningfully lower priority. We’ve got many more things to think about inside Western Europe first, and we’d clearly prioritize things in that fashion.

So I think at this juncture, you should assume it to be ratable over Q4 ‘10, Q1 through Q4 ‘11, and then Q1 2012 and then we’ll give an update on our progress quarter-by-quarter, including I think we can give you an update on that in December of this year, when we do our outlook call for 2011. So at this juncture that’s the best information that I would give you on modeling the share repurchase.
With respect to your first question, I think from a guidance perspective there’s a couple of things that are affecting ‘10 and ‘11. Firstly, we’re benefiting from a lower commodities environment in 2010. Commodities are actually down low single-digits versus ‘09 and driving the very significant operating income performance that we’ve articulated. At this juncture for 2011, we would expect commodity environment to be up in a low single-digit range in line with historical trend. We would expect to be able to take pricing at a level that would maintain our margins and offset that commodity inflation.
Also of note, we have hedged a significant part of our commodity exposure for 2011, notably with the exception of PET which remains our primary exposure for 2011. All that having been said, building 2011 of a very, very successful 2010 at this juncture other than the share buyback we would stand by our long term guidance. More to come in December.

Just as a reminder, together Norway and Sweden represent slightly less than 10% of our overall volume and revenue, and obviously, profit as well.

And bear in mind that Capri Sun, we have been selling Capri Sun in GB for many years, for more than 10 years, and so it’s an established brand. So clearly, the growth potential is bigger today in Holland, Belgium, and even in France, where we have been there for two years, and France is growing Capri Sun more than double-digits, and we expect that this trend, there is no reason why it should not continue. For Ocean Spray, it’s a bit of the same story. We took over the distribution for Ocean Spray this year both in GB and France.
And again, Ocean Spray has been a long established brand in GB. There is a lot of reason for it to continue to grow about new product innovations and building distribution there is still some room for advanced distribution. But clearly the growth potential is bigger in France. I think we can really grow very fast and truly on Ocean Spray front it has strong credential. We still need to build further distribution, further awareness. We see a lot of potential for Ocean Spray in France, about the same in term of gross rate on Capri Sun.

Frankly depending on the economy depending on the competitive environment, depending on whole host of things, which is why we no longer focus on any one of those items we focus on all three collectively in each year, each quarter even though you can assume we’ll be pulling the levers in the what we judge to be the optimum mix.
In terms of the operating income growth of 6 to 8 of course that’s based on revenue of 4 to 6 along with some efficiency ongoing efficiency improvements and it’s assuming that we have and I’d say just in general our whole business model is built on a modest growth rate for the NARTD category and a modest view around share gains that we will achieve year after year.
We believe we have the right brands, we have the right relationships with customers and we have the right people that collectively, we put all that together with our market place position, it is absolutely our intention and our plan and our assumption that we would have modest share growth on a consistent basis.
