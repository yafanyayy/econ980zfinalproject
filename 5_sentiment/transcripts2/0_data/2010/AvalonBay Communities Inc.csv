With me on the call today are Tim Naughton, our President; Leo Horey, our EVP of Operations; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. In my comments I will first be discussing our fourth quarter results and then I will provide some comments on lessons in the past few years and make some comments on our outlook for the next few years. Tim will be addressing our portfolio performance, investment activity and our 2010 financial outlook after which all four of us will be available for any questions you may have. 
Last evening we reported EPS of $0.40 and FFO per share of $0.64. For the full year our FFO was down approximately 11% after adjusting out non-routine items from both periods. The year-over-year decline in operating FFO was driven primarily by declines in property NOI and the weaker performance of our lease up communities. Our same store portfolio performance continued to reflect the weak economic environment with revenues down approximately 6% for the quarter and approximately 4% for the full year. 
Before turning to our outlook for 2010 I want to take a few minutes to reflect back on the lessons of the recent past. In a year-end publication by Green Street they highlighted a number of lessons learned from the performance of REITs over the past few years. I thought a couple of the points from the article were especially worth emphasizing. First, they mention that companies with simple, stable and transparent business models outperformed those of their more complex peers and also that companies with strong balance sheets outperformed their more highly leveraged peers. Both of these have certainly been true for AvalonBay. 
While we have evolved over the years our base business model and balance sheet approach remain largely unchanged. Let me share a few examples. While others chase new markets both domestically and internationally we remain committed to our high [varied] entry coastal strategy. While others pursued merchant building and condo development opportunities we remained focused on acquiring and developing high quality apartments in our markets. While other grew disproportionately through debt we continued to maintain the strongest balance sheet in the sector. 
In many of the more highly leveraged REITs were forced to issue equity last spring as cyclical lows in their stock price were causing long-term dilution. We avoided these dilutive and untimely equity raises ultimately issuing new equity later in the year when our stock price had recovered over 70% from its March lows. 
Now while our portfolio could not escape the effects of the recession our focus strategy, our consistent business model and our strong balance sheet served us well during this period. The strength of our stock price performance would seem to confirm the soundness of our strategy. In 2009 our total shareholder return was 44% versus 30% for both the RMS and the apartment sector. The last ten years show similar outperformance where our 10-year average total shareholder return was approximately 14% versus approximately 10% for both the RMS and the apartment sector. 
I think it is useful to look back over the last few years as I think many of the past lessons will continue to be true over the next few years. I think we can be pretty certain the de-leveraging process that began last spring will be a long-term process for many. This process will be made even more difficult with the proposed increased regulation of financial firms will likely result in tighter credit overall. The de-leveraging process will likely favor public over private as most public companies are less levered and have greater access to a variety of capital sources than their private peers. This is certainly true in the private sector where the private developers are virtually shut down. 
Among the public companies those with the strongest balance sheets and the highest multiples will be less impacted by dilutive effect of the de-levering process. So from a competitive point of view I think AvalonBay is well positioned to respond to the emerging opportunities that will undoubtedly increase as the economy strengthens and fundamentals improve. 
Given that we see 2010 as a transition year. A transition year for the economy, apartment fundamentals and our investment activity. In terms of the economy we have already seen a transition to positive GDP growth and while job growth is still expected to be modestly negative this year the expectation is from a transition from job losses to job growth in the second half. The modest improvement in the jobs front combined with the continued weakness in the for sale market and the steady decline in the supply of new apartments will help fundamentals begin to transition from very weak for most of 2009 to mostly positive by the end of this year. 
Now to be clear for the year overall we expect same store sales revenue to be down approximately the same as 2009. Yet as contrasted to 2009 where same store revenue eroded at an increasing rate as the year progressed, this year we expect the rate of same store performance decline to be at a decreasing rate. 
Finally we expect this to be a year of transition in terms of our investment activity. During 2009 we dramatically scaled back our investment volume. The combination of the extraordinary weakness in the economy coupled with the uncertainty created by the financial crisis argue for appropriate caution in terms of new investment activity last year. 
Given greater visibility now for both the economy and capital markets and our positive outlook regarding the fundamentals in late 2011 and 2012, we will be increasing our acquisition, free development and development volumes this year to position us for the projected improvement in fundamentals. 
Let me now pass it to Tim who will provide some more detail on our portfolio performance, investment activity as well as some details regarding our 2010 financial outlook.

I would like to focus my remarks on a review of operations and investment activity for the quarter and the past year as well as providing some more color on the outlook for 2010. 
Our portfolio performance continued to decelerate in Q4 with same store revenues down by 6% from last year and sequential revenues down by 2% from last quarter. Full-year performance was in line with our mid-year outlook as same store revenues were down 3.7% for the year and same store NOI down by 7%. Operating expenses were up by 4% for the year driven mostly by higher turnover related and bad debt expense resulting from weak economic and labor market conditions. 
This past year total job losses were more than two times higher than originally forecasted. Many of the additional job losses occurred in the first half of the year which placed greater pressure on portfolio performance for the second half. While portfolio performance continued to decline in Q4 we are seeing signs that the rate of decline is moderating and is currently bottoming on a year-over-year basis. For the same store portfolio economic occupancy is stable, turnover has returned to levels more in line with historical patterns after having been elevated for much of 2009 and concessions remain low. 
During last quarter and so far in Q1 we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline for both new move in and renewal rents. Year-over-year revenue declines bottomed in October and have fallen at a lesser rate in each subsequent month since then. As a result, the rate of decline in the sequential quarterly revenues appears to have bottomed in Q4. 
Regionally the West Coast continues to underperform with Seattle experiencing the greatest deterioration over the last quarter followed by Northern California. On the East Coast, D.C. and Boston are holding up best in the current environment driven in part by the strength of the government and educational sectors. 
Shifting to investment activity on the transaction front we bought one asset in Q4 and another so far in this quarter. Both of these acquisitions occurred in the D.C. market and totaled about $100 million, just under $150,000 per unit and a cap rate at the mid 6% range. Both communities were purchased from the acquisition fund. We sold three communities in Q4 totaling a little over $100 million. These communities sold at an average cap rate of 6.3%. For the full year we sold five assets totaling $190 million at an average cap rate of 6.5% and an unlevered IRR of 13%. So far in Q1 we sold one asset for $45 million and have two others under contract totaling another $145 million. 
Cap rates have been falling over the last three months as buyers are becoming increasingly confident and more aggressive in their underwriting and target returns. The greater near-term visibility in the operating environment combined with a very positive outlook for the fundamentals in 2011 and beyond has translated into lower cap rates and higher asset values. After cap rates had risen by 150-200 basis points last year from their lows they have since fallen by as much as 75 basis points and now range from mid 5 to low 6’s across our portfolio. 
Combined with declining NOI we estimate that asset value is up by around 5-10% over last quarter but still about 25% off the cyclical highs. With a shortage of product to meet investor demand bidding is becoming increasingly intense with plenty of support at market clearing prices. Clearly improved liquidity in the capital markets for supporting a multi-family transaction market and as we begin 2010 buyers far outnumber sellers which should continue to put positive pressure on asset values. 
In terms of new development our pipeline continues to decline after having completed almost half a billion in Q4 and over $800 million for the full year. Combined with modest starts of $65 million in 2009, current development underway is now around $800 million, down almost 2/3 from peak volume with only about one-quarter billion remaining to invest. We did start two deals in Q4. Both of these are wood frame communities in suburban northeast markets where rental market conditions have generally been more stable, the projected returns are more compelling and the construction costs have declined by over 20% since the peak. 
In fact, one of the communities recently started as a second phase located in Northborough, MA which is budgeted to be built for around 15% less than Phase I on a per square foot basis for just the vertical construction or for the bricks and sticks. This represents only a portion of the cumulative decline that has occurred as we started Phase I just a year earlier. 
Yields on current lease up and recently completed communities remain under pressure as we have had to use significant concessions and lower effective rents to maintain absorption particularly at communities at higher price points and with elevated levels of new supply. This is most evident at Avalon Fort Green in Brooklyn where effective rents are down significantly from initial pro forma. New move in rents have fallen throughout the New York City market but Brooklyn is particularly weak given the level of new supply being delivered there. 
Turning now to next year and our 2010 outlook starting with operations. As Bryce mentioned fundamentals should begin to improve with modest job growth projected to occur in the second half of the year. Combined with dwindling supply for a reduction in new deliveries of both purpose built rentals as well as potential shadow supply from new condominiums. While our full-year outlook for same store performance isn’t that much different than what we experienced in 2009 the changes by quarter figure will be the reverse of what we saw last year. 
2009’s quarterly performance was progressively worse during the year and 2010 we expect quarterly performance to get progressively better on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential quarter basis we expect the decline in same store revenues to continue to moderate and be flat by year-end. 
Regionally we expect that Seattle and Northern California will continue to underperform the average. The job picture should begin to improve in Seattle faster than other west coast markets but supply will remain elevated particularly on the east side. Northern California is expected o continue to lose jobs in the first part of the year and be impacted by the weight of the cumulative employment loss in that region. 
D.C. and Boston should outperform again in 2010. Job growth has already begun to turn positive in D.C. and the combination of private sector employment stabilizing and falling supply should help Boston outpace other markets. The outlook for New York and Southern California is a bit less clear as both of these regions appear to be in transition. Given the rebound in the capital markets, New York should stabilize quicker than we originally anticipated as job losses are almost 100,000 less than initially projected. 
In Southern California the sequential rate of decline has already begun to moderate. San Diego should be the first to recover of the Southern California markets while L.A. should recover roughly in line with the national average. Orange County with its dependence on the housing and mortgage industries figures to lag in its recovery. 
In terms of investment activity as Bryce mentioned 2010 should be a more active year for us. Last year the focus was on restoring and improving liquidity. As we start to bottom out during the correction portion of this cycle 2010 could prove to be a good year to put capital to work in the form of acquisitions and new development in certain markets. We are currently active on the acquisition front and have purchased around $100 million over the last 90 days. Other than dispositions already closed or under contract we don’t anticipate further asset sales this year. 
With the broader capital markets continuing to recover dispositions are a relatively less attractive source of capital than over the past couple of years when asset sales offered a balanced, neutral way to tap the cost effective GSC debt market. 
We do intend to start some new developments in 2010 although the amount should be modest by historical standards upon the order of $400 million. Most of the activity is likely to occur in the northeastern suburban markets where market conditions are more stable and wood frame communities offer better projected returns. In addition we are beginning to look at new land opportunities as some land owners and lenders are starting to consider disposing of their holdings and many of our competitors remain on the sidelines. 
Our financial outlook includes a range for FFO of $3.60 to $3.85 per share or about 16% below 2009 adjusting for non-routine items driven in part by a projected decline of same store NOI of 5-7%. Projected FFO declines are also being driven by stabilizing development activity from 2009 and 2010, much of which is leasing up at initial effective yields below pro forma. Our balance sheet is well positioned as debt to total market cap is currently under 40%. Liquidity is strong as we raised over $1.5 billion in 2009 and approximately $3 billion over the last two years. We currently have $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and all of our $1 billion credit facility available. 
Finally, the capital markets are largely open which should continue to support our growth plans. Since the fall we have raised capital through the issuance of common shares, securing unsecured debt and asset sales. With most forms of capital readily available at reasonable pricing through the best of credits our competitive position continues to strengthen as we move toward the expansion phase of the next cycle. 
With that I will now turn it back over to Bryce for summary remarks.

I just wanted to provide a few additional comments regarding our outlook for the next couple of years. As you know jobs, while not the only factor, are the principle driver of apartment demand and also as we know from historical experience actual job numbers can be very different than initial projections. 
One only needs to look at last year’s remind of how far off job forecasts can be and January 2009 the consensus forecast was for national job loss of about 2 million. Actual losses for 2009 were about 2.5 times as great. We look to a number of third parties and for 2010 the forecasts generally range from about 0.5% positive job growth to about 1.5% negative. We are using a baseline forecast of about 0.5% negative. Embedded in this estimate is the assumption of positive job growth in the second half of the year. 
The timing of this forecast is similar to past recoveries as job growth generally trails total GDP growth by 3-4 quarters. In any event, expected job growth is only one factor in how we assess expected revenue growth. It is primarily a bottom-up process where we look at each sub market, each properties competitive position in building up our owned revenue forecast. 
So as I stated earlier we see 2010 as a transition year, one where the economy transitions from job losses to job gains and where apartment fundamentals transition from weak to modestly positive and where revenue transitions from sequentially negative to flat later in the second half of the year. But ultimately sustained strength in all three of these being the economy, fundamentals and our portfolio, will not come until 2011 and 2012, a period where we expect to see very strong fundamentals. This has guided our decision to increase our investment activities as Tim outlined in anticipation of the expected stronger recovery. 
With that, operator we would be glad to take any questions.

In terms of acquisitions, acquisitions are going to experience the same revenue trends during that market period and where we may be more confident I think we are pretty confident we understand all the markets we are buying or developing in and we have given equal probability in terms of our forecast on how those markets are going to perform.

The other was the maintenance related expenses. Then frankly some one-time issues that occurred in 2008 that elevated our 2009 results. For example, there were two big tax appeals that were successful in the fourth quarter of last year which depressed the 2008 and forced 2009 up.

With me on the call today are Tim Naughton, our President; Leo Horey, our EVP of Operations; and Thomas Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. Leo and I will share some prepared remarks and then all four of us will available to answer any questions you may have. 
Last evening we reported operating results that were stronger than our prior guidance. The stronger results were primarily attributable to improved portfolio performance. In our comments today we’ll be focusing on what is driving the improving fundamentals, and the implications to our portfolio and investment activity. 
For the quarter we reported EPS of $0.88 which is up almost 50% from the same period last year, an increase that was driven primarily by the gains on two asset sales during the first quarter. FFO per share for the quarter was $0.96, which is down approximately 20% from the prior period after adjusting for non-routine items yet was above the previous guidance that we provided.
Now of the outperformance during the quarter the majority came from stronger portfolio performance with the balance coming from timing of various overhead expenses some of which will reverse themselves in the coming quarters. 
In my comments last quarter I said we expected 2010 to be a year of transition, transition in the economy, from job losses to job gains, and transition in both apartment fundamentals and portfolio performance.
In our prior guidance we had expected this transition to begin around mid year, however recent economic data, corporate profits, and our first quarter results suggest that this transition is already underway. 
So the transition we anticipated is happening a quarter or two earlier than expected. In terms of the economy the positive GDP growth that began in the second half of last year is now favorably impacting the employment picture.
The job market began to stabilize late last year, with essentially flat job growth from November through February and with the March job’s report, is now beginning to show positive growth. The current projections for job growth while still modest are ahead of prior forecasts used in our outlook at the beginning of the year.
And the current forecast of about 800,000 for the year is about double the original projection. Now the job growth in March while helpful is certainly not by itself sufficient to explain the recent improvement in apartment fundamentals. 
The improvement is likely due to a combination of factors, first the household surveys of job growth suggested actual job growth may be stronger than is what has recently been reported. And this is likely true particularly in the younger age segment which disproportionately benefits renter demand. 
Secondly, the improvement in fundamentals is undoubtedly driven in part by generally rising consumer confidence. The recent released consumer confidence index rose in April to its highest level since the beginning of the financial crisis in September of 2008.
I think its fair to say that most feel the worst is behind them and probably feel the job situation is likely stable. Many had delayed making a major housing decision over the last year or two because of the prior uncertainty regarding the economy and the security of the job market.
Historically this is particularly true in the younger age segments where household [formations] declined disproportionately during a recession. Now with the generally brighter outlook and the likely strained patience of their parents or roommates, the unbundling is likely beginning as the typical 25 year old recent college grad is deciding to finally leave mom and dad’s home or his friend’s couch and get his or her own apartment. 
Now this factor is hard to quantify but is consistent with what we have experienced coming out of prior recessions and is even more likely now given the size of the GenY age cohort. Another reason for the increase in renter households is the continued weakness in the for sale market which is continuing to reduce homeownership rates and increasing renter households.
As additional evidence of the weakness in the housing market home prices remained flat to down and inventory levels remained historically high. And all of this is despite unprecedented government support for the for sale market. 
Our results for the first quarter provide additional evidence that apartment fundamentals are improving and are doing so earlier than anticipated and I want to share a few data points with you, many of which Leo will elaborate on during his comments. 
Year over year revenue declines in our portfolio peaked in October of last year and the rate of decline has continued to moderate each month since. One third of our market showed positive sequential revenue growth this quarter despite a seasonally slow period. 
For the portfolio as a whole renewal rates turned positive during the quarter and overall most of our leading portfolio metrics have or are returning to pre-recession levels. So while the economic recovery this year will likely still be modest, at least in terms of job growth, it is a recovery, and its taking hold earlier than originally anticipated. 
And while our year over year revenue numbers will likely continue to be negative for most of the year we expect to see sequential positive growth during the second quarter. Overall as we indicated in last evening’s release we now expect that revenue and NOI for the full year will be better than our prior guidance and will fall outside of the original ranges. 
We also expect that FFO for the year will likely be at the high end of the prior range. As has been our practice we’ll be providing specific updated ranges during our mid year update in conjunction with our second quarter release. 
The earlier than expected recovery affirms our decision to restart our development activity late last year. In anticipation of the recovery cap rates on existing assets have continued to decline and are now in the mid five’s with some of the West Coast even lower. 
We believe that beginning developments now while we can lock in attractive construction pricing and delivering into stronger fundamentals in 2011 and 2012, is an attractive use of capital particularly when compared to current cap rates. 
Now during the quarter we began construction on one community in Long Island, this is a 350 apartment home community with a total cost of about $110 million. Given the improving fundamentals and the current soft construction market we elected to build this community as a single phase, versus a two phase community as previously planned. 
The combination of attractive construction pricing and the added scale efficiencies of the single phase allowed us to reduce our total budgeted cost for this job alone by about $20 million or about 15% from our prior budget. 
We currently have seven communities under construction which included the two communities which we started late last year. You’ll notice on attachment eight of the press release that we reported additional savings of about $3 million this quarter which brings our total savings from our original budgeted costs to approximately $50 million on the communities under construction.
We have and are clearly benefiting from a soft construction market. During the quarter we completed the sale of two communities for proceeds of about $83 million, and during April we sold the first phase of a large two phase community in New Rochelle, New York. 
The proceeds from this sale totaled about $107 million bringing the total sales for the year to about $190 million. For the second quarter we provided FFO guidance of $0.93 to $0.97 which reflects the positive effect of the improving fundamentals offset in part by the dilutive effects of the recent sales. 
Now with that I’ll pass it to Leo who will provide more color on our portfolio performance.

During Q1 portfolio performance exceeded our expectations driven primarily by better than expected revenue performance. Year over year revenues declined less than expected and sequential revenue improved from the minus 2% reported in Q4 to minus 0.3% for Q1. 
Importantly sequential revenue turned positive in March and early indications are that this pattern is continuing into April. This is the first sequential revenue increase since Q4 of 2008 and is occurring a couple of quarters ahead of our original expectations.
Occupancy averaged 96.2% for the quarter which was slightly better than the previous quarter and 1% greater than the same period of the previous year. These results were ahead of our expectations and allowed us to push rents more aggressively than anticipated. 
Occupancy increased through the quarter and in April this figure is trending to approximately 96.5%. The change in new move in rent improved from approximately minus 6% in Q4 of last year to approximately minus 4% in Q1 and was just over minus 2% in March. 
This pattern was consistent in varying degrees across all AvalonBay regions. Turning to renewal rents the portfolio average increased approximately one half of one percent for the quarter. Turnover was 42%, the lowest level in the last four years. These results are encouraging when you consider that renewal offers are extended to residents approximately 90 days prior to the expiration of their lease and as a result, the improvement in renewal rents often lag the improvement in markets conditions by a couple of months. 
Our expectation is that these renewal rent increases will continue to accelerate in the second quarter. Given the upward momentum we are seeing in both the economy and the apartment market, our current operating strategy in most regions is to push rents more aggressively.
So don’t be surprised if you see us come off of these high occupancy levels as we find the optimal pricing points. This is important as we enter the seasonally stronger spring and summer leasing periods when 60% of all expiration occur.
Occupancy comparisons during the second half of 2010 will be more challenging but continued improvement in the year over year results is dependent on continued growth in rental rates. Looking more specifically at individual regions, the West Coast continues to lag the East Coast from a performance perspective, but all regions show signs of improvement. 
In Northern California internet and technology companies are hiring. Occupancies are solid at approximately 96.5% in the San Francisco and San Jose markets and new move ins and renewal rents are stable or beginning to increase.
Similar patterns are evident in Southern California and Seattle, although from a more modest occupancy platform that increased substantially from the same period last year to approximately 95.5% for the first quarter. 
Moving to the East Coast, average rental rates are flat to up slightly on a sequential basis and occupancies are almost uniformly in the low to mid 96% range. This is generally being driven by job markets that are stabilizing sooner than on the West Coast coupled with declining new supply. 
On the jobs front the cutbacks in the financial services sector are not as significant as originally anticipated. In addition employment trends in the education and healthcare sectors have remained stable through this economic downturn and most of our East Coast markets have a higher share of that employment pool than the US average. 
Looking at individual markets, the New York Metropolitan area has experienced some job gains over the last several months and this has helped drive improvement in new move in and renewal rent change. In Boston recent job growth and limited new supply allowed occupancy to increase to almost 96% by the end of the quarter with few concessions being offered.
New move in rent change improved throughout the quarter and renewal rent change was positive in each of the three months averaging approximately 2.5%. The DC Metropolitan area continued to perform well. Continued job growth produced positive rent change on leases that expired but this was tempered by pockets of new supply. 
Before concluding I want to highlight the two new schedules in our earnings release, attachment four provides visibility into the contributions of the different operating components from assets not included in the same store sales portfolio. 
Attachment seven provides additional detail on the components of operating expenses for the same store sales portfolio. Expanding on the information provided in the new attachment seven, severe winter weather on the East Coast contributed disproportionately to the increase in repairs and maintenance.
For example approximately $550,000 of the million dollar increase in this category is attributable to snow removal in the Mid Atlantic alone and we expect some residual costs related to the winter weather will extend into Q2. 
Office operations is driven by bad debt which was higher than the same period last year but continued to trend down to more normal levels.   
So in summary we expect four factors to continue to support the more favorable revenue trends that we experienced during the quarter. First, improving job growth will boost household formations. Second, demographics will continue to increase rental demand. Third, home buying remained out of the reach for many renters in our markets, and finally, new supply is being absorbed and future supply is very limited.
As a result we are actively increasing rental rates in virtually all AvalonBay markets to ensure that we capitalize on the improving demand supply conditions and secure the highest rents possible as we enter the peak leasing season. 
With that I will turn the call back over to Bryce.

First it makes us feel even more confident regarding our decision to restart our development activity and it will likely result in our beginning a bit more than we originally planned.
Secondly while the recovery should and does make us increasingly interested in acquisitions unfortunately we’re not alone. As the economic has improved so too has buyer interest which in turn has pushed both cap rates and total return expectations down. 
And while we’ll continue to focus on acquisitions we do expect the volume of purchases to be relatively modest. And finally as Leo mentioned we will continue to push our rental rates given the improving outlook and our high occupancies. 
That concludes our remarks and we’d be glad to answer any questions that anyone may have.

To try to give some perspective on the future, if you look back to 2004 when sequential revenues turned positive the first quarter of 2004 they were slightly negative and then they went positive and for the next four quarters the sequential revenues were roughly between a half a percent and a percent.
So does that answer your question.

Having said that the household survey of job data which I alluded to has suggested there’s been job growth really happening since December so we wouldn’t be surprised to see the employment data get revised upwards to show that there has been more job growth happening. 
But the simple fact of seeing such a spike in consumer confidence I don’t think we can underestimate how that impacts people’s decision to make bigger decisions and a rental decision whiles it’s a big decision its not like deciding to buy a home.
So a little bit of improvement in consumer confidence particularly in that younger age cohort which are 75% renters, does a lot to boost demand for rental apartments. So if I had to pick one factor for all of us analytical types you like to look for exactly where is the job growth and I think in this case it’s a lot more driven by improving sentiment and people willingness to feel good about their condition in order to make that rental decision which is not a huge decision but is an important one for so many people.

But that’s going to vary by market based upon the growth outlook for a particular market. For instance on the West Coast we would expect the initial yield to be lower because we expect higher growth over time on the West Coast over the East Coast.

I will say while that’s conventional wisdom our own experience in our portfolio and maybe less true than many think in that we should never forget that everything trades on a relative basis so if that guy comes off the couch and he helps out the B’s and the B’s get fuller and start to push up rents, well then what does that do to the relative difference between B’s and A’s.
It narrows it and then A’s get stronger and it pushes up, and so the so called rising tide would solve both and when the tide goes out it affects all boats so I don’t think there’s ever a necessarily just a winner and a loser, I think there are going to be differences relatively minor differences at different parts of the cycle and that’s been our experience as you know.
Within our portfolio while we are primarily A’s, we’re not exclusively A’s and so we’re increasingly tracking the relative performance of what you would consider B’s versus A’s and we see a pretty narrow difference between those asset types.

As Tim mentioned and we’ve said for years, we underwrite on current rents so when a community is started that’s current rent. 
That rent remains unchanged until we are materially into the lease up which we define as nominally about 30%. At the time it gets to be 30% or better leased we update that number to reflect the actual leasing performance that’s been in place. So as an example take Fort Green, community was started whatever, 18 months ago, we carried that number until we were about 30% leased then a couple of quarters ago you saw that number go down because that reflected the initial leasing experience at Fort Green given that the market had turned down for the past 18 months.
Now we moved it up this month because our actual leasing performance not our expectations for the future, but our actual leasing performance demonstrated we’re getting those higher rents. Just wanted to make sure we’re all on the same page of how that number is calculated. It is not a projection of where we think leases will be when the community is completed.

Number one the rents have been basically flat and we’ve been absorbing apartments and that’s been going pretty well. In general the lease ups will follow how our same store markets are performing and obviously those are improving so our expectation is that rents will start to improve over time. 
I will want to point out one fact though which is that when you’re leasing up a community all the leases are new move ins. You don’t have the benefit of the existing residents so that can put some downward pressure. Ultimately what we do is we set absorption expectations in each community and when absorption exceeds the expectation that we set then we start moving rents up. 
In the first quarter we averaged about 17 net leases per month per community, that was basically consistent with the previous year and with our expectations. As we see more strength and that absorption accelerates then what we will do is we’ll raise rents accordingly.

All that being said there is still a lot of interaction between the centralized revenue management group that sits here in Alexandria and the people on the ground who can provide color and perspective. But I would tell you that the revenue management software has worked well throughout the cycle.

So what we do we like many many companies today have a sustainability initiative within the company and on each and every development we look at what are we required to do and then what do we want to do electively and in some cases we do only what’s required because to do any more electively is very punitive and it can be upwards of 10% of costs.
In other cases we elect to go the extra mile because its only a few additional percent. We and others in the industry have done some research on this with residents and unfortunately today residents are just not willing to pay, this is a general statement, but its borne out by survey of 50,000 renters, are generally not willing to pay the additional premium and so that certainly does impact our willingness to invest.
It isn’t just driven on that metric but that is an important metric. Our focus in the area of sustainability is looking first and foremost is what’s going to reduce utility expenses for us and for our residents. A lot of the green initiatives go beyond that to other areas of sustainability which are harder to quantify and some cases are quite costly.

In terms of our position we have a line that prices at LIBOR plus 40 and that rate will be reset sometime next year so clearly our floating rate debt cost will go up as well. I guess the other point to make though is long-term what we capitalize as a cost of development is based on a weighted average interest rate of all of our debt outstanding unless there’s specific debt to a property. 
So I wouldn’t expect that you’d see a big increase in capitalized interest, its just a big base to move over time and you’re not likely to see it. But our true costs, it would be hard to argue they’re not going to go up in the next couple of years.

With me on the call today are Tim Naughton our President; Leo Horey our EVP of Operations; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. Tim and I will share some prepared remarks and then all four of us will be available to answer any questions you may have today.
In our remarks, I’ll be highlighting our results for the quarter and we’ll be discussing our outlook for the second half of the year as well as some thoughts on 2011 and ‘12. Tim will be addressing both our portfolio performance and our investment activity.
For the quarter, we reported EPS of $0.61 and FFO per share of $1.04. Both the EPS and FFO were above the updated financial outlook that we provided in early June, due primarily to better than expected performance on the expense side, both of which is timing related.
Our revenue performance both on a year-over-year and sequential basis continue to show significant improvement. Our same store sales portfolio showed sequential revenue growth of 1.3% for the quarter and four of our six regions showing positive growth. This is our first quarterly sequential growth in over a year and half and is consistent with our recently updated financial outlook.
In January, when we gave our original guidance we stated that we expected 2010 to be a year of transition. One, where we would see improvement in jobs, corporate fundamentals and same store sales performance. In June, we released an updated outlook raising our estimates of 2010 revenue, NOI and FFO performance, in response to the significant improvement we’re seeing in our portfolio.
Our second quarter results and early third quarter metrics continued to substantiate improving fundamentals and allow us to reaffirm the financial outlook that we provided in early June.
So what’s driving this improvement? There is number of factors which can be grouped into four product categories. First, an improving albeit bumpy economic recovery; second, a weak for-sale housing market, which is resulting in a decline in ownership rate; third, demographics that will continue to benefit rental demand; and finally, a significant reduction in the delivery of new apartment. I want to touch on a few of these factors.
First on the economy, the economy continues to grow, ye the pace of growth slowed during the second quarter, and it’s not unusual for an economic recovery to be bumpy during the first few quarters out in inflection point and this recovery is no exception.
This uneven recovery is likely to continue to the rest of the year with moderate growth in both GDP and job gains. Job gains both year-to-date and for the full year is expected to average about 100,000 a month, which is a welcome change to the average of over 400,000 jobs per month loss last year, but still not strong enough to bring the unemployment rate down.
It will likely be into 2011 before we begin to see the positive effects of the current trends of rising corporate profits, low interest rates and improved access to credit as these hopefully begin to translate into rising business and consumer confidence and ultimately stronger private sector hiring.
Turning to the housing markets, I think it’s time to overemphasize the positive impact that the weak for-sale housing market has and will likely continue to have on the rental market. The ownership rate fell again during the second quarter and is now just below 67%, the lowest rate in over ten years.
This decline is in spite the positive effect of the Federal home buying tax credit, which is still available during the second quarter. In terms of this tax credit, the homeownership rate would undoubtedly have fallen further. Many would be buyers remain on sidelines because of appropriately tighter lending requirements, fears that home prices may continue to fall and continued uncertainty over the strengths of the economic recovery.
The recent article in Barron’s provided a forecast that the homeownership rate would likely drop to 64% by 2015, a level somewhat what we experienced over the 35-year period from the early 1960s to the mid 1990s.
Another article earlier this week suggested that homeownership rates could fall to as low as 62%. Assuming the rates fall to just 64% will create additional 3.5 million rental households during next five years or about 700,000 per year from this catalyst alone.
Now, our jobs have been and will continue to be an important driver for apartment demand. It’s likely that changes in the for-sale market may have even larger impact in job growth on the strength of the apartment markets in the coming years.
Finally let me touch on new supply. In multifamily rental start so far for 2010, are running in an annualized rate for about 70,000 for the year. The global production is only about a third of the historical average, and is approximately equal to the annual loss due to obsolescence. Given that there was a similarly modest level of apartment starts in the second half of ‘09, it will be the equivalent of Net Zero deliveries of new multifamily products in the ‘11 and ‘12.
While we are beginning of see the benefit of reduction in supply this year, the real benefit will be over the next few years. So whether it’s a modestly improving economy, falling homeownership rates, positive demographics or an anemic level of new products. It’s hard to not to feel positive about the impact on rental fundamentals, both this year, but increasing so in 2011 and 2012.
Now, before I pass it to Tim, I wanted to touch briefly on our activity under our CEP or Continuous Equity Program. As we outlined in last evening’s release, we raised approximately $210 million during the quarter at an average price of just over $100 a share. This program has been in place since August of last year and we now have raised a full $400 million authorized under the program.
Our selection of capital market options over the last several years, underscores the financial flexibility afforded by the strong balance sheet. Flexibility that we used during the financial crisis of late ‘08 and early ‘09. During that period, we issued over $2 billion of debt in an average rate of 5.2% and we avoided issuing equity at cyclically low prices.
The last time we had raised equity was in early 2007. The $400 million of equity raised since the fall of ‘09, helps to further strengthen what is arguably the strongest balance sheet in the sector and positions us well to take advantage of the emerging growth opportunities.
I will now pass it to Tim who will be providing some additional color on our operating and investment activities. Tim?

First, I’ll provide some additional color on portfolio performance and apartment market conditions. Second, I’ll discuss investment activity highlighting what we’re seeing in the transaction market and our outlook on new development.
Starting with operations, through July, we’re tracking with the midyear guidance we issued in early June. As Bryce mentioned, second quarter sequential same-store revenue growth was 1.3%. The increase was driven by improvement on the East Coast and sequential same-store revenues were around 2% higher in the East and roughly flat in the West. The improvement in performance was largely the result of rental rate growth, as same-store rental rates were up 0.9% from the previous quarter. Rental rate growth has been an area of focus for us over the last several months, as demand/supply fundamentals have turned in the favor of the landlords.
During the second quarter, changes in year-over-year rents for those units with expiring leases, which includes renewals and new move-ins, accelerated from just under 1% in April to around 4.5% in June. The trend is positive for both renewals and new move-ins, as renewals were up around 4% and new move-ins increased by over 5% in June. This trend continued into July as renewals and new move-ins were up around 5.5% year-over-year.
So overall, we’re seeing dramatic improvement in renewal and new move-in rent growth in our portfolio with the blended growth rate having increased by almost 500 basis points since March alone.
The trend of rents turning positive is broad based across the portfolio. In June and July, all 16 of our markets experienced year-over-year growth in roll-over rents, which we define as the blended average of renewals and new move-in.
As of July, the strongest growth occurred in the metro of New York, New Jersey region, where roll-over rents were up by more than 7%, and where new move-in rents increased by more than 10% at some of our communities.
This region had experienced the most dramatic turnaround in our portfolio as the New York Metro area is beginning to benefit from job growth that began to materialize in the first half of the year.
The Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northern California regions all posted solid gains as well, with roll-over rents increasing by more than 5% in each of these regions in July. The DC markets, which has been the most stable during the downturn, has recovered at a steadier pace, while Northern California and New England have accelerated more sharply.
The last region to recover, Seattle and Southern California, are currently experiencing roll-over rent increases of around 3.5% and 2% respectively. While we’re continuing to focus on growing the top line through rental rate growth, we are keeping our eye on occupancy and availability trends as well.
As we tested rents across our markets, we’ve been willing to tolerate some additional vacancy and in fact economic occupancy has drifted lower since April and for the mid to high 95% range. Given seasonal traffic patterns, though, we believe that midyear is the optimal time to push for excellent portfolio, often to the point of refusal in our markets.
If we experience some loss in occupancy in mid year, we still have the opportunity to adjust our pricing strategies before the lower traffic even sits in. We’ll continue to actively manage the portfolio seeking to find a pricing strategy that optimizes the relationship between rent and inventory levels.
While fundamentals have shifted decidedly in favor of rental housing, we understand that they are still impacted by broader economic trends, which as we’ve seen can be uneven and choppy, so maintaining a flexible posture with respect to our operating strategies in response to the shifts in the environment will be critical to optimize the performance.
I want to shift now to investment activity starting with an overview of the transaction market and our outlook for acquisitions and dispositions. As asset values have increased, we’ve started to see a pickup in market activity. Where transaction is currently being priced, rents appear to be around 5%, ranging from mid 4% to 5% on the West Coast and low-to-mid 5% on the East Coast. Combined with the more positive outlook for NOI growth, asset values of around 20% from the trough was still around 15% off the peak.
Although many owners are still reluctant to sell at current pricing levels, there’s a growing number willing to sell some assets in an effort to either diversify their holdings or resolve a pending issue with near-term maturing debt. Pricing support is solid and bid activity remains robust as demand for institutional product is outstripping supply.
Given these market conditions, sellers are beginning to take larger, more complex offerings to market sensing that buyer’s appetite and tolerance for risk is growing. Recently, there have been a number of $100 million plus transactions marked by sellers, including a 2,500 unit portfolio in D.C. area.
In the past quarter, we sold one asset Avalon on the sale of the New Rochelle for $108 million. This is the first phase of the 1,000 unit communities where we sold out approximately 600 apartments in the second phase, and continue to manage the first phase of the buyer. This transaction was initiated late last year and completed in April and was done in part to a large exposure to this one submarket.
We’ve completed the $190 million in dispositions for the second quarter and don’t anticipate stage selling anymore assets in 2010. In terms of acquisitions, we didn’t close on any communities this past quarter. However, we currently have around $200 million under contract and due diligence, all of which would be acquired for a second investment management fund.
While the investment market is competitive, we’ll continue to look for deals that we believe provides unique opportunities for growth even due to the competitive position in the market, for our ability to reposition them through our redevelopment in asset management capabilities.
Lastly, I’d like to touch on new developments. This past quarter we didn’t start or complete any new development, however in July, we did start three new deals sold in around $100 million and for the year, it has now started over $200 million in new developments. As outlined in our revised outlook, we expect to start around $600 million by year end, which represents a $200 million increase over our original outlook.
The projected yield for the current development portfolio was down this past quarter and is now projected at 5.7%. This is the result of the beginning of lease up for three communities that originally started in 2008, where opening rents are off by almost 10% from initial pro forma.
As you recall, we don’t adjust projected rents and so the beginning of lease up. For these three communities declines in the opening lease up rents are consistent with portfolio wide trends in these markets since the start of construction. Importantly, these three leased up communities are the last of the 2008 starts, those deals started before the rental market correction of 2009.
In other words each of the communities in the current development portfolio reflects rents that are essentially been mark-to-market. With market conditions now improving across the board, we expect the performance of this portfolio to improve.
In addition, the remaining 2010 starts represent some of the more attractive deals in our development pipeline. With projected yields in the 7% plus range which will further enhance the economics of this portfolio.
With cap rates now in the 5% range, new development in general is accretive on an NAV and earnings basis, and when you combine improving market fundamentals with cyclically low construction and capital costs new development is particularly compelling at this point of the cycle.
In addition to starting new deals, we are aggressively working to replenish the pipeline. Many owners and lenders are just starting the process to resolving some of their acquisitions.
In addition, some land developers are beginning to market new opportunities. For example, we recently signed an LOI with Federal Realty to develop the multi-family component of their mixed use of assembly road project in Boston.
We believe that we are uniquely positioned to secure our market opportunities like these. We have a long track record that provides comfort to landowners and our ability to perform. The current liquidity in balance sheet to fund new opportunities; and finally, the existing development and construction platform to execute them.
Building the pipeline will continue to be an area of heightened focus for the balance of the year, as we ramp up to some important part of business.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Bryce for some closing comments.

Certainly, we’re pleased to see the expected improvement in fundamentals translate to the tangible improvement in our portfolio. With positive sequential revenue growth and new move-in rents and renewal rents both now exceeding 5%, it’s clear that we’ve reached an inflection point in terms of our portfolio performance which positions us well with stronger performance in ‘11.
Across the number of dimensions like fewer acquisition wells to take advantage of our emerging growth opportunities, first, our portfolio with strong occupancies and accelerating rental rates; secondly, through the investment activity.
On the acquisition side, through our second investment management fund we have an additional 600 million of buying capacity. On the development side, we have a $3 billion pipeline that communities either in planning or under construction.
Finally, our balance sheet, which is arguably the strongest in the sector with low leverage and excellent liquidity. We are very optimistic regarding next few years both as to the attractiveness of rental fundamentals, but equally importantly our ability to capitalize on those opportunities. Lisa, that concludes our prepared remarks and we’d be glad to open it up for questions.

So, I feel pretty good about the push we’ve made and if you go specifically to new move-in rents, we’ve held our conversion ratio in that low to mid 30% range, which we always look for. And then our turnover, as you saw for the second quarter, was substantially below the same period the previous year, and in July that turnover is remaining in the high single-digits lower than the previous year.

It’s really the fact that we have deferred the government activity on certain parcels that we now can no longer capitalize interest on those because we’re not actively pursuing in for development, that’s the principal explanation for that. In terms of the overall $0.05 that’s in the road map on page three of the press release. It consists of a number of things, would start with the tax-exempt bond that increase of about $0.02 of the $0.05 is related to increased credit enhancement fees for a couple of factors in bond deals and these are liquidity facilities that expire and then were re-priced. In that re-pricing, I think it reflects what we’re seeing in the market, in general, and that is when credit facilities come up for renewal they are being priced at a higher rate than the legacy liquidity facility.
And then secondly, this is a market that’s probably further away from recovery than other credit markets, so the tax-exempt bond market is specifically the credit enhancement market has been a little slower recovery than some of the other markets. Some of the other components of that interest includes an anticipated increase in low floater rates which may or may not occur, and that’s about a $0.01 a share. If short-term interest rates remain where they are today at roughly 20 basis points, you could see that maybe a $0.01 of that not increase as we are anticipating.
Some of the other aspects of the $0.05 or the decrease in the capitalized interest that we already discussed of $0.02 and an anomaly the quarter in that we actually have an extra day in the quarter, which is growing on about $0.01 a share in terms of additional interest cost to the quarter. So, that’s the $0.05 that’s included in the roadmap.

My point is that they are just a bit less important than at other times, because we have a number of unusual factors, certainly first time that we’ve seen in this magnitude and I have been doing this for 26 years to see the homeownership rates fall at this rate and to see the positive benefits of demographics, both of which are creating demand at the expense of for sale market. So, those are pretty unusual conditions and those are happening at a time when there is an unprecedented reduction in the supply, which therefore will say less demand is going to be required to generate an equal amount of revenue growth to get that supply.
So, the point in my comment is just really to try to focus such that for so many years we’ve all been singularly focused on new job growth, job growth creates demand for rental housing, end of the discussion. It’s a little bit more complicated and positive this time around because of those other factors. If you just try to quantify it, if the homeownership rate does go to the, call it 64, that’s 3.5 million additional renters, about 700,000 a year, and then that’s total.
That’s big chunk of those new rent single family homes, but a component of them 40% or so are renting apartments. So that can be as much as a couple of hundred thousand a year. That’s real demand. I mean that’s the amount of demand we typically see in a good year, up from significant job growth. So it’s just that number of factors happening at the same time, which are causing our reliance on jobs to be a little less important than in prior times.

That range is high as the low double-digits in places like the West Coast, Northern California and Seattle. So I believe we can get back to those prior peaks.

In the first quarter of this year, we basically went to flat and in the second quarter we got to a loss to lease, approaching about 7%.
So, when you couple that with what Tim explained, which is that in July, our rollover rents which again are blending the new move-ins and renewals at 5.5% plus our occupancy being stable, there is some running room and I will give you even a little more insight. When we look out to the offers that we put out for renewals in August and September, there was one out in the 6%, 6.5%. Now these aren’t secured and there could be some erosion, but I would tell you that while we are getting pushback we are making a lot of progress, turnover is staying in line, we’re converting leases and we feel pretty good about the direction of our revenue.

The number that we’ve commented on before and the number that we used as a sort of a guide post is around mid-teens that if we grew it from the tenants they’re around 15% of equity capitalization in terms of dollars underway. That wouldn’t cause us much concern.
If we got higher than that it would for some of the reasons that we previously commented on in terms of just starting to put constrain on balance sheet metrics, whether it’d be debt to EBITDA, debt to service coverage, but also just organizational stress as well.

Honestly, head to head, West Coast had a bigger fall and I just think there is the anticipation that it's going to have a bigger run and it has just historically been much more volatile.

If I look out even to 2012 or ‘13, it’s 5% earnings yield.

In terms of cost of capital that’s a long debate and when we sell and asset and we’re raising equity through be selling an asset, we don’t think of leaving the initial yield, we think of what’s the unlevered IRR so to re-buy that asset, and similarly when you issue equity, you are asking for long-term cost of that equity capital. So there are short-term costs of capital or long-term costs of capital. We’re not necessarily focused on next year’s earnings, but creating value over a long period of time.
So, I think, in terms of the rationale that you’ve point to, I think it’s pretty challenging to say that you can have it permanently de-lever the balance sheet because this is a living-breathing open-ended perpetual life vehicle and always going to be making capital choices depending on what the sources are at, capital is and how we’re going to allocate the capital. In terms of additional equity issuances that profit kind of thing you can speak to, all as we can say is that the GDP program was authorized at $400 million and we’ve completed that.

Homeownership rate, yes, it benefits us but it’s a sign of weakness in the housing market and we sense the housing market gets even weaker, it’s drag on the economy.
So, either it’s clearly another sign to each action of the coin, but on balance the weakness in the for-sale market, does have a positive impact on our market where it does not in other elements of the economy, and that’s one of the things we’re just trying to highlight is that for years they were stealing share and now we’re able to steal some share. Fundamentally job growth and improving economy job growth is going to be key to income growth which is going to be key at this, certainly for corporate America to expand as you pointed out, or just for consumers willingness to spend.

With me on the call today are Tim Naughton, our President; Leo Horey, our EVP of Operations; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. And Tim and I will share some prepared remarks and then all four of us will be available to answer any questions you may have today.
In our remarks, I'll be highlighting our results for the quarter and we'll be discussing our outlook for the second half of the year as well as some thoughts on 2011 and 2012. Tim will be addressing both our portfolio performance and our investment activity.
Now for the quarter, we reported EPS of $0.61 and FFO per common share of $1.04. Both the EPS and FFO were above the updated financial outlook that we provided in early June, due primarily to better-than-expected performance on the expense side, most of which is timing-related.
Our revenue performance both on a year-over-year and sequential basis continued to show significant improvement. Our same-store sales portfolio showed sequential revenue growth of 1.3% for the quarter with four of our six regions showing positive growth.
This is our first quarterly sequential growth in over a year and a half and is consistent with our recently updated financial outlook. In January, when we gave our original guidance, we stated that we expected 2010 to be a year of transition, one where we would see improvement in jobs, public fundamentals and same-store sales performance. In June, we released an updated outlook raising our estimates of 2010 revenue, NOI and FFO performance in response to the significant improvement we're seeing in our portfolio.
Our second quarter results and early third quarter metrics continued to substantiate the improving fundamentals and allow us to reaffirm the financial outlook that we provided in early June. So what's driving this improvement? There's a number of factors which can be grouped to the four product categories: First, an improving, albeit, bumpy economic recovery; second, a weak for-sale housing market, which is resulting in a declining homeownership rate; third, demographics that will continue to benefit rental demand; and finally, a significant reduction in the delivery of new apartments. I want to touch on a few of these factors.
First, on the economy, the economy continues to grow yet the pace of growth slows during the second quarter. And it's not unusual for an economic recovery to be bumpy during the first few quarters past an inflection point and this recovery is no exception. This uneven recovery is likely to continue through the rest of the year with moderate growth in both GDP and job gains. Job gains in both year-to-date and for the full year is expected to average about 100,000 a month, which is a welcome change to the average of over 400,000 jobs per month lost last year, but still not strong enough to bring the unemployment rate down. It will likely be into 2011 before we begin to see the positive effect of the current trends of rising corporate profits, low interest rates and improved access to credit, as these hopefully begin to translate into rising business and consumer confidence and ultimately, stronger private sector hiring.
Turning to the housing market. I think it's fair to overemphasize the positive impact of the weak for-sale housing market, has and will likely continue to happen at rental market. The homeownership rates fell again during the second quarter and is now just below 6% to 7%, the lowest rate in over 10 years. This decline is in spite the positive effect of the Federal homebuying tax credit which was still available during the second quarter. The effects of the tax credit to homeownership rate would undoubtedly have fallen further. And many would-be buyers remain in the sidelines because of appropriately titled lending requirements here as home prices may continue to fall and continued uncertainty over the strengths of the economic recovery. 
A recent article in Barrons provided a forecast that the homeownership rate would likely drop to 64% by 2015, a level similar to what we experienced within a 35-year period from the only 1960s to the mid-1990s. Another article earlier this week suggested the homeownership rate could fall to as low in 62%.                                                          Assuming the rate falls to just 64%, would create an additional 3.5 million renter households during the next five years or about 700,000 per year from the Established alone. Now our jobs have been and will continue to be an important driver for apartment demand, slightly the changes in the for-sale market may have an even larger impact than job growth on the strength of the apartment market in the coming years.
Finally, let me touch on new supply. The multi-family rental starts so far 2010 are running at an annual rate of about 70,000 for the year. This level of production is only about a third of historical average and is partially equal to the annual loss due to obsolescence. Given that there was a similarly modest level of apartment starts in the second half of '09, it would be the equivalent of net zero deliveries of new multi-family product in '11 and '12. While we're beginning to see the benefit of reduction in supply this year, the real benefit will be over the next few years. So whether it's a modestly improving economy, a falling homeownership rate, positive demographics or an anemic level of new products, it's hard not to get positive about the impact on rental fundamentals, both this year but increasingly so for 2011, 2012.
But before I pass it to Tim, I wanted to touch briefly on our activity under our CEP or Continuous Equity Program. As we outlined in last evening's earnings release, we raised partially $210 million during the quarter and an average price of just over $100 a share. The program has been in place since August of last year and we now have raised the full $400 million authorized on this program.
Our selection of capital market options over the last couple years underscores the financial flexibility afforded by the strong balance sheet, flexibility that we used during the financial crisis of late '08 and early of '09. Now during that period we issued over $2 billion of debt at an average rate of 5.2%. We awarded issuing equity at particularly low prices. The last time we have raised equity was in early 2007. The $400 million of equity raised for the fall of '09 helps to further strengthen in what is arguably is the strongest balance sheet in the sector and positions us well to take advantage of emerging growth opportunity.
I would now pass it to Tim who will provide you some additional color on our operating and investment activity. Tim?"

I'll focus my remarks on a couple of areas, as you mentioned. First, I'll provide some additional color on: Portfolio performance in apartment market conditions; and second, all the steps in investment activity, highlighting what we're seeing in the transaction market and our outlook on new development.
Starting with operations, through July, we're tracking with the mid-year guidance we issued in early June. As Bryce mentioned, second quarter sequential same-store revenue growth was 1.3%. The increase was driven by improvement on the East Coast as sequential same-store revenues were around 2% higher than the East and roughly flat in the West. The improvement performance was largely the result of rental rate growth as same-store rental rates were up 0.9% from the previous quarter.
Rental rate growth has been an area of focus for us over the last several months as demand-supply fundamentals has turned in the favor of the landlord. During the second quarter, changes in year-over-year rents for those units with expiring leases, which includes renewals and new move-ins, accelerated from just under 1% in April to around 4.5% in June. The trend is positive for both renewals and new move-ins as renewals were up around 4% and new move-ins increased by over 5% in June. These trends continued into July as renewals and new move-ins were up around 5.5% year-over-year. So overall, we've seen dramatic improvement in renewal and new move-in rent growth in our portfolio with the blended growth rate having increased almost 500 basis points since March alone.
The trend of rent strength positive is broad-based across the portfolio. In June and July, all 16 of our March experienced year-over-year growth in rollover rents, which we defined as the point of average of renewals and new move-ins. As of July, the strongest growth occurred in the metro of New York, New Jersey regions where rollover rents were up by more than 7% and where new move-ins rents increased by more than 10% in some of our communities. This region had experienced the most dramatic turnaround in our portfolio as the New York Metro areas are beginning to benefit from job growth that began to materialize in the first half of the year.
The Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northern California regions all saw solid gains as well, with rollover rents increasing by more than 5% in each of these regions in July. The DC market, which has been the most stable during the downturn has recovered at a steadier pace, while Northern California and New England have accelerated more sharply. The last regions to recover, Seattle and Southern California are currently experiencing rollover rent increases of around to 3.5% and 2%, respectively.
While we're continuing to focus on growing the top line through rental rate growth, we are keeping an eye on occupancy and availability trends as well. As we tested rents across our markets, we've been willing to tolerate some additional vacancy. And in fact, economic occupancy has drifted lower since April within the mid- to high-95% range. Given seasonal traffic patterns though, we believe that mid-year is the optimal time to press risk in the portfolio, often to the point of refusal on markets.
This brings in some loss on occupancy mid-year with some of the opportunity to adjust our pricing strategy before the lowest traffic even sets in. We'll continue to actively manage the portfolio, seeking the pattern of pricing strategy that optimizes the relationships between rent and inventory levels. While fundamentals have shifted decidedly in favor of rental housing, we understand that there are some impacted by broader economic trends, which as we've seen can be uneven and choppy. The maintaining of flexible posture of discrepancy or operating strategies in response to shifts in the environment will be critical to optimizing performance.
I want to shift now to investment activity starting with an overview of the transaction market and our outlook for acquisitions and disposition. As asset values have increased, we've started to see a pickup in market activity. For transactions currently being priced, the range appear to be around to 5%, ranging from mid-4% to 5% on the West Coast and low to mid-5% on the East Coast. Combined with a more positive outlook for NOI growth, asset values are below 20% in the trough but still around 15% off the peak. Although many others are still reluctant to sell at current pricing levels, there are a growing number willing to sell some assets in an effort to either diversify their holdings or resolve a pending issue with near-term maturing debt. Pricing is reported solid and good activity remains robust as the demand for institutional product is outserving supply.
Given these market conditions, sellers are beginning to take larger, more complex offerings in marketing, something that buyers after time can tell if the rift is growing. Recently, there have been a number of $100 million-plus transactions started by sellers, including a 2,500-unit portfolio in DC area. This past quarter, we sold one asset, Avalon, on the town of the New Rochelle for $108 million. This is the first base of a thousand-unit community where we still have approximately 600 apartments, and the second base and continue to manage the first base provider. This transaction was initiated late last year we did in April and was done in part to trim our exposure to this one sub-market. We completed $190 million in dispositions for the second quarter and don't see this space selling any more assets in 2010. 
In terms of acquisitions, we didn't close on any community this past quarter, while we currently have around $200 million under contract and in due diligence. All these will be acquired for our second investment management fund. While the investment market is competitive, we continue to look for deals that we believe provides unique opportunities for growth due to the competitive position in the market through our ability to reposition them through our redevelopment and asset management capabilities.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on new development. This last quarter, we didn't start or complete any new development. However, in July, we did start three new deals, somewhere in around $100 million. And for the year have now started over $200 million in new development. As outlined in our revised outlook, we expect to start around $600 million by year end, which represents a $200 million increase over our original outlook.
The predicted yield for the current development portfolio was down this past quarter and is now projected at 5.7%. This is the result of the beginning of leases for three communities that really started in 2008 while opening rents were up by almost 10% from initial pro forma. As you recall, we don't adjust projected rents until the beginning of lease subs. And for these three communities, declines in the opening lease sub-rents are consistent with portfolio management in these market since the start of construction. Importantly, these three leads of communities are the last of a 2008 start, for those deals that started before the rental market correction of 2009. In other words, each of the community in this current development portfolio reflects rents that are essentially been marked-to-market, with market conditions now improving across the board, we expect the performance of this portfolio to improve.
In addition, the range of 2010 starts represents some of the more attractive deals in our development pipeline with projected yields in 7%-plus range which will further enhance the economics in this portfolio. The effective rates is now in the 5% range, new development in general, is accretive on an NAV and earnings basis and when you combine improving market fundamentals with cyclically run construction and capital cost, new development is particularly compelling at this point in the cycle. In addition to starting new deals, we are aggressively working to replenish the pipeline. Many developers and lenders are just starting to cross as to resolving some of their land positioning. In addition, some land developers are beginning to market new opportunities. For example, we recently signed an LOI with Federal Realty to develop a multi-family component of their mixed use assembly road project in Boston.
We believe that we are uniquely positioned to secure market opportunities like these. We have a long track record that provides confidence to landowners in our ability to perform, the current liquidity and balance sheet to fund new opportunities, and finally, the existing development and construction platform to execute them. Building the pipeline will continue to be an area of high focus for the balance of the year as we ramp up this important part of our business. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bryce for some closing comments."

And certainly, we're pleased to see the expected improvement in fundamentals translate to tangible improvement in our portfolio. The positive sequential revenue growth, with new move-in rent and renewal rent both now at 85%, it's clear that we've reached an inflection point in terms of our portfolio performance which positions us well to stronger performance in '11. 
Across a number of dimensions, I feel we're positioned well to take advantage of emerging growth opportunities: First, our portfolio with strong occupancies and accelerating rental rates; secondly, through the reinvestment activity, in the acquisition side through our second investment management fund, gives an additional $600 million of buying capacity. And then on development side, we have a $3 billion pipeline of communities either in planning or under construction.
And finally, our balance sheet is inarguably the strongest in the sector with low leverage and excellent liquidity. So we're very optimistic regarding the next few years, both as to the attractiveness of rental fundamentals, but equally importantly our ability to capitalize on those opportunities. 
Lisa, that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll be glad to open it up for questions."

So I feel pretty good about the push we've made, specifically the new move-ins rents, we've held a conversion ratio in that low- to mid-30% range which we always look for.

At best, that's the principal explanation for that. In terms of the overall $0.05 -- it's in the roadmap on Page 3 of the press release, it consists of a number of things. Let's start with the section for funds. That increase of about $0.02 and a $0.05 is related to increased credit enhancement fees for a couple of taxes and bond deals. And these are liquidity facilities that expired and then were repriced. And in that repricing, I think it reflects what we're seeing in the market in general and that is we -- the current store has come up for renewal. They're being priced at a higher rate than the legacy liquidity facility. And then secondly, this is a market that's probably further away from recovery than other credit markets. So the tactics in bond margin is specifically the credit enhancement market has been a little slower to recover than some of the other markets. Some of the other components to that interest include an anticipated increase in work order rates which may or may not occur. And that's about a thing you share. If short-term interest rates remain where they are, in say, roughly 20 basis points, you can see that we continued that increase as we are anticipating.

There is no question these jobs are critically important, so I guess I misinterpret my comments on that. My point is that they're just a bit less important than at other times because we have a number of unusual factors. Certainly, the first time that we've seen it with this magnitude that we've been doing this, I've been doing this for 26 years. To see the homeownership rates fall at this rate and to see the positive benefits of demographics, both of which are creating demand at the expense of for sale markets. So those are pretty unusual vision. And those are happening at a time when there's an unprecedented reduction in the supply. Which therefore we'd say, less demand can be required to generate an equal amount of revenue growth to get that supply. So the point of my comment is just to really try to focus that for so many years, we've all been singularly focused on new job growths. Job growths creates demand for rental housing, end of the discussion. It's a little bit more complicated and positive this time around because of those other factors. And if you just kind of quantify it, if you have -- some homeownership really does go to the, call it 54, that's 3.5 million additional renters of 700,000 a year, typically. And then that's total. Big chunk of those dual rent single-family homes, but a component of them, 40% or so are running apartment. So that can be as much of a couple hundred thousand year. That's real demand. I mean that's the amount of demand that we typically seen a good year from us from a significant job growth. So it's just all number of factors happening at the same time, which are causing on reliance on job to be of little less important than in prior times."

It's something we watch very carefully and the strength of our balance sheet has been, and we believe will continue to be one of the key attributes of the company.

When you add in the additional starts we've talked about, and then you take off some of the completions. That basically is starting to be about 10% of total equity capitalization, rough numbers. In '07, that number was just probably as high as 20%. And then when we made the comment recently that we probably were a little out over our skis at that level. The number that we have comment on before, and the number that we used as sort of a guide post is around mid-teens. And if we grew it from the 10% into around 15% of equity capitalization in terms of dollars underway, that wouldn't cause as much concern. If we got higher than that, it would. For some other reasons that we've previously commented on in terms of just starting to put constrain on balance sheet metrics, whether it be adjusted EBITDA or debt service coverage. But also just organizational stress as well. That's so fast that you can grow an organization. So long story short, in robust '10, we got as high as 20 and we could see it returning kind of into the mid-teens."

I think it's a stress to say because of the ATM or as we thought CEP. In terms of the cost of capital, that's a long debate and I think you're using some short-term measure that when we saw an asset and we're raising equity to be selling an asset, we don't think of losing the initial yield, we think of what's the unlevered IRR so to rebuy that asset. And similarly, when you issue equity, you have to think the long-term cost of that equity capital. So there are short-term cost of capital, and long-term cost of capital. We're not necessarily focused on next year's earnings, but creating value over a long period of time. So I think in terms of the rationale that you point to, I think it's pretty challenging the say that you can never permanently delever the balance sheet because this is a living-breathing, open-ended perpetual life vehicle and I'm always going to be making capital choices depending on what the sources are at, capital is and how are we going to allocate the capital. In terms of additional equity issuance is that it's not the kind of thing we can speak to. All we can say is that the CEP program was authorized with $400 million and we completed that.

Downtown is probably the most stable area. As you know we just started to deal there, Queen Anne. And that market is in the best balance and performing the best."

And we are seeing construction cost, we believe bottomed right now. They probably bottomed in around, somewhere between 20% to 25% from peak levels. Peak levels would have been in 2008, sometime. So with construction typically about 60%, 65% of your capitalization, then those were down 20%, 25%, you kind of do the math, 12% to 15% of the improvement in the economics is coming from construction. In terms of land, it's really a case-by-case basis. At some deals, were option that we were able to renegotiate with the land owner. Others are deals that are more recent and then repriced them. And I'd say the deals that we've repriced are year, a year and a half those are probably down in the order of 30% to 50% in terms of land basis. But it makes up a lot less if your total economics, obviously, at roughly 15% to 20% in total capitalization. And then we're saving some of our soft cost as well as you get it with a capitalized interest, given interest rates or architecture and engineering fees given the slowdown in the broader markets, we're benefiting there also."

With me on the call today are Tim Naughton, our President; Leo Horey, our EVP of Operations; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. And Tim and I will share some prepared remarks and then all four of us will be available to answer any questions you may have today.
In our remarks, I'll be highlighting our results for the quarter and we'll be discussing our outlook for the second half of the year as well as some thoughts on 2011 and 2012. Tim will be addressing both our portfolio performance and our investment activity.
Now for the quarter, we reported EPS of $0.61 and FFO per common share of $1.04. Both the EPS and FFO were above the updated financial outlook that we provided in early June, due primarily to better-than-expected performance on the expense side, most of which is timing-related.
Our revenue performance both on a year-over-year and sequential basis continued to show significant improvement. Our same-store sales portfolio showed sequential revenue growth of 1.3% for the quarter with four of our six regions showing positive growth.
This is our first quarterly sequential growth in over a year and a half and is consistent with our recently updated financial outlook. In January, when we gave our original guidance, we stated that we expected 2010 to be a year of transition, one where we would see improvement in jobs, public fundamentals and same-store sales performance. In June, we released an updated outlook raising our estimates of 2010 revenue, NOI and FFO performance in response to the significant improvement we're seeing in our portfolio.
Our second quarter results and early third quarter metrics continued to substantiate the improving fundamentals and allow us to reaffirm the financial outlook that we provided in early June. So what's driving this improvement? There's a number of factors which can be grouped to the four product categories: First, an improving, albeit, bumpy economic recovery; second, a weak for-sale housing market, which is resulting in a declining homeownership rate; third, demographics that will continue to benefit rental demand; and finally, a significant reduction in the delivery of new apartments. I want to touch on a few of these factors.
First, on the economy, the economy continues to grow yet the pace of growth slows during the second quarter. And it's not unusual for an economic recovery to be bumpy during the first few quarters past an inflection point and this recovery is no exception. This uneven recovery is likely to continue through the rest of the year with moderate growth in both GDP and job gains. Job gains in both year-to-date and for the full year is expected to average about 100,000 a month, which is a welcome change to the average of over 400,000 jobs per month lost last year, but still not strong enough to bring the unemployment rate down. It will likely be into 2011 before we begin to see the positive effect of the current trends of rising corporate profits, low interest rates and improved access to credit, as these hopefully begin to translate into rising business and consumer confidence and ultimately, stronger private sector hiring.
Turning to the housing market. I think it's fair to overemphasize the positive impact of the weak for-sale housing market, has and will likely continue to happen at rental market. The homeownership rates fell again during the second quarter and is now just below 6% to 7%, the lowest rate in over 10 years. This decline is in spite the positive effect of the Federal homebuying tax credit which was still available during the second quarter. The effects of the tax credit to homeownership rate would undoubtedly have fallen further. And many would-be buyers remain in the sidelines because of appropriately titled lending requirements here as home prices may continue to fall and continued uncertainty over the strengths of the economic recovery. 
A recent article in Barrons provided a forecast that the homeownership rate would likely drop to 64% by 2015, a level similar to what we experienced within a 35-year period from the only 1960s to the mid-1990s. Another article earlier this week suggested the homeownership rate could fall to as low in 62%.                                                          Assuming the rate falls to just 64%, would create an additional 3.5 million renter households during the next five years or about 700,000 per year from the Established alone. Now our jobs have been and will continue to be an important driver for apartment demand, slightly the changes in the for-sale market may have an even larger impact than job growth on the strength of the apartment market in the coming years.
Finally, let me touch on new supply. The multi-family rental starts so far 2010 are running at an annual rate of about 70,000 for the year. This level of production is only about a third of historical average and is partially equal to the annual loss due to obsolescence. Given that there was a similarly modest level of apartment starts in the second half of '09, it would be the equivalent of net zero deliveries of new multi-family product in '11 and '12. While we're beginning to see the benefit of reduction in supply this year, the real benefit will be over the next few years. So whether it's a modestly improving economy, a falling homeownership rate, positive demographics or an anemic level of new products, it's hard not to get positive about the impact on rental fundamentals, both this year but increasingly so for 2011, 2012.
But before I pass it to Tim, I wanted to touch briefly on our activity under our CEP or Continuous Equity Program. As we outlined in last evening's earnings release, we raised partially $210 million during the quarter and an average price of just over $100 a share. The program has been in place since August of last year and we now have raised the full $400 million authorized on this program.
Our selection of capital market options over the last couple years underscores the financial flexibility afforded by the strong balance sheet, flexibility that we used during the financial crisis of late '08 and early of '09. Now during that period we issued over $2 billion of debt at an average rate of 5.2%. We awarded issuing equity at particularly low prices. The last time we have raised equity was in early 2007. The $400 million of equity raised for the fall of '09 helps to further strengthen in what is arguably is the strongest balance sheet in the sector and positions us well to take advantage of emerging growth opportunity.
I would now pass it to Tim who will provide you some additional color on our operating and investment activity. Tim?"

I'll focus my remarks on a couple of areas, as you mentioned. First, I'll provide some additional color on: Portfolio performance in apartment market conditions; and second, all the steps in investment activity, highlighting what we're seeing in the transaction market and our outlook on new development.
Starting with operations, through July, we're tracking with the mid-year guidance we issued in early June. As Bryce mentioned, second quarter sequential same-store revenue growth was 1.3%. The increase was driven by improvement on the East Coast as sequential same-store revenues were around 2% higher than the East and roughly flat in the West. The improvement performance was largely the result of rental rate growth as same-store rental rates were up 0.9% from the previous quarter.
Rental rate growth has been an area of focus for us over the last several months as demand-supply fundamentals has turned in the favor of the landlord. During the second quarter, changes in year-over-year rents for those units with expiring leases, which includes renewals and new move-ins, accelerated from just under 1% in April to around 4.5% in June. The trend is positive for both renewals and new move-ins as renewals were up around 4% and new move-ins increased by over 5% in June. These trends continued into July as renewals and new move-ins were up around 5.5% year-over-year. So overall, we've seen dramatic improvement in renewal and new move-in rent growth in our portfolio with the blended growth rate having increased almost 500 basis points since March alone.
The trend of rent strength positive is broad-based across the portfolio. In June and July, all 16 of our March experienced year-over-year growth in rollover rents, which we defined as the point of average of renewals and new move-ins. As of July, the strongest growth occurred in the metro of New York, New Jersey regions where rollover rents were up by more than 7% and where new move-ins rents increased by more than 10% in some of our communities. This region had experienced the most dramatic turnaround in our portfolio as the New York Metro areas are beginning to benefit from job growth that began to materialize in the first half of the year.
The Mid-Atlantic, New England and Northern California regions all saw solid gains as well, with rollover rents increasing by more than 5% in each of these regions in July. The DC market, which has been the most stable during the downturn has recovered at a steadier pace, while Northern California and New England have accelerated more sharply. The last regions to recover, Seattle and Southern California are currently experiencing rollover rent increases of around to 3.5% and 2%, respectively.
While we're continuing to focus on growing the top line through rental rate growth, we are keeping an eye on occupancy and availability trends as well. As we tested rents across our markets, we've been willing to tolerate some additional vacancy. And in fact, economic occupancy has drifted lower since April within the mid- to high-95% range. Given seasonal traffic patterns though, we believe that mid-year is the optimal time to press risk in the portfolio, often to the point of refusal on markets.
This brings in some loss on occupancy mid-year with some of the opportunity to adjust our pricing strategy before the lowest traffic even sets in. We'll continue to actively manage the portfolio, seeking the pattern of pricing strategy that optimizes the relationships between rent and inventory levels. While fundamentals have shifted decidedly in favor of rental housing, we understand that there are some impacted by broader economic trends, which as we've seen can be uneven and choppy. The maintaining of flexible posture of discrepancy or operating strategies in response to shifts in the environment will be critical to optimizing performance.
I want to shift now to investment activity starting with an overview of the transaction market and our outlook for acquisitions and disposition. As asset values have increased, we've started to see a pickup in market activity. For transactions currently being priced, the range appear to be around to 5%, ranging from mid-4% to 5% on the West Coast and low to mid-5% on the East Coast. Combined with a more positive outlook for NOI growth, asset values are below 20% in the trough but still around 15% off the peak. Although many others are still reluctant to sell at current pricing levels, there are a growing number willing to sell some assets in an effort to either diversify their holdings or resolve a pending issue with near-term maturing debt. Pricing is reported solid and good activity remains robust as the demand for institutional product is outserving supply.
Given these market conditions, sellers are beginning to take larger, more complex offerings in marketing, something that buyers after time can tell if the rift is growing. Recently, there have been a number of $100 million-plus transactions started by sellers, including a 2,500-unit portfolio in DC area. This past quarter, we sold one asset, Avalon, on the town of the New Rochelle for $108 million. This is the first base of a thousand-unit community where we still have approximately 600 apartments, and the second base and continue to manage the first base provider. This transaction was initiated late last year we did in April and was done in part to trim our exposure to this one sub-market. We completed $190 million in dispositions for the second quarter and don't see this space selling any more assets in 2010. 
In terms of acquisitions, we didn't close on any community this past quarter, while we currently have around $200 million under contract and in due diligence. All these will be acquired for our second investment management fund. While the investment market is competitive, we continue to look for deals that we believe provides unique opportunities for growth due to the competitive position in the market through our ability to reposition them through our redevelopment and asset management capabilities.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on new development. This last quarter, we didn't start or complete any new development. However, in July, we did start three new deals, somewhere in around $100 million. And for the year have now started over $200 million in new development. As outlined in our revised outlook, we expect to start around $600 million by year end, which represents a $200 million increase over our original outlook.
The predicted yield for the current development portfolio was down this past quarter and is now projected at 5.7%. This is the result of the beginning of leases for three communities that really started in 2008 while opening rents were up by almost 10% from initial pro forma. As you recall, we don't adjust projected rents until the beginning of lease subs. And for these three communities, declines in the opening lease sub-rents are consistent with portfolio management in these market since the start of construction. Importantly, these three leads of communities are the last of a 2008 start, for those deals that started before the rental market correction of 2009. In other words, each of the community in this current development portfolio reflects rents that are essentially been marked-to-market, with market conditions now improving across the board, we expect the performance of this portfolio to improve.
In addition, the range of 2010 starts represents some of the more attractive deals in our development pipeline with projected yields in 7%-plus range which will further enhance the economics in this portfolio. The effective rates is now in the 5% range, new development in general, is accretive on an NAV and earnings basis and when you combine improving market fundamentals with cyclically run construction and capital cost, new development is particularly compelling at this point in the cycle. In addition to starting new deals, we are aggressively working to replenish the pipeline. Many developers and lenders are just starting to cross as to resolving some of their land positioning. In addition, some land developers are beginning to market new opportunities. For example, we recently signed an LOI with Federal Realty to develop a multi-family component of their mixed use assembly road project in Boston.
We believe that we are uniquely positioned to secure market opportunities like these. We have a long track record that provides confidence to landowners in our ability to perform, the current liquidity and balance sheet to fund new opportunities, and finally, the existing development and construction platform to execute them. Building the pipeline will continue to be an area of high focus for the balance of the year as we ramp up this important part of our business. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bryce for some closing comments."

And certainly, we're pleased to see the expected improvement in fundamentals translate to tangible improvement in our portfolio. The positive sequential revenue growth, with new move-in rent and renewal rent both now at 85%, it's clear that we've reached an inflection point in terms of our portfolio performance which positions us well to stronger performance in '11. 
Across a number of dimensions, I feel we're positioned well to take advantage of emerging growth opportunities: First, our portfolio with strong occupancies and accelerating rental rates; secondly, through the reinvestment activity, in the acquisition side through our second investment management fund, gives an additional $600 million of buying capacity. And then on development side, we have a $3 billion pipeline of communities either in planning or under construction.
And finally, our balance sheet is inarguably the strongest in the sector with low leverage and excellent liquidity. So we're very optimistic regarding the next few years, both as to the attractiveness of rental fundamentals, but equally importantly our ability to capitalize on those opportunities. 
Lisa, that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll be glad to open it up for questions."

Obviously, after erasing nearly $2 billion of debt in '08 and '09, it's time to restore the balance sheet partially and add the equity which is what we did. So I think as you're trying to project out our sources and uses of capital and how we might source that capital so we can get an equity, I think you have look at a 35% to 40% leverage ratio. You kind of triangulate on that."

And if we weren't receiving pushbacks in any market right now, I'd be concerned because when I talked last quarter in my prepared remarks about the fact that we would expect occupancy in September, where it's come off it wasn't the right time to do it instead. So we're getting pushbacks everywhere. If I was to give you some comfort, my hope it will be that even looking to August, that occupancy seems to be sustained. So I feel pretty good about the push we've made, specifically the new move-ins rents, we've held a conversion ratio in that low- to mid-30% range which we always look for. And in our turnover, as you saw for the second quarter was substantially below the same period the previous year. And in July, that turnover is remaining in the high single digits, lower than the previous year.

At best, that's the principal explanation for that. In terms of the overall $0.05 -- it's in the roadmap on Page 3 of the press release, it consists of a number of things. Let's start with the section for funds. That increase of about $0.02 and a $0.05 is related to increased credit enhancement fees for a couple of taxes and bond deals. And these are liquidity facilities that expired and then were repriced. And in that repricing, I think it reflects what we're seeing in the market in general and that is we -- the current store has come up for renewal. They're being priced at a higher rate than the legacy liquidity facility. And then secondly, this is a market that's probably further away from recovery than other credit markets. So the tactics in bond margin is specifically the credit enhancement market has been a little slower to recover than some of the other markets. Some of the other components to that interest include an anticipated increase in work order rates which may or may not occur. And that's about a thing you share. If short-term interest rates remain where they are, in say, roughly 20 basis points, you can see that we continued that increase as we are anticipating. Some of the other aspects of the $0.05 of the decrease in the cap rate interest that we already discussed, the $0.02, an anomaly in the quarter that we actually have an extra day in the quarter, which is throwing off share in terms of additional interest cost for the quarter.

So the point of my comment is just to really try to focus that for so many years, we've all been singularly focused on new job growths. Job growths creates demand for rental housing, end of the discussion. It's a little bit more complicated and positive this time around because of those other factors. And if you just kind of quantify it, if you have -- some homeownership really does go to the, call it 54, that's 3.5 million additional renters of 700,000 a year, typically. And then that's total. Big chunk of those dual rent single-family homes, but a component of them, 40% or so are running apartment. So that can be as much of a couple hundred thousand year. That's real demand. I mean that's the amount of demand that we typically seen a good year from us from a significant job growth. So it's just all number of factors happening at the same time, which are causing on reliance on job to be of little less important than in prior times."

That can range as high as the low-double digits in places like the West Coast, Northern California, Seattle. So I believe we can get back to those prior peaks. I believe that directionally we're moving now. To give you some perspective, in the fourth quarter we had, basically a gain to lease in our portfolio. In the first quarter of this year, we basically went flat and in the second quarter, we got to a loss, the lease approaching about 7%. So when you couple that with what Tim explained, which is the debt in July on rollover rent, which again are blending for new moving and renewals at 5.5%. Plus our occupancy being stable, the additional running room, and I'll give you even a little more insight. When we look out to the offers that we put out the renewals in August and September, those went out in the 6.5%. Now those aren't secured and there could be some erosion, but I'll tell you that while we're getting push back, we are making a lot of progress, turnover staying in line, we're converting leases and we feel pretty good about the direction of our revenue."

It's something we watch very carefully and the strength of our balance sheet has been, and we believe will continue to be one of the key attributes of the company.

The number that we have comment on before, and the number that we used as sort of a guide post is around mid-teens.

I'm curious as you think about bigger picture from a capital structure, we're sitting here with an AFFO earnings yield on 2011 earnings, at least on our numbers of 3.7%. If I look out even to 2012 or '13, it's 5% earnings yield. So you can effectively, and you just did I think rightly so, issue equity to lower cost than where you can issue debt.

I think it's a stress to say because of the ATM or as we thought CEP. In terms of the cost of capital, that's a long debate and I think you're using some short-term measure that when we saw an asset and we're raising equity to be selling an asset, we don't think of losing the initial yield, we think of what's the unlevered IRR so to rebuy that asset. And similarly, when you issue equity, you have to think the long-term cost of that equity capital. So there are short-term cost of capital, and long-term cost of capital. We're not necessarily focused on next year's earnings, but creating value over a long period of time. So I think in terms of the rationale that you point to, I think it's pretty challenging the say that you can never permanently delever the balance sheet because this is a living-breathing, open-ended perpetual life vehicle and I'm always going to be making capital choices depending on what the sources are at, capital is and how are we going to allocate the capital. In terms of additional equity issuance is that it's not the kind of thing we can speak to. All we can say is that the CEP program was authorized with $400 million and we completed that.

And we are seeing construction cost, we believe bottomed right now. They probably bottomed in around, somewhere between 20% to 25% from peak levels. Peak levels would have been in 2008, sometime. So with construction typically about 60%, 65% of your capitalization, then those were down 20%, 25%, you kind of do the math, 12% to 15% of the improvement in the economics is coming from construction. In terms of land, it's really a case-by-case basis. At some deals, were option that we were able to renegotiate with the land owner. Others are deals that are more recent and then repriced them. And I'd say the deals that we've repriced are year, a year and a half those are probably down in the order of 30% to 50% in terms of land basis. But it makes up a lot less if your total economics, obviously, at roughly 15% to 20% in total capitalization. And then we're saving some of our soft cost as well as you get it with a capitalized interest, given interest rates or architecture and engineering fees given the slowdown in the broader markets, we're benefiting there also."

On the call today are, Tim Naughton our President; Tom Sargeant our Chief Financial Officer; and Leo Horey, our EVP of operations. Tim and I will share the prepared remarks and all four of us will be available for Q&A.
I’ll be addressing our quarterly results and then comment briefing on market fundamentals and trends in our portfolio, while Tim will provide some additional comments on our portfolio and then will be highlighting on investing activity during the quarter.
Despite concerns regarding the pace of the economic recovery, apartment fundamentals continue to improve in our markets. This continued strength led to stronger than expected results with regard to our portfolio performance and an active quarter with regard to our level of investment activity.
For the quarter EPS was $0.29 and FFO was $0.98, both above the range we’ve previously provided. These results were driven by better than expected revenue performance and savings and interest expense, which is partially offset by higher than expected property level expenses.
For our same-store sale portfolio, year-over-year revenues increased modestly. The first year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter ‘08 and sequentially, revenues increased at a rate similar to what we saw in the second quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we expect the rate of sequential revenue growth to be roughly similar to what we saw this quarter and year-over-year revenue to continue with positive trend.
As a reminder, our year-over-year revenue trended from negative 4% in the first quarter to about negative 2% in the second, with modestly positive this quarter and we expect it to be up around 3% in the fourth quarter.
Based upon the better than expected quarterly performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have raised our full year outlook for FFO by $0.07 from the prior outlook in early June.
While the drivers of recovery in the apartment sector is fairly well understood by now, a few points are worth nothing. First, with regard to jobs, while private sector jobs growth remains weak, it is positive and with job growth there is disproportionately few, the younger age cohorts.
The pace of hiring among young adults goes under 30 has reportedly added strongest pace since the mid 80s. As this age group tends to be primarily runners, it does explain some of the unbundling the apartment sector is benefiting from. While the absorption of apartments during the first half of this year was at its highest in over 15 years.
Second, the declining homeownership rate which has been helping rental demand. Not surprisingly, in our portfolio we saw the percentage of move-outs due to home purchase drop to about 14% during the quarter.
Despite improved home affordability, this is at the very low end of the range of our historical experience and reflects continued weakness in for-sale segment, and the elimination of the homebuyer tax credit, which artificially stimulated demand in the first half of the year.
Third is demographics. Our sector continues to benefit from improving demographics as a result of the influx of the echo boomer segment. Today, there are now more U.S. residents aged 15 to 29 than 30 to 45 year olds. This is a significant change and the trend will become even more pronounced over the next five years.
Finally and, perhaps most importantly, is supply, where we’re just beginning to see the benefits of a sharp reduction. Over the last 10 years, the U.S. has added in average of about 225,000 new multifamily units per year.
This year that number will be less than half or about 100,000 units. 2011, the number completions were expected to fall again to about 70,000 units. This will be the lowest level of multifamily completion in the last 50 years.
Based upon the strength and demand combined with the sharp reductions in supply, we are projecting demand-supply rates in our markets over the next two years to be similar to what we experienced in the 2005 and 2006 time period, which is a period of strong rental growth.
With that I’ll turn it over to Tim, who’ll expand on the portfolio performance and highlight our activity for the quarter. Tim?

I’ll focus my remarks in a couple of areas. Now, first, I’ll provide some additional color on the portfolio performance in Q3, and secondly, I’ll discuss investment activity where new starts and acquisitions totaled around $1.5 billion this past quarter.
Starting with operations, portfolio performance continued to show steady improvement in Q3 and is tracking above the revised outlook we issued in June. Second quarter sequential same-store revenue growth was 1.1%, driven by an improvement in rental rates of 1.8%, which was twice the rate we experienced in Q2.
The sequential improvement in rental rates was widespread as five of our six regions posted sequential rental rate growth of at least 1.7%. During the third quarter, increases in rents for those units with expiring lease, which includes renewals and new move-ins averaged 5% to 5.5%. Renewals were up by almost 6%, while new move-ins increased by over 4% during the quarter.
As we discussed last quarter, our focus is on pushing rents even at the expense of additional vacancy. While we did consciously trade some occupancy for rent growth during the peak leasing season, by September Economic Occupancy was back up over 96%. As a result, the portfolio is well positioned headed into the slower, winter leasing season.
Looking at portfolio performance on a year-over-year basis, same-store revenues increased by 0.2%, the first year-over-year increase after six quarters of negative comps.
It’s interesting to point out that this downturn has been about half the duration of that experience early in the decade, despite having loss roughly three times the number of jobs during this past recession. The relative brevity of this correction is evidence of how housing demand has shifted in favor of rental housing over the last two to three years.
The improved year-over-year performance was driven by the East Coast, which experienced same-store revenue growth of 1.5% to 2%. We expect same-store revenues to continue to improve next quarter, as Bryce mentioned, with year-over-year growth projected to be around 3%, providing solid momentum heading into 2011.
I want to shift now to investment activity starting with new development, where we started five new communities this quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we believe it is a particularly attractive time to start new development. As apartment markets are recovering at the same time, we’re seeing cyclically low construction and capital cost.
The five deals started in Q3 totaled $232 million and have an average projected initial yield of around $7.5%. Three are located in the Northeast, while the other two are located in the Seattle market and four to five starts are second phases of existing communities.
These starts are wood-frame construction, where cost have fallen more than concrete construction over the last two years, given the slowdown in single-family housing during this period. Perhaps, most notable is the start of Avalon Green II, the second phase of an existing community in Greenburgh, New York where we just received building permits after 17 years of pursuit.
Our mainstay for many years on attachment 12, which is a schedule of development rights, we’re happy to see Avalon Green II following move up to attachment 9 the schedule of development communities. Perhaps most remarkable, though, is that we were able to option this land for 17 years that happen to close before construction.
Avalon Green in many ways has reminded us some of the unique requirements of developing in our markets, including the value of staying power and outlasting regulatory roadblocks, legal challenges and market downturns.
In Q4, we expect to start approximately $300 million, which should bring our total level of starts to over $600 million for the year, which is in line with our revised midyear outlook. With the addition of five new communities this past quarter, the average projected yield for the current development portfolio now stands at 6%, which represents an increase of 30 basis points from last quarter.
The development portfolio currently contains 12 communities, four of which were started in 2007 and 2008 were prior to the economic downturn and ensuing apartment market correction.
The projected yield of the overall development portfolio will continue to be burdened by these legacy deals until they are completed over the next two to three quarters. However, as these deals are completed and newer deals with initial projected yields of 6.5% to 7.5% added to the pipeline, the average projected yield should continue to improve over next few quarters.
In addition to new development, we’re getting more active in area of redevelopments. In Q3, we started one redevelopment and expect to start three more next quarter.
Currently, we have seven communities in redevelopment, where we’re investing on average of around $10 million per community to improve the competitive positioning of the assets in their respective submarkets...
Capital programs generally include modernizing kitchens and baths as well as renovating many of the amenity spaces and common areas. The community we started this quarter, Avalon at Decoverly is a good example of this kind of redevelopment where we’re upgrading the clubhouse and amenities as well as the apartments, with apartment renovation is being done on occupied units.
As rental fundamentals improved in the early part of the expansion phase of cycle, we think it’s a good time to invest in our portfolio through redevelopment. We’re also investing capital in number of other communities where the capital program is focused on merchandize the elements for the community such as the clubhouse, models and landscaping. On an average, we’re spending around $1.5 million per community to freshen up the cover few of these assets.
Lastly, I want to comment briefly on the transaction market in acquisition activity, transaction activity has picked up since early in the year with many of the trades in our markets concentrated in D.C. metro and Southern California and to a lesser extent in New York.
Northern California is relatively quiet as owners are reluctant to sell there, while the Northeast and Seattle are experiencing modest activity. National transaction volume is projected to be more than two times 2009, but still figures to be off longer term averages by 50% or so.
Pricing continues to reflect the limited level of transactions coming to market, as cap rates have dropped in the lower to mid floors in California, below fives in the East Coast and asset pricing is now back to then around 10% of peak levels.
This past quarter we acquired three communities totaling $240 million. The communities are located in D.C., Baltimore and Orange County markets. Two to three communities are large B, B+ quality assets costing around $100 million each and had been extensively renovated by the previous owner.
We’ve found the relative market pricing for these larger repositioned assets to offer more compelling values than many of the smaller newer core deals being marketed.
These kinds of deals often don’t fit neatly into strategies of core or value add investors and usually too large for smaller apartment owners who may be more value-oriented. Operating investments were brought for the investment management funds, where we have a 31% total investment.
In summary, the third quarter was an active quarter for us on the investment front. As we began to take advantage of the opportunities we’ve been positioning the Company for over the last couple of years, a period when we focused on restoring liquidity, strengthening the balance sheet, re-working and advancing the development and redevelopment pipelines and lastly, positioning our investment platforms to be active in the early part of the cycle.
We’re optimistic about the near and intermediate term outlook for apartment fundamentals a period of time in which we believe our markets are poised to significant outperform long-term trends, which should translate into strong portfolio performance.
With that, I’ll turn it back over to Bryce for some closing comments.

With respect to our balance sheet, we have nothing outstanding on our $1 billion line of credit. We recently raised 400 million of equity under our Continuous Equity Program. We’ve an additional approximately $600 million of purchasing capacity through our investment management fund.
We’ve about $400 million of cash on the balance sheet and our balance sheet metrics continue to be among the strongest in the REIT sector providing us with significant financial flexibility to fund future growth.
In short, we enjoy strong and prudent fundamentals, attractive investment opportunities and a balance sheet to prudently fund that growth.
Finally, I wanted to remind you about our upcoming Investor Day on November 17 and 18, beginning with dinner on the 17 following NAREIT. On the morning of 18, Mark Zandi will be joining us to provide his view of the economic recovery, which I think will be particularly timely coming on the heels of next week’s mid-term elections.
We’ll also have a number of presentations by senior management, which will be focusing on the growth drivers in our business and we’ll be sharing with you some early thoughts regarding our expectations for 2011.
Many of you have already responded and we’re expecting a great turnout. So for those of you who have not yet responded we look to hear from you soon.
With that said, that concludes our remarks. We’ll be glad to answer any questions.

In terms of more offensive opportunities where you’re actually enhancing and you’re probably really changing the competitive positioning of an asset in the market. Yes, typically we’re going to look for north of 10% return on enhancements in order for it to be compelling. I guess the other thing I’d say about it is, you think about in terms of total valuation, the fact that we’re repositioning asset, we’d say that we’d expect the underlying cash flows to grow faster just meeting maybe a deeper niche in the market and therefore might affect the excess cap rate, if you will. So we think there is both an initial return component as well as maybe a longer return in the form of higher cash flows and perhaps a lower residual cap rates.

I just want to clarify one thing, though, when you mention 1.8% sequential revenue growth, it is dependent upon the level of turnover and you have a lot less turnover in Q4 than you do in Q3. You can only increase rents on the units that are having expiring leases, and I think you have roughly two-thirds the level of expiring leases in Q4 than you do in Q3. Again, it’s a slower leasing fees and so even if we are pushing rates at the same rate, you’d only end up with 1-2 just to put some math to it, just make sure people understand sort of how that math works, if you will.

And then background of just the whole political debate, about a balanced housing policy, certainly, I think if you were nothing more over the last few years, over the past few years, has been that try to artificially stimulate single family demand if you are losing cost. So, I’d like to think that our policymakers won’t do anything that is going to artificially stimulate the housing demand; unless it’s on devices, it’s hard to be particularly optimistic about it, at least over the next year.

So that reflect market pricing is probably about six months old now, Andy. I believe census are more of mid-fives in terms of initial cap rate and in terms of projected unlevered IRRs and more in the mid-eights. If those are being re-priced today, those numbers would slide a bit. I suspect just based upon what’s happened in the market over the last six months.
But in terms of initial yields cap rates sort of mid-fives in terms of getting to the 8.5, there would be some above trend growth over the next few years, probably have compound annual growth rates in the mid-to-high threes and on the order of 100, 125 basis points of reversion on cap rate on the exit to get to your mid-eight type unlevered IRR.

In no markets are they ramping up on a collective basis, certainly some trades or commodities are, but overall we’re not seeing that yet. In fact, as you may have noticed on our development community schedule we reflected about another $3 million in savings this quarter just from cost savings of communities underway.
In terms of peak-to-trough, peak was probably first beginning above eight and since that time we’re seeing pricing on garden communities or wood-frame communities down 20% to 25% on hard press and high rise by 15% to 20% because of the nature of the different trades there, union versus nonunion principally.
