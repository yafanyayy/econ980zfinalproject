With me on the call today in addition to Amanda, we have David Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer.  During today’s call I would like to highlight our business performance for the year, provide highlights for the quarter and touch upon our 2010 guidance.  Dave will then discuss details of our financial results.  After Dave’s remarks we will take your questions both from the phone lines and via text on our webcast.
This morning we reported our full year 2009 adjusted earnings per share of $1.44.  This figure excludes a number of items which we highlighted in our press release.  This modest growth in 2009 profit in a very challenging economic environment was a result of stabilizing input costs and benefits generated from the tremendous work and sacrifice by our employees worldwide.  Looking back at the year we initially laid out a number of strategic and operational goals which allowed us to maintain a balanced approach through the recession.
These included staying focused on the customer, making sure we keep the innovation pipeline flowing, capitalizing on growth in the emerging markets, investing in our core and driving efficiency and productivity.  I am pleased to report that we exceeded our targets in many areas. For example, we broaden our customer base this year as we expanded our solutions in to new regions.  We also continued to expand our presence in existing applications with the strong value propositions and solutions we offer.  
We launched over 25 new solutions this year including our first integrated packaging software solution branded PakFormance which allows customers to track yield and productivity on their packaging equipment, our new CT301 shrink film which represents a breakthrough manufacturing technology that produces measurably thinner films that offer the same, if not better performance than thicker films thereby providing a positive environmental story to our customers.  
We also expanded our portfolio with products using recycled content including our new Ethafoam HRC which contains a minimum of 65% recycled plastic with little change in the performance characteristics which we are making especially for one computer customer in the Southwest.  
Looking to developing regions, we believe that our platform investments position us well to capture the higher rate of recovery coming from these regions in 2010 and beyond.  We saw this in the fourth quarter in particular where we experienced a 12% constant dollar sales increase in the brick countries of the world.  We also saw a 7% constant dollar sales increase in the developing regions overall.  This growth expanded our developing region sales to 17% of our consolidated revenue mix for the full year up from 16% last year.  This continues the long term expansion of our international sales mix which we expect to continue to outpace advanced regions in the years ahead.
Our global footprint is expected to be a meaningful contributor to our growth and profitability going forward.  As the US and European economies experience below average growth as they gradually recover from the recession and adjust for lower consumer spending as a percentage of GDP, the emerging markets and developing economies of the world will grow faster and our global presence in those markets will be a benefit to our growth. 
In conjunction with our GMS programs which contributed $20 million of incremental benefit this year we continued to invest in the growth of our core business by upgrading key technologies and expanding product lines in higher growth regions.  We also saw $40 million in benefit from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and continued to gain new efficiencies from the deployment of our global SAP system which will drive benefits for us in the years ahead.  All of these efforts contributed to a 320 basis point increase in gross margin to 28.7% and a 340 basis point increase in our operating margin to 11.6% in the year and getting close to that 30% gross profit in the fourth quarter.  Dave will speak to these in more detail in a few minutes.
Our margin growth especially stands out when looking at this year’s top line sales performance.  Sales declined 7% on a constant dollar basis which primarily reflects an 8% decline in volumes and relatively flat pricing.  As we have highlighted all year, volumes were most impacted in our industrial business while our positions in food and medical held relatively steady.  Looking at price mix we were able to maintain a $21 million price mix spread for the year as food packaging prices offset some selective price declines in our protective packaging business.
As I believe that our fourth quarter momentum is setting the pace for us in 2010, I’d like to highlight a few items in our largest segments before I discuss our 2010 guidance.  In the quarter we saw a 4% sequential sales increase which excludes foreign exchange.  This increase was led by food packaging with a 6% increase and protective packaging with a 4% increase.  Both of these increases reflect seasonal upticks although the seasonal increase in protective packaging was lower than what we would normally see outside of the recession environment.  This growth combined with the benefits of our various programs and stable input costs helped expand margins in the quarter and we reported a $0.40 adjusted EPS.  
Looking at our food packaging business, although we did see strong sequential sales in the quarter, we did experience a 3% volume decline on a year-over-year basis.  This volume decline was largely due to ongoing weak equipment sales due to the economy and primarily in Europe.  On a strong note we saw solid sales growth in our product serving beef and pork applications and we were able to broaden our customer relationships in the Americas and Europe.  
In Latin America, strong domestic consumption of beef in Brazil and in Argentina drove solid sales growth in that region.  This effectively jump started double digit sales growth in Brazil and in Argentina, that country saw their highest beef per capita consumption rate in the last 15 years.  
Lastly, we launched a number of new products in the fourth quarter.  These included two new automated loaders and our new deli snap tray which is on leading retailer shelves today and we expect more retail debuts to occur in 2010.  We’re expecting these same product trends to continue in 2010 and we expect our efforts will be supported by steady fresh red meat production and growing export levels.  
Food solution sales continue to track sequentially flat in the fourth quarter although we did see 5% lower volumes on a year-over-year basis.  This decline is primarily due to lower sales to the food service sector which continues to see record low traffic in restaurants and record lower sales in 2009.  On a positive note, we are pleased with the momentum we’ve started to build in North America with retailers around our new Mirabella case ready format, our Darfresh solution and new versions of our Simple Steps ready meal products. 
In Europe we are pleased with the acceleration of our case ready sales in Russia and the new placements of our Darfresh solution, both good signs of positive momentum going in to 2010.  As we’re also anticipating a slightly recovery in the restaurant and food service sector in the second half of 2010 we expect to start seeing an increased interest in equipment placements in that segment as well.  
Finally, the protective packaging segment experienced its best year-over-year 2009 performance in the fourth quarter with volumes down a modest 3% lower in the quarter.  We still have yet to lap last year’s sales but we do see our performance tracking to proxies and feel that our modest 4% sequential uptick due to seasonality may also be in line.  In the quarter we did see a pace of recovery in the brick regions that was equal or higher than in North America validating our reasons for the global footprint that the company has.
This was especially true in our shrink film business which saw positive year-over-year growth in Asia in the quarter due to both a pickup of export activity but also to the successful launch of our new CT-301 technology.  The success of CT-301 was also seen in Mexico where that product has quickly grown.
During the quarter we had a very strong launch of five new protective products at the Pack Expo Show in October.  These solutions have been very well received and we are enthusiastic about the potential for these systems to positively impact our business over the next few years.  As such, we’re expecting an ongoing modest rate of recovery to continue in 2010 with stronger recoveries occurring in our regions outside of the United States and Western Europe.  
With the success in the businesses, we entered 2010 with good momentum, strong focus, leaner cost structure and a positive attitude ready to capture the opportunities that arrive from the economic recovery.  As such, we are guiding a full year EPS range of $1.48 to $1.68 or $1.50 to $1.70 if adjusted to exclude the $0.02 we expect to incur relating to the final stages of our GMS program in 2010.
As we stated in our press release we are assuming a modest recovery with constant dollar sales growth between 4% and 6%.  We are also assuming that we may face an average mid single digit increase in resin prices during the year.  For foreign currency translations we have assumed the US dollar averages $1.43 per euro for the full year.  We have outlined a number of more mechanical assumptions that tie to our guidance range in our press release which I will not repeat here out of interest for time.
I would like to remind everyone that in 2010 our fully diluted share count is expected to be 176.2 million shares.  Additionally, our current guidance does not factor in the payment of the W.R. Grace settlement as the exact timing of the settlement is still unknown.  However, the interest expense associated with the principle payment currently equates to approximately $0.01 per share of EPS on monthly basis.   As such, we will update our guidance once we have more definitive information on the Grace settlement.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details on our financial performance and our liquidity situation.
"
382724,84104025,46738,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2010",2010-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","As our financial statements present, sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion.  Gross profit for the quarter increased 8% or $26 million to $334 million.  Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $12 million, gross profit would have increased 5%",1133,"As our financial statements present, sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion.  Gross profit for the quarter increased 8% or $26 million to $334 million.  Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $12 million, gross profit would have increased 5%.  Our food packaging and protective packaging segments both increased gross profit $13 million compared to last year.  This improvement was despite lower sales volume as we benefited approximately $20 million from lower resin costs and benefitted approximately $10 million from our global manufacturing strategy or GMS and from our 2008 cost reduction program.
Fourth quarter marketing, administrative and development expenses for the first time this year were higher than the comparable quarter in 2008.  This $32 million increase was largely due to a $30 million increase in incentive compensation.  Approximately one half of this amount was in the form of non-cash long term stock-based compensation related to the achievement of 2009 performance goals.  Our 2009 proxy statement explains in detail how these performance based awards are structured.  
Operating expenses were also impacted by $7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations.  Partially offsetting these amounts were benefits of approximately $5 million from our 2008 cost reduction program and from lower travel and entertainment expenses.  Operating profit was $128 million or 11.2% of revenue after adjusting for $5 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $9 million of GMS restructuring and non-recurring items.  
Another useful metric to measure operating performance is adjusted EBITDA which was 17% of net sales in the quarter compared to 15% last year.  Our calculation is shown in the supplementary information furnished with our financial statements.  We were able to achieve this increased level of adjusted EBITDA despite lower sales, the cost of the benefits from lower resin prices and the cost savings accomplished in 2009.  
Interest expense increased by $9 million in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting additional interest of $16 million in the fourth quarter on two first half note issuances.  The 12% notes issued in February 2009 and the 7 7/8ths note issued in June 2009.  Partially offsetting the additional interest expense was a reduction of $8 million resulting from the maturity of our 6.95% note in May 2009 and the redemption of our 3% convertible notes in July 2009.  
Looking ahead to 2010, we are expecting interest expense to be approximately $160 million.  This amount reflects a full year of accrued interest on the W.R. Grace settlement.  There is still no date certain for the funding of the settlement however, if we were to fund the settlement on June 30th we would expect our interest expense to be approximately $20 million less or $140 million for the full year.  
Other income increased by $13 million in 2009 as compared to 2008.  This increase is primarily attributable to a foreign currency exchange gain related to the repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2009.  Next, I’d like to summarize the cost and benefits of two of our key programs.  First, the cost reduction in productivity program we announced in July 2008, reduced employment by approximately 900 positions or 5% of our workforce from the June 30, 2008 levels.  We realized approximately $40 million of incremental savings in 2009 and $55 million overall from this program.  These savings were split almost equally between cost of sales and operating expenses.  
From a cash flow perspective we made cash payments of approximately $37 million in 2009 primarily for termination benefits.  We expect to make the remaining payments totaling $7 million by the end of the second quarter of 2010.  Substantially all of the 2009 and 2010 payments were charged to earnings in 2008.
Second, we recorded charges of $16 million in 2009 related to the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy.  These charges were split almost equally between our cost of sales and restructuring charges.  Our incremental benefit for the full year was approximately $20 million and we remain on track to realize additional incremental benefit of $10 million in 2010.  This would bring our cumulative benefit to $55 million in 2010 and thereafter in line with our expectations when we introduced this program in 2006 with its focus on adding capacity in emerging markets.
I’ll conclude with some key balance sheet and cash flow items.  Our receivables declined $16 million from December 31, 2008.  Excluding $25 million of foreign currency translation and excluding the repurchase of $80 million of receivables included in our receivables securitization facility in December 2008, receivables would have decreased $121 million or 16%.  We did not utilize our accounts receivable securitization facility in the fourth quarter of 2009.  
We continue to be focused on our credit and collection efforts in the current economic environment and to date we have not experienced any material deterioration in our accounts receivable portfolio.  As evidence of the diligence of our collection team, our days sales outstanding were five days lower at December 31, 2009 than at December 31, 2008.
Inventory investment at December 31st declined $95 million during the year.  Excluding $22 million of foreign currency translation, inventory would have declined $117 million on a constant dollar basis during the year.  This continues to be a coordinated effort involving sales, supply chain and customer service with support from finance and information systems.  Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents at December 31st was $966 million down $382 million or 28% from the end of December 2008.  This decrease is attributable to the record free cash flow we generated this year.
At December 31st we had $695 million in cash and cash equivalents.  In addition, we continued to have access to nearly $700 million of committed borrowing capacity.  Free cash flow, one of our key metrics as a management team gets close attention.  As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, we generated a record $500 million of free cash flow in 2009 compared to $253 million last year.  On a constant dollar basis reduced investment in both accounts receivable and inventory contributed to our impressive year-to-date free cash flow performance.
Capital investment in 2009 was lower than in recent years as work was largely completed on the three new plants we opened in emerging markets as part of our GMS program.  Our total capital investment in 2010 as Bill indicated is expected to be in the range of $80 to $100 million to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects.  This level of investment is consistent with our spending before commencing our GMS investments in 2006. 
Finally, our current available liquidity and projected free cash flow positions us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W.R. Grace settlement should it become payable in the next 12 months.  Now, I’ll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.

I would expect that in 2010 we will see some recovery in our protective business.  You can see that protective really declined relative to food in the 2009 period primarily due to the impact of the economy on the industrial sector.  As 2010 recovers even though it may be a gradual recovery, as I said during my prepared comments, we’re continuing to see sequential growth in the protective side of the business.  The CT-301 which also serves the industrial sector has got a great cost benefit environmental study so I do see protective coming back up to more its historical percentage of the company.
As I said also that geographically I fully expect that the US economy will painfully adjust to consumer spending dropping from 70% of GDP down to something in the high 60s and that will result in I think faster growth outside the US which we’ve seen in the fourth quarter.  The fourth quarter numbers I felt were very impressive outside of the US with double digit growth in the emerging markets.  
If I look at products within the groups that may diverge regionally or in total I’d say the CT-301 is probably a positive one because it’s got a cost benefit environmental green story and it is also a new patented technology which should give us a leading position for a fair amount of time.  The other one is the Ethafoam business which really is depending on more the tech sector and the computer sector and that probably will not come back as quickly although I’m hopeful.  I do think the Ethafoam HRC to the extent that we can over a 65% plus recycled product with both the performance of Ethafoam type products with the cost and environmental benefits of being made from high recycled content, I’m optimistic that will turn upward a little more than we may have in our plan.
The other one that’s running a little differently is the food service sector which is really in our food solutions business.  That one has challenges in consumers eating out, getting back to the habits of eating out.  I watched the news this morning at the gym how one family was preparing their dinner meals for eight years ahead of time so they could manage their budget and eat out less but that would be the only product that may diverge from my overall outlook.

That suffers from two factors, one is the capacity in the marketplace and the other is a lot of the end use markets are under pressure so that’s the combination.
You do see a little bit of pressure on the mailer side but some of the things we are doing there to offset that are quite attractive.  That’s overall and I’d say it depends probably Europe is the most competitive, US is probably second and the rest of the world probably tails off after that.

Customer investments in food packaging equipment it’s an economic cycle issue.  The countries where we have seen relatively large investments are basically Spain has been a big investor over the years and has dropped off quite significantly as unemployment in Spain has hit 18%.  But, it’s a little bit better in the fourth quarter it was down about 12% and I think as confidence returns customers will be more inclined to invest.  I think the equipment cycle and our food customer bases have very similar equipment cycle in most industries.  In good economies people are confident to invest, in bad economies people are cautious.

There are two things in depreciation and amortization, there’s the traditional depreciation of our plant and equipment which I think was around $155 million in ’09 and we expect to climb to about $160 million in 2010.  The other item that gets reported there is the amortization of our stock awards which are non-cash award so it doesn’t get treated in the normal expense categories but rather gets treated as an amortization amount and we have split that out separately in the supplementary information to our financial statements.  
The number in 2009 I believe was around $38 million and we’ve rounded that off to $40 million in thinking about what it might be next year.  So we don’t see a big change up or down in that expense next year.  That is really what is driving the fourth quarter increase in our SG&A spending because that D&A line is consolidated in to our total SG&A spend.

I do think that the European cost structure in general tends to be higher and you’re absolutely right there are things we can do.  For example, one of the GMS programs which we announced in the fourth quarter was reducing production at one of our facilities in Germany where we’re able now to produce that product for other parts of the world at a lower cost.  So we are doing that.
I think also Dave may have mentioned earlier in 2009 that we had a European optimization program.  We were looking at the various components of our cost structure in Europe particularly a term we call cost to serve.  That is in progress on its way and that will bring our European cost structure more in line.  You do have the ongoing challenges, there are 14 countries and each has their own accounting system and tax system so you do have to work your way around what is perhaps maybe a less efficient system in other parts of the world where you can reach large population groups with one structure.

The first question is in the press release we note there is a $200 million reduction in resin costs in 2009, is this total year-over-year decline or the effect of cost decline due to lower prices?  If the former, how much resin cost reduction is due to price versus volume?  
I’ll try to be as simplistic as I can here.  The $200 million is on a price per pound basis and that is assuming constant volumes so that would be the price per pound, that would be the price variance.  Actually offsetting that was about $140 million impact due to lower volumes so essentially lower volumes absorbed a fair amount of the price impact on resin.  
Let me go to the next question, in 2009 Sealed Air achieved a 12% adjusted operating margin.  Do I see the company being able to achieve 15% target?  It is our target, it is our management target and we definitely are committed to achieving it and 2012 is a reasonable number if modest economic growth prevails over this period would be the caveat.  
The last question on the Internet is can I discuss our medical strategy at this time and comment on our progress and outlook for the growth of this business in China and the Far East specifically?  Our medical business is progressing well.  We are in the process of renewing our import license in China.  We are reasonably confident that we’ll get that approval.  We know it could be a disruption in our supply chain should there be any delays in that but we are hopeful and we should know something there by the end of the first quarter early second quarter.
We have actually seen 21% growth in our medical business in Asia in the fourth quarter.  The Far East specifically, we’re beginning to reach customers in India and other parts of Asia so we are really looking to grow where the healthcare systems are improving and as people’s standards of living improve there’s more focus on healthcare.  That’s kind of a quick summary of what our strategy is on Asia for the medical business.
Let’s go back we have two more questions on the telephone.  Let’s try to cover those quickly and conclude our call thereafter.

I think you mentioned that the effect of volume in 2009 was something like $140 million and if I do some rough math on what you said the volume change was in ’09 that would suggest a decremental margin of at least 30% perhaps closer to 40%.  This year as we look out to 2010 and look at the implied guidance, it seems like you’re using more like a 20% perhaps even lower amount of incremental margin off your core revenue forecast.  Are the international regions that much lower margin wise in terms of incremental?  Because if all you are doing is eating in to excess capacity I would think that frankly the margin would be higher.  
That’s question one and question two, currently we are going through a process here in the states with US red meat consumption being flat to down.  It is to be expected at some point we would hope that that will recover.  Do you think that the fact that herd sizes are still declining might affect a recovery in consumption in red meat any time in the next couple of years or do you think that will be a secondary consideration?

The second item is that when we made the delta between the 2008 and 2009 incentive compensation food solutions was one of the businesses that was affected by that compared to the other businesses.  They were allocated to all of the businesses but particularly it’s a component of that one. 
The third is that the food solutions business has got several hundred million dollars of outsourced trades that go in to our case ready business and that’s always a catch up since we’re buying product and the price formulas there tend to lack a quarter.  So food solutions overall though less I paint too rosy of a picture, I think it’s got a very, very positive outlook but it really is focused on the restaurant trade and the food service trade which has been disproportionally impacted by the consumer’s not eating out as much and scaling back their consumption of kind of convenient and easy to eat and purchased foods for eating outside the home.  So the outside the home component is probably as much of an impact as anything else.

I am Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today in addition to Amanda, we have Dave Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer.
During today’s call, I will be highlighting our business performance for the first quarter. Dave will then discuss details of our financial results. After Dave’s remarks, we will take your questions both from the phone lines and via text on our webcast.
This morning, we reported a 9% increase in our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.36. This figure excludes a $0.01 charge related to our global manufacturing strategy program, which we highlighted in our press release this morning. 
We are pleased with our earnings growth as we recognize that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery and we are managing through higher resin prices both on a prior year and a sequential basis.
Additionally, we generated comparable gross and operating profit margin versus last year. We achieved this to the benefits of not only favorable foreign exchange translation, but of higher volumes in new and existing products, strong growth in developing regions, stringent controls on operating expenses, and productivity improvements, which offset both on favorable resin costs and price mix.
Looking at the top line, first quarter sales increased 1% on a constant dollar basis. However, volume growth was a major contributor which increased 4% overall, largely driven by 8% increase in our protective packaging segment in North America, a 4% increase in our food packaging segment in North America, and a 10% increase in Latin America in food packaging as well.
Across all of our businesses, volume growth improved through the course of the quarter ending with solid March results. For example, using our protective packaging business, our sales in January were 99.6% of January 2009 as we still had not crossed the breakeven line in our recovery of the decline in sales from last year. February sales were a 103% of the comparable month into 2009 and March sales were 109% of comparable sales in March 2009. 
We announced a price increase to be effective April 1st, so we didn’t wonder whether some of the March increase resulted from the price increase. And we look at our April sales month to date and we are tracking a 108% of April 2009. And I am pleased to say that we were expecting this type of trending to continue for the rest of the year.
Looking at volume trends in more detail, food packaging volumes increased 2%, largely driven by the 4% increase in North America and a 10% increase in Latin America that I previously mentioned. Our performance in both of these regions was above local animal production rates due to incremental volumes from new and existing customers and from new product expansion.
In North America, most products benefited from positive volume growth. And interestingly, the primary volume driver was a 43% increase in equipment as customers started to reinvest in replacement equipment during the first quarter.
Western European volumes remained weak due to prolonged economic weakness and very low consumer confidence levels. But on a bright note, we did see ongoing growth in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, where we achieved double-digit volume increases.
Food solutions had similar regional results led by a 6% increase in North America due to strong poultry case ready sales and ongoing product expansion, including a new star fresh film for fresh fish which was launched at a large multinational retailer in the first quarter.
Additionally, food solutions had an 18% increase in the Asia-Pacific region due largely to growth in case ready and ready meals. Like our food packaging business, the food solutions team deserved the onset of recovery in all the regions, except Western Europe, where conditions remained weak. We did see strength in developing regions, again with very solid sales growth of greater than 50% in Russia due to strong case ready program in that country.
Our vertical pouch packaging sales increased 2% which included 4% of favorable foreign exchange. On a constant dollar basis, vertical pouch packaging sales held relatively flat in North America and Latin America as we expanded into bakery and deli applications, while the restaurant industry starts to stabilize and recover.
Before I touch upon our protected packaging results, I would like to mention that our food businesses continue to be recognized for their innovation that targets measurable value for customers and consumers.
In the quarter, the 2010 Flexible Packaging Association Achievement Award recognized our marinated on-demand package with the highest achievement award and the Gold Flexible Packaging Achievement Award for Technical Innovation. This marks the second consecutive year that our Cryovac brand has received this award.
Additionally, the team earned the Food Processing Magazine Readers’ highest accolade for the seventh consecutive year and they were awarded the Readers’ Choice Award as the Gold Supplier of Packaging Materials.
Moving onto the protective packaging segment, this business drew more than half of the volume growth in the quarter, largely benefiting from improving economic conditions. When looking at their 8% volume growth versus the prior year, I am pleased to report that volumes were up in all regions, including 8% in North America, 3% in Europe, and double-digit increases in the developing regions with 10% growth in Latin America and 25% growth in Asia Pacific, where the modest recovery of export market and the manufacturing sector in countries like Mexico contributed to the increase.
Volumes were also driven by good buy-in of our new products including the new CT-301 Shrink Film and our new paper base PackTiger Solution, FasFil. I should also note that although it’s anecdotal, one our Midwest sales reps mentioned to me that he has noticed fuller parking lots at some manufacturing customers in the Midwest. He is having a harder time finding a parking space which indicates a real sense of pickup in that region which is also very encouraging for the economy.
And in maintaining the pace for continued growth to protect the packaging launched Recycled Content Bubble Wrap, which uses a minimum of 50% pre-consumer recycle content. This product now offers the highest minimum recycle content for air, cellular cushioning products on the market. 
Although, we usually don't talk about equipments separately, investors usually ask us about equipment trends as an indicator of future outlook and of customer confidence. Our numbers for the first quarter are good. Equipment sales are up approximately 14% in the first quarter over a very low first quarter 2009. Also, equipment backlog that is orders for equipment not yet built and shipped is up 90% from the depths of the recession at the end of the first quarter of 2009.
Looking at consolidated price mix, we did see a $27 million or 3% decline in the quarter versus the prior year, which impacted all reportable areas. As we mentioned in our press release, price mix reflected the lag timing of food packaging contract price adjustments and a challenging year-over-year comparison.
In most of our businesses the first quarter 2010 selling prices reflected lower late 2009 resin cost. This compares to first quarter 2009 selling prices which were higher reflected late 2008 peak risen prices. As resin prices rose again in the first quarter of 2010, our businesses quickly responded by announcing various price increases in North America and Europe, as well as targeted price increases in other parts of the world. These price increases focused on recovering the additional resin cost that we incurred and varied from 4% to 9% depending on the product and the region.
Most of these price increases generally went into effect on April 1st and we expect to start seeing the benefits by the end of the second quarter 2010. 
To wrap up before I hand the call to Dave, I would like to reaffirm our EPS guidance for the full year, which is $1.48 to $1.68 per share on a reported basis or $1.50 a share to $1.70 a share if adjusted to exclude a $0.02 charge related to our global manufacturing strategy program.
As we navigate through the second quarter, we are continuing to show goods sales momentum and are benefiting from volume gains and a leaner cost structure. Combined with the expected future benefit of resin cost recovery, seasonality, the ongoing adoption of new products by our customers, the incremental volume that we have recently signed on, and our investments in growth, we continue to feel positively about the year ahead.
As such, we continue to expect the full-year average constant dollar sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% of which volume will be the primary driver. Our release outlines our updated assumptions for resin cost increases. But as we noted, we feel that we are able to offset these increases with the benefits I noted a moment ago. Of course, volume and raw material price fluctuations are the primary factors that will influence how we perform within our range. 
And now, I am going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave?

Gross profit for the quarter increased 5% or $14 million to $300 million. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $14 million, gross profit would have been flat compared with 2009. 
In the quarter, we experienced the positive impact of a $42 million increase in volumes across all of our reporting segments along with an estimated $15 million of benefits from supply chain productivity improvements including $2 million of incremental benefit from GMS like sourcing volumes from lower cost facilities in our developing regions. The offsets were in approximate $30 million increase in resin costs and an unfavorable price mix of $27 million. As Bill just noted, we faced a challenging year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. Both list price increases and formula price adjustments are amongst the actions to offset these higher resin costs. 
First quarter marketing, administrative and development expenses increased to 6% or $9 million to $176 million. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $7 million, the expenses would have increased $2 million and remained flat as a percent of sales.
Operating profit was $124 million or 11.7% of revenue. After adjusting for $7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, operating profit would have been relatively flat compared with 2009. On a reportable segment basis, our protective packaging segment reported a 16% increase in operating profit as compared to prior year, which was offset by a combined 5% decline in operating profit in our food businesses.
Interest expense increased by $6 million in the quarter compared to 2009, reflecting additional interest of $11 million on two first half of 2009 note issuances. The 7-7/8% notes issued note issued in June 2009, which contributed to $8 million to the increase and the 12% notes issued in February 2009, which contributed $3 million. Partially offsetting this additional interest expense was the reduction of $6 million resulting from the redemption of our 3% convertible notes in July 2009, which contributed $4 million and the maturity of the 6.95% notes in May 2009, which contributed $2 million.
As mentioned on last quarter’s call, we are expecting interest expense to be approximately $160 million for the year. This amount reflects a full year of accrued interest related to the W. R. Grace Settlement. There is still no date certain for the funding of the settlement. However, if we were to fund the Grace Settlement on June 30th, we would expect our interest expense to be approximately $20 million less or an adjusted a $140 million for the full year.
Other income increased by $7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase includes net foreign currency exchange gains of $6 million, primarily resulting from the favorable impact of the strengthening of some foreign currencies when we remeasured our intra-company loans in our intra-company receivables and payables. As a reminder, the US dollar was very strong a year-ago attributable to the flight-to-safety in global currency markets. 
I will conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents declined $67 million in the first quarter to $628 million at March 31st. During the quarter, we repaid amounts outstanding on our European credit facility, paid our accrued 2009 annual incentive compensation, made an annual cash contribution to our profit sharing, and paid $19 million in dividend.
Our receivables declined to $25 million from December 31st, 2009. Excluding $3 million of foreign currency translation, receivables would have decreased $22 million or 16%. This decline was largely in Europe and North America primarily due to our normal first quarter sales seasonality. As the economy recovers, we are continuing to focus on our credit and collections efforts and have successfully maintained the quality of our global accounts receivable portfolio.
Inventory investment increased $33 million during the quarter with little impact of foreign currency translation. In the quarter, inventory levels were higher in North America and Europe mainly in our food businesses reflecting a buildup of inventories in anticipation of normal second quarter seasonality. Yet, net of cash and cash equivalents at March 31st was $955 million, down slightly from December 31st, 2009. Also at March 31st, we had no amounts outstanding under our global or European credit facilities or our accounts receivable securitization program. Our annual committed borrowing capacity was $750 million at March 31st. 
As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, we generated $97 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2010. This compares with a $160 million last year. The $63 million decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a decline in cash flow generated from working capital items. We still anticipate free cash flow to exceed $300 million this year.
Capital investment in the first quarter was $9 million lower than 2009 as work is largely completed on our three new plants opened in developing regions as part of our GMS program.
In today's press release, we did announce the investment in a new facility in Brazil for expanded capacity in that developing market. Approximately, $11 million for this investment will be included in our second quarter of 2010 capital investment. We anticipate additional modest investments next year and in 2012 related to this facility.
Our total capital investments for 2010 is still expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects. This range includes our recent investment in Brazil and is consistent with our annual investment before commencing our GMS projects in 2006.
Our current available liquidity and our rejected free cash flow positions us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W. R. Grace Settlement should have become payable in the next 12 months. 
And now, I will turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.

However hog markets has  cut back and is really down greater than 4% in the first quarter, and is expected to be down for the year 2010. Back to beef, we do see supply tightening in the second quarter but the second half of the year off to be better and I think the last numbers I saw for the full year were about 2%, 2.1% up on an annual basis. So that would suggest that the cattle market has a better second half, (inaudible) it will probably be lower for the year and primarily driving that as I understand the corn harvest quality has been poor with all the rains we’ve had and had some high moles, so it really is making the animals kind of lighter and taking them longer to get to the market.  
So that’s kind of a little bit of color on what’s happening on the herd sizes. As far as the case ready North America, the numbers are really up about, it’s about 2% overall down on a global basis but that’s really 3% up in North America. Europe is a soft spot, we’re really down high single digits and the European weakness goes across both food businesses. The North American case ready was up about 3%, primarily on the poultry side as I mentioned in my comments, Europe is down high single digits and that’s primarily in the Southern half of Europe where particularly Spain where we have a very large case ready customer at they are experiencing some of the problems that are happening in the Spanish market.  
We are seeing renewed interest in the US from some major retailers, not the major retailer that people think about but one of the second or third major retailers looking to do a new movement on case ready which we’re extremely positive about and should hit stores sometime in second quarter.

As you know from the call today, when we look at the cost side of things we are expecting resin cost to move up from that mid-single digit to the low-double digit range. The price increases that we spent some time talking about both in our prepared remarks and the Q&A are in place to get us back in line with our guidance expectations by the end of the year.  
So the - with those two big factors we are still in that range that we communicated in January. The other area where we’re seeing quite a bit of volatility that’s more in my backyard is foreign exchange while the Europe which we hung out there is toward the benchmark for our basket of currencies has clearly weekend against the dollar and based on the latest headlines may have further to go. The other currencies particularly in commodity and resource driven economies in many of the emerging markets have actually strengthened against the dollar more than we expected. So when we net those both out, we really are not seeing an overall impact much different than our original assumptions when it comes to currency.  
On the spending side through our fixed cost areas, we are continuing to maintain the discipline that we’ve had in prior years don’t see any change in our assumptions there, don’t see any change in our free cash flow assumption. We are right on target in the first quarter with our free cash flow generation to meet our goals exceeding $300 million for the year.

We are hopeful for a recovery in Europe. I would say coming, lagging behind the US and the emerging markets, but to be single-digit positive by the end of the year has contributed to our growth and that does Eastern Europe as part of Europe. So our Europe includes Eastern Europe as well. 
So when I say, single-digit growth low-to-mid single digit that includes what is going to be double-digit in the Eastern European side and also the protective business which is positive. I think on the food side, the hope is that we essentially get back the positive numbers compared to the prior year. And hopefully the EU will resolve the Greek issue and whether there is a Portugal issue following that. But it’s really weighing heavily on consumer confidence. 
On the equipment business in North America, the order book looks good, looks better than it has been in probably eight or nine quarters. I don’t necessarily see any reason to change that trend. And obviously, I think, you see a little bit of a bump on people get some more confidence. 
A lot of it will be depending on how solid the recovery is. I think as everyone said, this is clearly not a V-shaped every recession. I think we have concluded is not really an L either. Someone actually compared to more like Nike swoosh, where we were down pretty quick, but it takes a little longer to go up the other side. So equipment is probably to follow that trend.

And I think, let me say there are a three or four factors. 
One is I would say on the protective side, the principal driver has been recovery sort of comps is that this time of last year I remember being in China and visiting some customers whose business was primarily export. And they were running less than 30% of their lines, because the export market to the US had pretty much dried up. So the protective side is primarily a favorable comp situation and an economy recovery of exports out of Asia to the West. 
The food side of the business is primarily new products and penetration into what is still basically a much less developed protein distribution market. Those are the kind of the principal drivers. And as I say, food and industrial are coming from slightly different places.

So I think housing is probably an area that may - maybe a bubble. We don’t play in that space. We basically serve industrial and food processing companies that either sell to the domestic market or export. So we keep up clearly with the news.

We just pointed out in the first quarter when those price increases were not yet contributing, we did benefit from our cost productivity programs in terms of leveling out the impact and being able to match last year’s margins. 
The key driver of productivity is a volume per employee and we see two factors that work there Al. First of all, our employment levels at the end of first quarter are down about 3% globally from where they were at March 31st last year. And we are starting to see additional volume particularly on the protective side and later this year on the food side come back into the plants. 
One way, we are positioned to get profitability with the new capacity we have put in place, with our ongoing investment in technology is to be able to get that additional volume through our supply chain organization without a commensurate increase in headcount and cost. 
So there is a - I think the term is often referred to as operating leverage. So we see an opportunity for significant operating leverage as we move towards that 4% to 6% expected year-over-year increase.

Operator, I would like to take the questions from text that have come in from our webcast. 
The first question from our webcast is, what industry in the protective packaging segment is in the increased demand coming from? And what was the cash from operations for the quarter as well as the dividends paid for the quarter?
Let me answer the first part of it first. On the protective packaging segment, it’s pretty much across the board. I was out with a couple of sales managers earlier this week and we got something like 12 or 13 geographic regions in our protective business around the country. And something like a 11 of those 13 or on or ahead of our plan for 2009-2010. So that - and that covers the industrial Midwest, that covers the tech sector on the West Coast, that covers the e-commerce type of operation. So it’s pretty well spread across the board.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter, I think we mentioned in our press release, free cash flow which is for this case we are reasonable surrogate for cash flow from operations, which was about a $100 million or about $0.10 for every dollar of our sales. Dividends paid, I think Dave mentioned that is $19 million for the quarter. So that was one question from the webcast.
Second question from the webcast is given the price increases in place to recover resin, when do you expect to be back to a normalized raw material spread assuming resins stay stable with April levels?
I think that I sort of addressed that a little bit earlier on one of the earlier calls. We would expect a lot of that to roll through by most of it by the end of the second quarter. There will be a carryover into the third quarter. So clearly sometime during the third quarter, we should be kind of normalized, assuming everything stays the same. But in the resin market these days, that’s a pretty strong assumption.
Those were the two questions operator from the webcast. So if you have any left on the phone here in a couple of minutes we have left.

I would actually sort of suggest it maybe 20 years ago we were much - our diversification was less, we were primarily industrial packaging. And if you look at the Sealed Air business 20 years ago, 100% of the business depended on industrial packaging. And part of the moves we made in the 90s were to begin to reduce our reliable on industrial packaging as we went through some of the earlier recessions, knowing the impact that the industrial business is much more affected by the industrial. 
So it was a couple of decisions we made is one was to diversify the end markets and two is become more global with being at the markets around the world, create opportunities in other segments. We recognized food early on as a diversification opportunity, starting with our interesting acquisition in the 80s where we obtained dry-lock absorbent pad for meat trays which really gave us a flavor of what happened in the food business, followed it up in the 90s with the acquisition of Trigon, which got us into the protein packaging business primarily in Asia Pacific and Europe, followed with Cryovac in 1998. And as we look for further end market opportunities, again using core technologies and core manufacturing capabilities, we see kind of the diversification into the medical business as being another logical step for couple of reasons. One being the aging population and the increase in demand for healthcare by older population, and two the more emphasis on healthcare in the emerging markets.
So we see that as a growth opportunity and the opportunity has really been focused from our core competencies and basically Polymer Science and extrusion and the manufacturing. We may have a lot of end markets but a lot of the inputs and processes are similar. We continue to look about whether there is something else beyond industrial, food and medical, but right now we are focusing on the portfolio we have but thanks for asking the question.
Okay, operator, I think we are about wrapped up. So I would like to thank everyone for your participation of the call today. As we continue to perform through the second quarter, we remain optimistic that the modest recovery we saw last quarter will continue to provide growth opportunities for us in the year ahead. This recovery combined with our growth strategies, our lean and expansive international network ongoing innovations and expanding customers relationships position us to accelerate our growth rates, expand margins and continue to deliver measurable value for our customers and stockholders. 
And again, I would like to say I am really proud to be a Sealed Air shareholder and thank you for taking the time to listen to us today.

During today's call, I will be highlighting our",1520,"Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. I'm Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today, in addition to Amanda, we have Dave Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer. 
During today's call, I will be highlighting our business performance for the first quarter. Dave will then discuss details of our financial results. After Dave's remarks, we will take your questions, both from the phone lines and via text on our web cast. 
This morning, we reported a 9% increase in our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.36. This figure excludes a $0.01 charge related to our Global Manufacturing Strategy program, which we highlighted in our press release this morning. We are pleased with our earnings growth as we recognize that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery, and we are managing through higher resin prices, both on a prior year and a sequential basis. 
Additionally, we generated comparable gross and operating profit margin versus last year. We achieved this through the benefits of not only favorable foreign exchange translation, but of higher volumes in new and existing products, strong growth in developing regions, stringent with controls on operating expenses, and productivity improvement, which offset both unfavorable resin cost and price mix. 
Looking at the top line, first quarter sales increased 1% on a constant dollar basis. However, volume growth was a major contributor, which increased 4% overall, largely driven by an 8% increase in our Protective Packaging segment in North America, a 4% increase in our Food Packaging segment in North America, and a 10% increase in Latin America in Food Packaging as well. Across all of our businesses, volume growth improved through the course of the quarter, ending with solid March results. 
For example, using our Protective Packaging business, our sales in January were 99.6% of January 2009, as we still had not crossed the breakeven line in our recovery of the decline in sales from last year. February sales were 103% of the comparable month in 2009, and March sales were 109% of comparable sales in March 2009. We announced a price increase to be effective April 1, so we did wonder whether some of the March increase resulted from the price increase, and we look at our April sales month to date, and we're tracking 108% of April 2009. And I'm pleased to say that we're expecting this type of trending to continue for the rest of the year. 
Looking at volume trends in more detail, Food Packaging volumes increased 2%, largely driven by the 4% increase in North America and a 10% increase in Latin America, that I previously mentioned. Our performance in both of these regions was above local animal production rates due to incremental volumes from new and existing customers and from new product expansion. 
In North America, most products benefited from positive volume growth, and interestingly, the primary volume driver was a 43% increase in equipment as customers started to reinvest in replacement equipment during the first quarter. 
Western European volumes remained weak due to prolonged economic weakness and very low consumer confidence levels. But on a bright note, we did see ongoing growth in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, where we achieved double-digit volume increases. 
Food Solutions had similar regional results, led by a 6% increase in North America due to strong poultry case-ready sales and ongoing product expansion, including a new Darfresh film for fresh fish, which was launched at a large multinational retailer in the first quarter. Additionally, Food Solutions had an 18% increase in the Asia-Pacific region due largely to growth in case-ready and Ready Meals. 
Like our Food Packaging business, the Food Solutions team observed the onset of recovery in all regions except Western Europe, where conditions remain weak. We did see strength in developing regions, again, with very solid sales growth of greater than 50% in Russia due to strong case-ready program in that country. 
Our vertical pouch packaging sales increased 2%, which included 4% of favorable foreign exchange. On a constant dollar basis, vertical pouch packaging sales held relatively flat in North America and Latin America, as we expanded into bakery and deli applications, while the restaurant industry starts to stabilize and recover. 
Before I touch upon our Protective Packaging results, I would like to mention that our Food businesses continue to be recognized for their innovation that targets measurable value for customers and consumers. In the quarter, the 2010 Flexible Packaging Association Achievement Award recognized our marinated-on-demand package with the highest achievement award and the Gold Flexible Packaging Achievement Award for technical innovation. This marks the second consecutive year that our Cryovac brand has received this award. Additionally, the team earned the Food Processing Magazine readers' highest accolade for the seventh consecutive year and they were rewarded the Readers Choice Award as the goal supplier of packaging materials. 
Moving onto the Protective Packaging segment, this business drove more than half of the volume growth in the quarter, largely benefiting from improving economic conditions. When looking at their 8% volume growth versus the prior year, I am pleased to report that volumes were up in all regions, including 8% in North America, 3% in Europe and double-digit increases in the developing regions, with 10% growth in Latin America and 25% growth in Asia-Pacific, where the modest recovery of export markets and the manufacturing sector in countries like Mexico contributed to the increase. 
Volumes were also driven by good buy-in of our new products, including the new CT-301 shrink film and our new paper-based Packtiger solution Fasfil. I should also note that, although it's anecdotal, one of our Midwest sales reps mentioned to me that he has noticed fuller parking lots at some manufacturing customers in the Midwest. He's having a harder time finding a parking space, which indicates a real sense of pickup in that region, which is also very encouraging for the economy. 
And in maintaining the pace for continued growth of Protective Packaging launched recycled content Bubble Wrap, which uses a minimum of 50% pre-consumer recycled content. This product now offers the highest minimum recycled content for air cellular cushioning products on the market. 
Although we usually don't talk about equipment separately, investors usually ask us about equipment trends as an indicator of future outlook and of customer confidence. Our numbers for the first quarter are good. Equipment sales are up approximately 14% in the first quarter over a very low first quarter 2009. Also, equipment backlog, that is, orders for equipment not yet built and shipped, is up 90% from the depths of the recession at the end of the first quarter of 2009. 
Looking at consolidated price mix, we did see a $27 million or 3% decline in the quarter versus the prior year, which impacted all reportable areas. As we mentioned in our press release, price mix reflected the lag timing of Food Packaging contract price adjustments and a challenging year-over-year comparison. In most of our businesses, the first quarter 2010 selling prices reflected lower late 2009 resin costs. This compares to first quarter 2009 selling prices, which were higher and reflected late 2008 peak resin prices. 
As resin prices rose again in the first quarter of 2010, our businesses quickly responded by announcing various price increases in North America and Europe as well as targeted price increases in other parts of the world. These price increases focused on recovering the additional resin costs that we incurred and varied from 4% to 9% depending on the product and the region. Most of these price increases generally went into effect on April 1, and we expect to start seeing the benefits by the end of the second quarter 2010. 
To wrap up before I hand the call to Dave, I would like to reaffirm our EPS guidance for the full year, which is $1.48 to $1.68 per share on a reported basis or $1.50 per share to $1.70 per share if adjusted to exclude a $0.02 charge related to our Global Manufacturing Strategy program. 
As we navigate through the second quarter, we are continuing to show good sales momentum and are benefiting from volume gains and a leaner cost structure. Combined with the expected future benefit of resin cost recovery, seasonality, the ongoing adoption of new products by our customers, the incremental volume that we have recently signed on and our investments in growth, we continue to feel positively about the year ahead. As such, we continue to expect the full year average constant dollar sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%, of which volume will be the primary driver. 
Our release outlines our updated assumptions for resin cost increases. But as we noted, we feel that we will be able to offset these increases with the benefits I noted a moment ago. Of course, volume and raw material price fluctuations are the primary factors that will influence how we perform within our range. And now, I'm going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave?"

Gross profit for the quarter increased 5% or $14 million to $300 million. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $14 million, gross profit would've been flat compared with 2009. In the quarter, we experienced the positive impact of a $42 million increase in volumes across all of our reporting segments, along with an estimated $15 million of benefits from supply chain productivity improvements, including $2 million of incremental benefit from GMS by sourcing volumes from lower cost facilities in our developing regions. 
The offsets were an approximate $30 million increase in resin costs and an unfavorable price mix of $27 million. As Bill just noted, we faced a challenging year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. Both list price increases and formula price adjustments are amongst the actions to offset these higher resin cost. 
First quarter marketing, administrative and development expenses increased 6% or $9 million to $176 million. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $7 million, these expenses would've increased $2 million and remained flat as a percent of sales. 
Operating profit was $124 million or 11.7% of revenue. After adjusting for $7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, operating profit would've been relatively flat compared with 2009. On a reportable-segment basis, our Protective Packaging segment reported a 16% increase in operating profit as compared to prior year, which was offset by a combined 5% decline in operating profit in our Food businesses. 
Interest expense increased by $6 million in the quarter compared to 2009, reflecting additional interest of $11 million on two first half 2009 note issuances. The 7 7/8% notes issued in June 2009, which contributed $8 million to the increase and the 12% notes issued in February 2009, which contributed $3 million. Partially offsetting this additional interest expense was the reduction of $6 million resulting from the redemption of our 3% convertible note in July 2009, which contributed $4 million and the maturity of the 6.95% notes in May 2009, which contributed $2 million. As mentioned on last quarter's call, we're expecting interest expense to be approximately $160 million for the year. This amount reflects a full year of accrued interest related to the W.R. Grace settlement. There's still no date certain for the funding of the settlement. However, if we were to fund the Grace settlement on June 30, we would expect our interest expense to be approximately $20 million less or an adjusted $140 million for the full year. 
Other income increased by $7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase includes net foreign currency exchange gains of $6 million, primarily resulting from the favorable impact of the strengthening of some foreign currencies when we re-measured our inter-company loans and our inter-company receivables and payables. As a reminder, the U.S. dollar was very strong a year ago, attributable to the flight to safety in global currency markets. 
I'll conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents declined $67 million in the first quarter to $628 million at March 31. During the quarter, we repaid amounts outstanding on our European credit facility, paid our accrued 2009 annual incentive compensation, made an annual cash contribution to our profit sharing and paid $19 million in dividends. 
Our receivables declined $25 million from December 31, 2009. Excluding $3 million of foreign currency translation, receivables would've decreased $22 million or 16%. This decline was largely in Europe and North America, primarily due to our normal first quarter sales seasonality. As the economy recovers, we are continuing to focus on our credit and collections efforts and have successfully maintained the quality of our global accounts receivable portfolio. 
Inventory investment increased $33 million during the quarter with little impact of foreign currency translation. In the quarter, inventory levels were higher in North America and Europe, mainly in our Food businesses, reflecting a buildup of inventories in anticipation of normal second quarter seasonality. 
Net of cash and cash equivalents at March 31 was $955 million, down slightly from December 31, 2009. Also, at March 31, we had no amount outstanding under our global or European credit facilities or our accounts receivable securitization program. Our annual committed borrowing capacity was $750 million at March 31. 
As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, we generated $97 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2010. This compares with $160 million last year. The $63 million decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a decline in cash flow generated from working capital items. We still anticipate free cash flow to exceed $300 million this year. 
Capital investment in the first quarter was $9 million lower than 2009, as work is largely completed on our three new plants both in developing regions as part of our GMS program. In today's press release, we did announce the investment in a new facility in Brazil for expanded capacity in that developing market. Approximately $11 million of this investment will be included in our second quarter of 2010 capital investments. We anticipate additional modest investments next year and in 2012 related to this facility. 
Our total capital investment for 2010 is still expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects. This range includes our recent investment in Brazil and is consistent with our annual investment before commencing our GMS projects in 2006. 
Our current available liquidity and our projected free cash flow positions us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W.R. Grace settlement, should it become payable in the next 12 months. And now, I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions."

And although animal prices have been increasing, that still hasn't hurt the cattle market. However, hog markets cutback and it's really down greater than 4% in the first quarter and is expected to be down for the year 2010. Back to beef, we do see supply tightening in the second quarter, but the second half of the year ought to be better. And I think the last numbers I saw for the full year were about 2%, 2.1% up on an annual basis. So that would suggest that the cattle market has a better second half but [inaudible] it'll probably be lower for the year. And primarily driving that, as I understand, the corn harvest quality has been poor with all the rain we had and has had some high molds. So it really is kind of making the animals kind of lighter and taking them longer to get to the market. So that's kind of a little bit of color on what's happening on the herd sizes. As far as the case-ready North America, the numbers are really up -- it's about 2% overall down on a global basis. But that's really 3% up in North America. Europe's a soft spot. We're really down high-single digits, and the European weakness goes across both Food businesses. The North American case-ready was up about 3%, primarily on the poultry side, as I mentioned in my comments. Europe's down high-single digits, and that's primarily in the southern half of Europe, where particularly, Spain, where we have a very large case-ready customer and they're experiencing some of the problems that are happening in the Spanish market. We are seeing renewed interest in the U.S. from some major retailers, not the major retailer that people think about, but one of the second or third major retailers looking to do a new movement on case-ready, which we're extremely positive about, and should hit stores sometime second quarter."

There is a page that we distributed as part of our press release, it's posted on the website. But you see the European business is really down 2%. And you probably heard me say earlier that it's up and Protected a couple of percent. So the numbers down in Food are mid to high-single digits. And that is very, very impacted by the European economy. The consumer confidence level in Europe is extremely low. The euro, as you know, is dramatically down over the last several months, particularly customers in those troubled economies: Spain, Portugal, Greece. Food consumption is really tailed back to the basics. Much more eating at home, much more cutting back on the expensive cuts of meat, and we're actually seeing a decline. And that has -- essentially, Europe's 26% of our business overall. And that's had a significant impact on bringing down the base. When you say, we've seen good growth in North America 4%, 5%, depending on the business, 8% in Protective, you've seen double-digit growth in the Brazils and the Asias of the world, but the big 26% of our business in Europe is down.

That 2% swing can have something on the ballpark of a $0.10 impact on our EPS. So that's going to be the biggest factor. As you know, from the call today, when we look at the cost side of things, we are expecting resin costs to move up from that mid-single digit to the low-double digit range. The price increases that we spent some time talking about, both in our prepared remarks and the Q&A, are in place to get us back in line with our guidance expectations by the end of the year. So with those two big factors, we are still in that range that we communicated in January. The other area where we're seeing quite a bit of volatility, that's more in my backyard, is foreign exchange. While the euro, which we hung out there as sort of the benchmark for our basket of currencies, has clearly weakened against the dollar, and based on the latest headlines, may have further to go. The other currencies, particularly in commodity and resource-driven economies in many of the emerging markets, have actually strengthened against the dollar more than we expected. So when we net those both out, we really are not seeing an overall impact much different than our assumptions when it comes to currency. On the spending side, through our fixed cost areas, we are continuing to maintain the discipline that we've had in prior years. Don't see any change in our assumptions there, don't see any change in our free cash flow assumption.

We are hopeful for a recovery in Europe. I'd say lagging behind the U.S. and the emerging markets.

And also the Protective business, which is positive. I think on the Food side, the hope is that we essentially get back to positive numbers compared to the prior year. And hopefully, the EU will resolve the Greek issue and whether there's a Portugal issue following that. But it's really weighing heavily on consumer confidence. On the Equipment business in North America, the order book looks good, looks better than it has been in probably eight or nine quarters. I don't necessarily see any reason to change that trend. And obviously, I think you see a little bit of a bump when people get some more confidence, a lot of it will depend on how solid the recovery is.

And they were running less than 30% of their lines because the export market to the U.S. had pretty much dried up. So the Protective side is primarily a favorable comp situation and an economic recovery of exports out of Asia to the West.

So I think housing is probably an area that may be a bubble. We don't play in that space. We basically serve industrial and food processing companies that either sell to the domestic market or export. So we keep up clearly with the news, but right now, we haven't seen an impact on our business."

We just pointed out in the first quarter, when those price increases were not yet contributing, we did benefit from our cost productivity programs in terms of leveling out the impact and being able to match last year's margins. The key driver of productivity is volume per employee, and we see two factors at work there, Al. First of all, our employment levels at the end of the first quarter are down about 3% globally from where they were at March 31 last year. And we are starting to see additional volume, particularly on the Protective side and later this year on the Food side, come back into the plants. One way we are positioned to get profitability with the new capacity we've put in place with our ongoing investment in technology, is to be able to get that additional volume through our supply chain organization without a commensurate increase in head count and cost. So there's, I think the term is often referred to as operating leverage. So we see an opportunity for significant operating leverage as we move towards that 4% to 6% expected year-over-year volume increase."

First question from our web cast is, what industry in the Protective Packaging segment is the increased demand coming from? And what was the cash from operations for the quarter as well as the dividends paid for the quarter?"
382724,100483327,58168,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-28-2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Let me answer the first part of it, first.

On the Protective Packaging segment, it's pretty much across the board. I was out with a couple of sales managers earlier this week, and we got something like 12 or 13 geographic regions in our Protective business around the country. And something like 11 of those 13 are on or ahead of our plan for 2009, 2010. And that covered the industrial Midwest. It covers the tech sector on the West Coast. It covers the e-commerce type of operations. So it's pretty well spread across the board. Cash flow from operations for the quarter, I think, we mentioned in our press release, free cash flow, which is for this case a reasonable surrogate for cash flow from operations, which was about $100 million or about $0.10 for every dollar of sales. Dividends paid, I think, Dave mentioned that, is $19 million for the quarter. So that was one question from the web cast.
Second question from the web cast is, given price increases in place to recover resin, when do you expect to be back to a normalized raw material spread assuming resin stays stable with April levels?"

I would actually suggest that maybe 20 years ago, we were much, much -- our diversification was less. We were primarily Industrial Packaging. And if you looked at the Sealed Air business 20 years ago, 100% of the business depended on Industrial Packaging. And part of the moves we made in the '90s were to begin to reduce our reliance on Industrial Packaging as we went through some of the earlier recessions, knowing the impact that the Industrial business is much more affected by the industrial. So a couple of decisions we made is, one was to diversify the end markets and two, was to become more global. With it being that the markets around the world create opportunities in other segments, we recognized Food early on as a diversification opportunity, started with our interesting acquisition in the '80s, where you have paying the dri-loc absorbent pads for meat trays, which really gave us a flavor of what happened in the Food business. Followed it up in the '90s with the acquisition of Trigon, which got us into the protein packaging business primarily in Asia-Pacific and Europe, followed with Cryovac in 1998. And as we look for further end-market opportunities, again using core technologies and core manufacturing capabilities, we see kind of the diversification into the Medical business as being another logical step for a couple of reasons. One, being the aging population and the increase in demand for healthcare by older populations, and two, the more emphasis on healthcare in the emerging markets. So we see that as a growth opportunity. And the opportunity has really been focused from our core competencies and basically, polymer science and extrusion and the manufacturing. We may have a lot of end markets, but a lot of the inputs and processes are similar. We continue to look about whether there's something else beyond Industrial, Food and Medical. But right now, we're focusing on the portfolio we have, but thanks for asking the question. So I would like to thank everyone for your participation for the call today. As we continue to perform through the second quarter, we'll remain optimistic that the modest recovery we saw last quarter will continue to provide growth opportunities for us in the year ahead. This recovery, combined with our growth strategies, our lead and expensive international network, ongoing innovations and expanding customer relationships position us to accelerate our growth rates, expand margins and continue to deliver measurable value for our customers and stockholders.

During today's call, I will be highlighting our business performance for the first quarter. Dave will then discuss details of our financial results. After Dave's remarks, we will take your questions, both from the phone lines and via text on our web cast.
This morning, we reported a 9% increase in our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.36. This figure excludes a $0.01 charge related to our Global Manufacturing Strategy program, which we highlighted in our press release this morning. We are pleased with our earnings growth as we recognize that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery, and we are managing through higher resin prices, both on a prior year and a sequential basis.
Additionally, we generated comparable gross and operating profit margin versus last year. We achieved this through the benefits of not only favorable foreign exchange translation, but of higher volumes in new and existing products, strong growth in developing regions, stringent with controls on operating expenses, and productivity improvement, which offset both unfavorable resin cost and price mix.
Looking at the top line, first quarter sales increased 1% on a constant dollar basis. However, volume growth was a major contributor, which increased 4% overall, largely driven by an 8% increase in our Protective Packaging segment in North America, a 4% increase in our Food Packaging segment in North America and a 10% increase in Latin America in Food Packaging as well. Across all of our businesses, volume growth improved through the course of the quarter, ending with solid March results.
For example, using our Protective Packaging business, our sales in January were 99.6% of January 2009, as we still had not crossed the breakeven line in our recovery of the decline in sales from last year. February sales were 103% of the comparable month in 2009, and March sales were 109% of comparable sales in March 2009. We announced the price increase to be effective April 1, so we did wonder whether some of the March increase resulted from the price increase, and we look at our April sales month to date, and we're tracking 108% of April 2009. And I'm pleased to say that we're expecting this type of trending to continue for the rest of the year.
Looking at volume trends in more detail. Food Packaging volumes increased 2%, largely driven by the 4% increase in North America and a 10% increase in Latin America that I previously mentioned. Our performance in both of these regions was above local animal production rates due to incremental volumes from new and existing customers and from new product expansion.
In North America, most products benefited from positive volume growth, and interestingly, the primary volume driver was a 43% increase in equipment as customers started to reinvest in replacement equipment during the first quarter.
Western European volumes remained weak due to prolonged economic weakness and very low consumer confidence levels. But on a bright note, we did see ongoing growth in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, where we achieved double-digit volume increases.
Food Solutions had similar regional results, led by a 6% increase in North America due to strong poultry case-ready sales and ongoing product expansion, including a new Darfresh film for fresh fish, which was launched at a large multinational retailer in the first quarter. Additionally, Food Solutions had an 18% increase in the Asia Pacific region due largely to growth in case-ready and ready meals.
Like our Food Packaging business, the Food Solutions team observed the onset of recovery in all regions except Western Europe where conditions remain weak. We did see strength in developing regions, again, with very solid sales growth of greater than 50% in Russia due to strong case-ready program in that country.
Our vertical pouch packaging sales increased 2%, which included 4% of favorable foreign exchange. On a constant dollar basis, vertical pouch packaging sales held relatively flat in North America and Latin America, as we expanded into bakery and deli applications while the restaurant industry starts to stabilize and recover.
Before I touch upon our Protective Packaging results, I would like to mention that our Food businesses continue to be recognized for their innovation that targets measurable value for customers and consumers. In the quarter, the 2010 Flexible Packaging Association Achievement Award recognized our marinated on demand package with the highest achievement award and the Gold Flexible Packaging Achievement Award for Technical Innovation. This marks the second consecutive year that our Cryovac brand has received this award. Additionally, the team earned the Food Processing magazine readers' highest accolade for the seventh consecutive year and they were awarded the Readers' Choice Award as the gold supplier of packaging materials.
Moving on to the Protective Packaging segment. This business drove more than half of the volume growth in the quarter, largely benefiting from improving economic conditions. When looking at their 8% volume growth versus the prior year, I am pleased to report that volumes were up in all regions, including 8% in North America, 3% in Europe and double-digit increases in the developing regions, with 10% growth in Latin America and 25% growth in Asia Pacific, where the modest recovery of export markets and the manufacturing sector in countries like Mexico, contributed to the increase.
Volumes were also driven by good buy-in of our new products, including the new CT-301 shrink film and our new paper-based PackTiger solution FasFil. I should also note that, although it's anecdotal, one of our Midwest sales reps mentioned to me that he has noticed fuller parking lots at some manufacturing customers in the Midwest. He's having a harder time finding a parking space, which indicates a real sense of pickup in that region, which is also very encouraging for the economy.
And in maintaining the pace for continued growth, the Protective Packaging launched recycled content Bubble Wrap, which uses a minimum of 50% pre-consumer recycled content. This product now offers the highest minimum recycled content for air cellular cushioning products on the market.
Although we usually don't talk about equipment separately, investors usually ask us about equipment trends as an indicator of future outlook and of customer confidence. Our numbers for the first quarter are good. Equipment sales are up approximately 14% in the first quarter over a very low first quarter 2009. Also, equipment backlog, that is, orders for equipment not yet built and shipped, is up 90% from the depths of the recession at the end of the first quarter of 2009.
Looking at consolidated price/mix, we did see a $27 million or 3% decline in the quarter versus the prior year, which impacted all reportable areas. As we mentioned in our press release, price/mix reflected the lag timing of Food Packaging contract price adjustments and a challenging year-over-year comparison. In most of our businesses, the first quarter 2010 selling prices reflected lower late 2009 resin costs. This compares to first quarter 2009 selling prices, which were higher and reflected late 2008 peak resin prices.
As resin prices rose again in the first quarter of 2010, our businesses quickly responded by announcing various price increases in North America and Europe as well as targeted price increases in other parts of the world. These price increases focused on recovering the additional resin costs that we incurred and varied from 4% to 9% depending on the product and the region. Most of these price increases generally went into effect on April 1, and we expect to start seeing the benefits by the end of the second quarter 2010.
To wrap up before I hand the call to Dave, I would like to reaffirm our EPS guidance for the full year, which is $1.48 to $1.68 per share on a reported basis, or $1.50 a share to $1.70 a share if adjusted to exclude a $0.02 charge related to our global manufacturing strategy program.
As we navigate through the second quarter, we are continuing to show good sales momentum and are benefiting from volume gains and a leaner cost structure. Combined with the expected future benefit of resin cost recovery, seasonality, the ongoing adoption of new products by our customers, the incremental volume that we have recently signed on and our investments in growth, we continue to feel positively about the year ahead. As such, we continue to expect the full year average constant dollar sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%, of which volume will be the primary driver.
Our release outlines our updated assumptions for resin cost increases. But as we noted, we feel that we will be able to offset these increases with the benefits I noted a moment ago. Of course, volume and raw material price fluctuations are the primary factors that will influence how we perform within our range. 
And now, I am going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave?"

Gross profit for the quarter increased 5% or $14 million to $300 million. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $14 million, gross profit would've been flat compared with 2009. In the quarter, we experienced the positive impact of a $42 million increase in volumes across all of our reporting segments, along with an estimated $15 million of benefits from supply chain productivity improvements, including $2 million of incremental benefit from GMS by sourcing volumes from lower cost facilities in our developing regions.
The offsets were an approximate $30 million increase in resin costs and an unfavorable price mix of $27 million. As Bill just noted, we faced a challenging year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. Both list price increases and formula price adjustments are amongst the actions to offset these higher resin cost.
First quarter marketing, administrative and development expenses increased 6% or $9 million to $176 million. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $7 million, the expenses would've increased $2 million and remained flat as a percent of sales.
Operating profit was $124 million or 11.7% of revenue. After adjusting for $7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, operating profit would've been relatively flat compared with 2009. On a reportable segment basis, our Protective Packaging segment reported a 16% increase in operating profit as compared to prior year, which was offset by a combined 5% decline in operating profit in our Food businesses.
Interest expense increased by $6 million in the quarter compared to 2009, reflecting additional interest of $11 million on two first half 2009 note issuances. The 7 7/8% notes issued in June 2009, which contributed $8 million to the increase and the 12% notes issued in February 2009, which contributed $3 million. Partially offsetting this additional interest expense was the reduction of $6 million resulting from the redemption of our 3% convertible note in July 2009, which contributed $4 million and the maturity of the 6.95% notes in May 2009, which contributed $2 million. 
As mentioned on last quarter's call, we're expecting interest expense to be approximately $160 million for the year. This amount reflects a full year of accrued interest related to the W.R. Grace settlement. There's still no date certain for the funding of the settlement. However, if we were to fund the Grace settlement on June 30, we would expect our interest expense to be approximately $20 million less or an adjusted $140 million for the full year.
Other income increased by $7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase includes net foreign currency exchange gains of $6 million, primarily resulting from the favorable impact of the strengthening of some foreign currencies when we re-measured our inter-company loans and our inter-company receivables and payables. As a reminder, the U.S. dollar was very strong a year ago, attributable to the flight to safety in global currency markets.
I'll conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents declined $67 million in the first quarter to $628 million at March 31. During the quarter, we repaid amounts outstanding on our European credit facility, paid our accrued 2009 annual incentive compensation, made an annual cash contribution to our profit sharing and paid $19 million in dividends.
Our receivables declined $25 million from December 31, 2009. Excluding $3 million of foreign currency translation, receivables would've decreased $22 million or 16%. This decline was largely in Europe and North America, primarily due to our normal first quarter sales seasonality. As the economy recovers, we are continuing to focus on our credit and collections efforts and have successfully maintained the quality of our global accounts receivable portfolio.
Inventory investment increased $33 million during the quarter with little impact of foreign currency translation. In the quarter, inventory levels were higher in North America and Europe, mainly in our Food businesses, reflecting a buildup of inventories in anticipation of normal second quarter seasonality.
Net of cash and cash equivalents at March 31 was $955 million, down slightly from December 31, 2009. Also, at March 31, we had no amount outstanding under our global or European credit facilities or our accounts receivable securitization program. Our annual committed borrowing capacity was $750 million at March 31.
As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, we generated $97 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2010. This compares with $160 million last year. The $63 million decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a decline in cash flow generated from working capital items. We still anticipate free cash flow to exceed $300 million this year.
Capital investment in the first quarter was $9 million lower than 2009, as work is largely completed on our three new plants both in developing regions as part of our GMS program. In today's press release, we did announce the investment in a new facility in Brazil for expanded capacity in that developing market. Approximately $11 million of this investment will be included in our second quarter of 2010 capital investments. We anticipate additional modest investments next year and in 2012 related to this facility.
Our total capital investment for 2010 is still expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects. This range includes our recent investment in Brazil and is consistent with our annual investment before commencing our GMS projects in 2006.
Our current available liquidity and our projected free cash flow positions us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W.R. Grace settlement, should it become payable in the next 12 months. And now, I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions."

And although animal prices have been increasing, that still hasn't hurt the cattle market. However, hog markets cutback and it's really down greater than 4% in the first quarter and is expected to be down for the year 2010. Back to beef, we do see supply tightening in the second quarter, but the second half of the year ought to be better. And I think the last numbers I saw for the full year were about 2%, 2.1% up on an annual basis. So that would suggest that the cattle market has a better second half but [indiscernible] side it'll probably be lower for the year. And primarily driving that, as I understand, the corn harvest quality has been poor with all the rain we had and has had some high molds. So it really is making the animals kind of lighter and taking them longer to get to the market. So that's kind of a little bit of color on what's happening on the herd sizes. As far as the case-ready North America, the numbers are really up about -- it's about 2% overall down on a global basis. But that's really 3% up in North America. Europe's a soft spot. We're really down high single digits, and the European weakness goes across both food businesses. The North American Case-ready was up about 3%, primarily on the poultry side, as I mentioned in my comments. Europe's down high single digits, and that's primarily in the southern half of Europe, where particularly Spain, where we have a very large case-ready customer and they're experiencing some of the problems that are happening in the Spanish market. We are seeing renewed interest in the U.S. from some major retailers, not the major retailer that people think about, but one of the second or third major retailers looking to do a new movement on case-ready, which we're extremely positive about, and should hit stores sometime second quarter."

And you probably heard me say earlier that it's up and Protected a couple of percent. So the numbers down in Food are mid to high-single digits. And that is very, very impacted by the European economy. The consumer confidence level in Europe is extremely low. The euro, as you know, is dramatically down over the last several months, particularly customers in those troubled economies: Spain, Portugal, Greece. Food consumption is really tailed back to the basics. Much more eating at home, much more cutting back on the expensive cuts of meat, and we're actually seeing a decline. And that has -- essentially, Europe's 26% of our business overall. And that's had a significant impact on bringing down the base. When you say, we've seen good growth in North America 4%, 5%, depending on the business, 8% in Protective, you've seen double-digit growth in the Brazils and the Asias of the world, but the big 26% of our business in Europe is down.

As you know, from the call today, when we look at the cost side of things, we are expecting resin costs to move up from that mid-single digit to the low-double digit range. The price increases that we spent some time talking about, both in our prepared remarks and the Q&A, are in place to get us back in line with our guidance expectations by the end of the year. So with those two big factors, we are still in that range that we communicated in January. The other area where we're seeing quite a bit of volatility, that's more in my backyard, is foreign exchange. While the euro, which we hung out there as sort of the benchmark for our basket of currencies, has clearly weakened against the dollar, and based on the latest headlines, may have further to go. The other currencies, particularly in commodity and resource-driven economies in many of the emerging markets, have actually strengthened against the dollar more than we expected. So when we net those both out, we really are not seeing an overall impact much different than our assumptions when it comes to currency. On the spending side, through our fixed cost areas, we are continuing to maintain the discipline that we've had in prior years. Don't see any change in our assumptions there, don't see any change in our free cash flow assumption. We are right on target in the first quarter with our free cash flow generation to meet our goal of exceeding $300 million for the year."

We are hopeful for a recovery in Europe. I'd say lagging behind the U.S. and the emerging markets. But to be single-digit positive by the end of the year has contributed to our growth, and that does include Eastern Europe as part of Europe. So all Europe includes Eastern Europe as well. So when I say, single-digit growth, low- to mid- single digit growth, that includes what is going to be double-digit growth in the Eastern European side. And also the Protective business, which is positive. I think on the Food side, the hope is that we essentially get back to positive numbers compared to the prior year. And hopefully, the EU will resolve the Greek issue and whether there's a Portugal issue following that. But it's really weighing heavily on consumer confidence. On the Equipment business in North America, the order book looks good, looks better than it has been in probably eight or nine quarters. I don't necessarily see any reason to change that trend. And obviously, I think you see a little bit of a bump when people get some more confidence, a lot of it will depend on how solid the recovery is. I think as everyone said, this is clearly not a V-shaped recession. I think we've concluded it's not really an L either. Someone actually compared it to more like a Nike swoosh, where we were down pretty quick but it takes a little longer to go up the other side. So Equipment will probably follow that trend."

I remember not too long ago it was 9%, and so it's run up to 14%. I think, let me say there are three or four factors. One is, I'd say on the Protective side, the principal driver has been recovering sort of comps, is that this time last year, I remember being in China and visiting with some customers whose business was primarily export. And they were running less than 30% of their lines because the export market to the U.S. had pretty much dried up. So the Protective side is primarily a favorable comp situation and an economic recovery of exports out of Asia to the West. The Food side of the business is primarily new products and penetration into what is still basically a much-less developed protein distribution market. Those are the kind of the principal drivers. And as I said, I think Food and Industrial are coming from some slightly different places."

We just pointed out in the first quarter, when those price increases were not yet contributing, we did benefit from our cost productivity programs in terms of leveling out the impact and being able to match last year's margins. The key driver of productivity is volume per employee, and we see two factors at work there, Al. First of all, our employment levels at the end of the first quarter are down about 3% globally from where they were at March 31 last year. And we are starting to see additional volume, particularly on the Protective side and later this year on the Food side, come back into the plants. One way we are positioned to get profitability with the new capacity we've put in place with our ongoing investment in technology, is to be able to get that additional volume through our supply chain organization without a commensurate increase in head count and cost. So there's, I think the term is often referred to as operating leverage. So we see an opportunity for significant operating leverage as we move towards that 4% to 6% expected year-over-year volume increase."

They go into effect anywhere from April 1 to deeper in the quarter, depending on the specific price increase. If you want to call Amanda later in the day, I'm sure she can give you a little bit more flavor for what we've put in play there. Operator, I'd like to take questions from text that have come in from our webcast. The first question from our webcast is, what industry in the Protective Packaging segment is the increased demand coming from? And what was the cash from operations for the quarter as well as the dividends paid for the quarter? Let me answer the first part of it, first. On the Protective Packaging segment, it's pretty much across the board. I was out with a couple of sales managers earlier this week, and we got something like 12 or 13 geographic regions in our Protective business around the country. And something like 11 of those 13 are on or ahead of our plan for 2009, 2010. And that covered the industrial Midwest. It covers the tech sector on the West Coast. It covers the e-commerce type of operations. So it's pretty well spread across the board. Cash flow from operations for the quarter, I think, we mentioned in our press release, free cash flow, which is for this case a reasonable surrogate for cash flow from operations, which was about $100 million or about $0.10 for every dollar of sales. Dividends paid, I think, Dave mentioned that, is $19 million for the quarter. So that was one question from the webcast. Second question from the webcast is, given price increases in place to recover resin, when do you expect to be back to a normalized raw material spread assuming resin stays stable with April levels? I think that I sort of addressed that a little bit earlier on one of the earlier calls. We would expect a lot of that to roll through by, most of it by the end of the second quarter. There will be some carryover into the third quarter. So clearly sometime during the third quarter, we should be kind of normalized, assuming everything stays the same. But in the resin market these days, that's a pretty strong assumption. Those were the two questions, operator, from the web cast so if you have any left on the phone here in the couple of minutes we have left."

I would actually suggest that maybe 20 years ago, we were much, much -- our diversification was less. We were primarily Industrial Packaging. And if you looked at the Sealed Air business 20 years ago, 100% of the business depended on Industrial Packaging. And part of the moves we made in the '90s were to begin to reduce our reliance on Industrial Packaging as we went through some of the earlier recessions, knowing the impact that the Industrial business is much more affected by the industrial. So a couple of decisions we made is, one was to diversify the end markets and two, was to become more global. With it being that the markets around the world create opportunities in other segments, we recognized Food early on as a diversification opportunity, started with our interesting acquisition in the '80s, where you have paying the dri-loc absorbent pads for meat trays, which really gave us a flavor of what happened in the Food business. Followed it up in the '90s with the acquisition of Trigon, which got us into the protein packaging business primarily in Asia Pacific and Europe, followed with Cryovac in 1998. And as we look for further end-market opportunities, again using core technologies and core manufacturing capabilities, we see kind of the diversification into the Medical business as being another logical step for a couple of reasons. One, being the aging population and the increase in demand for healthcare by older populations, and two, the more emphasis on healthcare in the emerging markets. So we see that as a growth opportunity. And the opportunity has really been focused from our core competencies and basically, polymer science and extrusion and the manufacturing. We may have a lot of end markets, but a lot of the inputs and processes are similar. We continue to look about whether there's something else beyond Industrial, Food and Medical. But right now, we're focusing on the portfolio we have, but thanks for asking the question. So I would like to thank everyone for your participation for the call today. As we continue to perform through the second quarter, we'll remain optimistic that the modest recovery we saw last quarter will continue to provide growth opportunities for us in the year ahead. This recovery, combined with our growth strategies, our lead and expensive international network, ongoing innovations and expanding customer relationships position us to accelerate our growth rates, expand margins and continue to deliver measurable value for our customers and stockholders. And again, I would like to say I'm really proud to be a Sealed Air shareholder, and thank you for taking the time to listen to us today."

During today's call, I will be highlighting our business performance for the second quarter, and Dave will discuss details of our financial results. After Dave's remarks, we will take your questions both from the phone lines and via text on our webcast. I understand that this morning is a busy morning for earnings releases, so we'll try to move along very smartly.
Yesterday evening, we reported a 15% increase on our second quarter earnings per share of $0.38. Excluding $0.03 related to foreign currency exchange gains from our Venezuelan subsidiary in 2010 and a $0.01 impact from GMS in 2009, we reported a 3% increase on our adjusted EPS to $0.35 per share in the quarter.
As a reminder, we have elected to exclude any foreign currency translation, gains or losses, from Venezuela in 2010 due to the significant currency fluctuations in that country. We did, however, have a $0.02 foreign exchange loss in the quarter, which is reported in other income. And excluding that item, which records we're responsible for, on an operating income basis, we're essentially in the line with the consensus of last year estimates for the second quarter.
Sales increased 6% to $1.1 billion, reflecting approximately 5% higher volume and 3% favorable foreign exchange, which were partially offset by 1% lower price mix.
Our Protective Packaging segment stood out in the quarter with strong 12% volume growth. While volume growth in our Food Packaging segment was modest in the quarter, it exceeded customer production volumes during the same period.
Total company price mix remained below last year's level, but we did see marked improvement in the second quarter as we started to see the benefits of our April pricing actions later in the quarter. Although been official, the price increases did not offset the surge in resin costs that we experienced in the quarter when resin prices peaked in the month of April in most regions.
In light of these factors, our business demonstrated solid growth in the second quarter in several areas. First, our industrial packaging business volume growth was stronger than expected and above normal seasonal trends. Looking at protective packaging, North American volumes increased 10% and Europe achieved a solid 11% volume growth. We expected this level of growth to moderate slightly in the second half of the year, primarily due to the year-over-year comparisons.
Additionally, we are seeing strong reception of new solutions and technologies like our CT-301 Shrink Film where our new proprietary technology is extending our range of offerings and bringing us new customers. We will be reinforcing this product line with two additional launches later this year. So we're very excited about the growth prospects in shrink films and where we can extend this exciting new technology across our broader product portfolio.
We have observed significant growth in equipment demand with a 36% sales increase in equipment, which includes a 3% favorable impact from foreign exchange. This order rate currently exceeds production rates, reflecting solid backlogs going into the third quarter. Additionally, orders appear to largely reflect new installations versus replacements, which suggest that these equipment sales will lead to future incremental material sales opportunities.
Developing regions grew in the quarter, both on a year-over-year and the sequential basis. Our China sales were a little weaker, which you may have seen in our financials under the Asia Pacific region, but this was expected due to pre-buying in our medical business in the first quarter, as customers built inventory ahead of our formulation license renewal.
Overall, we saw solid growth throughout the quarter in countries like Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia, as our businesses did not see any economic weakness or slowdown in these economies. We believe that this growth remains on track through the balance of the year.
Europe has been a topic of much interest in the last few months, and I have to say that we are encouraged by the solid 5% volume growth rate in the region, which was largely driven by our industrial packaging business, but also by a 3% volume growth rate in food packaging.
So we believe we have turned the corner in the second quarter and our daily sales reports through late July support this view and as we are already saying, improved food volumes and ongoing growth in industrials and in the developing regions. We continue to be excited about the second half of the year and expect to accelerate sales and earnings going forward.
Before we discuss our earnings guidance, I'd like to highlight a few key points on each of our primary business segments. As I mentioned earlier, the food packaging business exceeded customer production rates with modest growth in the quarter in the first half of the year.
Looking ahead, the full year prospects look solid, with industry data suggesting North America beef production up 4% to 5% in the second half of the year. This compares to a minus 1% to minus 4% customer production rates in the first half of the year. Additionally, contract price adjustments to recover higher resin costs go into effect in the third quarter. Thus our second quarter price remained unfavorable on a year-over-year basis.
We excelled in two key areas in the quarter. First, equipment sales were up over 39%, which includes a 4% favorable impact from foreign exchange; and secondly, 8% volume growth in Latin America where our team did a solid job throughout the quarter by expanding the presence of our product lines in this important region.
Looking at developing regions, the business saw no slowdown in economies like Brazil, Mexico and China related to food packaging demand, and we anticipate that trend going forward. So looking ahead, a pickup in customer production volumes, new customer contracts, incremental price, and continued success in shifting pilot projects into commercial sales around our recently launched solutions are expected to bring mid to upper single digit percent constant dollar sales growth in the second half versus the prior year.
The food solutions business continued to experience improvement in the quarter, with a 1% volume increase, with the strongest demand occurring in June and in the Asia-Pacific and European regions. We were pleased to see that European performance improved both year-over-year and sequentially with a 4% sales increase over the first quarter.
The primary drivers behind the pickup in sales in Europe are from solid volume growth in our ready meals portfolio related largely to pizza and to equipment demand. Although European case ready sales were not ahead of last year, the region did see improved demand in the portfolio due to an expanded development program for whole chickens in the Middle East, and ongoing market growth in our Mirabella and Darfresh formats.
Also in the quarter, we saw signs of consumers starting to return to more convenience oriented and higher-priced point products at retail. This reinforced our view that the food industry is starting its slow recovery process.
Looking closely at the two primary product portfolios, case-ready and vertical pouch packaging, first, case-ready sales decreased by 1%, which included a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. However, we did see an 8% sales increase in case-ready in North America, and over a 20% increase in case-ready in Latin America, as our market programs continued to expand the products' presence in these parts of the world.
A great example of this type of growth is in the Americas, where in Canada, we have just launched case-ready with two large retailers, one of which is a division of a leading multinational retailer. This growth in the Americas was offset by weakness in Europe, which I previously indicated.
Number two, vertical pouch packaging showed the greatest growth this quarter in this segment as sales increased 5% which included a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Growth was strongest in North America and the Asia-Pacific region, where sales increased by over 30%.
Looking ahead to the second half, we expect this segment to see similar constant dollar sales growth as our food packaging business. Improving retail conditions, combined with incremental price from both second quarter and early third quarter increases will help drive top-line growth, so also will ongoing successful market growth of our case-ready products in developing markets like Russia and the successful transition of pilot projects into commercial sales.
As you saw in our financials, protective packaging segment was a standout segment this quarter, as the business drove over two-thirds of our volume growth. When looking at the 12% volume growth versus the prior year, I am pleased to report that volumes are up at all regions of the world, including the 10% and 11% increases in North America and Europe, which I discussed earlier.
I also would like to point out that the segment saw approximately 20% growth in Latin America and in Asia-Pacific region, as the business continued to develop new customer relationships. Interesting, European growth was broader than most would have expected, including growth in countries like Portugal and Spain.
Naturally, the strongest sales increase was achieved in Northern Europe, Scandinavia, France and Germany, where the industrial output remained solid. Contributing to the growth was our very successful new product programs, which are getting strong reception and selling above both planned and prior year rates.
These new products include our Instapak complete and (Fastfill) packaging solutions. Additionally, we have achieved strong growth in proprietary solutions such as our traditional Instapak foam-in-place product and in Korrvu suspension packaging.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we're expecting constant dollar sales growth in the high single digits as we see ongoing benefits from the economy, new solution sales, and both our April price actions and the European price announcement issued this month.
To wrap up before I hand the call to Dave, I would like to reaffirm our full year EPS guidance which is a $1.48 to $1.68 on a reported basis, or $1.50 to $1.70 if adjusted to exclude a $0.02 charge related to the GMS program.
As I stated earlier in the call, the first half year surge in raw materials and slower food customer production volume are both abating, and second half 2010 results are expected to outperform our first half performance. This positions us to achieve a full year EPS within the mid range of our earnings guidance.
As I mentioned, ongoing modest improvements in the economy, combined with accelerated constant dollar sales from product adoptions and the benefits of our pricing actions will be the key drivers to this growth.
Additionally, we assume foreign exchange to be a net positive by 1% to 2% for the full year. We also see additional benefits from our steadfast commitment to innovation throughout the economic downturn. During this time, we have been developing a strong pipeline of proprietary technologies and applications that have been in development with customers for several quarters now.
We expect to start commercializing many of these in late 2010, as several projects reach market stage and are positioned to generate value for our business.
At this point, I am going to turn the call over to Dave to review some additional details on our financial performance and our liquidity.

As presented in the financial statements that accompanied our release, sales were $1.089 billion for the quarter. Moving down to P&L, gross profit for the quarter increased 4% or $12 million to $301 million. Excluding favorable currency t",1021,"Thank you, Bill. As presented in the financial statements that accompanied our release, sales were $1.089 billion for the quarter. Moving down to P&L, gross profit for the quarter increased 4% or $12 million to $301 million. Excluding favorable currency translation of $7 million, gross profit would have been $5 million higher than 2009.
Gross profit growth was largely driven by volume growth in the industrial businesses, which Bill previously touched upon. Also contributing to our higher gross profit were benefits realized from our supply chain productivity improvements and from the benefits of producing products in our new, low-cost facilities in developing regions.
These benefits were partially offset by approximately $45 million of increased resin cost and $13 million of unfavorable price mix compared to last year. Second quarter marketing, administrative and developmental expenses increased 1% or $2 million to $172 million. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $3 million, these expenses would have remained flat.
The higher sales volumes that we achieved in the quarter required higher sales and marketing support costs, which were offset by lower provisions for variable incentive compensation expenses, mainly due to revenue levels in our food businesses and the impact of higher resin cost. We are still estimating operating expenses to be 16% to 17% of net sales for the full year, in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year.
Operating profit was $129 million, or 11.9% of revenue. After adjusting for $4 million of favorable foreign currency translation, operating profit would have been $7 million higher than 2009. Our industrial businesses reported a combined 52% increase in operating profit as compared to last year, which was offset by a combined 5% decline in operating profit in our two food businesses.
We expect the operating profits of our food businesses to improve in the third quarter, as we realized benefits from our previously announced pricing actions in contract pricing adjustments, as well as the volume opportunities that Bill mentioned.
Interest expense increased by $3 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting additional interest of $7 million on the 7-7/8% notes issued in June of last year, partially offset by a reduction of $4 million resulting from the redemption of the 3% convertible notes in July of last year.
As mentioned in our press release, we recognized $7 million of foreign currency exchange gains related to our subsidiary in Venezuela. Due to the unpredictable foreign currency environment in Venezuela, with the resulting (Bolivar) fluctuations in exchange rates, we are excluding any gains or losses we may recognize related to these changes in exchange rates from our adjusted earnings per share. While this exchange gain is sizeable, our Venezuelan subsidiary represents less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and our consolidated assets.
Other expense was $3 million in the second quarter. This amount includes net foreign currency exchange losses, primarily relating to an inter-company loan we are in the process of paying off.
I'll now conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents increased $36 million in the second quarter to $663 million at June 30. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $19 million and invested $11 million in our previously announced new facility in Brazil designed for expanded capacity.
In the quarter, we also used $8 million to complete a small bolt-on acquisition which provides us with the opportunity to develop a new unique technology platform, offering both cost savings and revenue growth opportunities for existing and new proprietary applications.
As this is a technology investment, we anticipate an ongoing development phase in 2010 and expect the initial commercialization of products in 2011.
Our receivables remained flat from March 31, 2010 on a reported U.S. dollar basis. Excluding foreign currency translation of $22 million which reflects the declining euro in the period, our receivables increased $23 million, in line with our increases in sales volume.
Inventory investment increased $10 million during the quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation of $13 million, also mainly due to the weakening euro, inventories increased $23 million. At June 30, inventory levels were higher in North America and Europe, mainly in our food businesses, reflecting peak resin costs in April and a buildup of inventories in anticipation of increased sales volumes from normal seasonality in these businesses.
Debt, net of cash, and cash equivalents at June 30 was $921 million, down $33 million from March 31 of this year. Also at June 30, we had no amounts outstanding under our global or European credit facilities, or our accounts receivable securitization program. Our available committed borrowing capacity was $750 million at June 30 of 2010.
As shown in the supplemental information with the financial statements, we generated $181 million of free cash flow in the first six months of 2010. Cash flow from operating results was comparable to last year, but working capital swung to usage from the source last year as we responded to the recovery of the global economy.
We continue to expect free cash flow to exceed $300 million in 2010. And as we noted in our press release this morning, we did announce a dividend increase that is going to be a modest additional payout that will not in any way affect our ability to exceed the free cash flow targets of $300 million.
Capital investment in the first six months was $4 million lower than 2009 as work is completed on three new plants we opened in developing regions as part of our GMS program.
Our total year capital investment for 2010 is still expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects. This range includes our recent investment in Brazil, and is consistent with our annual investment before commencing our GMS projects in 2006.
Finally, our current available liquidity and our projected free cash flow position us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W.R. Grace settlement, should it become payable within the next 12 months.
Now I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.

I think it's seven formats of case-ready, and we look at it depending on the customer, the market and the consumer interest. We can sort of provide a variety of case-ready alternatives.
So we really got the total system. We're not just selling a piece of it. We're selling the tray. We're selling the lid. We're selling the equipment. And we're providing service and support to our customers. And I think that gives us a pretty strong place to be.
And we're continuing the work on the next generation of case-ready. Case-ready is still a $450 million business for us. As we said earlier, it's continuing to grow in the U.S. We do have a couple of customers in Europe who were particularly hard hit by the recession and whose actually meat sales have moved to lower-quality cuts. So that's why the European numbers were kind of negative for the quarter.
But on a global basis, case-ready numbers are still positive. We do believe our seven offerings, plus two or three we have in the lab, will continue to give customers the most choice, the most opportunity and we think the best combined offering you can get in the marketplace.

So I think from our perspective, there is nothing unusual that distinguishes what we're experiencing in North America versus what we're experiencing in our international markets, with the one exception is that on the pricing side, Rosemarie, I think as we've said in the past, it's primarily in North America where we have the pricing formulas that have the lags built into them. Most of what we do overseas is on list prices that get adjusted periodically based on market conditions.

I don't remember the numbers. I looked at prior to the call.
Bubble Wrap has undergone a couple of changes in mix as we've added recycled content. The pricing point comes down a little bit, because we are using less expensive materials. And that's probably a mix factor. So the 13% in sales has probably got a little bit of a negative factor of mix and a positive factor in price. That's about the simplest way I can say it.

Europe was 11% on the protective side and about 5% on the food side, both of which were the best numbers we've seen in a couple of quarters.
I'd like to think that Europe is turning back up, but I also mentioned we've got three groups of countries in Europe and the business breaks up that way. Group one, which for most of our businesses are still slow, still very smudge in the recession or final stages of it, and that's the Spain, Greece and the U.K. Then you've got group two where we are seeing an improvement and where France and Italy we're up high single digits. And then you've got group three companies where there is a solid recovery and good increase in our business such as Scandinavia and Germany where numbers are up well over double digits.
And I think those are fair amount export-driven if you look at German and Scandinavian economies, and I think they have also been more frugal in terms of their financial policies. So clearly, we're being carried in Europe by a couple of strong countries with a couple of weak ones still behind. I'm not confident enough to say that we have kind of the laggards come out of the woods yet. I'm just not sure, but I'm hopeful.
On your second point, I'll just say that I think we're still waiting for the gabble to go down on the Grace settlement.
