96079,84647448,48026,"JDS Uniphase Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-02-2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Viavi Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michelle and good afternoon everyone. I would like to begin by providing a brief summary of our fiscal second quarter results. JDSU’s revenue of $343.8 million and operating profit of 8.2% came in at the high end of our guidance. These result",2475,"Thank you, Michelle and good afternoon everyone. I would like to begin by providing a brief summary of our fiscal second quarter results. JDSU’s revenue of $343.8 million and operating profit of 8.2% came in at the high end of our guidance. These results reflect increasing customer demand and the leverage in our operating model. Our book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one.
Our balance sheet and working capital structure continue to strengthen. In Q2, when compared to Q1, we generated over $27 million of free cash flow, decreased our inventory by $11 million, resulting in inventory turns above six, which historically is the highest level for the company, and reduced our day’s sales outstanding to 60. These results evidence our continued focus to improve our operating model.
Now let’s move on to our individual business segments. First, the Communications Test & Measurement segment, fiscal Q2 revenues grew 23% compared to last quarter and book-to-bill was greater than one. This is the third consecutive quarter of growth as we continue to see customer demand improve. All geographies grew quarter-over-quarter, with particular strength in North America and EMEA.
We had one of our strongest quarters for fiber optics test in North America and Q2 was the largest quarter ever for shipments of the T-BERD 6000, one of our modular field optical test solutions. Other areas of strength in this region were wireless backhaul, 100 Gig, 40 Gig and cable. Europe grew over 45% compared to Q1, where recovery is underway in Western Europe.
Asia grew more than 10%, as we saw increased demand in the region. We saw strength in Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Korea, Australia, the Philippines and India. Build out of fiber plants for transport and FTTx continues to present good opportunities across the region. Our bookings growth in China and India mirrored the positive economic growth in these two countries.
As you can see, we continue to strengthen our leader market position in Test and Measurement across all of our addressable markets. On a year-over-year basis JDSU grew faster than the market, with particular strength in North America and our Test and Measurement business maintains the leading market position worldwide for field test in Ethernet, fiber field, DSL and cable networking markets, as well as storage network tests for the lab and production market.
This quarter JDSU was awarded the Frost & Sullivan 2009 worldwide growth strategy award for capturing the highest annual compound growth rate for the last three years for our portfolio of Gigabit Ethernet test equipment. Our portfolio provides the industry’s deepest set of test features, providing end-to-end testing for carrier Ethernet, products and services, including lab and service verification, development and production, installation and maintenance, troubleshooting and overall service assurance.
JDSU continues to support our customers with a portfolio of technology that is aligned with key market trends. For example, this quarter we experienced strong growth in Ethernet backhaul and monitoring tests for wireless service providers. I mentioned earlier that we had our largest quarter ever shipping T-BERD 6000 and in fact, a large percentage of these were for Ethernet backhaul applications. Bookings related to Ethernet backhaul projects for Tier 1 North American operators were particularly strong this quarter.
Continuous growth of mobile services and requirements for improving network efficiency is driving wireless operators to migrate to Ethernet services for mobile backhaul. Third party research show mobile backhaul equipment investment jumping more than 50% in 2009 to nearly $6 billion worldwide, with projections for the market to more than triple from 2008 levels to $11.3 billion in 2013.
Operators not only need to make this transition from TDM to Ethernet, they need to do it quickly, with the ability to efficiently turn up and manage service using their existing work force. JDSU understands the operators’ needs and provides a full solutions transition to Ethernet with not only the right products and systems, but with the expertise and services to effectively transition with the current workforce, providing training, consulting services, and outlining methods and procedures to deploy Ethernet and manage it through the entire lifecycle.
In another example that demonstrates JDSU technology leadership, we continue to lead the market in 100 Gig lab and production testing. JDSU was the first to demo error free 100 Gig test transmission. This quarter we shipped 100 Gig systems to six customers across all geographic regions.
Our leadership in technology for managing fiber optics networks is also evident in continued increasing demand in Q2 for our ONMS, or optical network management system. The ONMS increases customer workforce productivity and facilitates management of fiber optic networks with fewer technicians through fiber remote testing and documentation. Finally, JDSU continues to lead the 40 Gig testing in both the lab and field services’ global demand increase for 40 Gig this quarter.
Moving on to our Communications and Commercial Optical Products segment, first our Optical Communications business in fiscal Q2 revenue grew by 11% quarter-over-quarter and book-to-bill was again over one. We continue to gain market share as we see demand increasing not only for our ROADM and 300 pin tunable, but also for our newer products such as the Super Transport Blade, the mini 50 gigahertz ROADM and the tunable XFP.
All geographic regions grew quarter-over-quarter, and we had record revenue in China, driven primarily by Huawei. As I noted, our ROADM demand is clearly recovering. ROADM revenue in Q2 grew by over 50% compared to the last quarter, and is well over 20% of total optical revenue. ROADM bookings continue to be strong with a book-to-bill greater than one. Also, we have started to ship our next generation 50 gigahertz ROADM. 
Production volumes are happening in the third quarter. The revenue breakdown between transport and transmission was 60% and 40%, respectively. Trends we are seeing in transmission include the disruption of the 10 Gig market with our tunable XFP, and more demand for the 10 Gig transceivers and VCSELs for wireless backhaul and data center applications.
For transport we continue to work closely and collaborate with our customers on 40 Gig and 100 Gig solutions. In one example, we are supplying a key customer with our product, including our next generation 50 gigahertz ROADM and modulators in the network that is carrying live 100-gig traffic. In fact, we are the first and only vendor supplying ROADMs and modulators carrying 100-gig traffic in a deployed network.
Our focused strategy of technology leadership, cost leadership, and functional integration enables us to continue to differentiate ourselves in a very competitive market. As you know, we have introduced a number of platforms that possess high functional integration, which have been very well received by our customers.
The tunable XFP, the first tunable made available in an XFP form factor, is a new and disruptive technology to the fixed wavelength XFPs and 300 pin 10-gig tunable transponder markets. The product was released into production in September, and to-date we are engaged with 26 customers, and have shipped product to 13 customers.
Our Super Transport Blade’s unique architecture provides substantial footprint savings to our customers. We received significant production orders to-date from two customers, with multiple designs at each customer and we have been designed into a third customer. We are currently working with most of our other customers, who are excited about the Super Transport Blade that allows them the opportunity to take full advantage of the smaller footprint and open up valuable real estate in their chassis.
Current revenue for new products less than two years old is approximately 40%, compared to 30% last quarter, in part due to the new products mentioned above. Our lasers business experienced over 10% sequential growth. Recovery is currently concentrated in a few key customers in North America and Japan. 
We saw strength in our solid-state lasers and gas lasers, mainly in the semiconductor and micro machining industries. We also continue to make progress on our lean initiatives, as evidenced by a six percentage point improvement in lasers gross margins.
Finally, onto our Advanced Optical Technologies segment. Q2 revenue grew 1% compared to the previous quarter. Strength was in our Custom Optics business, including 3-D products. Our currency business was relatively flat, and we saw continued softness in our transaction cards business, as new credit card issuances remain depressed. Book-to-bill was approximately 1%.
Positive trends for this segment include customers seeking more complex integrated design features, utilizing multiple JDSU security technologies to combat counterfeiting, 3-D and growth in aerospace. Finally, JDSU and SICPA extended an already long standing relationship by signing a new long-term agreement for our anti-counterfeiting products.
On to our corporate priorities, we continue to capitalize on the positive long term growth opportunity in our markets. JDSU will continue to focus on four priorities. These priorities will enable us to further differentiate ourselves, increase our leadership position in the markets we serve, and further improve our financial model.
First is our focus on profitable market based innovation. As you know, we have taken considerable steps to lower our cost structure and improve our financial model. As our top line continues to grow, our profitability would benefit from the leverage in our model. JDSU’s innovation engine is the driver that will enable long term top line growth and profitability.
We will continue to collaborate with our customers and invest in profitable market based innovation to drive market share gains and revenue growth. It is our goal to increase the percentage of revenue from products that are less than two years old to greater than 50% over the next three years.
Highlights of innovation and future revenue opportunities include the following. For Optical Communications business has developed a substantial number of new products over the past year. In Q2 alone, we began shipping the following new products. First, our next generation 980 nanometer pump, the new pump laser is designed to help network equipment manufacturers lower cost and power consumption within optical networks.
Second, we are supplying a next generation tunable laser assembly or ITLA to market, which is also incorporated into our 310 transponders. This product provides lower power and lower cost options to the market, optimized for all the flexibility required in agile optical networks.
Finally, and as mentioned earlier, we began shipping our next generation mini 50 gigahertz WSS ROADM, which currently has multiple wins at nine customers and we are gaining good traction in the market with our tunable XFP and Super Transport Blade, both of which are in volume production.
In AOT segment, JDSU is currently in customer trials for the HoloFuse authentication technology. The HoloFuse technology is a newly, highly integrated product that helps protect government issued identity documents, such as passports, national identity documents and drivers licenses, against counterfeiting and tampering.
The partially transparent and customized hologram within a polycarbonate film includes overt, covert and forensic security features. HoloFuse has been recognized by its industry peers, having won several industry awards, most notable a Sesame award during 2009 and the excellence in Holography award from the International Hologram Manufacturers Association.
Also developed in the AOT segment is optical coating technology for 3-D solutions. Since the launch of the movie, Beowulf, in 2007, JDSU has provided a full spectrum color wheel, which captures light from a digital movie projector to deliver premium 3-D images. Most recently JDSU has provided the color wheel technology, along with 3-D glasses, with JDSU optical coatings for the viewing of the currently popular movie, Avatar.
Moving forward, we expect to 3-D to continue to be a growth opportunity for JDSU, with a current focus on cinema and large venue video viewing. The AOT segment and optical communications business have been working together to develop technologies for use in gesture recognition, a new market for JDSU.
We are all familiar with home gaming and television remote controls, what if you can control these electronics without the use of devices, by using human gestures. This is exactly what gesture recognition technology can accomplish. JDSU has developed a solution for gesture recognition applications with the unique advantage of providing two of the most critical system components, filters and diode lasers.
JDSU will begin shipments to a major home gaming provider in Q3, and we are in discussions with other potential customers. This new market represents future growth opportunities as new applications develop, such as automotive controls, lighting control and home security. AOT and optical communications have also been working together to develop concentrated photovoltaic cells for the solar market aimed at large commercial and utility scale installations. In the coming quarters we will update you on our progress.
For our laser business our product development is focused on advanced solid state and fiber laser platforms. These new products are expected to increase our served available market by more than threefold by end of the current fiscal year and in our Communications Test & Measurement segment JDSU was selected by BT Group for our industry leading HST-3000 handheld tester, which supports triple play and FTTx testing.
BP selected JDSU for our collaboration and development of new features for the product. JDSU is well positioned to support our cable customers with the DOCSIS 3.0 technology rollout with hardware and software upgrades to support our market leading installed base of DSAM and PathTrak customers with new standalone products.
Our second corporate priority is increasing our global market presence. We are placing more emphasis on expanding our market penetration and receiving our fair share of business outside of traditionally strong North American and Western European markets. We continue to see this emphasis paying off.
Latin America revenue increased by over 38% quarter-over-quarter, with particular strength in the Test and Measurement segments. Our Optical Communication Asia bookings in Q2 were the highest in over a year. Our third priority is Lean. Much of the heavy lifting to reduce our costs and improve our financial model is complete, and we are seeing evidence of the model working as the top line improves. Lean is part of the JDSU culture, and we will continue to improve our cost structure.
Finally, maximizing utilization of our assets, we are focusing on the utilization of our assets in order to maximize shareholder value, as evidenced by the improvement in our DSO and in our inventory turns. Our priorities for cash remain generating cash, and strategic accretive acquisitions in our core or adjacent markets.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I’d like to thank our employees, as we begin to realize the benefits of their efforts and dedication through the economic downturn, evidenced by our improving business model. I would also like to thank our customers, partners, vendors and long term shareholders for their continued support for JDSU.
With that, I will hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q2 and discuss our Q3 outlook.

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. Second quarter revenues of $343.8 million were up 15.1% from the previous quarter, and down 2.9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Revenues in",1478,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. Second quarter revenues of $343.8 million were up 15.1% from the previous quarter, and down 2.9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Revenues increased sequentially in each of our business segments.
For fiscal Q2 our Test and Measurement segment contributed 51% of total revenue. Our CCOP segment contributed 33% of total revenue and our AOT segment contributed 16% of total revenue. Second quarter gross margin of 44.6% was up from the previous quarters gross margin of 44%, from the second quarter fiscal 2009 gross margin of 43.5%. This improvement was primarily due to favorable segment revenue mix and improved margins in the CCOP segment.
Operating expenses for the fiscal second quarter of $125.3 million were up from the previous quarters $121.2 million, and were lower by $9.6 million from the prior year’s second quarter operating expenses of $134.9 million. The sequential increase resulted primarily from higher sales compensation due to higher revenues, selective strategic R&D investments, and a partial reinstatement of employee benefits
 Due to our higher revenues and improved gross margins our operating income for the quarter was $28.1 million, or 8.2% of revenue, which compares to an operating income of $10.2 million, or 3.4% of revenue, for the previous quarter. Net income for the second quarter of $26.6 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to the previous quarter’s net income of $9 million, or $0.04 per share, a detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today’s press release.
Our second quarter non-GAAP results exclude among other items, $23.2 million of amortization of acquired technology, intangibles and imputed non-cash interest on convertible debt, a $12 million charge related to stock based compensation, and an $8.7 million charge for restructuring and non-recurring expenses, including the noted items, the second quarter fiscal 2010 GAAP net loss narrowed to $19.5 million, or a loss of $0.09 per share, from the previous quarters GAAP net loss of $31.9 million, or a loss of $0.15 per share.
Now looking at revenue by region, America’s revenue of $173.6 million was 50% of total revenue, up $21.9 million from the prior quarter. The increase included approximately $10 million from service provider, budget flush and growing demand from Latin America service providers.
Latin America revenue grew over 38% quarter-over-quarter. EMEA revenue of $94.8 million was 28% of total revenue, up $14.8 million from the prior quarter, as CommTest and CCOP products saw a rebound in demand from their seasonally low Q1 levels. Asia-Pac revenue was $75.4 million, up $8.5 million from the previous quarter, and represented 22% of total revenues. Asia-Pac revenue increased across all three business segments.
Moving to the segments, in the Test and Measurement segment second quarter revenue of $176.9 million was up 23.4% from the previous quarter’s $143.4 million, and up 2.3% from the prior year’s $173 million. As previously noted, the calendar year and budget flush from North America service providers was approximately $10 million. From a product standpoint our field test revenue grew by 16%.
Lab and production revenue grew by 70%, and service assurance grew 8%, as compared to the previous quarter. Geographically revenue increased across all regions sequentially. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one. Fiscal Q2 gross margin for Test and Measurement of 56% was down compared to the previous quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to an inventory write-down, and transition costs associated with our move to contract manufacturers.
These charges totaled approximately $4.3 million in the quarter. As a result of the higher revenue, the Test and Measurement second quarter operating profit of $31.5 million, or 17.8% of revenue, increased 75% when compared to the prior quarter’s operating profit of $18 million, or 12.6% of revenue. In Test and Measurement we continue to make progress on our transition to contract manufacturing.
We have completed the transition of our Indianapolis product lines and our Germantown, Maryland transition is expected to be largely complete by the end of fiscal 2010. Once we have completed this transition, over 70% of our CommTest product revenue will be manufactured by contract manufacturers. We maintain that the above initiative provides the structure to support gross margins in the 57% to 61% range, and sustainable operating margins between 20% and 23% at a quarterly revenue level of $175 million or greater.
Now moving on to our CCOP segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows. Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q2 was $95.6 million, up 11.2% when compared to the previous quarter’s revenue of $86 million, and down 12.7% when compared to the prior year’s $109.5 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from the previous quarter’s gross margin of 19.7%.
The improvement in gross margin is attributable to reduced manufacturing costs, higher utilization of our fabs, and a more favorable product mix. Book-to-bill was greater than 1 for the quarter. ASP decline was in our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Looking at the product lines, growth was strong for our datacom and telecom product lines, including our ROADMs, circuit packs, pluggables and tunables.
For example, ROADM revenue increased over 50% sequentially, and demand also increased for the third quarter in a row. With the completion of the consolidation of our optical fabs, our gross margin improvement initiatives are now focused on increasing factory utilization. Our target is for sustainable margins in the 25% to 30% range. We believe we can operate in this range by the end of fiscal 2010.
In our Lasers business second quarter revenue of $16.7 million was up 10.6% when compared to the previous quarter and gross margins for the quarter improved to 32.4%. Book-to-bill was also greater than one. On a total segment level, due to higher revenue and improved gross margin, operating income for CCOP was $3.2 million, which compares to an operating loss of $1.5 million in the prior quarter.
We believe the CCOP operating model supports operating margins of 10% to 15% at revenue levels of $150 million or greater per quarter. For the advance optical technologies or AOT segment fiscal Q2 revenue was $54.6 million up 0.9% compared to the previous quarter and up 2.8% compare to the prior year. Our custom Optics and Authentication Solutions groups delivered sequential growth of 10% and 15%, respectively.
Currency was relatively flat, and custom color products were down from the previous quarter. AOT book-to-bill was approximately one for the quarter. Fiscal Q2 gross margin for our AOT segment was 50%, down from the previous quarter. The decline in margin was due to factory utilization, as we executed against our inventory reduction plan. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $19.6 million, down from the previous quarter’s $20.6 million. The operating margin of 35.9% is in our targeted sustainable operating profit range of 34% to 37%.
Moving to the balance sheet for fiscal Q2 2010 the company reduced inventory levels by more than $11 million, and reduced its day’s sales outstanding by more than 3 days. As a result, the company was free cash flow positive $27.1 million for the quarter. The headcount as of January 2 was 3,944.
Moving to our operating model, we maintain that our cost structure is such that we can sustainably realize 10% operating margins when quarterly revenues are between $375 million and $385 million and gross margins are 46%.
Now to our Q3 guidance, first some points to consider, as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarters. Lead times from our component suppliers have increased and could impact revenues in the quarter. In Q2, due to supply constraints, we are unable to ship between $8 million of $10 million of customer demand.
Test and Measurement revenue is historically seasonally lower in the March quarter, as the December quarter revenue includes calendar year end budget flush spending from the carriers and carrier budgets are not typically released at the beginning of the March quarter.
Optical Communications ASP decline is expected to be above our quarterly range of 2% to 4% due to just completed pricing negotiations. Total operating expenses are expected to increase as we increase our investment in the AOT segment. Employer payroll taxes increase with the new calendar year and we will not have a companywide shutdown in Q3. The increase in operating expenses is estimated to be between $4 million and $5 million for the third fiscal quarter.
Finally, we expect our quarterly tax provision to range between $2 million and $4 million. Taking into consideration, the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect third quarter revenues to be between $325 million and $350 million; and non-GAAP operating margins to be between 5% and 7.5%.
Operator, we’ll now take questions.

I’d like to begin by providing an overview of our Q4 financial results followed by highlights of our business achievement in the quarter.JDSU reported revenue of $398.1 million, as we continued to see r",2161,"Thank you, Cherryl, and good afternoon everyone. I’d like to begin by providing an overview of our Q4 financial results followed by highlights of our business achievement in the quarter.
JDSU reported revenue of $398.1 million, as we continued to see robust demand across all of our segments. For the fifth quarter in the row, overall book-to-bill for the company was above 1. Each of our three segments also had a book-to-bill greater than 1 with particular strength in our CCOP segment.
Overall gross margin for the company improved to 45.5% from 44.1% last quarter and 42.2% last year as each segment improved its gross margin on a sequential basis. This quarter, we saw a return to more typical pricing environments in our CommTest and Optical communications businesses.
JDSU reported operating income of $37 million or 9.3% of revenue. In percentage terms, this is at the high end of the guidance we provided during our previous earnings call and represents in both dollar and percentage terms, JDSU’s highest level of quarterly operating income since December of 2007.
I’d also like to highlight the strength in our balance sheet. In Q4, JDSU generated cash from operations of approximately $47 million. The strong cash flow was driven by positive trends in working capital, as we reduced DSO sequentially from 65 to 63 days and posted an inventory turnover ratio above 7.
Now let me provide more details on the performance of our individual business segments. First, the CommTest segment. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $186.2 million, gross margin was 56.1% and operating margin was 11%.
In Q4, we completed transition of our North American high volume product revenue to contract manufacturers. Book-to-bill was greater than 1 for the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth in both revenue and bookings was driven by strong demand from North America and Asia Pacific.
The NSD acquisition from Agilent closed at the beginning of May and contributed approximately $16 million of revenue. This acquisition complements and strengthens our industry-leading CommTest product portfolio by creating an end-to-end wireless network test solution and expands our addressable market by nearly $800 million.
We are now positioned to provide test equipment in services to support the accelerating transition to LTE. In fact, our technology leadership was recognized by wireless industry experts in June when JDSU’s LTE Network Trial Solution won the best testing product for LTE award at the Annual LTE World Summit in Amsterdam.
Also in June, we announced that our Signaling Analyzer Real Time, or SART, solution quickly and successfully validated results from rapidly changing test scenarios during a series of intense two-week long major LTE interoperability trials in Dusseldorf and Beijing.
Finally, we expect LTE deployments will be ramping in calendar 2011. We are already engaged with over a dozen network equipment manufacturers and service providers around the world. In Q4, we recognized revenue from LTE customers in the U.S., Korea, Germany, Sweden, France, and Japan.
Emerging technologies such as LTE, the accelerating adoption of smartphones and the rapid expansion of mobile video are key drivers for investments in more efficient and cost effective Ethernet backhaul. As such, Ethernet backhaul test applications are continuing to expand on a global basis and continue to be significant driver of bookings and revenue in this segment.
Another growth driver for CommTest is DOCSIS 3.0. We believe JDSU has a unique, competitive advantage based on our DSAM DOCSIS 3.0 chipset’s ability to test faster speeds than our competitors. While competitors struggle to test 100 megabytes downstream, JDSU’s DSAM supports 300 megabytes downstream for the U.S. and 400 megabytes downstream for EMEA and most of Asia.
North America remains our strongest market for DOCSIS 3.0, but we also have good traction in Europe and see growing interest across Asia, particularly in Japan and Korea. Shipments for DOCSIS 3.0 exceeded $9 million in Q4. According to Prime Data, in May 2010, JDSU has a number one worldwide market share in cable test.
We also continue to lead the market in high-speed optical testing for both lab and field applications. Last quarter, we shipped six 100 gig systems to network equipment manufacturing customers in Japan, Germany, U.K. and the U.S.
In addition, we shipped 21 40 gig systems to customers in the U.S. Europe and Asia during the quarter with notable increase in the number of 40 gig systems shipped for field applications. The continued growth of our 40 gig business indicates that 40 gig is a natural progression in the evolution of Tier 1 carrier networks worldwide.
Last week Frost and Sullivan recognized JDSU solution-base and value-added approach in supporting a broad range of communications technology with two awards.
Both awards noted our leading edge product and service portfolio which along with our focus on collaborative innovation help our customers cost effectively deploy high quality, next generation networks and technologies including 40 gig and 100 gig, IPTV, mobile backhaul and wireless LTE 4G communications.
As I conclude this section pertaining the CommTest, I would also like to make you aware of an initiative that is underway with the purpose of accelerating improvements in the business model for this segment. This initiative includes a number of process improvements as well as organizational changes.
The process improvements are mainly in the operations area and include demand management as well as contract manufacture interface. Along with these process improvements, a number of leadership changes have taken place within the operations team, including the recruitment of key skill sets from outside the company.
Significant progress has been made in this area already. Dave Holly, the President and General Manager of CommTest will change positions and take on the leadership role for developing emerging markets for this business segment. Dave, who has a deep understanding of our technologies and products, will be responsible for accelerating our growth and position in these fast growing markets.
As President and General Manager of CommTest Dave led the segment through an important phase of its business evolution. Key strategic initiatives including significantly expanding our addressable markets with the acquisitions of NSD and SNT and transitioning our North American manufacturing activities to contract manufacturers took place during his tenure. I would like to thank Dave for these significant accomplishments and look forward to his future contributions in his new role.
An external search for the next President and General Manager of CommTest is underway and I expect the selection process to be completed in a reasonable period of time. From now until the new leader is in place, the executive staff members of CommTest will report directly to me.
Moving on to our CCOP segment, which is comprised of two businesses, Optical Communications and Lasers. The combined CCOP results are as follows. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $157.3 million and operating margin was approximately 12%, which is now within our target model range for this segment.
Now let me provide more color on each business. First, Optical Communications. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $134.7 million and gross margin was 28.5%. We saw a significant demand growth in this business as revenue for 10 of our 11 product lines grew sequentially with the highest growth in circuit packs, gesture recognition tunables and ROADMs.
All geographic regions grew quarter-to-quarter and we recorded record revenue in China for the fourth quarter in a row. Book-to-bill for Optical Communications was solidly above 1.
In order to meet the increased demand, we have initiatives in place to increase our production capacity by 33% during fiscal year ‘11, particularly in areas where we have significant product differentiation such as our tunable XFPs, ROADMs, and Super Transport Blade as well as gesture recognition.
This capacity will be the result of the combination of improved utilization in yields and selective equipment purchases, while we maintain our current fabrication process footprint.
Revenue from products introduced within the last two years continued to gain momentum and accounted for more than half of our total Optical Communications revenue in Q4. Tunable XFP revenue almost tripled sequentially as we ship product to 32 customers and 43 design slots during the quarter. Another new product, the Super Transport Blade grew 50% sequentially.
Our next generation 50 gigahertz ROADM continues to ramp and more than doubled in revenue this quarter. In total, ROADM revenue in Q4 grew 24% sequentially and was again over 25% of total Optical Communications revenue. ROADM bookings continued to be very strong with a book-to-bill significantly greater than 1 for the second straight quarter.
Finally, revenue from gesture recognition grew meaningfully as well. Q4 was our second quarter of shipping laser diodes from this segment to a leading home gaming provider. The top line growth in Optical Communications has been accompanied by sustained improvement in its operating model.
Optical Communications gross margin improved from 26% in fiscal Q3 to 28.5% in fiscal Q4 as we continue to optimize our supply chain and benefited from higher utilization of our fabs.
Turning to our laser’s business within the CCOP segment, fiscal Q4 revenue was $22.6 million, a sequential increase of 21% driven by growth in a semiconductor and microelectronic materials processing end markets. Gross margin improved to 44.6% compared to 41.3% last quarter. Book-to-bill was greater than 1.
Last month, we announced the partnership with Amada to develop a high-power 4 kilowatt fiber laser. This fiber laser has been integrated into a new sheet metal cutting system that Amada reports will provide the fastest linear cutting speed available worldwide.
This collaboration has opened the laser market kilowatt materials processing to JDSU. According to estimates by analyst firm Strategies Unlimited, this kilowatt materials processing market will grow to more than $1 billion by 2013.
We have received very positive feedback on the announcement as industry insiders recognize the complementary strengths JDSU and Amada bring to this collaboration. This laser cutting system will be unveiled at a trade show in Germany this October, and we expect a global market introduction in June of 2011.
Our lasers group has also been developing concentrated photovoltaic or CPV sales for the solar market aimed at large commercial and utility scale installations. In Q4, we were qualified and received production orders from our first customer for CPV sales. We are engaged with several other customers and we will continue to update you on our progress in the coming quarters.
The growth in gesture recognition and solar are examples of opportunities that leverage our extensive technology in order to expand our non-telecom customer base in the CCOP segment.
Our third and final segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $54.6 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially, primarily due to lower currency pigments demand. Despite the revenue decline, AOT improved its gross margin sequentially from 51.5% in Q3 to 51.9% in Q4. Operating margin continues to be within the target range at 36.3%. Book-to-bill was greater than one.
Q4 marked the start of production of optical filters targeting gesture recognition systems. We have seen steady demand for specialized filters for gesture recognition and 3D applications. Recently, we opened a new manufacturing site in China to support the demand from the consumer electronics sector for these products.
We also saw demand pick up in office automation, where JDSU supplies front surface mirrors for devices such printers, scanners, copiers and multifunction devices as well as audio/visual equipment and projectors. Bookings and revenue growth in this market is being driven by recovering global demand for these devices.
In summary, fiscal 2010 was a year of solid top line growth for JDSU, driven by demand recovery in several key markets, revenue growth from innovative products in all of our segments and our two acquisitions.
At the same time, we continue to execute against our stated strategic priorities resolving in an improved operating model, a strong balance sheet and sustained positive cash flow. Looking ahead to fiscal year ‘11, we expect to build on our strategic priorities to grow the business.
JDSU is a global leader in the current markets it serves, aligned with strong growth drivers such as increasing broadband demand, the need for leading edge authentication in commercial laser applications.
At the same time, we will continue to identify and pursue opportunities to diversify into emerging growth opportunities, such as gesture recognition, 3D and Solar.
We will support this by continuing to focus on profitable market-driven innovation, collaborating closely with our customers to provide differentiated solutions that address specific needs and deliver immediate value, and by advancing our corporate culture towards lean and continued process improvement.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I would like to thank our employees whose focus, commitment and tremendous efforts led to a stronger, more profitable JDSU in fiscal ‘10. I would also like to thank our customers, partners, vendors and long-term shareholders for their continued support of JDSU.
With that, I’ll hand the call over to Dave who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q4 and fiscal year end 2010, and will discuss our outlook for Q1.

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise. Fourth quarter revenue of $398.1 million was up 19.6% from the prior quarter, and up 45.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.The sequen",1472,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise. Fourth quarter revenue of $398.1 million was up 19.6% from the prior quarter, and up 45.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
The sequential revenue increase was from two segments, the CCOP segment, as demand for optical products continue to outpace supply, and the CommTest segment, as we recognized two months of revenue from our NSD acquisition and we had our normal seasonal increasing demand from carriers.
Fourth quarter gross margin was 45.5%, up from the previous quarter’s gross margin of 44.1% and up from fourth quarter fiscal 2009’s gross margin of 42.2%. The fourth quarter gross margin improvement reflects the NSD acquisition and improved factory utilization in both the CCOP and AOT segments.
Operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter of $144.1 million included $12.4 million of operating expense from the NSD acquisition. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 36.2%, down from the prior quarter’s 37.4%.
As a result of improved gross margins and operating expense leverage, our operating income for the quarter of $37 million was 9.3% of revenue, which compares to a 6.6% operating margin for the prior quarter.
Net income for the fourth quarter of $33.1 million or $0.15 per share, compares to a third quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $23.2 million or $0.10 per share.
For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $1.37 billion, up 7% from the prior year’s $1.28 billion. Gross margin for the full fiscal year was 44.6%, up from 42.8% for fiscal 2009.
Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $97.4 million or 7.1% of revenue, up from 2.4% of revenue for fiscal 2009. Improved operating income is primarily due to higher revenues and higher gross margins. Our net income for the year was $91.9 million or $0.41 per share, up from $42.6 million or $0.20 per share for fiscal 2009.
A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today’s press release. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP results exclude among other items, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles of $21.5 million, a $10 million charge related to stock-based compensation and acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $7.2 million and a $13.2 million of investment income from the sale of our investment in Fabrinet.
Including the noted items, the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 GAAP net income was $1.5 million or earnings of $0.01 per share, which compares to a prior year fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $63.6 million or a loss of $0.29 per share.
For the full fiscal year, GAAP net loss was $61.8 million or a loss of $0.28 per share, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $909.5 million or a loss of $4.22 per share for fiscal year 2009.
Now, looking at quarterly revenue by region; Americas revenue of $194.5 million or 48.9% of total revenue was up over $40 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased revenue from North American service providers and network equipment manufacturers.
EMEA revenue of $104 million or 26.1% of total revenue was up approximately $8 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to increased revenue from network equipment manufacturers.
Asia Pacific revenue was $99.6 million or 25% of total revenue, up over $14 million from the prior quarter due to increased carrier demand and increased demand for gesture recognition products.
Moving to the segments; in the CommTest segment, fourth quarter revenue of $186.2 million was up 27.7% from the previous quarter and up 40.4% from the prior year. The sequential revenue increase includes approximately $15.7 million of revenue from the NSD acquisition and seasonal demand from carriers.
From a CommTest product standpoint, our service assurance revenue doubled sequentially in fiscal Q4 due to the NSD acquisition, while field test revenue grew by 27% and lab and production revenue grew 16%. Revenue from all three geographies grew sequentially as well.
Fiscal Q4 gross margin for CommTest at 56.1% was up compared to the prior quarter but still below our targeted range of 57% to 61%. Gross margin was favorably impacted by the NSD revenue, which was partially offset by charges required to meet our customer needs such as expedite fees paid to vendors.
CommTest operating profit of $20.5 million or 11% of revenue increased more than 3 percentage points when compared to the prior quarter’s operating margin.
The operating margin growth was due to higher revenue and improved profitability in this segment exclusive of the NSD acquisition. The NSD acquisition had an operating loss of $2.5 million near the low end of the expected range.
CommTest targeted operating margins are between 20% to 23% at a quarterly revenue level of $175 million or greater. Our objective is to attain this targeted range by the end of the calendar year.
Now, moving on to our CCOP segment, breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows. Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q4 was $134.7 million, up 22.6% when compared to the prior quarter’s revenue and up nearly 70% when compared to the prior year. Due to supplying capacity constraints, we were unable to ship over $10 million of Optical Communications’ demand this quarter.
Sequential ASP decline was just over 2% and at the lower end of our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 28.5%, up from the prior quarter’s gross margin of 26%. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization. We believe our Optical Communications’ gross margin can exceed 30% when quarterly revenues are $150 million or more.
In our Lasers business, fourth quarter revenue of $22.6 million was up 20.7% when compared to the prior quarter. Gross margins were 44.6%, up from 41.3% due to improved utilization on higher revenue.
Total CCOP revenue was $157.3 million, up 22.3% from the prior quarter. Operating income was $19.1 million or 12.1% of revenue. The CCOP segment is now operating in its targeted operating margin range of 10% to 15%.
For the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q4 revenue was $54.6 million, down 6.8% compared to the prior quarter. We saw strength in our coatings business, as well as a modest improvement in our transaction card business relative to the previous quarter. At the same time, we saw lower demand for our currency pigments. As previously noted, the currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs.
Fiscal Q4 gross margin for our AOT business was 51.9%, up from 51.5% in the prior quarter, due to better factory utilization. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $19.8 million or 36.3% of revenue, down $2.7 million from the prior quarter.
The decline in operating margin was due primarily to lower revenues and increased investment in R&D and sales and marketing for the segment. The AOT segment continues to operate in its targeted operating margin range of 34% to 37%.
Moving to the balance sheet, for fiscal Q4 2010, the company generated $46.9 million of cash from operations, reflecting improved inventory turns and lower day sales outstanding. For the full year, the company generated $119.2 million of cash from operations. As of the end of the fiscal year, the company held $600.1 million in total cash and investments. Headcount for the company as of August 14, 2010 was 4,715.
Now, moving on to our operating model, our current operating model is for operating margins of 11% to 14% when revenue is between $415 million and $425 million, and gross margin is 46% or greater. Our objective is to achieve this operating model by the end of the calendar year.
Now, to our Q1 guidance, first, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarters. Our fiscal Q1 operating expenses will have a full quarter's worth of operating expense and temporary transition costs for our NSD acquisition, and incremental R&D and SG&A investments across all segments. We expect operating expenses to be between $155 million and $158 million.
CommTest operating margin is expected to be between 13% and 16% for the first fiscal quarter. These operating margins reflect the typical revenue seasonality of the segment and the temporary incremental costs resulting from the NSD acquisition.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 5% of revenue for the next several quarters, as we are purchasing capital for the NSD acquisition and strategically investing to expand capacity for our CCOP and AOT segments to meet customer demand.
Taking into consideration the factors above, and based on our current visibility, we expect first quarter revenue to be between $410 million and $425 million and non-GAAP operating margin to be between 8.5% and 10.5%.
Thank you. Operator, we will now take questions.

I was just wondering for the September quarter, are you expecting the NSD business to get to that $40 million run rate. It seems then you acquired it for, as you talked about, this product transition, does that takes a little bit longer? That also frames my question on guidance, as you essentially assume the full quarter of NSD at about 40 million, it sounds like the rest of the business is relatively flat to down. Is that due to the CommTest seasonality? That’s my first question.

So as Tom had mentioned, we don’t expect that pricing dynamic to continue. We expect to have some of these other costs behind us to the transitions. So those are the elements plus we’ll have a full quarter of NSD without having some of these incremental NSD transition costs. So those are really the main points.
If you look at the Test and Measurement business, without the NSD impact you’d have seen that we were almost 14% operating profit for the quarter. So we think we’ve got a model that gets us there. We think that it’s about execution as always and we’re positioning ourselves to do that.

I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q4 financial results followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter. JDSU reported revenue of $398.1 million as we continue to see",2168,"Thank you, Cherryl, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q4 financial results followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter. JDSU reported revenue of $398.1 million as we continue to see robust demand across all of our segments. For the fifth quarter in a row, overall book-to-bill for the company was above one. Each of our three segments also had a book-to-bill greater than one with particular strength in our CCOP [Communications and Commercial Optical Products] segment. 
Overall gross margin for the company improved to 45.5% from 44.1% last quarter and 42.2% last year, as each segment improved its gross margin on a sequential basis. This quarter, we saw a return to a more typical pricing environments in our CommTest and Optical Communications businesses. 
JDSU reported operating income of $37 million or 9.3% of revenue. In percentage terms, this is at the high end of the guidance we provided during our previous earnings call and represents in both dollar and percentage terms, JDSU's highest level of quarterly operating income since December of 2007. 
I would also like to highlight the strength in our balance sheet. In Q4, JDSU generated cash from operations of approximately $47 million. The stronger cash flow was driven by positive trends in working capital as we reduced DSO sequentially from 65 to 63 days and posted an inventory turnover ratio above seven. 
Now let me provide more details on the performance of our individual business segments. First, the CommTest segment. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $186.2 million, gross margin was 56.1% and operating margin was 11%. In Q4, we completed during the transition of our North American high-volume product revenue to contract manufacturers. Book-to-bill was greater than one for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
Growth in both revenue and bookings was driven by strong demand from North America and Asia-Pacific. The NSD acquisition from Agilent closed at the beginning of May and contributed approximately $16 million of revenue. This acquisition complements and strengthens our industry-leading CommTest product portfolio by creating an end-to-end wireless network test solution and expands our addressable market by nearly $800 million. 
We are now positioned to provide test equipment and services to support the accelerating transition to LTE. In fact, our technology leadership was recognized by wireless industry experts in June when JDSU's LTE network trial solution won the best testing product for LTE award at the annual LTE World Summit in Amsterdam. Also in June, we announced that our Signaling Analyzer Real Time or SART solution quickly and successfully validated results from rapidly changing test scenarios during a series of intense two-week long major LTE interoperability trials in Düsseldorf and Beijing. 
Finally, we expect LTE deployments will be ramping in calendar 2011. We are already engaged with over a dozen network equipment manufacturers and service providers around the world. In Q4, we recognized revenue from LTE customers in the U.S., Korea, Germany, Sweden, France and Japan. Emerging technologies such as LTE, the accelerating adoption of smart phones and the rapid expansion of mobile video are key drivers for investments in more efficient and cost-effective Ethernet backhaul. As such, Ethernet backhaul test applications are continuing to expand on a global basis and continue to be a significant driver of bookings and revenue in this segment. 
Another growth driver for CommTest is DOCSIS 3.0. We believe JDSU has a unique competitive advantage based on our DSAM DOCSIS 3.0 chipset's ability to test faster speed than our competitors. While competitors struggle to test 100 megabits downstream, JDSU's DSAM supports 300 megabits downstream for the U.S. and 400 megabits downstream for EMEA and most of Asia. North America remains our strongest market for DOCSIS 3.0 but we also have good traction in Europe and see growing interest across Asia, particularly in Japan and Korea. 
Shipments for DOCSIS 3.0 exceeded $9 million in Q4. According to Prime Data in May 2010, JDSU has the number one worldwide market share in cable tests. 
We also continue to lead the market in high-speed optical testing for both WAP and field applications. Last quarter, we shipped six 100 Gig systems to network equipment manufacturing customers in Japan, Germany, U.K. and the U.S. In addition, we shipped 21 40 Gig systems to customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia during the quarter with notable increase in the number of 40 Gig systems shipped for field applications. The continued growth of our 40 Gig business indicates that 40 Gig is a natural progression in the evolution of Tier 1 carrier networks worldwide. 
Last week, Frost & Sullivan recognized JDSU's solution-based and value-added approach in supporting a broad range of communications technology with two awards. Both awards noted our leading-edge product and service portfolio, which along with our focus on collaborative innovation, help our customers cost effectively deploy high-quality, next-generation networks and technologies, including 40 Gig, a 100 Gig, IPTV, mobile backhaul and wireless LTE/4G communications. 
As I conclude this section pertaining to CommTest, I would also like to make you aware of an initiative that is underway with the purpose of accelerating improvements in the business model for this segment. This initiative includes a number of process improvements, as well as organizational changes. The process improvements are mainly in the operations area and include demand management, as well as contract manufacturer interface. Along with these process improvements, a number of leadership changes have taken place within the operations team, including the recruitment of key skill sets from outside the company. Significant progress has been made in this area already. 
Dave Holly, the President and General Manager of CommTest will change positions and take on the leadership role for developing emerging markets for this business segment. Dave, who has a deep understanding of our technologies and products will be responsible for accelerating our growth and positioning in this fast-growing markets. As President and General Manager of CommTest, Dave led the segment through an important phase of its business evolution. Key strategic initiatives, including significantly expanding our addressable markets with the acquisitions of NSD and SNT [Storage Network Test], and transitioning our North American manufacturing activities to contract manufacturers, took place during his tenure. I would like to thank Dave for these significant accomplishments and I look forward to his future contributions in his new role. 
An external search for the next to President and General Manager of CommTest is underway and I expect the selection process to be completed in a reasonable period of time. For now, until the new leader is in place, the Executive staff members of CommTest will report directly to me. 
Moving on to our CCOP segment, which is comprised of two businesses, Optical Communications and Lasers. The combined CCOP results are as follows: Fiscal Q4 revenue was $157.3 million and operating margin was approximately 12%, which is now within our target model range for this segment. 
Now let me provide more color on each business. First, Optical Communications. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $134.7 million and gross margin was 28.5%. We saw a significant demand growth in this business as revenue for 10 of our 11 product lines grew sequentially with the highest growth in circuit packs, gesture recognition, tunables and ROADMs. All geographic regions grew quarter-to-quarter and we recorded record revenue in China for the fourth quarter in a row. Book-to-bill for Optical Communications was solidly above one. 
In order to meet the increased demand, we have initiatives in place to increase our production capacity by 33% during fiscal year '11, particularly in areas where we have significant product differentiation, such as our tunable XFPs, ROADMs and Super Transport Blades, as well as gesture recognition. This capacity will be the result of a combination of improved utilization and yields and selective equipment purchases, while we maintain our current fabrication process footprint. 
Revenue from products introduced within the last two years continue to gain momentum and accounted for more than half of our total Optical Communications revenue in Q4. Tunable XFP revenue almost tripled sequentially as we shipped product to 32 customers and 43 design slots during the quarter. Another new product, the Super Transport Blade, grew 50% sequentially. 
Our next-generation 50 gigahertz ROADM continues to ramp and more than doubled in revenue this quarter. In total, ROADM revenue in Q4 grew 24% sequentially, and was again over 25% of total Optical Communications revenue. ROADM's bookings continue to be very strong with the book-to-bill significantly greater than one for the second straight quarter. 
Finally, revenue from gesture recognition grew meaningfully as well. Q4 was our second quarter of shipping Laser diodes from this segment to a leading home gaming provider. The top line growth in Optical Communications has been accompanied by sustained improvement in its operating model. Optical Communications gross margin improved from 26% in fiscal Q3 to 28.5% in fiscal Q4 as we continue to optimize our supply chain and benefited from higher utilization of our fabs. 
Turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $22.6 million, a sequential increase of 21%, driven by growth in the semiconductor and microelectronic materials processing end markets. Gross margin improved to 44.6% compared to 41.3% last quarter. Book-to-bill was greater than one. 
Last month, we announced the partnership with Amada to develop a high-power 4-kilowatt fiber laser. This fiber laser has been integrated into a new sheet metal cutting system that Amada reports will provide the fastest linear cutting speed available worldwide. This collaboration has opened the laser market for kilowatt materials processing to JDSU. According to estimates by analysts firm, Strategies Unlimited, this kilowatt materials processing market will grow to more than $1 billion by 2013. We received very positive feedback on the announcement, as industry insiders recognized the complementary strengths JDSU and Amada bring to this collaboration. This laser cutting system will be unveiled at a trade show in Germany this October and we expect a global market introduction in June of 2011. 
Our Lasers group has also been developing concentrated photovoltaic or CPV cells for the solar market, aimed at large commercial and utility scale installations. In Q4, we were qualified and received production orders from our first customer for CPV cells. We are engaged with several other customers and will continue to update you on our progress in the coming quarters. 
The growth in gesture recognition and solar are examples of opportunities that leverage our extent of technology in order to expand our non-telecom customer base in the CCOP segment. 
Our third and final segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Fiscal Q4 revenue was $54.6 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially, primarily due to lower currency pigments demand. Despite the revenue decline, AOT. improved this gross margin sequentially from 51.5% in Q3 to 51.9% in Q4. Operating margin continues to be within the target range of 36.3%. Book-to-bill was greater than one. 
Q4 marked the start of production of optical filters, targeting gesture recognition systems. We are seeing steady demand for specialized filters for gesture recognition and 3D applications. Recently, we opened a new manufacturing site in China to support the demand from the consumer electronics sector for these products. We also saw demand pickup in office automation, where JDSU supplies front surface mirrors for devices such as printers, scanners, copiers and multi-function devices, as well as audiovisual equipment and projectors. Bookings and revenue growth in this market is being driven by recovering global demand for these devices. 
In summary, fiscal 2010 was a year of solid top line growth for JDSU driven by demand recovery in several key markets, revenue growth from innovative products in all of our segments and our two acquisitions. At the same time, we continue to execute against our stated strategic priorities, resulting in an improved operating model, a strong balance sheet and sustained positive cash flow. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '11, we expect to build on our strategic priorities to grow the business. JDSU is a global leader in the current markets it serves, aligned with strong growth drivers such as increasing broadband demand, and the need for leading edge authentication and commercial laser applications. 
At the same time, we will continue to identify and pursue opportunities to diversify into emerging growth opportunities such as gesture recognition, 3D and Solar. We will support this by continuing to focus on profitable, market-driven innovation, collaborating closely with our customers to provide differentiated solutions that address specific needs and deliver immediate value and by advancing our corporate culture towards lean and continued process improvement. 
As I conclude my formal remarks, I would like to thank our employees who's focus, commitment and tremendous efforts led to a stronger, more profitable JDSU in fiscal '10. I would also like to thank our customers, partners, vendors and long-term shareholders for their continued support of JDSU. With that, I'll hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q4 and fiscal year-end 2010 and will discuss our outlook for Q1."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. Fourth quarter revenue of $398.1 million was up 19.6% from the prior quarter and up 45.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These sequent",1475,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. Fourth quarter revenue of $398.1 million was up 19.6% from the prior quarter and up 45.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These sequential revenue increase was from two segments: The CCOP segment, as demand for optical products continue to outpace supply; and the CommTest segment, as we recognized two months of revenue from our NSD acquisition and we had our normal seasonal increase in demand from carriers. 
Fourth quarter gross margin was 45.5%, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 44.1% and up from fourth quarter fiscal 2009's gross margin of 42.2%. The fourth quarter gross margin improvement reflects the NSD acquisition and improved factory utilization in both the CCOP and AOT segments. 
Operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter of $144.1 million, included $12.4 million of operating expenses from the NSD acquisition. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 36.2%, down from the prior quarter's 37.4%. As a result of improved gross margins and operating expense leverage, our operating income for the quarter of $37 million was 9.3% of revenue, which compares to a 6.6% operating margin for the prior quarter. 
Net income for the fourth quarter of $33.1 million or $0.15 per share compared to a third quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $23.2 million or $0.10 per share. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $1.37 billion, up 7% from the prior year's $1.28 billion. Gross margin for the full fiscal year was 44.6%, up from 42.8% for fiscal 2009. Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $97.4 million or 7.1% of revenue, up from 2.4% of revenue for fiscal 2009. 
Improved operating income is primarily due to higher revenues and higher gross margins. Our net income for the year was $91.9 million or $0.41 per share, up from $42.6 million or $0.20 or share for fiscal 2009. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today's press release. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles of $21.5 million, a $10 million charge related to stock-based compensation, an acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $7.2 million and $13.2 million of investment income from the sale of our investment in Fabrinet. 
Including the noted items, the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 GAAP net income was $1.5 million or earnings of $0.01 per share, which compares to our prior year fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $63.6 million or a loss of $0.29 per share. For the full fiscal year, GAAP net loss was $61.8 million or a loss of $0.28 per share, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $909.5 million or a loss of $4.22 per share for fiscal year 2009. 
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $194.5 million or 48.9% of total revenue, was up over $40 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased revenue from North American service providers and network equipment manufacturers. EMEA revenue of $104 million or 26.1% of total revenue was up approximately $8 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to increased revenue from Network Equipment Manufacturers. Asia-Pacific revenue was $99.6 million or 25% of total revenue, up over $14 million from the prior quarter due to increased carrier demand and increased demand for gesture recognition products. 
Moving to the segments. In the CommTest segment, fourth quarter revenue of $186.2 million was up 27.7% from the previous quarter and up 40.4% from the prior-year. The sequential revenue increase includes approximately $15.7 million of revenue from the NSD acquisition and seasonal demand from carriers. 
From a CommTest product standpoint, our service assurance revenue doubled sequentially in fiscal Q4 due to the NSD acquisition, while field test revenue grew by 27% and lab & production revenue grew 16%. Revenue from all three geographies grew sequentially as well. Fiscal Q4 gross margin for CommTest of 56.1% was up compared to the prior quarter, but still below our targeted range of 57% to 61%. 
Gross margin was favorably impacted by the NSD revenue, which was partially offset by charges required to meet our customer needs, such as expedited fees paid to vendors. 
Now on just the operating profit of $20.5 million or 11% of revenue increased more than three percentage points when compared to the prior quarter's operating margin. The operating margin growth was due to higher revenue and improved profitability in the segment, exclusive of the NSD acquisition. The NSD acquisition had an operating loss of $2.5 million, near the low end of the expected range. CommTest targeted operating margins of between 20% to 23% at a quarterly revenue level of $175 million or greater. Our objective is to attain this targeted range by the end of the calendar year. 
Now moving on to our CCOP segment. Breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q4 was $134.7 million, up 22.6% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up nearly 70% when compared to the prior year. Due to supply and capacity constraints, we were unable to ship over $10 million of Optical Communications demand this quarter. 
Sequential ASP decline was just over 2% and at the lower end of our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 28.5%, up from the prior quarter's gross margin of 26%. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization. We believe our Optical Communication's gross margin can exceed 30% when quarterly revenues are $150 million or more. 
In our Lasers business, fourth quarter revenue of $22.6 million was up 20.7% when compared to the prior quarter. Gross margins were 44.6%, up from 41.3% due to improved utilization on higher revenue. Total CCOP revenue was $157.3 million, up 22.3% from the prior quarter. Operating income was $19.1 million or 12.1% of revenue. The CCOP segment is now operating in its targeted operating margin range of 10% to 15%. 
With the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q4 revenue was $54.6 million, down  6.8% compared to the prior quarter. We saw strength in our Coatings business, as well as a modest improvement in our Transaction Card business, relative to the previous quarter. At the same time, we saw lower demand for our currency pigments. As previously noted, the currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. 
Fiscal Q4 gross margin for our AOT business was 51.9%, up from 51.5% in the prior quarter due to better factory utilization. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $19.8 million, or 36.3% of revenue, down $2.7 million from the prior quarter. The decline in operating margin was due primarily to lower revenues and increased investment in R&D and sales and marketing for the segment. The AOT segment continues to operate in its targeted operating margin range of 34% to 37%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q4 of 2010, the company generated $46.9 million of cash from operations, reflecting improved inventory turns and lower days sales outstanding. For the full year, the company generated $119.2 million of cash from operations. As of the end of the fiscal year, the company held $600.1 million in total cash and investments. Headcount for the company as of August 14, 2010, was 4,715. 
Now moving on to our operating model. Our current operating model is for operating margins of 11% to 14% when revenue is between $415 million and $425 million and gross margin is 46% or greater. Our objective is to achieve this operating model by the end of the calendar year. 
Now to our Q1 guidance. First, some points to consider as you think about our financial performance over the coming quarters. Our fiscal Q1 operating expenses will have a full quarter's worth of operating expense and temporary transition costs for our NSD acquisition, and incremental R&D and SG&A investments across all segments. We expect operating expenses to be between $155 million $158 million. 
CommTest operating margin is expected to be between 13% and 16% for the first fiscal quarter. These operating margins reflect the typical revenue seasonality of the segment and the temporary incremental costs resulting from the NSD acquisition. Our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 5% of revenue for the next several quarters as we are purchasing capital for the NSD acquisition and strategically investing to expand capacity for our CCOP and AOT segments to meet customer demand. 
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect first quarter revenue to be between $410 million and $425 million, and non-GAAP operating margin to be between 8.5% and 10.5%. Thank you. And operator, we would now take questions."

I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q1 financial results followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter.JDSU reported revenue of $411.3 million inclusive of contribu",1926,"Thank you, Cherryl, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q1 financial results followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter.
JDSU reported revenue of $411.3 million inclusive of contributions from our NSD acquisition, which represents growth of 37.7% year-on-year and 3.3% sequentially. Book-to-bill for the company was above 1 for the sixth straight quarter, driven by strong bookings in our Optical Communications business.
Gross profit of $195.1 million or 47.4% of revenue improved from 44% in the prior fiscal year and 45.5% last quarter. In both dollar and percentage terms, this represents the highest level of quarterly gross profit for the company in the last five year.
JDSU also reported operating income of $44.4 million or 10.8% compared to 3.4% in the prior fiscal year and 9.3% in the prior quarter. This operating margin exceeds our guidance and is the second highest reported by the company in the last five years. This is within sight of our target operating model of 11% to 14% operating margin when quarterly revenue was greater than $415 million.
Now, let me provide highlights from each of our individual business segments. Given recent mixed messages with respect to the Optical Communications sector, I would like to begin with our CCOP segment. This segment is comprised of two businesses, Optical Communications and Lasers.
The combined CCOP results are as follows. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $168 million and operating margin was approximately 14.4% at the high end of our target model for this segment. Gross margin of 31.9% has improved by more than 11 percentage points year-on-year. Book-to-bill for the segment was the greater than 1.
Now, let me provide more color on each business. First, Optical Communications; fiscal Q1 revenue was $143 million and gross margin was 29.5%. Gross margin improved by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year and 1 percentage point sequentially due to primarily an increasing mix of new products and cost production activities.
On the revenue side, the 66% year-on-year and 6% sequential revenue increase was driven primarily by growth in our ROADMs, circuit packs, tunable XFPs, gesture recognition products.
Revenue from products introduced within the last two years accounted for more than 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q1 exceeding our target of 50%. We believe that we are positioned very well with our customers and with our differentiated product offerings to see continued growth in this business.
Fiscal Q1 book-to-bill was significantly greater than 1. Our combined book-to-bill was greater 1.6 for our ROADMs, circuit packs, and tunable XFPs. Our Optical Communication backlog entering fiscal Q2 was at the highest level in many years.
We did have a few product lines where our book-to-bill was less than 1 in fiscal Q1. These were telecom pumps, passive components, and pluggables with a combined book-to-bill was approximately 0.85.
I would now like to provide an update on some of our key products beginning with our tunable XFP. In Q1, tunable XFPs accounted for approximately 7% of total Optical Communications revenue.
Since its introduction, JDSU has shipped more than 12,000 tunable XFPs. We believe demand will remain strong as customers design new variant of the product.
In September at the ECOC trade show, we highlighted and enhanced tunable XFP, which features technology that provides improved performance for network transmission, including increased optical output power and improved optical signal-to-noise performance.
We are executing our tunable roadmap to continue to provide additional differentiated products to our customers. Gesture recognition also grew for the fourth consecutive quarter.
As a reminder, we supply two key products for our current gaming platform, laser diodes from our Optical Communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. The combined revenue from these two products in fiscal Q1 was greater than 3% of total JDSU revenue.
ROADM revenue grew more than 150% year-on-year and 9% sequentially and was again over 25% of total Optical revenue. Book-to-bill for ROADMs continues to be significantly over 1.
Revenue for the Super Transport Blade has grown 14 times in the past year and 28% sequentially. Our Mini 50 gigahertz and Mini 100 gigahertz WSS product line are also significant contributors to our continued success in the market as they now represent more than 50% of our total ROADM revenue.
This quarter, we enhanced our offerings by introducing low port-count WSS products for both the Mini 50 and Mini 100 offerings. These low port-count offerings are designed to divided high performance, but lower cost points for ads in metro regions through the network.
Our market leadership in ROADMs was recognized by Infonetics Research last month. Additionally, we are seeing strong demand for our 40 gigabit and 100 gigabit products. Through close collaboration with our customers, we are winning designs slots for our components at the leading network equipment manufacturers.
Our component and module roadmap is strong, and through partnerships with key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see strong traction with our customers for both line side and client side 40 gigabits and 100 gigabit solutions.
Demand continues to exceed shipment across the majority of our product line and we are steadily ramping our ability to supply these products in greater volume, particularly for our competitively differentiated products such as the tunable XFP, Super Transport Blade, gesture recognition, and ROADMs.
Early in fiscal Q1, we had a number of external supply constraint. These constraints eased later in the quarter and this led to better capacity utilization and increased shipments as we progress through Q1. Since June, we’ve increased our production capacity significantly, and we expect that over the course of the fiscal year, we will have added 50% more operating capacity.
Turning to our lasers business within the CCOP segment, fiscal Q1 revenue grew approximately 11% sequentially to $25 million, while gross margin improved to 45.5% due to product mix and continued cost improvements. Book-to-bill was less than 1 for the quarter.
The recently launched JDSU 4 kilowatt fiber laser product continues to gain market traction. Incorporated into the heart of the Amada laser cutting system for metal processing applications, the JDSU laser enables up to three times higher processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. Only last week, Amada won Best Product at the EuroBlech International Sheet Metal Trade Show in Germany for this system.
We expect the 4 kilowatt fiber laser to be shipping at low volumes in the beginning of calendar 2011 and in full production by the summer of 2011. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulsed lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing products used in high-precision micromachining applications. We expect first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012.
Moving on to CommTest segment, last month, we named David Heard as the President of our Communications Test & Measurement segment. David brings a depth of experience and extensive industry knowledge to this role in areas that are key to JDSU’s growth strategy. During his 20 years in the communications sector, David has grown and managed a range of networking and wireless businesses and has extensive operational and the international experience. I’m pleased to welcome David to JDSU’s senior leadership team and I look forward to his contributions.
Turning to fiscal Q1 results, CommTest revenue was $182.8 million, an increase of 27.5% year-on-year and a sequential decrease of 1.8% due to the impact of backend loaded orders and deferred software revenue. CommTest book-to-bill was less than 1.
Gross margin was 60.7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than the prior quarter’s gross margin of 56.1% as a result of continued execution on cost reduction initiatives as well as product mix, including greater NSD revenue. Operating margin also improved sequentially to 11.9%.
In its first full quarter with JDSU, NSD was accretive to earnings. While LTE-related revenue was a small portion of the total, our unique end-to-end LTE solutions puts us in a position of strength as a number of global carriers committed to deploying LTE continues to rise.
For LTE projects, we currently are working with 30 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on drive test and 9 customers for service assurance. We have recently announced engagements with SingTel and Chunghwa Telecom, two leading carries in Asia Pacific. LTE revenue currently is being led by protocol and drive test offerings with service assurance to follow.
As service providers deploy LTE in high-speed packet access technologies across more cell site to cope with both growing numbers of mobile broadband subscribers and increased user bandwidth, the efficient backhaul of mobile traffic remains a priority. Infonetics reports spending on mobile backhaul Ethernet equipment will be $1.8 billion this calendar year with a compounded annual growth rate of 35.1% from 2009 to 2014.
Our leadership in helping service providers turn up powers across North America positions us to our new business as service providers worldwide begin to deploy this technology.
Frost & Sullivan recognized our market traction by awarding JDSU a 2010 Market Penetration Leadership Award for Gigabit Ethernet test equipment. The cumulative effects of higher bandwidth demand, more video across networks and richer mobile applications continues to push upgrades across the metro and core networks.
We shipped 17, 40G and 100G test systems in the quarter to customers worldwide. 10 of these systems were new customers for 40G and 100G. As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the lab positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed.
We saw sequentially revenue growth in North America. Fiscal Q1 highlights included significant growth in revenue from the U.S. Federal government, steady sales to support Ethernet backhaul testing and sales for mobility applications, including a multimillion dollar first office application for LTE.
The quarter also delivered major CommTest wins in other regions, including a multimillion dollar deal for service assurance in Europe, Multiple sales of our Optical Network Management System in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific, our first win in Sri Lanka for 3G UMTS, key wins for DOCSIS 3.0 in Latin America and EMEA, mobile verification test in the Middle East and Africa and multiple protocol test and drive test wins worldwide.
JDSU’s continued focus on collaborative innovation resulted in products and features introduced within the last two years accounting for approximately 45% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q1.
Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million, an increase of approximately 11% sequentially. Gross margin was 50.4%, while operating margin was 36.5%.
Book-to-bill was less than one. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currency pigments for bank notes, continued recovery in the transaction card market and growth in use of our optical filters for consumer applications.
In order to meet growing demand for optical coatings and filters in a cost-efficient manner, we formally opened a new facility in Suzhou, China to manufacture high precision optical coatings for a wide variety of markets that include 3D, gesture recognition, theater projections, and sensing applications. This also supports our strategic initiative of expanding our presence in the Asian market.
As I conclude by formal remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their focus, commitment and contribution this quarter. I would also like to thank our customers, partners, vendors, and long-term shareholders for their continued support of JDSU.
With that, I’ll hand the call over to Dave who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q1 and will discuss our outlook for Q2.

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise. First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter, and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.Revenue was a",1321,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise. First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter, and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
Revenue was at the lower end of our previously stated guidance. CommTest revenue was impacted by seasonal backend loaded quarters and deferred revenue, software revenue, while CCOP revenue growth was constrained by vendors lead times and test capacity at the beginning of the quarter. Both supply and capacity constraints in CCOP steadily eased during the quarter.
First quarter gross margin was 47.4% of revenue, up from the previous quarter’s gross margin of 45.5%, and up from first quarter fiscal 2010 gross margin of 44%. The first quarter gross margin improvement reflects improved margins in CommTest, due to favorable product mix and a full quarter of NSD revenue and improved margins in our CCOP segment.
Operating expenses for the first fiscal quarter of $150.7 million or 36.6% of revenue, a slight increase from the prior quarters 36.2% of revenue. As a result of improved gross margins, our operating income for the quarter of $44.4 million was 10.8% of revenue, which compares to a 9.3% operating margin for the prior quarter.
Net income for the first quarter of $44.8 million or $0.20 per share compares to a fourth quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $33.1 million or $0.15 per share. Net income and earnings per share for the quarter benefited from a favorable effective settlement of uncertain tax positions in the amount of $4.5 million or $0.02 per share.
A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available in today’s press release.
Our first quarter non-GAAP operating results exclude among other items, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles of $22.7 million, a $9 million charge related to stock-based compensation and acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $6.1 million and non-recurring charges primarily related to NSD of $5.4 million.
Including the noted items, the first quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $100,000 or breakeven on an earnings per share basis, which compares to a prior year first quarter GAAP net loss of $31.9 million or a loss of $0.15 per share.
Now, looking at quarterly revenue by region; Americas revenue of $206.5 million or 50.2% of total revenue was up $12 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased revenue from North American service providers and network equipment manufacturers.
EMEA revenue of $104.2 million or 25.3% of total revenue was up approximately flat from the prior quarter. Asia Pacific revenue was $100.6 million or 24.5% of total revenue, up over $1 million from the prior quarter.
Moving to the segments; in the CCOP segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows. Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q1 was $143 million, up 6.2% when compared to the prior quarter’s revenue and up 66.3% when compared to the prior year. Due to supply and capacity constraints, we were unable to ship over $10 million of Optical Communications demand this quarter.
We saw a strong sequential growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, while Asia Pacific revenue declined sequentially due to supply constraints which limited shipments to this region. Sequential ASP decline was less than our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%.
Gross margin for the quarter was 29.5%, up from the prior quarter’s gross margin of 28.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization, and cost reduction activities. We believe our Optical Communications gross margin can be between 30% and 35% and quarterly revenues are $150 million or more.
In our Lasers business, first quarter revenue of $25 million was up approximately 11% when compared to the prior quarter. Gross margins were 45.5%, up from the prior quarter’s gross margin of 44.6% due to product mix and cost structure improvements.
Total CCOP revenue was $168 million, up 6.8% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 31.9% and operating income was $24.2 million or 14.4% of revenue, at the high end of our targeted operating margin range of 10% to 15%. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue level, improved factory utilization and a higher mix of laser revenue.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment, first quarter revenue of $182.8 million was down 1.8% from the previous quarter and up 27.5% from the prior fiscal year. The sequential revenue decrease was due to seasonal backend loaded orders, which resulted in the deferral of $4 million of end of quarter shipments.
In addition, we deferred $7 million of NSD software revenue that will be recognized over the next four quarters. NSD revenue recognized in the quarter was approximately $30 million. With a full quarter of NSD revenue, service assurance is now greater than 20% of CommTest revenue.
On a regional basis, we saw seasonal decline in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, with lower field test and lab and production revenue. CommTest revenue did increase sequentially in the Americas region, as Tom noted earlier.
Fiscal Q1 gross margin for CommTest up 60.7% was at the high end our targeted range of 57% to 61%. The gross margin improvement was driven by improved product mix, which included higher revenues from the NSD business as well as cost structure improvements. CommTest operating profit was $21.7 million or 11.9% of revenue, which compares to 11% in the prior quarter. Targeted operating margins for CommTest are between 20% and 23%.
For the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million or 10.8% compared to the prior quarter, driven by strength in our currency pigment, transaction card and consumer electronic application businesses. As previously noted, the currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs.
Fiscal Q1 gross margin for our AOT business was 50.4%, down from 51.9% in the prior quarter. This is due to higher manufacturing spend in our new Suzhou, China facility. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $22.1 million or 36.5% of revenue, up $2.3 million from the prior quarter due to the higher revenues. The AOT segment continued to operate in its targeted operating margin range of 34% to 37%.
Moving to the balance sheet, for fiscal Q1 2011, the company generated $35.7 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $23.3 million or 5.7% of revenue. At the end of fiscal Q1, the company held $620 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of October 2, 2010 was 4,744.
Now to our Q2 guidance, based on our current visibility, we expect CommTest and CCOP revenues to each grow between 6% and 10% in fiscal Q2. CommTest has additional potential revenue of up to $10 million from carrier end of the year budget flush.
CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 15% and 18%. AOT revenue is expected to decline by slightly more than 10% due to cyclical softening of currency pigment demand and delays in printing of the U.S. $100 bill. This will also reduce AOT operating margin to below 30%.
Operating expenses are expected to be between $159 million and $162 million due to variable selling costs, increased R&D investment and incremental IT infrastructure investment. Taxes, interest and other expenses are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $6 million.
Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 230 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 5% and 6% of revenue as we invest in our Suzhou facility and in expanding our capacity for Optical Communications production.
Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $425 million and $450 million and non-GAAP operating margin to be between 10% and 12%.
Thank you. Operator, we will now take questions.

So that is not a typical.
I think in the AOT business as we noted that, we believe that revenue will come down, it’s more to do with bank notes printing needs and those are really the two areas, where we had the book-to-bill less than 1. Again, I think we’ve guided AOT appropriately and CommTest is pretty typical for that quarter.

Your next question was about the operating margin range in that we did 14.4% operating margin, which is at the higher end of the range. If the revenues stay above the $150 range million, we’ll look at adjusting potentially those ranges of 10% to 15% for CCOP going forward.

We are within sight of our target operating model of 11% to 14% operating margin when quarterly revenue was greater than $415 million. Our objective is to obtain this model by the end of fiscal Q2.
The integration of the NSD acquisition is proceeding as expected within accretive contribution in its first full quarter inside of JDSU. While we work through unanticipated software and service-related revenue deferrals, we did realized costs and revenue synergies in fiscal Q1, and we are bullish on the wireless and LTE growth opportunity this business provides.

JDSU reported revenue of $411.3 million inclusive of contributions from our NSD acquisition, which represents growth of 37.7% year-on-year and 3.3% sequentially. Book-to-bill for the company was above 1 for the sixth straight quarter, driven by strong bookings in our Optical Communications business. Gross profit of $195.1 million or 47.4% of revenue improved from 44% in the prior fiscal year and 45.5% last quarter. In both dollar and percentage terms, this represents the highest level of quarterly gross profit for the company in the last 5 years. JDSU also reported operating income of $44.4 million or 10.8% compared to 3.4% in the prior fiscal year and 9.3% in the prior quarter. This operating margin exceeds our guidance and is the second highest reported by the company in the last 5 years. It is within sight of our target operating model of 11% to 14% operating margin when quarterly revenue was greater than $450 million. Now let me provide highlights from each of our individual business segments.
Given recent mixed messages with respect to the Optical Communications sector, I'd like to begin with our CCOP segment. This segment is comprised of 2 businesses, Optical Communications and lasers. The combined CCOP results are as follows: fiscal Q1 revenue was $168 million; and operating margin was 14.4% at the high end of our target model for this segment. Gross margin of 31.9% has improved by more than 11 percentage points year-on-year. Book-to-bill for the segment was greater than 1. Now let me provide more color on each business.
First, Optical Communications. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $143 million and gross margin was 29.5%. Gross margin improved by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year and 1 percentage point sequentially, due to primarily an increasing mix of new products and cost reduction activities. On the revenue side, the 66% year-on-year and 6% sequential revenue increase was driven primarily by growth in our ROADM, circuit packs, tunable XFP and gesture recognition products. Revenue from products introduced within the last 2 years accounted for more than 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q1, exceeding our target of 50%. We believe that we are positioned very well with our customers and with our differentiated product offerings to see continued growth in this business. Fiscal Q1 book-to-bill was significantly greater than 1. Our combined book-to-bill was greater than 1.6 for our ROADMs, circuit packs and tunable XFPs. Optical Communication backlog entering fiscal Q2 was at the highest level in many years. We did have a few product lines where our book-to-bill was less than 1 in fiscal Q1. These were telecom prompts, passive components and pluggables where the combined book-to-bill was approximately 0.85. I would now like to provide an update on some of our key products, beginning with our tunable XFP.
In Q1, tunable XFPs accounted for approximately 70% of total communications revenue. Since its introduction, JDSU has shipped more than 12,000 tunable XFP. We believe demand will remain strong as customers design new variants of the product. In September at the ECOC trade show, we highlighted an enhanced tunable XFP, which features technology that provides improved performance for network transmission, including increased optical output power and improved optical signal-to-noise performance. We're executing our tunable roadmap to continue to provide additional differentiated products for our customers. 
Gesture recognition also grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a reminder, we supply 2 key products for our current gaming platform, laser diodes from our Optical Communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. The combined revenue from these 2 products in fiscal Q1 was greater than 3% of total JDSU revenue. 
ROADM revenue grew more than 150% year-on-year and 9% sequentially and was again over 25% of total optical revenue. Book-to-bill for ROADMs continues to be significantly over 1. Revenue for the Super Transport Blade has grown 14x in the past year and 28% sequentially. Our many 50 gigahertz and mini 100 gig WSS product lines are also significant contributors to our continued success in the market as they now represent more than 50% of our total ROADM revenue. This quarter, we enhanced our offerings by introducing low port count WSS products for both the mini 50 and mini 100 offering. This low port count offerings are designed to provide high-performance but lower cost points for EDGE and metro regions of the network. Our market leadership in ROADMs was recognized by Infonetics Research last month. 
Additionally, we are seeing strong demand for our 40 and 100 gigabit products. Through close collaboration with our customers, we are winning design slots for our components at the leading equipment manufacturer. Out component and module roadmap is strong and through our partnerships with key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see strong traction with our customers for both line site and client-side 40 and 100 gigabit solutions. Demand continues to exceed shipments across majority of our product lines and we're steadily ramping our ability to supply these products in greater volume, particularly for our competitively differentiated product such as the tunable XFP, super transport blades, gesture recognition and ROADMs. 
Early in fiscal Q1, we had a number of external supply constraints. These constraints eased later in the quarter and this led to better capacity utilization and increased shipments as we progressed through Q1. Since June, we have increased our production capacity significantly and we expect that over the course of the fiscal year, we will have added 50% more operating capacity.
Turning to our lasers business within the CCOP segment. Fiscal Q1 revenue grew approximately 11% sequentially to $25 million while gross margin improved to 45.5% due to product mix and continued product improvements. Book-to-bill was less than 1 for the quarter.
The recently launched JDSU 4-kilowatt fiber laser product continues to gain market traction. Incorporated into the heart of the AMADA for metal processing applications, the JDSU laser enables up to 3x higher processing fee on thick materials as compared to additional CO2 laser technologies. Only last week, AMADA won best product at the International Sheet Metal Trade Show in Germany for this system.
We expect the 4-kilowatt fiber laser to be shipping at low volumes in the beginning of calendar 2011 and in full production by the summer of 2011. We are developing a new fiber-based class of pulse lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing products used in high precision micromachining applications. We expect first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012.
Moving onto the CommTest segment. Last month, we named David Heard as the President of our Communications Test and Measurement segment. David brings a depth of experience and extensive industry knowledge to this role in areas that are key to JDSU's growth strategy. During his 20 years in the communications sector, David has grown and managed a range of networking and wireless businesses and has expected operational and international experience. I'm pleased to welcome David to JDSU senior leadership team, and I look forward to his contributions.
Turning to fiscal Q1 results. CommTest revenues was $182.8 million, an increase of 27.5% year-on-year and a sequential decrease of 1.8% due to the impact of back end loaded orders and deferred software revenue. CommTest book-to-bill was less than 1. Gross margin was 60.7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than the prior quarter's gross margin of 56.1% as a result of continued execution on cost reduction initiatives as well as product mix, including Rader NSD revenue. Operating margin also improved sequentially to 11.9%.
In its first full quarter with JDSU, NSD was accretive to earnings. While LTE related revenue was a small portion of the total, our unique end-to-end LTE solutions puts us in a position of strength as a number of global carriers committed to deploying LTE continues to rise. We're LTE projects, we currently are working with 30 customers in protocol test, 25 customers on drive tests and 9 customers for service assurance. We have recently announced engagements with Singtel and TelCom, 2 leading carriers in Asia Pacific. LTE revenue currently is being led by protocol and drive tests offerings with service assurance to follow. As service providers deploy LTE in high-speed packet access most more cell sites to cope with both growing numbers of Mobile Broadband subscribers and increased user bandwidth, efficient backhaul of mobile traffic remains a priority. reports spending on mobile backhaul ethernet equipment will be $1.8 billion this calendar year with a compounded annual growth rate of 35.1% from 2009 to 2014. Our leadership in helping service providers certain of powers across North America positions us to our new business as service providers worldwide begin to deploy this technology. Frost & Sullivan recognized our market traction by awarding JDSU a 2010 Market Penetration Leadership Award of gigabit ethernet cost equipment. The cumulative effects of higher bandwidth demand, more video across networks and richer mobile applications continues to push upgrades across the metro and core networks. We shipped 17 40G and 100G test systems in the quarter to customers worldwide. 10 of these systems were new customers for 40G and 100G. As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the lab positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue when these higher speed networks are deployed. We saw a sequential revenue growth in North America. Fiscal Q1 highlights included significant growth in revenue from the U.S. federal government, steady sales to support ethernet backhaul testing and sales for mobility applications including a multimillion dollar first office application for LTE. The quarter also delivered major CommTest wins and other regions, including a multimillion dollar deal for service assurance in Europe. Multiple sales of our optical network management system in eastern Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific, our first win in Sri Lanka for 3D, key wins for DOCSIS 3.0 in Latin America and EMEA, global verification test in Middle East and Africa and multiple protocol test worldwide. JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation resulted in products and features introduced within the last 2 years accounting for approximately 45% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q1. Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million, an increase of approximately 11% sequentially. Gross margin was 50.4%, while operating margin was 36.5%. Book-to-bill was less than 1. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currency payments for banknotes, continued recovery in the transaction card market and growth in use of our optical filters for consumer applications.
In order to meet growing demand for optical coating in filters in a cost-efficient manner, we formally opened a new facility in China to manufacture high precision optical coatings for a wide variety of markets that include 3D, gesture recognition, theater projection and sensing applications. It's also supports our strategic initiative of expanding our presence in the Asian market.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their focus, commitment and contributions this quarter. I would also like to thank our customers, partners, vendors and long-term shareholders for their continued support of JDSU. With that, I'll hand the call over to Dave, who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q1 and will discuss our outlook for Q2."
96079,114812841,162773,"JDS Uniphase Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Viavi Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue was at",1313,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue was at the lower end of our previously stated guidance. CommTest revenue was impacted by seasonal backend loaded orders and deferred revenue, software revenue while CCOP revenue growth was constrained by vendor lead times and test capacity at the beginning of the quarter. Both supply and capacity constraints in CCOP steadily eased during the quarter.
First quarter gross margin was 47.4% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 45.5% and up from first quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 44%. The first quarter gross margin improvement reflects improved margins in CommTest due to favorable product mix and a fully quarter of NSD revenue and improved margins of our CCOP segment. Operating expenses for the first fiscal quarter of $150.7 million were 36.6% of revenue, a slight increase from the prior quarters 36.2% of revenue. As a result of improved gross margins, operating income for the quarter of $44.4 million was 10.8% of revenue, which compares a 9.3% operating margin for the prior quarter.
Net income for the first quarter of $44.8 million or $0.20 per share compares to a fourth quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $33.1 million or $0.15 per share. Net income and earnings per share for the quarter benefited from a favorable effective settlement of uncertain tax positions in the amount of $4.5 million or $0.02 per share. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available today in today's press release. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles of $22.7 million, a $9 million charge related to stock-based compensation and acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $6.1 million and nonrecurring charges primarily related to NSD of $5.4 million. Including the noted items, the first quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $100,000 or breakeven on an earnings per share basis, which compares to a prior year first quarter GAAP net loss of $31.9 million or a loss of $0.15 per share.
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $206.5 million or 50.2% of total revenue was up $12 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased revenue in North American service providers and network equipment manufacturers. EMEA revenue of $104.2 million or 25.3% of total revenue was approximately flat from the prior quarter and Asia-Pacific revenue was $100.6 million or 24.5% of total revenue, up $1 million from the prior quarter.
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q1 was $143 million, up 6.2% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 66.3% when compared to the prior year. Due to supply and capacity constraints, we were unable to ship over $10 million of Optical Communications demand this quarter. We saw strong sequential growth in the Americas and EMEA regions while Asia Pacific revenue declined sequentially due to supply constraints, which limited shipments to this region.
Sequential ASP decline was less than our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.5%, up from the prior quarter's gross margin of 28.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization and cost reduction activity. We believe our optical communication's gross margin can be between 30% and 35% and quarterly revenues are $150 million or more. 
In our lasers business, first quarter revenue of $25 million was up approximately 11% when compared to the prior quarter. Gross margins were 45.5%, up from the prior quarter's gross margin of 44.6% due to product mix and cost structure improvements. Total CCOP revenue was $168 million, up 6.8% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 31.9% and operating income was $24.2 million or 14.4% of revenue at the high end of our targeted operating margin range of 10% to 15%. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue level, improved factory utilization and a higher mix of laser revenue.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. First quarter revenue of $182.8 million was down 1.8% from the previous quarter and up 27.5% from the prior fiscal year. This sequential revenue decrease was due to seasonal backend loaded orders, which resulted in the deferral of $4 million of end of quarter shipments. In addition, we deferred $7 million of NSD software revenue that will be recognized over the next 4 quarters. NSD revenue recognized in the quarter was approximately $30 million. With a full quarter of NSD revenue, service assurance is now greater than 20% of CommTest revenue. On a regional basis, we saw a seasonal decline in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions with lower field test in lab and production revenue. CommTest revenue did increase sequentially in the Americas region as Tom noted earlier. Fiscal Q1 gross margin for CommTest of 16.7% was at the high end of our targeted range of 57% to 61%. The gross margin improvement was driven by improved product mix, which included higher revenues from the NSD business as well as cost structure improvements. CommTest operating profit was $21.7 million or 11.9% of revenue, which compares to 11% in the prior quarter. Targeted operating margins for CommTest are between 20% and 23%.
With the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million or 10.8% compared to the prior quarter. Driven by strength in our currency pigments, transaction card and consumer electronic application businesses, as previously noted, the currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of bank note printing needs. Fiscal Q1 gross margin for our AOT business was 50.4%, down from 51.9% in the prior quarter. This is due to higher manufacturing spend in our new China facility. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $22.1 million or 36.5% of revenue, up $2.3 million from the prior quarter due to the higher revenues. The AOT segment continued to operate in its targeted operating margin range of 34% to 37%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q1 2011, the company generated $35.7 million cash from operations, capital expenditures totaled $23.3 million or 5.7% of revenue. At the end of fiscal Q1, the company held $620 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of October 2, 2010, was 4,744. 
Now to our Q2 guidance. Based on our earnings visibility, we expect CommTest and CCOP revenues to each grow between 6% and 10% in fiscal Q2. CommTest has additional potential revenue of up to $10 million from carrier end-of-year budget flush. CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 15% and 18%. AOT revenue is expected to decline by slightly more than 10% due to cyclical softening of currency pigment demand and delays imprinting of the U.S. $100 bill. This will also reduce AOT operating margin to below 30%. Operating expenses are expected to be between $159 million and $162 million due to variable selling costs, increased R&D investment and incremental IT infrastructure investment.
Taxes, interest and other expenses are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $ million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 230 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 5% and 6% of revenue as we invest in our facility and in expanding our capacity for Optical Communications products. Taking into Consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $425 million and $450 million and non-GAAP operating margin to be between 10% and 12%. Thank you and operator, we will now take questions."

I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q1 financial results, followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter. JDSU reported revenue of $411.3 million inclusive of contribu",1925,"Thank you, Cherryl, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q1 financial results, followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter. JDSU reported revenue of $411.3 million inclusive of contributions from our NSD acquisition, which represents growth of 37.7% year-on-year and 3.3% sequentially. Book-to-bill for the company was above 1 for the sixth straight quarter, driven by strong bookings in our Optical Communications business. 
Gross profit of $195.1 million or 47.4% of revenue improved from 44% in the prior fiscal year and 45.5% last quarter. In both dollar and percentage terms, this represents the highest level of quarterly gross profit for the company in the last 5 years. 
JDSU also reported operating income of $44.4 million or 10.8% compared to 3.4% in the prior fiscal year and 9.3% in the prior quarter. This operating margin exceeds our guidance and is the second highest reported by the company in the last 5 years. This is within sight of our target operating model of 11% to 14% operating margin when quarterly revenue was greater than $415 million. Now let me provide highlights from each of our individual business segments. Given recent mixed messages with respect to the Optical Communications sector, I'd like to begin with our CCOP segment. This segment is comprised of 2 businesses, Optical Communications and lasers. The combined CCOP results are as follows: fiscal Q1 revenue was $168 million; and operating margin was 14.4% at the high end of our target model for this segment. Gross margin of 31.9% has improved by more than 11 percentage points year-on-year. Book-to-bill for the segment was greater than 1. 
Now let me provide more color on each business.  First, Optical Communications. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $143 million and gross margin was 29.5%. Gross margin improved by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year and 1 percentage point sequentially, due to primarily an increasing mix of new products and cost reduction activities. On the revenue side, the 66% year-on-year and 6% sequential revenue increase was driven primarily by growth in our ROADM, circuit packs, tunable XFPs and gesture recognition products. Revenue from products introduced within the last 2 years accounted for more than 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q1, exceeding our target of 50%. We believe that we are positioned very well with our customers and with our differentiated product offerings to see continued growth in this business. Fiscal Q1 book-to-bill was significantly greater than 1. Our combined book-to-bill was greater than 1.6 for our ROADMs, circuit packs and tunable XFPs. Our Optical Communication backlog entering fiscal Q2 was at the highest level in many years. We did have a few product lines where our book-to-bill was less than 1 in fiscal Q1. These were telecom pumps, passive components and pluggables where the combined book-to-bill was approximately 0.85. 
I would now like to provide an update on some of our key products, beginning with our tunable XFP. In Q1, tunable XFPs accounted for approximately 7% of total Optical Communications revenue. Since its introduction, JDSU has shipped more than 12,000 tunable XFPs. We believe demand will remain strong as customers design new variant of the product. In September at the ECOC trade show, we highlighted an enhanced tunable XFP, which features technology that provides improved performance for network transmission, including increased optical output power and improved optical signal-to-noise performance. We are executing our tunable roadmap to continue to provide additional differentiated products to our customers. 
Gesture recognition also grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a reminder, we supply 2 key products for our current gaming platform, laser diodes from our Optical Communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. The combined revenue from these 2 products in fiscal Q1 was greater than 3% of total JDSU revenue. 
ROADM revenue grew more than 150% year-on-year and 9% sequentially and was again over 25% of total Optical revenue. Book-to-bill for ROADMs continues to be significantly over 1. Revenue for the Super Transport Blade has grown 14x in the past year and 28% sequentially. Our Mini 50 Ghz and Mini 100 Ghz WSS product lines are also significant contributors to our continued success in the market as they now represent more than 50% of our total ROADM revenue. This quarter, we enhanced our offerings by introducing Low Port Count WSS products for both the Mini 50 and Mini 100 offering. This Low Port Count offerings are designed to provide high performance, but lower cost points for edge in metro regions of the network. Our market leadership in ROADMs was recognized by Infonetics Research last month. 
Additionally, we are seeing strong demand for our 40 and 100 gigabit products. Through close collaboration with our customers, we are winning design slots for our components at the leading network equipment manufacturer. Our component and module roadmap is strong and through our partnerships with key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see strong traction with our customers for both line side and client side 40 and 100 gigabit solutions. Demand continues to exceed shipments across the majority of our product line and we are steadily ramping our ability to supply these products in greater volume, particularly for our competitively differentiated products such as the tunable XFP, Super Transport Blade, gesture recognition and ROADMs. 
Early in fiscal Q1, we had a number of external supply constraint. These constraints eased later in the quarter and this led to better capacity utilization and increased shipments as we progressed through Q1. Since June, we have increased our production capacity significantly, and we expect that over the course of the fiscal year, we will have added 50% more operating capacity.
Turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. Fiscal Q1 revenue grew approximately 11% sequentially to $25 million, while gross margin improved to 45.5% due to product mix and continued product improvements. Book-to-bill was less than 1 for the quarter.
The recently launched JDSU 4 kW fiber laser product continues to gain market traction. Incorporated into the heart of the Amada laser cutting system for metal processing applications, the JDSU laser enables up to 3x higher processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. Only last week, Amada won Best Product at the EuroBlech International Sheet Metal Trade Show in Germany for this system.
We expect the 4 kW fiber laser to be shipping at low volumes in the beginning of calendar 2011 and in full production by the summer of 2011. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulsed lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing products used in high-precision micromachining applications. We expect first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012.
Moving onto the CommTest segment. Last month, we named David Heard as the President of our Communications Test and Measurement segment. David brings a depth of experience and extensive industry knowledge to this role in areas that are key to JDSU's growth strategy. During his 20 years in the communications sector, David has grown and managed a range of networking and wireless businesses and has extensive operational and international experience. I'm pleased to welcome David to JDSU's senior leadership team and I look forward to his contributions.
Turning to fiscal Q1 results. CommTest revenues was $182.8 million, an increase of 27.5% year-on-year and a sequential decrease of 1.8% due to the impact of back-end loaded orders and deferred software revenue. CommTest book-to-bill was less than 1. 
Gross margin was 60.7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than the prior quarter's gross margin of 56.1% as a result of continued execution on cost reduction initiatives as well as product mix, including greater NSD revenue. Operating margin also improved sequentially to 11.9%.
In its first full quarter with JDSU, NSD was accretive to earnings. While LTE-related revenue was a small portion of the total, our unique end-to-end LTE solutions puts us in a position of strength as a number of global carriers committed to deploying LTE continues to rise. For LTE projects, we currently are working with 30 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on drive tests and 9 customers for service assurance. We have recently announced engagements with SingTel and Chunghwa Telecom, 2 leading carriers in Asia Pacific. LTE revenue currently is being led by protocol and drive test offerings with service assurance to follow. As service providers deploy LTE in high-speed packet access most technologies across more cell site to cope with both growing numbers of mobile broadband subscribers and increased user bandwidth, the efficient backhaul of mobile traffic remains a priority. Infonetics reports spending on mobile backhaul Ethernet equipment will be $1.8 billion this calendar year with a compounded annual growth rate of 35.1% from 2009 to 2014. Our leadership in helping service providers turn up powers across North America positions us to our new business as service providers worldwide begin to deploy this technology. Frost & Sullivan recognized our market traction by awarding JDSU a 2010 Market Penetration Leadership Award for Gigabit Ethernet cost equipment. 
The cumulative effects of higher bandwidth demand, more video across networks and richer mobile applications continues to push upgrades across the metro and core networks. We shipped 17 40G and 100G test systems in the quarter to customers worldwide. 10 of these systems were new customers for 40G and 100G. As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the lab positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed. We saw a sequential revenue growth in North America. Fiscal Q1 highlights included significant growth in revenue from the U.S. Federal Government, steady sales to support Ethernet backhaul testing and sales for mobility applications, including a multimillion dollar first office application for LTE. 
The quarter also delivered major CommTest wins in other regions, including a multimillion dollar deal for service assurance in Europe, multiple sales of our Optical Network Management System in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific, our first win in Sri Lanka for 3G UMTS, key wins for DOCSIS 3.0 in Latin America and EMEA, mobile verification test in the Middle East and Africa and multiple protocol test and drive test wins worldwide. 
JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation resulted in products and features introduced within the last 2 years accounting for approximately 45% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q1. 
Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million, an increase of approximately 11% sequentially. Gross margin was 50.4%, while operating margin was 36.5%. Book-to-bill was less than 1. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currency pigments for banknotes, continued recovery in the transaction card market and growth in use of our optical filters for consumer applications.
In order to meet growing demand for optical coatings and filters in a cost-efficient manner, we formally opened a new facility in Suzhou, China to manufacture high precision optical coatings for a wide variety of markets that include 3D, gesture recognition, theater projection and sensing applications. This also supports our strategic initiative of expanding our presence in the Asian market.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their focus, commitment and contributions this quarter. I would also like to thank our customers, partners, vendors and long-term shareholders for their continued support of JDSU. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Dave who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q1 and will discuss our outlook for Q2."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue was at",1319,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue was at the lower end of our previously stated guidance. CommTest revenue was impacted by seasonal back-end loaded orders and deferred revenue, software revenue, while CCOP revenue growth was constrained by vendor lead times and test capacity at the beginning of the quarter. Both supply and capacity constraints in CCOP steadily eased during the quarter.
First quarter gross margin was 47.4% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 45.5% and up from first quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 44%. The first quarter gross margin improvement reflects improved margins in CommTest due to favorable product mix and a fully quarter of NSD revenue and improved margins of our CCOP segment. 
Operating expenses for the first fiscal quarter of $150.7 million or 36.6% of revenue, a slight increase from the prior quarter's 36.2% of revenue. As a result of improved gross margins, our operating income for the quarter of $44.4 million was 10.8% of revenue, which compares a 9.3% operating margin for the prior quarter.
Net income for the first quarter of $44.8 million or $0.20 per share compares to a fourth quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $33.1 million or $0.15 per share. Net income and earnings per share for the quarter benefited from a favorable effective settlement of uncertain tax positions in the amount of $4.5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available today -- in today's press release. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles of $22.7 million, a $9 million charge related to stock-based compensation and acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $6.1 million and nonrecurring charges primarily related to NSD of $5.4 million. Including the noted items, the first quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $100,000 or breakeven on an earnings per share basis, which compares to a prior year first quarter GAAP net loss of $31.9 million or a loss of $0.15 per share.
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $206.5 million or 50.2% of total revenue was up $12 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased revenue from North American service providers and network equipment manufacturers. EMEA revenue of $104.2 million or 25.3% of total revenue was approximately flat from the prior quarter. And Asia Pacific revenue was $100.6 million or 24.5% of total revenue, up $1 million from the prior quarter.
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q1 was $143 million, up 6.2% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 66.3% when compared to the prior year. Due to supply and capacity constraints, we were unable to ship over $10 million of Optical Communications demand this quarter. We saw a strong sequential growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, while Asia Pacific revenue declined sequentially due to supply constraints, which limited shipments to this region. Sequential ASP decline was less than our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.5%, up from the prior quarter's gross margin of 28.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization and cost reduction activities. We believe our Optical Communications gross margin can be between 30% and 35% and quarterly revenues are $150 million or more. 
In our Lasers business, first quarter revenue of $25 million was up approximately 11% when compared to the prior quarter. Gross margins were 45.5%, up from the prior quarter's gross margin of 44.6% due to product mix and cost structure improvements. Total CCOP revenue was $168 million, up 6.8% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 31.9% and operating income was $24.2 million or 14.4% of revenue, at the high end of our targeted operating margin range of 10% to 15%. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue level, improved factory utilization and a higher mix of laser revenue.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. First quarter revenue of $182.8 million was down 1.8% from the previous quarter and up 27.5% from the prior fiscal year. This sequential revenue decrease was due to seasonal back-end loaded orders, which resulted in the deferral of $4 million of end of quarter shipments. In addition, we deferred $7 million of NSD software revenue that will be recognized over the next 4 quarters. NSD revenue recognized in the quarter was approximately $30 million. With a full quarter of NSD revenue, service assurance is now greater than 20% of CommTest revenue. 
On a regional basis, we saw a seasonal decline in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, with lower field test and lab and production revenue. CommTest revenue did increase sequentially in the Americas region as Tom noted earlier. Fiscal Q1 gross margin for CommTest of 60.7% was at the high end of our targeted range of 57% to 61%. The gross margin improvement was driven by improved product mix, which included higher revenues from the NSD business as well as cost structure improvements. CommTest operating profit was $21.7 million or 11.9% of revenue, which compares to 11% in the prior quarter. Targeted operating margins for CommTest are between 20% and 23%.
For the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million or 10.8% compared to the prior quarter, driven by strength in our currency pigment, transaction card and consumer electronic application businesses. As previously noted, the currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of banknote printing needs. 
Fiscal Q1 gross margin for our AOT business was 50.4%, down from 51.9% in the prior quarter. This is due to higher manufacturing spend in our new Suzhou, China facility. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $22.1 million or 36.5% of revenue, up $2.3 million from the prior quarter due to the higher revenues. The AOT segment continued to operate in its targeted operating margin range of 34% to 37%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q1 2011, the company generated $35.7 million cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $23.3 million or 5.7% of revenue. At the end of fiscal Q1, the company held $620 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of October 2, 2010, was 4,744. 
Now to our Q2 guidance. Based on our current visibility, we expect CommTest and CCOP revenues to each grow between 6% and 10% in fiscal Q2. CommTest has additional potential revenue of up to $10 million from carrier end-of-year budget flush. CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 15% and 18%. AOT revenue is expected to decline by slightly more than 10% due to cyclical softening of currency pigment demand and delays in printing of the U.S. $100 bill. This will also reduce AOT operating margin to below 30%. Operating expenses are expected to be between $159 million and $162 million due to variable selling costs, increased R&D investment and incremental IT infrastructure investment.
Taxes, interest and other expenses are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $6 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 230 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 5% and 6% of revenue as we invest in our Suzhou facility and in expanding our capacity for Optical Communications products. Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $425 million and $450 million and non-GAAP operating margin to be between 10% and 12%.

So just wondering kind of when you expect to get back to that run rate and what are the factors playing there. And then the other question I had was on the operating margin goal of 11% to 14%. At the midpoint of your range, you get to the low end of that level after this quarter, but that's a level that you guys had expected to be at on a sustained basis starting December quarter. I'm just wondering if you're still feeling that that's achievable not just for the December quarter, but also going forward."

As you remember, last quarter, previous quarter we deferred about $5 million. We expect that as these deferrals roll off, we'll get those benefits in the December quarter. Right now, I would say that we're looking at the revenue levels to get closer to that $40 million range as we get in the December and the March quarter timeframe. So it has more to do with the mix and the software revenue recognition rules. As you could see, we shipped $37 million of value in the quarter and we're only able to recognize $30 million because of the deferrals. Your next question was about the operating margin range and that we 14.4% operating margin, which is at the higher end of the range.

We're within sight of our target operating model of 11% to 14% operating margin when quarterly revenue was greater than $415 million. Our objective is to obtain this model by the end of fiscal Q2. The integration of the NSD acquisition is proceeding as expected with an accretive contribution in its first full quarter inside of JDSU. While we work through unanticipated software and service-related revenue deferrals, we did realize costs and revenue synergies in fiscal Q1, and we are bullish on the wireless and LTE growth opportunity this business provides. The demand for our products remains strong as carriers continue to make investments in order to meet the need for greater bandwidth worldwide. We expect to continue growing our business as supply constraints ease in our Optical Communications and Test and Measurement businesses, and we invest an incremental capacity for our Optical Communications and AOT businesses.

I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q1 financial results, followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter. JDSU reported revenue of $411.3 million inclusive of contribu",1924,"Thank you, Cherryl, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to begin by providing an overview of our Q1 financial results, followed by highlights of our business achievements in the quarter. JDSU reported revenue of $411.3 million inclusive of contributions from our NSD acquisition, which represents growth of 37.7% year-on-year and 3.3% sequentially. Book-to-bill for the company was above 1 for the sixth straight quarter, driven by strong bookings in our Optical Communications business. 
Gross profit of $195.1 million or 47.4% of revenue improved from 44% in the prior fiscal year and 45.5% last quarter. In both dollar and percentage terms, this represents the highest level of quarterly gross profit for the company in the last 5 years. 
JDSU also reported operating income of $44.4 million or 10.8% compared to 3.4% in the prior fiscal year and 9.3% in the prior quarter. This operating margin exceeds our guidance and is the second highest reported by the company in the last 5 years. It is within sight of our target operating model of 11% to 14% operating margin when quarterly revenue was greater than $415 million. Now let me provide highlights from each of our individual business segments. Given recent mixed messages with respect to the Optical Communications sector, I'd like to begin with our CCOP segment. This segment is comprised of 2 businesses, Optical Communications and Lasers. The combined CCOP results are as follows: fiscal Q1 revenue was $168 million; and operating margin was 14.4% at the high end of our target model for this segment. Gross margin of 31.9% has improved by more than 11 percentage points year-on-year. Book-to-bill for the segment was greater than 1. 
Now let me provide more color on each business.  First, Optical Communications. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $143 million and gross margin was 29.5%. Gross margin improved by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year and 1 percentage point sequentially, due to primarily an increasing mix of new products and cost reduction activities. On the revenue side, the 66% year-on-year and 6% sequential revenue increase was driven primarily by growth in our ROADM, circuit packs, tunable XFPs and gesture recognition products. Revenue from products introduced within the last 2 years accounted for more than 60% of total revenue in fiscal Q1, exceeding our target of 50%. We believe that we are positioned very well with our customers and with our differentiated product offerings to see continued growth in this business. Fiscal Q1 book-to-bill was significantly greater than 1. Our combined book-to-bill was greater than 1.6 for our ROADMs, circuit packs and tunable XFPs. Our Optical Communication backlog entering fiscal Q2 was at the highest level in many years. We did have a few product lines where our book-to-bill was less than 1 in fiscal Q1. These were telecom pumps, passive components and pluggables where the combined book-to-bill was approximately 0.85. 
I would now like to provide an update on some of our key products, beginning with our tunable XFP. In Q1, tunable XFPs accounted for approximately 7% of total Optical Communications revenue. Since its introduction, JDSU has shipped more than 12,000 tunable XFPs. We believe demand will remain strong as customers design new variants of the product. In September at the ECOC trade show, we highlighted an enhanced tunable XFP, which features technology that provides improved performance for network transmission, including increased optical output power and improved optical signal-to-noise performance. We are executing our tunable roadmap to continue to provide additional differentiated products to our customers. 
Gesture recognition also grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a reminder, we supply 2 key products for our current gaming platform, laser diodes from our Optical Communications business and optical filters from our AOT segment. The combined revenue from these 2 products in fiscal Q1 was greater than 3% of total JDSU revenue. 
ROADM revenue grew more than 150% year-on-year and 9% sequentially and was again over 25% of total Optical revenue. Book-to-bill for ROADMs continues to be significantly over 1. Revenue for the Super Transport Blade has grown 14x in the past year and 28% sequentially. Our Mini 50 Ghz and Mini 100 Ghz WSS product lines are also significant contributors to our continued success in the market as they now represent more than 50% of our total ROADM revenue. This quarter, we enhanced our offerings by introducing Low Port Count WSS products for both the Mini 50 and Mini 100 offering. The Low Port Count offerings are designed to provide high performance, but lower cost points for edge in metro regions of the network. Our market leadership in ROADMs was recognized by Infonetics Research last month. 
Additionally, we are seeing strong demand for our 40 and 100 gigabit products. Through close collaboration with our customers, we are winning design slots for our components at the leading network equipment manufacturers. Our component and module roadmap is strong and through our partnerships with key suppliers and customers, we believe we will continue to see strong traction with our customers for both line side and client side 40 and 100 gigabit solutions. Demand continues to exceed shipments across the majority of our product line and we are steadily ramping our ability to supply these products in greater volume, particularly for our competitively differentiated products such as the tunable XFP, Super Transport Blade, gesture recognition and ROADMs. 
Early in fiscal Q1, we had a number of external supply constraints. These constraints eased later in the quarter and this led to better capacity utilization and increased shipments as we progressed through Q1. Since June, we have increased our production capacity significantly, and we expect that over the course of the fiscal year, we will have added 50% more operating capacity.
Turning to our Lasers business within the CCOP segment. Fiscal Q1 revenue grew approximately 11% sequentially to $25 million, while gross margin improved to 45.5% due to product mix and continued product improvements. Book-to-bill was less than 1 for the quarter.
The recently launched JDSU 4 kW fiber laser product continues to gain market traction. Incorporated into the heart of the Amada laser cutting system for metal processing applications, the JDSU laser enables up to 3x higher processing speed on thick materials as compared to traditional CO2 laser technologies. Only last week, Amada won Best Product at the EuroBlech International Sheet Metal Trade Show in Germany for this system.
We expect the 4 kW fiber laser to be shipping at low volumes in the beginning of calendar 2011 and in full production by the summer of 2011. We are also developing a new fiber-based class of pulsed lasers. These new lasers will expand the capabilities of existing products used in high-precision micromachining applications. We expect first revenue from these new lasers to start in fiscal 2012.
Moving onto the CommTest segment. Last month, we named David Heard as the President of our Communications Test and Measurement segment. David brings a depth of experience and extensive industry knowledge to this role in areas that are key to JDSU's growth strategy. During his 20 years in the communications sector, David has grown and managed a range of networking and wireless businesses and has extensive operational and international experience. I'm pleased to welcome David to JDSU's senior leadership team and I look forward to his contributions.
Turning to fiscal Q1 results. CommTest revenues was $182.8 million, an increase of 27.5% year-on-year and a sequential decrease of 1.8% due to the impact of back-end loaded orders and deferred software revenue. CommTest book-to-bill was less than 1. 
Gross margin was 60.7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than the prior quarter's gross margin of 56.1% as a result of continued execution on cost reduction initiatives as well as product mix, including greater NSD revenue. Operating margin also improved sequentially to 11.9%.
In its first full quarter with JDSU, NSD was accretive to earnings. While LTE-related revenue was a small portion of the total, our unique end-to-end LTE solutions puts us in a position of strength as a number of global carriers committed to deploying LTE continues to rise. For LTE projects, we currently are working with 30 customers on protocol test, 25 customers on drive tests and 9 customers for service assurance. We have recently announced engagements with SingTel and Chunghwa Telecom, 2 leading carriers in Asia Pacific. LTE revenue currently is being led by protocol and drive test offerings with service assurance to follow. As service providers deploy LTE in high-speed packet access technologies across more cell site to cope with both growing numbers of mobile broadband subscribers and increased user bandwidth, the efficient backhaul of mobile traffic remains a priority. Infonetics reports spending on mobile backhaul Ethernet equipment will be $1.8 billion this calendar year with a compounded annual growth rate of 35.1% from 2009 to 2014. Our leadership in helping service providers turn up powers across North America positions us to our new business as service providers worldwide begin to deploy this technology. Frost & Sullivan recognized our market traction by awarding JDSU a 2010 Market Penetration Leadership Award for Gigabit Ethernet test equipment. 
The cumulative effects of higher bandwidth demand, more video across networks and richer mobile applications continues to push upgrades across the metro and core networks. We shipped 17 40G and 100G test systems in the quarter to customers worldwide. 10 of these systems were new customers for 40G and 100G. As 40G and 100G migrate to the field, our presence in the lab positions us with a competitive advantage to earn revenue as these higher speed networks are deployed. We saw a sequential revenue growth in North America. Fiscal Q1 highlights included significant growth in revenue from the U.S. Federal Government, steady sales to support Ethernet backhaul testing and sales for mobility applications, including a multimillion dollar first office application for LTE. 
The quarter also delivered major CommTest wins in other regions, including a multimillion dollar deal for service assurance in Europe, multiple sales of our Optical Network Management System in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific, our first win in Sri Lanka for 3G UMTS, key wins for DOCSIS 3.0 in Latin America and EMEA, mobile verification test in the Middle East and Africa and multiple protocol test and drive test wins worldwide. 
JDSU's continued focus on collaborative innovation resulted in products and features introduced within the last 2 years accounting for approximately 45% of CommTest revenue in fiscal Q1. 
Our remaining segment is Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT. Fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million, an increase of approximately 11% sequentially. Gross margin was 50.4%, while operating margin was 36.5%. Book-to-bill was less than 1. Revenues for the quarter included growth in currency pigments for banknotes, continued recovery in the transaction card market and growth in use of our optical filters for consumer applications.
In order to meet growing demand for optical coatings and filters in a cost-efficient manner, we formally opened a new facility in Suzhou, China to manufacture high precision optical coatings for a wide variety of markets that include 3D, gesture recognition, theater projection and sensing applications. This also supports our strategic initiative of expanding our presence in the Asian market.
As I conclude my formal remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their focus, commitment and contributions this quarter. I would also like to thank our customers, partners, vendors and long-term shareholders for their continued support of JDSU. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Dave who will take you through the details of our financial performance in Q1 and will discuss our outlook for Q2."

Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue was at",1320,"Thank you, Tom. Before I start, please note that all numbers are non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.
First quarter revenue of $411.3 million was up 3.3% from the prior quarter and up 37.7% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue was at the lower end of our previously stated guidance. CommTest revenue was impacted by seasonal back-end loaded orders and deferred revenue, software revenue, while CCOP revenue growth was constrained by vendor lead times and test capacity at the beginning of the quarter. Both supply and capacity constraints in CCOP steadily eased during the quarter.
First quarter gross margin was 47.4% of revenue, up from the previous quarter's gross margin of 45.5% and up from first quarter fiscal 2010's gross margin of 44%. The first quarter gross margin improvement reflects improved margins in CommTest due to favorable product mix and a full quarter of NSD revenue and improved margins in our CCOP segment. 
Operating expenses for the first fiscal quarter of $150.7 million or 36.6% of revenue, a slight increase from the prior quarter's 36.2% of revenue. As a result of improved gross margins, our operating income for the quarter of $44.4 million was 10.8% of revenue, which compares to a 9.3% operating margin for the prior quarter.
Net income for the first quarter of $44.8 million or $0.20 per share compares to a fourth quarter fiscal 2010 net income of $33.1 million or $0.15 per share. Net income and earnings per share for the quarter benefited from a favorable effective settlement of uncertain tax positions in the amount of $4.5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is available today -- in today's press release. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating results exclude, among other items, amortization of acquired technology and intangibles of $22.7 million, a $9 million charge related to stock-based compensation and acquisition accounting adjustment to revenue of $6.1 million and nonrecurring charges primarily related to NSD of $5.4 million. Including the noted items, the first quarter fiscal 2011 GAAP net income was $100,000 or breakeven on an earnings per share basis, which compares to a prior year first quarter GAAP net loss of $31.9 million or a loss of $0.15 per share.
Now looking at quarterly revenue by region. Americas revenue of $206.5 million or 50.2% of total revenue was up $12 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased revenue from North American service providers and network equipment manufacturers. EMEA revenue of $104.2 million or 25.3% of total revenue was approximately flat from the prior quarter. And Asia Pacific revenue was $100.6 million or 24.5% of total revenue, up $1 million from the prior quarter.
Moving to the segments. In the CCOP segment, the breakout of the key metrics for Optical Communications and Lasers is as follows: Optical Communications revenue in fiscal Q1 was $143 million, up 6.2% when compared to the prior quarter's revenue and up 66.3% when compared to the prior year. Due to supply and capacity constraints, we were unable to ship over $10 million of Optical Communications demand this quarter. We saw a strong sequential growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, while Asia Pacific revenue declined sequentially due to supply constraints, which limited shipments to this region. Sequential ASP decline was less than our historical quarterly range of 2% to 4%. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.5%, up from the prior quarter's gross margin of 28.5%. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix, better factory utilization and cost reduction activities. We believe our Optical Communications gross margin can be between 30% and 35% when quarterly revenues are $150 million or more. 
In our Lasers business, first quarter revenue of $25 million was up approximately 11% when compared to the prior quarter. Gross margins were 45.5%, up from the prior quarter's gross margin of 44.6% due to product mix and cost structure improvements. Total CCOP revenue was $168 million, up 6.8% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 31.9% and operating income was $24.2 million or 14.4% of revenue, at the high end of our targeted operating margin range of 10% to 15%. Profitability in this segment continues to improve due to higher revenue level, improved factory utilization and a higher mix of laser revenue.
Now moving on to our CommTest segment. First quarter revenue of $182.8 million was down 1.8% from the previous quarter and up 27.5% from the prior fiscal year. This sequential revenue decrease was due to seasonal back-end loaded orders, which resulted in the deferral of $4 million of end of quarter shipments. In addition, we deferred $7 million of NSD software revenue that will be recognized over the next 4 quarters. NSD revenue recognized in the quarter was approximately $30 million. With a full quarter of NSD revenue, service assurance is now greater than 20% of CommTest revenue. 
On a regional basis, we saw a seasonal decline in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, with lower field test and lab and production revenue. CommTest revenue did increase sequentially in the Americas region as Tom noted earlier. Fiscal Q1 gross margin for CommTest of 60.7% was at the high end of our targeted range of 57% to 61%. The gross margin improvement was driven by improved product mix, which included higher revenues from the NSD business as well as cost structure improvements. CommTest operating profit was $21.7 million or 11.9% of revenue, which compares to 11% in the prior quarter. Targeted operating margins for CommTest are between 20% and 23%.
For the Advanced Optical Technologies or AOT segment, fiscal Q1 revenue was $60.5 million or 10.8% compared to the prior quarter, driven by strength in our currency pigment, transaction card and consumer electronic application businesses. As previously noted, the currency products will see demand fluctuate according to the level of banknote printing needs. 
Fiscal Q1 gross margin for our AOT business was 50.4%, down from 51.9% in the prior quarter. This is due to higher manufacturing spend in our new Suzhou, China facility. AOT operating profit for the quarter was $22.1 million or 36.5% of revenue, up $2.3 million from the prior quarter due to the higher revenues. The AOT segment continued to operate in its targeted operating margin range of 34% to 37%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. For fiscal Q1 2011, the company generated $35.7 million cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $23.3 million or 5.7% of revenue. At the end of fiscal Q1, the company held $620 million in total cash and short-term investments. Headcount as of October 2, 2010, was 4,744. 
Now to our Q2 guidance. Based on our current visibility, we expect CommTest and CCOP revenues to each grow between 6% and 10% in fiscal Q2. CommTest has additional potential revenue of up to $10 million from carrier end-of-year budget flush. CommTest operating margins are estimated to be between 15% and 18%. AOT revenue is expected to decline by slightly more than 10% due to cyclical softening of currency pigment demand and delays in printing of the U.S. $100 bill. This will also reduce AOT operating margin to below 30%. Operating expenses are expected to be between $159 million and $162 million due to variable selling costs, increased R&D investment and incremental IT infrastructure investment.
Taxes, interest and other expenses are expected to result in a net expense of $5 million to $6 million. Share count for calculating EPS is expected to be approximately 230 million shares. Capital equipment purchases will be between 5% and 6% of revenue as we invest in our Suzhou facility and in expanding our capacity for Optical Communications products. Taking into consideration the factors above and based on our current visibility, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $425 million and $450 million and non-GAAP operating margin to be between 10% and 12%. 
Thank you. And operator, we will now take questions."

The mix will change where they're coming now. They'll be dropping 10% and that their operating margins will be dropping, but I think now we have a mix of products and profitability that allows us to stay in those operating profit ranges that we've identified in the model."

As our call concludes, I'd like to reiterate some key points. First, JDSU continues to improve its business model. Today, we reported the company's highest gross margin and second highest operating margin in 5 years, while at the low end of our revenue guidance. We're within sight of our target operating model of 11% to 14% operating margin when quarterly revenue is greater than $415 million. Our objective is to obtain this model by the end of fiscal Q2. The integration of the NSD acquisition is proceeding as expected with an accretive contribution in its first full quarter inside of JDSU. While we work through unanticipated software and service-related revenue deferrals, we did realize costs and revenue synergies in fiscal Q1, and we are bullish on the wireless and LTE growth opportunity this business provides. The demand for our products remains strong as carriers continue to make investments in order to meet the need for greater bandwidth worldwide. We expect to continue growing our business as supply constraints ease in our Optical Communications and Test and Measurement businesses, and we invest an incremental capacity for our Optical Communications and AOT businesses. Our relentless focus on collaborative innovation leading to a significantly increased revenue level from new products continues to contribute to our improved financial performance. Thank you again for taking the time to join us on this earnings call. We appreciate your interest in JDSU. Have a great evening."
