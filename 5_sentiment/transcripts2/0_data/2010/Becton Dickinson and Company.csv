Before turning the call over to David to review our first quarter results in more detail. I would like to briefly comment on some of the highlights from the quarter, which are noted on slide four. 
But first, let me introduce two of our business leaders on the call with us today, Bill Rhodes and Philippe Jacon. Bill Rhodes is President, BD Biosciences and has responsibility for cell analysis and discovery Labware including the advanced bio processing business. 
Bill’s career with BD spends more than a decade. In 2003, Bill became Vice President and General Manager for Immunocytometry Systems and then he was named President of cell analysis. 
Under Bill’s leadership, the cell analysis business reinvent and improved its product development capabilities, bringing to market the successful (inaudible) cancer product lines, while developing a successful special order research product business. He was appointed President of the bioscience segment one-year ago. 
Philippe Jacon is President Diagnostics Systems, which covers infectious diseases including microbiology and genome, as well as, women’s health and cancer including TriPath in tested for sexually transmitted diseases. 
He began his career at BD Biosciences in France in 1988 and joined BD Diagnostics as President of Microbiology Systems in 2006. Under Philippe’s leadership, the microbiology business improved its growth rate while successfully bringing to market new products such as CHROMagar and MRSA and the BACTEC FX. He was appointed to as President well last year January. 
Moving on to our performance this quarter, results for the quarter exceeded the company’s expectations aided by flu-related sales in the medical and diagnostic segments. However, regarding flu-related sales for the full fiscal year, we expect sales in the diagnostic segments to be about the same as in fiscal 2009. 
In our medical segment, we expect sales of flu-related products for the fulfill year to be approximately 60 to 65 million, which is slightly higher than the fiscal --slightly higher than fiscal 2009, and it is consistent with our discussion in our November earnings call. We estimate our sales related to the U.S. BARDA order to be approximately 30 million for the full fiscal year. 
Now, let’s move to segment performance for the quarter. BD medical is off to a strong start driven by sales of Medical Surgical Systems and Pharmaceutical Systems products including flu-related products. 
International safety revenues continue to be strong in our medical surgical business unit. Sales of diabetes care products also contributed to revenue growth. Strong emerging market and pen needle growth, coupled with incremental revenues from a non-product related co-marketing agreement led growth in this business. 
In BD diagnostics, solid revenue growth was driven by sales of safety engineered devices and infectious disease testing products, including flu-related products. 
In BD biosciences, capital spending constraints continued to dampen demand for research and clinical instruments as we expected. We continue to expect the majority of U.S. stimulus-related sales will occur during the second half of the fiscal year. 
I would also like to point out that U.S. revenues in the discovery Labware business were impacted by a distributor destocking and a decline in sales of advanced bio processing products to a large customer due to timing of orders. 
Lastly, you may recall biosciences grew 10% in the prior a year period, making for a difficult comparison. Overall, bioscience is off to a good start and we are seeing strength -- some strengthening of demand, particularly for research and clinical reagents in U.S. 
We are very pleased with our first quarter results. Our earnings exceeded our expectations, resulting from strong revenue growth, gross margin improvement and continued tight expense control while we continue to fund our growth opportunities. 
As Ed stated in our press release, our first quarter revenue and operating performance was solid and gives us confidence to raise guidance for fiscal year 2010. 
Moving to slide five, our prior guidance which are revenue to increase 5% to 6% currency neutral, given our first quarter sales results, we now expect revenues to increase about 6% currency neutral for fiscal 2010. 
We have also raised our guidance on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from fiscal -- for fiscal 2010, from 7% to 9% currency neutral to 8% to 10% over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items of 495 for fiscal year 2009. 
Now, I will turn the call over to David to review our financial results.

And good morning, everyone. As Vince just summarized, we’re off to a good start this fiscal year. I’d now like to turn to slide seven, to highlight some of our first quarter results. Strong flu-related orders in the quarter benefit",1119,"Thank you, Vince. And good morning, everyone. As Vince just summarized, we’re off to a good start this fiscal year. I’d now like to turn to slide seven, to highlight some of our first quarter results. 
Strong flu-related orders in the quarter benefited both our medical and diagnostic segments worldwide. Medical revenue grew about 13% currency neutral, driven by strong performance in the medical surgical and pharmaceutical system business units, as well as, diabetes care products. 
Diagnostics revenue growth on a currency neutral basis was about 8%, driven by strong diagnostic systems growth of 11%. Biosciences revenue grew 0.5% currency neutral versus a challenging comparison to the prior year period. 
Revenue growth in the quarter came from all geographies with U.S. revenue growth of about 10% and international growth about 8.5% currency neutral. 
Good operating performance, continued tight cost control and favorable commodity prices versus the prior period drove margin improvement in the quarter. As a result our operating income grew about 15% on a currency neutral basis. 
On slide eight, we begin our review of growth by segment. First, you can see total topline growth for the company in the quarter was about 9% currency neutral. Medical’s first quarter revenues increased about 16% or about 13% currency neutral. As Vince discussed earlier, we experienced strong sales across medical surgical systems, pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care. Flu-related sales contributed about 7 percentage points of growth in the quarter. 
Revenues in the BD Diagnostics segment grew about 10% or about 8% currency neutral. Sales of both safety engineered devices and infectious disease testing systems contributed to the growth. Flu-related sales contributed about 2 percentage points of growth in the quarter and the biosciences segment revenues increased a 0.5% currency neutral. After two quarters of revenue decline, we are seeing evidence of some strengthening in the biosciences business. 
I would now like to turn to our U.S. and international revenues. Slide nine. In the first quarter, BD’s U.S. reported revenues increased about 10%. U.S. medical revenues increased about 15% year-on-year, reflecting strong sales of prefillable device, prefilled flush syringes and Nexiva, as well as flu-related products. 
U.S. sales of diagnostics products increased about 8%, reflecting strong sales of infectious disease testing systems and flu-related products. Biosciences in the U.S. declined about 3%. As Vince discussed, our discovery Labware business results were impacted by a distributor destocking and a decrease in purchases from a large customer in the advanced bio processing business due to the timing of orders. 
Reported international revenues for the first quarter increased about 13% year-on-year or 8.5% currency neutral. Underlying growth was driven by double-digit performance in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. 
First quarter international revenues on a currency neutral basis were strong in medical and diagnostics with each growing about 11% and 8% respectfully. Biosciences grew about 3% currency neutral. 
Moving to global safety on slide 10. Reported sales grew about 13% in the quarter to 454 million. On a currency neutral basis, underlying growth was about 11% both in the U.S. and in international markets. On a segment basis, medical safety revenues were the largest contributor to our growth, with revenues growing about 16% on a currency neutral basis. 
Now, turning to slide 11, we look at the components of first quarter revenue growth year-on-year. Gains from our medical diagnostics business segment drove the underlying performance of 9%. The favorable currency impact of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year was partially offset by our hedging program, which had an unfavorable impact of 2.7%. 
Moving to slide 12, gross margins declined 160 basis points, mainly driven by the impact of foreign currency movements and our hedging program previously entered into. After taking out the effect of foreign currency and hedges, our margin is slightly ahead of last year driven by lower raw material costs primarily resins. 
Lower raw material costs this quarter were consistent with our expectations and as previously guided. We expect unfavorable price variances in the second half of the fiscal year to offset first half favorability. 
Slide 13 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. As discussed earlier, first quarter revenue growth was about 9% currency neutral with growth profit increasing almost 10% due to gross margin improvement in the quarter. 
Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 6% currency neutral impacted by a litigation contingency and costs related to our HandyLab acquisition. In addition, there was an increase in our deferred compensation plan liability. This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in our interest income line. 
R&D increased about 1% currency neutral, which is lower than what we expect for the year due to timing within the year. Our operating income increased about 15% currency neutral, as a result of the strong revenue growth and improved operating margin. 
Moving to guidance, on slide 14, I’d like to walk you through increases for fiscal year 2010. We expect revenues to increase about 7% on a reported basis or about 6% currency neutral. This is up from our previous guidance of 6% reported and 5% to 6% currency neutral. 
I would like to point out that given our first quarter revenue growth of 9% and guidance of about 6%, currency neutral implies the remainder of the year will be less than 6%. You may recall that in our prior year result, we benefited from flu-related orders of about $76 million in the second half of fiscal year 2009, this presents a difficult comparison. 
Earnings per share are expected to increase 2% to 4% over adjusted EPS of $4.95 or 8 to 10% on a currency neutral basis. This is up from prior guidance of 1% to 3% on a reported basis or 7% to 9% on a currency neutral basis. 
Operating margins are expected to be broadly in line with our previous guidance as difficult comparisons occur in the second half of the year driven by high raw material prices and lower flu-related orders. 
Our operating cash flows are expected to be about $1.7 billion for the full fiscal year with share repurchases of about $450 million. 
Now, moving to slide 15, to recap our results for the quarter. We had a strong start to the year. Strong revenue growth in medical and diagnostic segment were aided by flu-related orders. Biosciences underlying demand is improving and on track to meet full-year expectations. 
Higher revenues, along with operating margin improvement in the quarter gave us confidence to raise EPS guidance to $5.05 to $5.15. We continued our solid generation of operating cash flow of about $400 million with $191 million used for share repurchases. 
Thank you. And I now like to turn the call over to Vince.

Also, you may have seen the joint press release issued by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and BD announcing our collaboration to improve the treatment of type 1 diabetes by developing novel insulin delivery products that enhanced the use of insulin pumps. 
We and the JDRF believe there are significant opportunities to improve product performance in the area of infusion disposables. We believe we can apply technologies and know-how from our infusion business to address many of these immediate opportunities. 
We will work with the JDRF to bring these technologies and our micro needle technology to contribute to closing the loop or creating a reliable artificial pancreas. We are not entering the pump business and we intend to work with all manufacturers of pumps. 
Switching to operational initiatives, Everest or SAP upgrade is moving ahead as planned. We informed you on our last call that we expect our expenses to increase incrementally on this program of this year, which will enable us to retire several legacy systems and improve our core worldwide supply chain processes. 
ReLoCo, our operational initiative to reduce costs of our medical surgical products about 20% to 30% is on track. We have also made good progress defining the functional transformation strategies to continue leveraging our G&A cost structure, which we call global service excellence or GSE. We believe our continued focus on productivity improvements and disciplined expense management along with our ongoing investments in growth opportunities will ensure our future success. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.

So if you look at it, if you strip out the other $20 million with some of the special items that we had talked about. We are getting leverage as we drive that topline growth faster than what our investment in expenses are, we continue to get leverage in SSG&A and we anticipate continuing doing that given the outlook for our sales growth and our tight cost controls.

We’re getting good traction with Nexiva and so we were encouraged by that. Over the last 12 months, we have been putting more sales resources behind that.

Those are two countries that we’re continuing to put a lot of focus on, strategy development and long-term investment. 
The Chinese government had announced about a year ago that they were expanding healthcare access to 90% of the population, so there is a buildout in that second tier. And part of our strategy planning is how to put the deployment in place, so that we can serve that second tier of hospitals. 
As with many multinationals, much of our business today is in the top tier of hospitals, that’s where most of the, let’s say western quality medical practices has been going on. A lot of that will start shifting to the second tier with the top tier doing more specialty work, which also lends itself to revenue growth. 
And we’re planning deployment strategies that will enable us to serve that tier, both directly through our own people and also through broadened distribution networks. We see China as a big opportunity for many years to come.

You know, resins really is the major driver in the quarter, it out shadows anything else, any of the pluses and minuses we have in there from a performance perspective. As we said before, if you think about margin improvement for the full year, if I go back to that, what we had got it before, we said for the full year, we were going to be at 52.6%, going to 51.1% to 51.3%. And if you recall, about 100 basis points of that is FX. 
And then we also had additional pension expenses and startup expenses that were going to hit us this year, which is unfavorable about 60 basis points. And the underlying performance of the business was improvement about 20 basis points. So that gets hit to the 51.1%, 51.3%. 
In the first quarter, we came in at 152% versus last year at 53.6%, and as I said earlier about 190 basis points of that was related to negative because of the currency. Pension startup was around 50 basis points and performance was around 80 net and that again, the bulk of it is really driven by the resin prices. 
So you’ll see, gross margins for the year, we’re not changing the outlook for the full year. As those unfavorable resin prices come through in Q3 and Q4 as we forecast, we’ll see our gross margins come down a little bit and that’s why we gave the guidance as we did.

We are encouraged in the quarter that we saw sales of the BACTEC FX on reagent rental good -- some good reagent growth. So that you know that seemed to be a step in the right direction as well. 
On the HAI side and the genome side, where we’re seeing the difference is on the C difficile test and of course that’s a reagent rental.

Before turning the call over to David to review our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to briefly comment on some of the highlights from the quarter which are noted on Slide 4. But first let me introduce two of our business leaders on the call with us today, Bill Rhodes and Philippe Jacon . Bill Rhodes is President BD Biosciences and has responsibility for Cell Analysis and Discovery Labware, including the Advanced Bioprocessing business. Bill's career with BD stands more than a decade. In 2003, Bill became Vice President and General Manager for Amino Cytometry Systems, and then was named President, Cell Analysis. Under Bill's leadership, the Cell Analysis business revamped and improved its product development capabilities, bringing to market the successful FACSAria and FACSCanto product lines, while developing the successful Special Order Research Product business. He was appointed President of the Biosciences segment one year ago.Philippe Jacon is President, Diagnostic Systems, which covers infectious disease including microbiology and GeneOhm, as well as [indiscernible] and cancer, including TriPath and testing for sexually-transmitted diseases. He began his career at BD Biosciences in France at 1988 and joined BD Diagnostics as President of Microbiology Systems in 2006. Under Philippe's leadership, the Microbiology business improved its growth rate while successfully bringing to market new products such as CHROMagar, MRSA and the BACTEC FX. He was appointed to his President role last January. Moving onto our performance this quarter, results for the quarter exceeded the company's expectations, aided by flu-related sales in the Medical and Diagnostic segments. However, regarding flu-related sales for the full fiscal year, we expect sales in the Diagnostic segment to be about the same as in fiscal 2009. In our Medical Segment, we expect sales of flu-related products for the full fiscal year to be approximately $60 million to $65 million, which is slightly higher than fiscal 2009 and it is consistent with our discussion in our November earnings call. We estimate our sales related to the U.S. BARDA order to be approximately $30 million for the full fiscal year.Now let's move to segment performance for the quarter. BD Medical is off to a strong start driven by sales of Medical Surgical Systems and Pharmaceutical Systems products, including flu-related products. International safety revenues continue to be strong in our Medical Surgical business unit. Sales of Diabetes Care products also contributed to revenue growth. Strong emerging market and pen needle growth, coupled with incremental revenues from a non-product related co-marketing agreement led growth in this business. In BD Diagnostics, solid revenue growth was driven by sales of safety-engineered devices and infectious disease testing products, including flu-related products.In BD Biosciences, capital spending constraints continue to dampen demand for research and clinical instruments as we expected. We continue to expect the majority of U.S. stimulus-related sales will occur during the second half of the fiscal year. I would also like to point out that U.S. revenues in the Discovery Labware business were impacted by a distributor destocking and a decline in sales of Advanced Bioprocessing products to a large customer due to timing of orders. Lastly, you may recall Biosciences grew 10% in the prior-year period, making for a difficult comparison. Overall, Biosciences is off to good start and we are seeing some strengthening at demand, particularly for research and clinical reagents in U.S.We are very pleased with our first-quarter results. Our earnings exceeded our expectations, resulting from strong revenue growth, gross margin improvement and continued tight expense control while we continue to fund our growth opportunities. As Ed stated in our press release, our first-quarter revenue and operating performance was solid and gives us confidence to raise guidance for fiscal year 2010.Moving to Slide 5, our prior guidance was for revenue to increase 5% to 6% currency neutral. Given our first quarter sales results, we now expect revenues to increase about 6% currency neutral, for fiscal 2010. We have also raised our guidance on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 from 7% to 9% currency neutral, to 8% to 10% over diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding specified items of $4.95 for fiscal year 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to David to review our financial results."

I'd now like to turn to Slide 7 to highlight some of our first-quarter results. Strong flu-related orders in the quarter benefited both our Medical and Diagnostic segments worldwide. Medical revenue grew about 13% currency neutral, driven by strong performance in the Medical Surgical and Pharmaceutical Systems business units as well as Diabetes Care products. Diagnostics revenue growth on a currency neutral basis was about 8%, driven by strong Diagnostic Systems growth of 11%. Biosciences revenue grew 0.5% currency neutral, versus a challenging comparison to the prior-year period. Revenue growth in the quarter came from all geographies, with U.S. revenue growth of about 10% and international growth at 8.5% currency neutral. Good operating performance, continued tight cost control and favorable commodity prices versus the prior period drove margin improvement in the quarter. As a result, our operating income grew about 15% on a currency-neutral basis. On Slide 8, we begin our review of growth by segment. First, you can see total top line growth for the company in the quarter was about 9% currency neutral. Medical's first quarter revenues increased about 16% or about 13% currency neutral. As Vince discussed earlier, we experienced strong sales across Medical Surgical Systems, Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care. Flu-related sales contributed about seven percentage points of growth in the quarter.Revenues in the BD Diagnostics segment grew about 10% or about 8% currency neutral. Sales of both safety-engineered devices and infectious disease testing systems contributed to the growth. Flu-related sales contributed about 2 percentage points of growth in the quarter. In the Biosciences segment, revenues increased 0.5% currency neutral. After two quarters of revenue decline, we are seeing evidence of some strengthening in the Biosciences business.I would now like to turn to our U.S. and international revenues, slide 9. In the first quarter, BD's U.S. reported revenues increased about 10%. U.S. Medical revenues increased about 15% year-on-year reflecting strong sales of prefillable devices, pre-filled flush syringes and Nexiva, as well as flu-related products. U.S. sales of Diagnostics products increased about 8%, reflecting strong sales of infectious disease testing systems and flu-related products. Biosciences in the U.S. declined about 3%. As Vince discussed, our Discovery Labware business results were impacted by a distributor destocking and a decrease in purchases from a large customer in the Advanced Bioprocessing business, due to the timing of orders. Reported international revenues for the first quarter increased about 13% year-on-year or 8.5% currency neutral. Underlying growth was driven by double-digit performance in Asia, Pacific and Latin America. First quarter international revenues, on a currency-neutral basis, were strong in Medical and Diagnostics, with each growing about 11% and 8%, respectively. Biosciences grew about 3% currency neutral.Moving to Global Safety on Slide 10, reported sales grew about 13% in the quarter to $454 million. On a currency-neutral basis, underlying growth was about 11%, both in the U.S. and in international markets. On a segment basis, Medical Safety revenues were the largest contributor to our growth, with revenues growing about 16% on a currency-neutral basis.Now turning to Slide 11, we look at the components of first quarter revenue growth year-on-year. Gains from our Medical, Diagnostics business segments drove the underlying performance of 9%. The favorable currency impact of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year was partially offset by our hedging program, which had an unfavorable impact of 2.7%.Moving to Slide 12, gross margin declined 160 basis points, mainly driven by the impact of foreign currency movement and our hedging program previously entered into. After taking out the effect of foreign currency and hedges, our margins is slightly ahead of last year, driven by lower raw material cost, primarily resins. Lower raw material cost this quarter were consistent with our expectations. And as previously guided, we expect unfavorable price variances in the second half of the fiscal year to offset first-half favorability.Slide 13 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. As discussed earlier, first quarter revenue growth was about 9% currency neutral, with gross profit increasing almost 10% due to gross margin improvement in the quarter. Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 6% currency neutral, impacted by a litigation contingency and costs related to our HandyLab acquisition. In addition, there was an increase in our deferred compensation plan liability. This increase was offset by a corresponding in increase in our interest income line. R&D increased about 1% currency neutral, which is lower than what we expect for the year due to timing within the year. Our operating income increased about 15% currency neutral, as a result of the strong revenue growth and improved operating margins. Moving to guidance on Slide 14, I'd like to walk you through increases for fiscal year 2010. We expect revenues to increased about 7% on a reported basis or about 6% currency neutral. This is up from our previous guidance of 6% reported and 5% to 6% currency neutral. I'd like to point out that given our first quarter revenue growth of 9% and guidance of about 6% currency neutral, implies the remainder of the year will be less than 6%. You may recall that in our prior-year results, we benefited from flu-related orders of about $76 million in the second half of fiscal year 2009. This presents a difficult comparison. Earnings per share are expected to increase 2% to 4% over adjusted EPS of $4.95 or 8% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis. This is up from prior guidance of 1% to 3% on a reported basis or 7% to 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Operating margins are expected to be broadly in line with our previous guidance as difficult comparisons occur in the second half of the year, driven by higher raw material prices and lower flu-related orders. Our operating cash flows are expected to be about $1.7 billion for the full fiscal year, with share repurchases of about $450 million. Now moving to Slide 15, to recap our results for the quarter. We had a strong start to the year. Strong revenue growth in Medical and Diagnostic segment were aided by flu-related orders. Biosciences underlying demand is improving and on track to meet full year expectations. Higher revenues, along with operating margin improvement in the quarter, gave us confidence to raise EPS guidance to $5.05 to $5.15. We continued our solid generation of operating cash flow of about $400 million, with $191 million used for share repurchases. Thank you and I'd now like to turn the call over to Vince."

Before we open the call to questions, I would like to comment on the progress of several of our strategic and operational initiatives. First, we are pleased with the integration of the HandyLab acquisition and the progress being made on developing the new instrument. Also, you may have seen the joint press release issued by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and BD announcing our collaboration to improve the treatment of Type 1 diabetes by developing novel insulin-delivery products that enhance the use of insulin pumps. We, and the JTRF, believe there are significant opportunities to improve product performance to the area of infusion disposables. We believe we can apply technologies and know-how from our infusion business to address many of these immediate opportunities. We will work with the JTRF to bring these technologies and our microneedle technology to contribute to closing the loop [ph] or creating a reliable artificial pancreas. We are not entering the pump business and we intend to work with all manufacturers of pumps.Switching to operational initiatives. EVEREST, our SAP upgrade, is moving ahead as planned. We informed you on our last call that we expect our expenses to increase incrementally on this program this year, which will enable us to retire several legacy systems and improve our core worldwide supply-chain processes. ReLoCo, our operational initiative to reduce cost of our Medical Surgical products, about 20% to 30%, is on track. We have also made good progress defining the functional transformation strategies to continue leveraging our G&A cost structure, which we call, Global Service Excellence or GSE. We believe our continued focus on productivity improvements and discipline expense management, along with our ongoing investments in growth opportunities will ensure our future success. Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

The Chinese environment had announced about a year ago that they were expanding healthcare access to 90% of the population. So there is a build out in that second tier. And part of our strategy planning is how to put the deployment in place so that we can serve that second tier of hospitals. As with may many multinationals, much of our business today is in the top tier of hospitals. That's where most of the, let's say, western quality medical practices has been going on. A lot of that will start shifting to the second tier with the top tier doing more specialty work, which also lands itself to revenue growth. And we're planning deployment strategies that will enable us to serve that tier, both directly to our own people and also through broadened distribution networks.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before turning the call over to David to review our second quarter results in more detail, I would like to briefly comment on some of the highlights regarding the quarter results, which are noted on Slide 4. 
As Ed stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were in line with the company's expectations. Our overall revenue growth for the quarter was solid. BD Medical revenue growth was primarily driven by Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems. BD Diagnostics, on the other hand, grew less than expected. 
We experienced an exceptionally mild flu season. As a result, we saw reduced testing levels in most of our Diagnostics businesses, which was partially offset by strong growth in our cancer diagnostics and molecular STD product platforms. Finally, we are continuing to see an improvement in our Biosciences segment. 
Overall, we are quite pleased with the company's performance in a difficult environment. Our second quarter and year-to-date earnings results provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.
Moving to Slide 5, you will see that the company experienced solid top line and strong bottom line growth for both the second quarter and our six-month year-to-date results. For the second quarter, our revenues grew 7%, or 6.6% on a currency-neutral basis. We experienced strong adjusted EPS growth at 8.5%, or 16.2% on a currency-neutral basis. For the six-month year-to-date results, revenue growth was 9.3%, or 7.8% currency neutral. Adjusted EPS grew at 6.6%, or 14.1% on a currency-neutral basis.
Before reviewing our guidance for the fiscal year, I would like to briefly mention that throughout our commentary, we will be discussing two types of flu: the pandemic flu, which has had a positive impact on our year-to-date revenue growth; and the seasonal flu, the absence of which has had a negative impact on our revenue growth. David will cover the impact of the pandemic flu-related revenues on the company later in his remarks.
Now let's move on to Slide 6, which looks at our guidance for fiscal 2010. You may recall that our previous revenue guidance was at about 7%, or about 6% on a currency-neutral basis. We have adjusted our reported revenue growth to approximately 6% to reflect the strengthening dollar. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect revenues to increase approximately 6%, which is in line with our previously communicated guidance. With that said, we are reaffirming our previous guidance for adjusted EPS to increase 2% to 4% to $5.05 to $5.15, or 8% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the healthcare reform charge. Now I'll turn the call over to David to review our financial results."

As Vince just summarized, we are pleased with our first half results. I'd now like to turn to Slide 8 to highlight some of our second quarter results.

I'd now like to turn to Slide 8 to highlight some of our second quarter results. 
Medical revenues grew 7.8%, currency neutral, driven by strong performance in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care businesses. Diagnostics revenue growth, on a currency-neutral basis, was 2.7%, which is impacted by an exceptionally mild flu season and a reduction in lab testing. Biosciences showed continued improvement, with underlying growth at 9.8%. This was mainly driven by a solid instrument and reagent sales in the U.S. and in Japan. 
Revenue growth in the quarter came from most geographies, with U.S. revenue growth of 6% and international revenue growth of 7%, currency neutral. Our strong bottom line performance was driven by revenue and operating margin expansion, on a currency-neutral basis.
On Slide 9, we begin to review our growth by segment. First, you can see total top line growth for the company in the quarter was 7%, or 6.6% currency neutral, with pandemic flu-related sales contributing less than 1%. For the first half, the company grew 9.3%, or 7.8% currency neutral, benefited by pandemic-related sales of a little more than 2% of growth. 
BD Medical second quarter revenues increased 9.7%, or 7.8% currency neutral. As mentioned earlier, we experienced strong sales in Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care businesses. Strong Diabetes Care growth was primarily attributable to pen needle sales, and the non-product co-marketing agreement discussed on our last call. We also experienced significant growth across emerging and developed markets. The strong growth in Pharmaceutical Systems is due partially to timing, new product lines and some benefit from pandemic-related revenues. 
For the first half, the Medical segment grew 13%, or 10.2% currency neutral. Again, benefited by pandemic-related sales of about four percentage points of growth. Revenues in the BD Diagnostics segment grew 3%, or 2.7% currency neutral. This was caused by the slower growth of our PAS and Diagnostic Systems products, as a result of lower U.S. hospital admissions and lower lab testing lines in the quarter. 
Our Cancer and Molecular Diagnostics businesses continue to experience solid growth of about 8%. For the first half, the Diagnostics segment grew 6.6%, or 5.4% currency neutral. In the Biosciences segment, revenues increased 6%, with underlying growth of 9.8%, currency neutral. We are pleased that the Biosciences segment continues to improve. Solid U.S. growth was driven by research instrument and reagent sale and key customer purchases, benefiting our Advanced Bioprocessing business.
So we now just experienced strong instrument growth, particularly in Japan. This was driven by supplemental government funding of cell analysis instruments for stem cell research, mainly by academic institutions. For the first half of the fiscal year, our Biosciences segment grew 3%, or 5.2% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now turning to Slide 10, we'll look at our geographic results. In the second quarter, BD's U.S.-reported revenues increased 6%. U.S. Medical revenues increased 6.7% year-over-year, reflecting solid sales of pre-fillable devices and Nexiva, as well as flu-related products. U.S. sales of Diagnostics products increased 2.7%, and was impacted by an extremely mild flu season and the lower lab testing. Bioscience revenues in the U.S. increased 12.6% due to revenue growth in Cell Analysis business, which was led by research instrument and reagents.
International revenues grew 7.7%, or 7% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. Growth in our Medical segment grew at 8.6%, currency neutral, by strong growth in our pre-fillable devices, pen needles and infusion therapy products. The Diagnostics segment grew 2.8%, currency neutral, mainly as a result of the mild flu season. Biosciences grew at 8.4%, currency neutral, by exceptionally strong growth in Japan. This growth was offset by continued delays in Western Europe government funding of cell analysis instruments.
For the first half, reported U.S. revenues were 7.9%, with Medical increasing 10.9%. Diagnostics increased 5.3% and Biosciences growing 4.6%. International revenues were strong in our Medical segment, with underlying growth of 9.8%, currency neutral, while our Diagnostics and Biosciences grew at 5.5% on a currency-neutral basis.
Now moving to global safety on Slide 11. Reported sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, to $418 million. On a currency-neutral basis, underlying growth was 5.9%. This was comprised of a 5.4% growth rate for the U.S. and an underlying international growth rate of 6.8%. International safety slowed in the quarter, due to back-order products, the weak flu season and reduced testings. 
For the first half, underlying growth was 8.4%, on a currency-neutral basis, which is a combination of an 8.2% growth rate in the U.S. and an underlying growth rate of international safety of 8.6%, on a currency-neutral basis. This also reflects the quarter two softness, as I just mentioned, due to some back orders, the weak flu season and reduced testing volumes. Vince will provide you an update on the EU Safety legislation in his closing remarks.
Now moving to Slide 12 and looking at the second quarter revenue growth year-over-year, gains from our underlying performance of 6.6% and a 3.9% favorable impact from currency translation were offset in part by the 3 1/2% unfavorable impact from our hedging program. 
Moving to Slide 13, gross margin remained flat year-over-year. Underlying gross margin improved 130 basis points, mainly driven by positive product mix. Strong performance this quarter and marginal favorable currency translation had a positive impact on gross margin, but were offset by the unfavorable hedge impact in the quarter.
Slide 14 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. As discussed earlier, second quarter revenue growth was 6.6%, currency neutral. Gross profit remained flat year-over-year, as a percentage of sales. However, on a currency-neutral basis, gross profit improved, reflecting stronger underlying performance, driving gross profit up 9.3%. 
Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased 5.9%, currency neutral. This was impacted by an increase in our deferred compensation plan, which is offset by gain on our interest income line. Increased pension costs and the cost of our EVEREST program have also contributed to the unfavorable impact on SSG&A. 
R&D increased 1.7%, currency neutral, which is lower than what we expected for the year, due to timing within the year. Our spending will accelerate in the second half of the year. Our operating income increased 14.5%, currency neutral, as a result of the strong revenue growth and improved operating margins, on a currency-neutral basis.
Moving to Slide 15 and our year-to-date performance, I'll review revenue growth. Our revenue growth increased 9.3%. Performance and currency contributed 7.8% and 4.6%, respectively, which was partially offset by the hedge with a 3.1% unfavorable impact. 
Looking at Slide 16, our gross margin change year-over-year, we experienced 80 basis point decline. Favorable resins and favorable mix were offset by pension and start-up costs, which were primarily related to our ReLoCo program. Our strong year-to-date performance was also offset by hedging and unfavorable foreign currency translation, which includes the effects of a one-time holding gain in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Slide 17 recaps the six-month year-to-date income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. Revenue growth was 7.8%, currency neutral. Gross profit margin declined 80 basis points, due to the unfavorable hedging and foreign currency translation. However, on a currency-neutral basis, it was higher than revenue growth, reflecting the favorable margin expansion.
Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 6%, currency neutral, again, impacted by EVEREST and pension costs, and an increase in our deferred compensation plan, which has an offset in the interest income line. Similar to what I mentioned earlier for the second quarter results, R&D increased 1 1/2%, currency neutral, which is lower than we expect for the year, due to timing. And as I said earlier, spending, we anticipate to accelerate in the second half of the year. Our operating income increased 14.7%, as a result of strong revenue and the improved operating margins, on a currency-neutral basis.
Now moving to Slide 18 to recap our results for the first half. We are really pleased with the results in the first half of the year. We ended the second quarter with a strong first half revenue growth, aided by pandemic flu-related orders. The Biosciences segment continues to show improvement. On a currency-neutral basis, operating margins improved, benefiting from favorable resins, as well as product mix. We generated solid operating cash flow of $688 million, with $450 million used for share repurchases during the first half of the year. Solid first half performance gives us confidence to reaffirm our previous EPS guidance of $5.05 to $5.15, excluding the healthcare reform charge.
Now moving to Slide 19, I would like to walk you through the impact of the pandemic flu on the company's total revenue growth during each of the two halves of our fiscal year 2010. In the first half of fiscal year 2010, pandemic flu provided a benefit to our revenue growth of 2.4%, which is mainly in the U.S. On the second half of fiscal year 2010, the pandemic flu is expected to result in a 2% negative impact to our revenue growth, due to the international pandemic revenues that were recorded in the second half of fiscal year 2009. Adjusting for the effect of pandemic-related orders, the underlying growth is consistent to full year, with a growth rate of about 6%, currency neutral.
Now I'd like to move to guidance on Slide 20. We'll first look at our revenue guidance by segment, on a reported and currency-neutral basis. As Vince mentioned earlier, we have adjusted our reported revenue growth to approximately 6% to reflect the stronger dollar. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect revenues to increase about 6%, which is in line with our previously communicated guidance. 
In our Medical segment, we expect revenues to increase 7% to 8%, on a reported basis, and about 6%, currency neutral. For our Diagnostics segment, we expect revenues to increase 5% to 6%, or about 5%, on a currency-neutral basis, which is lower than our previous guidance of about 6%, mainly due to the global milder seasonal flu and the low anticipated hospital admissions in the U.S. We expect Biosciences revenues to increase about 4%, or 6% currency neutral, which is better than our previous guidance of about 5%, due to strong sales in the quarter in Japan and the U.S.
Overall, we expect our operating margins for the fiscal year 2010 to remain broadly the same as previously communicated. Given our year-to-date results, we are reaffirming our previous guidance for EPS to increase 2% to 4% or $5.05 to $5.15, or 8% to 10%, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the healthcare reform charge. We have also increased our expected share repurchases from $450 million to $550 million for the year. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back over to Vince."

You can see on Slide 22 some of the key dates that reflect the progression of the legislation and the projected timeline for adoption. With this adoption schedule, we are not projecting any changes to our revenue guidance.
Before we open the call to questions, I would just like to reiterate that we are very pleased with the company's performance in a difficult environment that has been challenged by lower hospital admissions and an exceptionally mild flu season. The diversity of our product portfolio and the company's global presence provides us with a resilient platform for growth, as you can see in our year-to-date results.

We saw a little bit of a rebound in March, but nothing that could compensate what we've seen between December and February. So I think this is really about our Point of Care franchise.

It had followed 26 states, passing individual laws. So therefore, we were seeing some progress there. But the national law became a uniform impact throughout the country. Whereas in Europe, even though it's a uniform policy that's being put into place, it will be implemented individually by the countries. And we're expecting some variance at how they implement. So on the whole, we're not expecting an immediate impact, as Vince had indicated. The countries have three years to move into full compliance. We think the impact will be toward the back end of that, at different rates. Plus there has been some progress already, in the absence of a legislative environment in Europe that varies by country. So some countries have moved pretty far along already, while others are still at a very early stage. That also varies by product category. So we would say, on the whole, two or three years out, we'll see more of the impact. It's going to be more of a progression than a quantum step function like we saw in the U.S."

On the whole, we're getting very good growth out of the Asia-Pacific region with particularly strong growth in China and India, which are two strong areas of strategic focus for us, both in the near term and in the long term. We're gaining very strong growth out of Latin America. We're having a very positive year in Japan relative to past years for reasons already discussed on the call. And then in comparison, Western Europe, U.S. and Canada in terms of our outlook are more reflective of them both aiding very mature markets, also the constraints on spending. And then I think you are also getting at some of the issues that emerged in Greece and seem to be spreading a bit to some of the other countries. I'm going, in a moment, defer to David on how we're managing the credit risk there, because we've been on top of the situation in Greece for some time. And in general, manage this very tightly, particularly as we look at the other countries like Spain and Portugal. Ireland is another one that comes up in this process. But on whole, to answer your question, Europe's growth is stable, but certainly well below the company average and it's being more than offset by very strong growth in the regions that we're investing more heavily now, particularly Asia-Pacific and Latin America."

We believe we're appropriately reserved in all those countries. As we've looked at it, we've increased our reserves as we talked about, I believe, in the first quarter, particularly around Greece. Our DSOs over all have been pretty consistent, so we're not seeing any major changes in our DSOs. But Greece is significantly higher. In Greece, over all, they owe the healthcare industry about $9 billion. Adamed Pharma have been working with the health authorities there to try and resolve that, but that's something we are very much keeping close eye on and making sure that our exposure's don't increase there. We are seeing in Italy and pockets within particular counties where the DSOs are increasing a bit, but it's nowhere near what we had been seeing in Greece."

Now whether every country complies with that in a uniform manner and enforces is something we'll only know with time. We're anticipating strong enforcement in many of the countries and maybe lighter in some of the others. And there's no doubt this will help the growth in Western Europe, without a doubt, because the markets will be driven more towards safety engineer devices. If it's implemented effectively, it'll also even more importantly create the environment, the safety environment in Western Europe that we've been advocating for, for years as well as elsewhere in the world. It's just not likely to be a step function. The growth impact will start before three years, but we don't anticipate a big impact this year. And it will ramp.

Today, I'd like to begin our presentation with a few remarks regarding BD's solid third quarter, and then spend some time on discussing our current view of the marketplace and BD's opportunities within that context. I'll also discuss our strong commitment to delivering shareholder value and some of the things we're doing to enhance shareholder returns now and in the future.
It is clear that we're managing through a very challenging time for the global economy and for the healthcare industry segments in which we participate. We recognize that we're not immune to these challenges, and we are committed to aggressively managing the company to deliver strong bottom line growth while continuing to invest for the future. We expect to be a steady ship through these choppy waters based on a combination of actions we're taking. So what are these actions? 
First, we will continue to drive operational efficiency initiatives which are aimed at gross profit improvements such as ReLoCo. Next, we will also reduce G&A costs by streamlining our administrative processes and with the implementation of our SAP upgrade program EVEREST. While EVEREST will be an investment up front, it will deliver significant cost savings longer term.  
Ultimately, our strong product platforms and planned product extensions, along with our focused execution in important emerging markets, will help us accelerate revenue growth. We'll also use our strong cash flow to accelerate share repurchases.  Our steadfast commitment to achieving top line and bottom line growth is a key message I want to leave with you all this morning. 
So now let me comment on the quarter which was a solid one for BD. We delivered EPS from continuing operations of $1.29 per diluted share, which was in-line with company expectations. Importantly, we saw a good performance across the businesses, with all three segments contributing bottom line results consistent with expectations. That being said, as you all know, the quarter was not without significant macroeconomic headwinds for our industry. Globally, spending on healthcare products continue to be challenged. Hospital spending remains at muted levels and lab testing has moderated. Doctor visits in the U.S. continue to show declines due to high unemployment. And the increase in syringe and diagnostic testing volumes from the H1N1 virus in 2009 have not been sustained in 2010. These factors are global but have been even more pronounced in regions, such as the European Union, where they continue to sort through a number of difficult issues. 
We anticipated these market conditions in April when we provided our guidance for fiscal 2010. However, as we have assessed our markets during the third quarter, we now believe that evidence suggests that these conditions are likely to persist in the near term. Despite these global macroeconomic conditions, we expect to deliver bottom line FX-neutral earnings growth of 9% for fiscal 2010, which is in-line with our previously communicated range of 8% to 10% in spite of a higher tax rate than we had originally forecasted.
Regarding the top line, as we continue to face these macroeconomic spending challenges, we see that fiscal 2010 FX-neutral revenue growth will come in at around 5% rather than the 6% we guided to in our April call. We're confident that the fundamental business strategy we're following is a sound one that will enable us to deliver annual EPS growth over the next three years of 10% to 12% FX-neutral from continuing operations, with revenue expectations of an average of 6% over the same three-year time horizon. This is slightly muted from our prior 7% average three-year growth that we had been discussing.
Additionally, we expect that our top line during this interval will improve in the later part of the period as the global economy improves and very importantly, as our R&D programs, new product launches and line extensions come through fruition, again, in the later part of the next three years. 
We're confident in our ability to deliver consistent bottom line growth due to a number of factors, including our strong product pipeline and our operational excellence programs, which we continue to expect to drive 50 basis points of operating income improvement annually over the next three years, with the programs I mentioned in the beginning of my remarks. Additionally, the company remains committed to efficient utilization of our strong cash flow. As a component of that, for fiscal year 2010, we are raising our guidance for share repurchases to $700 million, and we expect that we will execute approximately $600 million in share repurchases in 2011 next year. So it's $700 million this year and $600 million next year in share repurchases.
Before I conclude, I would like to express my congratulations to Vince Forlenza regarding the announcement we issued today. At the board meeting this week, the board elected to add the title of Chief Operating Officer to the title of President, which he now holds. This is a well-deserved recognition of Vince's execution against the additional duties that he has taken on over the last two years. It is also a recognition of the key role he continues to play in developing and implementing BD's strategy and vision and the great leadership and commitment Vince has demonstrated throughout his career at BD. 
As President since January 1, 2009, Vince has overseen BD's three business segments, international and the quality function. In January of this year, Vince also assumed responsibility for the Integrated Global Supply Chain and the IT functions. 
So I'm now delighted to turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Vince Forlenza."
103678,109058755,70467,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 5, I'd like to briefly highlight some of our third quarter results. As Ed mentioned in his remarks, our third quarter results were in-line with the company's expectations. Revenues came in at",444,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 5, I'd like to briefly highlight some of our third quarter results. As Ed mentioned in his remarks, our third quarter results were in-line with the company's expectations. Revenues came in at 3.9% currency neutral, which was impacted by a tough comparison to fiscal year 2009 pandemic flu purchases and slowed by softness in the BD Diagnostics segment. 
BD Medical revenue growth was primarily driven by Diabetes Care products, which were partially offset by the H1N1 flu pandemic impact of about one percentage point and softer Pharmaceutical Systems revenue due to timing of orders in the quarter. BD Diagnostics was impacted by the economic pressures in the U.S., resulting in reduced physician office visits and reduced diagnostic volumes in Europe. The comparison to prior year is also negatively impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2009.
We experienced an improvement in our Biosciences segment, primarily driven by Cell Analysis, instrument and reagent sales in the U.S., available supplemental funding in Japan and a favorable comparison versus the prior year. We're also pleased with the results in our emerging markets experiencing double-digit top line growth. We believe the company's performance has fared well in a challenging global economy and in the healthcare industry. Based on our results year-to-date, we are confident that we're able to achieve bottom line growth of about 9% currency neutral, which is in-line with our previous range of 8% to 10% for the full fiscal year 2010. 
Moving to Slide 6, you'll see that the company experienced top line growth of 3.9% on a currency-neutral basis for the third quarter. Adjusted EPS decreased by 0.8% to $1.29, however, on a currency-neutral basis, increased by 6.9%. Our nine-month year-to-date results reflect solid revenue growth of 6.5% on a currency-neutral basis and adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% currency neutral.
Now let's move on to Slide 7, which looks at our guidance for fiscal 2010. As Ed mentioned earlier in his remarks, we have modified our revenue guidance to 6% currency neutral. Our adjusted EPS guidance of about 3% or about 9% on a currency-neutral basis remains in line with our previously communicated range. 
On Slide 8, we will review our revenue guidance by segment. For the Medical segment, currency-neutral growth remains unchanged at about 6%. For the Diagnostics segment, we are modifying our revenue growth to about 4% on a currency-neutral basis due to reduced diagnostic testing and physician visits. For our Bioscience segment, we expect revenues to be approximately 6% currency neutral. 
Now I'll turn the call over to David to review our financial results."

First, you can see total top line growth for the company in the quarter was 3.9% currency neutral. For the nine-month period, the company grew 6 1/2% currency neutral. BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 2.7% currency neutral. Excluding the impact of pandemic sales, revenue growth within the quarter was up 3.4%. 
As Vince mentioned earlier, the growth in this segment was mainly driven by the Diabetes Care businesses with continued strong sales of pen needles. Our pen needle growth was led by the successful launch of our new Nano product, the world's smallest pen needle, along with strong growth in emerging markets. 
Pharmaceutical Systems revenue in the quarter was flat mainly due to the timing of orders in the quarter. For the nine-month period, the Medical segment grew 7.6% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the impact of pandemic sales, revenue growth for the nine-month period was up 5.2%.
Revenues in the BD Diagnostics segment grew 2% currency neutral. Diagnostic Systems business growth was flat year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, partly due to the H1N1 impact in quarter three fiscal year 2009 and the soft demand in the U.S. and Western Europe due to lower diagnostic testing. Partially offsetting these testing declines is a strong growth in our GeneOhm platform of 14% in the quarter. Our Preanalytical Systems business grew 3.9% in the quarter, with strong growth in emerging markets offset lower lab testing volumes in the U.S. For the nine-month period, the Diagnostics segment grew 4.3%.
BD Biosciences' growth 11.6% currency neutral due to the reasons Vince mentioned earlier in his remarks. In addition, the Advanced Bioprocessing business also experienced very strong double-digit growth in the U.S., primarily due to accelerated timing of large customer order. For the nine-month period, the Biosciences segment grew 7.3%. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 11. We'd like to walk you through the impact of the pandemic flu on the quarterly revenue growth of our business in fiscal year 2010. In the first half of the year, pandemic flu provided a benefit to our revenue growth of 2.4%, which is mainly in the U.S. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect the pandemic flu to result in a 2% negative impact to our revenue growth due to the international pandemic revenues that we recorded in the second half of fiscal year 2009. Adjusting for the effect of pandemic-related orders, the underlying growth is consistent with the full year growth rate of about 5% to 6% currency neutral.
Now turning to Slide 12, we'll look at our geographic revenue results. On an as-reported basis, in the third quarter, BD's U.S. revenues increased 3%. U.S. Medical revenues increased 1% year-over-year. U.S. sales of diagnostics products increased 1.4%, impacted by reduced physician offices visits and lower diagnostic testing. Biosciences revenues in the U.S. increased 14.8% due to strong revenue growth in the Cell Analysis business, led by research, instruments and reagents. International revenues grew 4.6% on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter, with soft Western Europe being offset by growth at Asia-Pacific and Latin America.
Growth in our Medical segment at 3.9% was driven by strong emerging market growth, partially offset by timing in orders with our Pharmaceutical Systems business. The Diagnostics segment grew 2.7% currency neutral, driven by growth in Preanalytical System's emerging markets, partially offset by Western Europe. Biosciences grew at about 10% currency neutral mainly driven by strong growth in Japan. 
For the nine-month period, reported U.S. revenues were 6.3% with Medical increasing 7 1/2%, Diagnostics increasing 4% and Biosciences growing 8%. International revenues were strong in our Medical segment with underlying growth at 7.6% currency neutral. The Diagnostics segment grew at 4.6% and Biosciences grew at 6.8% currency neutral.
Moving on to global safety on Slide 13. Sales grew 3.3% on a currency-neutral basis to $436 million in the quarter. This was comprised of a 1.6% growth rate in the U.S. and an underlying international growth rate of 6 1/2%, but the Medical and Diagnostics segments are being negatively affected by previous pandemic orders. For the nine-month period, underlying growth was 6.6% on a currency-neutral basis, which is a combination of the 5.9% growth rate in the U.S. and an underlying growth rate international safety of about 8% on a currency-neutral basis.
Next, I will review the third quarter revenue growth. Looking at the third quarter revenue growth, gains from our underlying performance of 3.9% and the 0.9% favorable impact of currency translation were offset in part by the 1.6% unfavorable impact from our hedging program. 
Moving to Slide 15, gross margin declined 100 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin performance, however, improved 20 basis points, mainly driven by strong favorable product mix that was partially offset by increased resins and start-up costs of our ReLoCo program and pension costs. This favorable performance was more than offset by the unfavorable currency translation and unfavorable hedging costs.
Slide 16 recaps the third quarter income statement, highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. As discussed earlier, third quarter revenue growth was 3.9% and gross profit grew faster at 4.2%. Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased 3% currency neutral, which is 100 basis point improvement over the prior year as a percent of revenue. This reduction was primarily driven by a decrease in our deferred compensation plan expenses, reflecting lower returns that reduces our SSG&A expense and correspondingly is offset by a loss on the interest income line.  Additionally, we continue to place tight controls on our G&A spending that were able to more than offset the unfavorable pension and EVEREST expense we've been incurring.
R&D almost increased 10% or 40 basis points as a percent of revenue over the prior period. The acceleration is in-line with our expectation, which continues to increase in the second half of the fiscal year due to funding of key strategic initiatives. Our operating income increased 10.2% as a result of the improved operating margins on a currency-neutral basis. 
I would also like to point out that the tax rate for the quarter is higher than prior year due to the absence of the R&D tax credit and the unfavorable impact related to geographic mix of income. In our full year guidance, we have increased the tax rate to 28.5% to reflect this unfavorable mix.
Moving to Slide 17, year-to-date revenue growth increased 7.2%. Performance and currency contributed 6 1/2% and 3.3%, respectfully, which was partially offset by the hedge with a 2.6% unfavorable impact. 
Looking at our gross margin change year-over-year on Slide 18, we experienced a 90 basis-point decline as a percent of revenue. Favorable performance of 50 basis points reflects favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable startup and pension costs. This favorable performance was more than offset by the currency and hedging costs.
Slide 19 recaps the nine-month year-to-date income statement, highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. Revenue growth was 6 1/2% currency neutral and gross profit was 7.7%. Moving down the income statement, the SSG&A increased about 3% currency neutral impacted by EVEREST and our pension costs. 
For the nine-month period, R&D expense increased 4.3%, which is lower than what we expect for the full year. We expect R&D spends to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 13.1% as a result of our strong gross margin and controlled SSG&A expenses.
Moving to slide 20 to recap our results for the nine-month period. We are pleased with the results in a difficult macroeconomic environment. We experienced lower-than-expected revenue growth which is mainly due to the euro weakness and lower hospital admissions and lab testing. We expect slightly higher operating margins reflecting the gross margin improvement and operational excellence programs. 
Earnings are in-line with expectations, and we are committed to delivering about 9% adjusted EPS growth for the full fiscal year 2010 despite the higher tax rate that I just discussed. I would like to point out that our year-to-date EPS performance is just over 11%, and our total year is 9%, which implies the fourth quarter is essentially flat. There are two contributing factors impacting our expected results.
First, as I previously mentioned to you, the absence of fourth quarter pandemic revenue as compared to prior year impacted revenue by 3%. Secondly, we're seeing higher resin costs as compared to prior year as discussed on our quarter two earnings call. Our cash flows remain strong and we'll be increasing our share repurchases from $550 million to $700 million, which supports our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders. 
I would like to reiterate Ed's comments in the beginning of our call today that while we are not immune to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment, we are confident that we have the tools to overcome these challenges through our strong product platform and geographic diversity, along with the operational excellence programs we have put in place.
Before we open the call to questions, I'd like to introduce and welcome to BD, Zac Nagle, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac will serve as the primary liaison between BD and its investors and the analyst community. Zac is a seasoned investor relations leader who brings over 16 years of experience and a deep understanding of the investment community to BD, including investor relations positions that he had in both Flowserve and Dell. Sherry Bertner will continue to work with BD in a advisory role. We look forward to introducing Zac to everyone in the coming months. 
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Vince to begin the Q&A."

As we look at for the full fiscal year, it's about $0.15 currency, is our best estimate and the hedge would probably decrease. That hedge loss would probably decrease to about $0.06, which would be about $0.09 for the year. So I think you for the remainder of the year, between where we are right now, year-to-date, and our guidance is, probably the way for you to think about, is as far as volatility in rates.

But since you mentioned, fiscal year '11, it's probably good for me right now to discuss foreign currency and our hedging program as we look forward. We made a rough estimate on how currencies may impact our next year results if they held at current rates. We estimate that revenues would be negatively impacted by about 2%. If you factor in the normal drop of roughly 25% to 35% to operating income. And tax effect that, the negative impact would be about 2% to our EPS growth, reported EPS growth. And at this point, we still haven't entered into any hedges as they continue to be very costly and there's a lot of volatility obviously that still exists.

The backbone for that program is Everest, going from five ERP systems down to one, but we're also laying these functional excellence programs on top in finance, HR and IT. And we feel that we have that well organized. We're making good progress on that. So while Everest itself is a bit of an expense increase in the near term, as Ed mentioned, then we start to see benefits from these programs as they get layered in.

And I will separate the TriPath and molecular so that you understand better. But really, Europe and Canada are the two regions where we've been suffering. So although in TriPath, the sales this quarter were about $33 million, and we see a growth which is kind of slow in the U.S., reflecting the economy, the weak economy, and the lower visits to the physicians. We're seeing very good growth in Asia on the TriPath products. But unfortunately, these have been offset by a decline in Europe where we see, in some of the countries, the increase in troubles being mandated. So for instance in Belgium today, instead of having one cervical cancer test per year, it's now every two years, and this is really impacting directly the business. And the last piece is that we have, in the same quarter of last year in Canada, a very large cash order of instrument that didn't repeat this year. In molecular, the picture is a bit different. Actually, the U.S. has been doing pretty good. But clearly, it's because of the good performance of our Affirm product. We know that the CT/GC market seems to be flattening in terms of its growth overall. Europe also is kind of declining for several reasons. But one of them is really that we see some increased competition in the mid- to low-volume segment popping up. And also, again in Europe, we're seeing some instrument sales that we had last year, cash sales, which really account for 3% to 4% growth that did not repeat this year.

So that's basically where we are, fairly close to where we anticipated. With Japan, what you're actually seeing in the third quarter is essentially a timing overhang of sales that were made in the second quarter but installed in the third quarter. So that really is the bulk of the supplemental funding that has been spent in Japan. So we don't anticipate additional supplemental funding until the next round it becomes available."

It's very difficult to kind of normalize for the things that are going on. But if you look at over the next three years, which is the way we like to look at things and normalize for things like the stimulus and the pandemic, we believe that in the mid to later part of this three-year horizon, you will see a normalized growth rate for Biosciences in the higher-single digits, something in the 7%, 8%, 9% range. We think that with the launch of new products in Molecular Diagnostics and in cancer screening and with the recovery of testing to more normal levels, we think that the Diagnostics business can be in the 6% to 7% range. It is a little bit below that now. In Medical, with strong growth in Diabetes Care, which is above trend. With a return to stronger growth in Pharma Systems with the launch of some new products that we see in the pipeline and with international expansion, particularly in China and India and Latin America, et cetera, we think Medical can kind of be at the average in the 5%, 6%, 7% range. So if you put that into your longer-term perspective, we think that 6% on average over the next three years is a prudent way to go. And with higher rates in the latter part of the plan, as we sort of come through, a, the economic situation; b, some of the anomalies of flu and stimulus; and c, as we get some line extensions and some new product launches in the '12 and '13 time frame.

So this is really about the U.S. Outside of the U.S., I would say that we've seen a little bit of, again, a slowdown in Europe and mainly in the U.K., where they were programs in place and have been a little kind of discontinued or kind of phased out.

But again, you're going to have, I think, the segmentation that we're looking at and we've been discussing internally about the market in terms of volume batch versus on demand and also with the BD MAX again being an open platform where our customers will be able to run their own assays. And I could even think like in the case of a pandemic, like we've seen last year, instead of us putting a lot of effort in developing a molecular test, our customers could develop their own that they would get from either the CBC in the U.S. or the equivalent of the CBC in other country and be able to run on BD MAX very quickly.

Today, I'd like to begin our presentation with a few remarks regarding BD's solid third quarter, and then spend some time on discussing our current view of the marketplace and BD's opportunities within that context. I'll also discuss our strong commitment to delivering shareholder value and some of the things we're doing to enhance shareholder returns now and in the future.
 It is clear that we're managing through a very challenging time for the global economy and for the healthcare industry segments in which we participate. We recognize that we're not immune to these challenges, and we are committed to aggressively managing the company to deliver strong bottom line growth while continuing to invest for the future. We expect to be a steady ship through these choppy waters based on a combination of actions we're taking. So what are these actions?
 First, we will continue to drive operational efficiency initiatives which are aimed at gross profit improvements such as ReLoCo. Next, we will also reduce G&A costs by streamlining our administrative processes and with the implementation of our SAP upgrade program EVEREST. While EVEREST will be an investment up front, it will deliver significant cost savings longer term.
 Ultimately, our strong product platforms and planned product extensions, along with our focused execution in important emerging markets, will help us accelerate revenue growth. We'll also use our strong cash flow to accelerate share repurchases.  Our steadfast commitment to achieving top line and bottom line growth is a key message I want to leave with you all this morning.
 So now let me comment on the quarter which was a solid one for BD. We delivered EPS from continuing operations of $1.29 per diluted share, which was in-line with company expectations. Importantly, we saw a good performance across the businesses, with all three segments contributing bottom line results consistent with expectations. That being said, as you all know, the quarter was not without significant macroeconomic headwinds for our industry. Globally, spending on healthcare products continue to be challenged. Hospital spending remains at muted levels and lab testing has moderated. Doctor visits in the U.S. continue to show declines due to high unemployment. And the increase in syringe and diagnostic testing volumes from the H1N1 virus in 2009 have not been sustained in 2010. These factors are global but have been even more pronounced in regions, such as the European Union, where they continue to sort through a number of difficult issues.
 We anticipated these market conditions in April when we provided our guidance for fiscal 2010. However, as we have assessed our markets during the third quarter, we now believe that evidence suggests that these conditions are likely to persist in the near term. Despite these global macroeconomic conditions, we expect to deliver bottom line FX-neutral earnings growth of 9% for fiscal 2010, which is in-line with our previously communicated range of 8% to 10% in spite of a higher tax rate than we had originally forecasted.
 Regarding the top line, as we continue to face these macroeconomic spending challenges, we see that fiscal 2010 FX-neutral revenue growth will come in at around 5% rather than the 6% we guided to in our April call. We're confident that the fundamental business strategy we're following is a sound one that will enable us to deliver annual EPS growth over the next three years of 10% to 12% FX-neutral from continuing operations, with revenue expectations of an average of 6% over the same three-year time horizon. This is slightly muted from our prior 7% average three-year growth that we had been discussing.
 Additionally, we expect that our top line during this interval will improve in the later part of the period as the global economy improves and very importantly, as our R&D programs, new product launches and line extensions come through fruition, again, in the later part of the next three years.
 We're confident in our ability to deliver consistent bottom line growth due to a number of factors, including our strong product pipeline and our operational excellence programs, which we continue to expect to drive 50 basis points of operating income improvement annually over the next three years, with the programs I mentioned in the beginning of my remarks. Additionally, the company remains committed to efficient utilization of our strong cash flow. As a component of that, for fiscal year 2010, we are raising our guidance for share repurchases to $700 million, and we expect that we will execute approximately $600 million in share repurchases in 2011 next year. So it's $700 million this year and $600 million next year in share repurchases.
 Before I conclude, I would like to express my congratulations to Vince Forlenza regarding the announcement we issued today. At the board meeting this week, the board elected to add the title of Chief Operating Officer to the title of President, which he now holds. This is a well-deserved recognition of Vince's execution against the additional duties that he has taken on over the last two years. It is also a recognition of the key role he continues to play in developing and implementing BD's strategy and vision and the great leadership and commitment Vince has demonstrated throughout his career at BD.
 As President since January 1, 2009, Vince has overseen BD's three business segments, international and the quality function. In January of this year, Vince also assumed responsibility for the Integrated Global Supply Chain and the IT functions.
 So I'm now delighted to turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Vince Forlenza.

103678,109058755,71290,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives"," Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 5, I'd like to briefly highlight some of our third quarter results. As Ed mentioned in his remarks, our third quarter results were in-line with the company's expectations. Revenues came in at",444," Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 5, I'd like to briefly highlight some of our third quarter results. As Ed mentioned in his remarks, our third quarter results were in-line with the company's expectations. Revenues came in at 3.9% currency neutral, which was impacted by a tough comparison to fiscal year 2009 pandemic flu purchases and slowed by softness in the BD Diagnostics segment.
 BD Medical revenue growth was primarily driven by Diabetes Care products, which were partially offset by the H1N1 flu pandemic impact of about one percentage point and softer Pharmaceutical Systems revenue due to timing of orders in the quarter. BD Diagnostics was impacted by the economic pressures in the U.S., resulting in reduced physician office visits and reduced diagnostic volumes in Europe. The comparison to prior year is also negatively impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal year 2009.
 We experienced an improvement in our Biosciences segment, primarily driven by Cell Analysis, instrument and reagent sales in the U.S., available supplemental funding in Japan and a favorable comparison versus the prior year. We're also pleased with the results in our emerging markets experiencing double-digit top line growth. We believe the company's performance has fared well in a challenging global economy and in the healthcare industry. Based on our results year-to-date, we are confident that we're able to achieve bottom line growth of about 9% currency neutral, which is in-line with our previous range of 8% to 10% for the full fiscal year 2010.
 Moving to Slide 6, you'll see that the company experienced top line growth of 3.9% on a currency-neutral basis for the third quarter. Adjusted EPS decreased by 0.8% to $1.29, however, on a currency-neutral basis, increased by 6.9%. Our nine-month year-to-date results reflect solid revenue growth of 6.5% on a currency-neutral basis and adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% currency neutral.
 Now let's move on to Slide 7, which looks at our guidance for fiscal 2010. As Ed mentioned earlier in his remarks, we have modified our revenue guidance to 6% currency neutral. Our adjusted EPS guidance of about 3% or about 9% on a currency-neutral basis remains in line with our previously communicated range.
 On Slide 8, we will review our revenue guidance by segment. For the Medical segment, currency-neutral growth remains unchanged at about 6%. For the Diagnostics segment, we are modifying our revenue growth to about 4% on a currency-neutral basis due to reduced diagnostic testing and physician visits. For our Bioscience segment, we expect revenues to be approximately 6% currency neutral.
 Now I'll turn the call over to David to review our financial results.

On Slide 10, we begin a review of our revenue growth by segment. First, you can see total top line growth for the company in the quarter was 3.9% currency neutral. For the nine-month period, the company grew",1607," Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everybody. On Slide 10, we begin a review of our revenue growth by segment. First, you can see total top line growth for the company in the quarter was 3.9% currency neutral. For the nine-month period, the company grew 6 1/2% currency neutral. BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 2.7% currency neutral. Excluding the impact of pandemic sales, revenue growth within the quarter was up 3.4%.
 As Vince mentioned earlier, the growth in this segment was mainly driven by the Diabetes Care businesses with continued strong sales of pen needles. Our pen needle growth was led by the successful launch of our new Nano product, the world's smallest pen needle, along with strong growth in emerging markets.
 Pharmaceutical Systems revenue in the quarter was flat mainly due to the timing of orders in the quarter. For the nine-month period, the Medical segment grew 7.6% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the impact of pandemic sales, revenue growth for the nine-month period was up 5.2%.
 Revenues in the BD Diagnostics segment grew 2% currency neutral. Diagnostic Systems business growth was flat year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, partly due to the H1N1 impact in quarter three fiscal year 2009 and the soft demand in the U.S. and Western Europe due to lower diagnostic testing. Partially offsetting these testing declines is a strong growth in our GeneOhm platform of 14% in the quarter. Our Preanalytical Systems business grew 3.9% in the quarter, with strong growth in emerging markets offset lower lab testing volumes in the U.S. For the nine-month period, the Diagnostics segment grew 4.3%.
 BD Biosciences' growth 11.6% currency neutral due to the reasons Vince mentioned earlier in his remarks. In addition, the Advanced Bioprocessing business also experienced very strong double-digit growth in the U.S., primarily due to accelerated timing of large customer order. For the nine-month period, the Biosciences segment grew 7.3%.
 Now I'll turn to Slide 11. We'd like to walk you through the impact of the pandemic flu on the quarterly revenue growth of our business in fiscal year 2010. In the first half of the year, pandemic flu provided a benefit to our revenue growth of 2.4%, which is mainly in the U.S. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect the pandemic flu to result in a 2% negative impact to our revenue growth due to the international pandemic revenues that we recorded in the second half of fiscal year 2009. Adjusting for the effect of pandemic-related orders, the underlying growth is consistent with the full year growth rate of about 5% to 6% currency neutral.
 Now turning to Slide 12, we'll look at our geographic revenue results. On an as-reported basis, in the third quarter, BD's U.S. revenues increased 3%. U.S. Medical revenues increased 1% year-over-year. U.S. sales of diagnostics products increased 1.4%, impacted by reduced physician offices visits and lower diagnostic testing. Biosciences revenues in the U.S. increased 14.8% due to strong revenue growth in the Cell Analysis business, led by research, instruments and reagents. International revenues grew 4.6% on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter, with soft Western Europe being offset by growth at Asia-Pacific and Latin America.
 Growth in our Medical segment at 3.9% was driven by strong emerging market growth, partially offset by timing in orders with our Pharmaceutical Systems business. The Diagnostics segment grew 2.7% currency neutral, driven by growth in Preanalytical System's emerging markets, partially offset by Western Europe. Biosciences grew at about 10% currency neutral mainly driven by strong growth in Japan.
 For the nine-month period, reported U.S. revenues were 6.3% with Medical increasing 7 1/2%, Diagnostics increasing 4% and Biosciences growing 8%. International revenues were strong in our Medical segment with underlying growth at 7.6% currency neutral. The Diagnostics segment grew at 4.6% and Biosciences grew at 6.8% currency neutral.
 Moving on to global safety on Slide 13. Sales grew 3.3% on a currency-neutral basis to $436 million in the quarter. This was comprised of a 1.6% growth rate in the U.S. and an underlying international growth rate of 6 1/2%, but the Medical and Diagnostics segments are being negatively affected by previous pandemic orders. For the nine-month period, underlying growth was 6.6% on a currency-neutral basis, which is a combination of the 5.9% growth rate in the U.S. and an underlying growth rate international safety of about 8% on a currency-neutral basis.
 Next, I will review the third quarter revenue growth. Looking at the third quarter revenue growth, gains from our underlying performance of 3.9% and the 0.9% favorable impact of currency translation were offset in part by the 1.6% unfavorable impact from our hedging program.
 Moving to Slide 15, gross margin declined 100 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin performance, however, improved 20 basis points, mainly driven by strong favorable product mix that was partially offset by increased resins and start-up costs of our ReLoCo program and pension costs. This favorable performance was more than offset by the unfavorable currency translation and unfavorable hedging costs.
 Slide 16 recaps the third quarter income statement, highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. As discussed earlier, third quarter revenue growth was 3.9% and gross profit grew faster at 4.2%. Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased 3% currency neutral, which is 100 basis point improvement over the prior year as a percent of revenue. This reduction was primarily driven by a decrease in our deferred compensation plan expenses, reflecting lower returns that reduces our SSG&A expense and correspondingly is offset by a loss on the interest income line.  Additionally, we continue to place tight controls on our G&A spending that were able to more than offset the unfavorable pension and EVEREST expense we've been incurring.
 R&D almost increased 10% or 40 basis points as a percent of revenue over the prior period. The acceleration is in-line with our expectation, which continues to increase in the second half of the fiscal year due to funding of key strategic initiatives. Our operating income increased 10.2% as a result of the improved operating margins on a currency-neutral basis.
 I would also like to point out that the tax rate for the quarter is higher than prior year due to the absence of the R&D tax credit and the unfavorable impact related to geographic mix of income. In our full year guidance, we have increased the tax rate to 28.5% to reflect this unfavorable mix.
 Moving to Slide 17, year-to-date revenue growth increased 7.2%. Performance and currency contributed 6 1/2% and 3.3%, respectfully, which was partially offset by the hedge with a 2.6% unfavorable impact.
 Looking at our gross margin change year-over-year on Slide 18, we experienced a 90 basis-point decline as a percent of revenue. Favorable performance of 50 basis points reflects favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable startup and pension costs. This favorable performance was more than offset by the currency and hedging costs.
 Slide 19 recaps the nine-month year-to-date income statement, highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. Revenue growth was 6 1/2% currency neutral and gross profit was 7.7%. Moving down the income statement, the SSG&A increased about 3% currency neutral impacted by EVEREST and our pension costs.
 For the nine-month period, R&D expense increased 4.3%, which is lower than what we expect for the full year. We expect R&D spends to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 13.1% as a result of our strong gross margin and controlled SSG&A expenses.
 Moving to slide 20 to recap our results for the nine-month period. We are pleased with the results in a difficult macroeconomic environment. We experienced lower-than-expected revenue growth which is mainly due to the euro weakness and lower hospital admissions and lab testing. We expect slightly higher operating margins reflecting the gross margin improvement and operational excellence programs.
 Earnings are in-line with expectations, and we are committed to delivering about 9% adjusted EPS growth for the full fiscal year 2010 despite the higher tax rate that I just discussed. I would like to point out that our year-to-date EPS performance is just over 11%, and our total year is 9%, which implies the fourth quarter is essentially flat. There are two contributing factors impacting our expected results.
 First, as I previously mentioned to you, the absence of fourth quarter pandemic revenue as compared to prior year impacted revenue by 3%. Secondly, we're seeing higher resin costs as compared to prior year as discussed on our quarter two earnings call. Our cash flows remain strong and we'll be increasing our share repurchases from $550 million to $700 million, which supports our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders.
 I would like to reiterate Ed's comments in the beginning of our call today that while we are not immune to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment, we are confident that we have the tools to overcome these challenges through our strong product platform and geographic diversity, along with the operational excellence programs we have put in place.
 Before we open the call to questions, I'd like to introduce and welcome to BD, Zac Nagle, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac will serve as the primary liaison between BD and its investors and the analyst community. Zac is a seasoned investor relations leader who brings over 16 years of experience and a deep understanding of the investment community to BD, including investor relations positions that he had in both Flowserve and Dell. Sherry Bertner will continue to work with BD in a advisory role. We look forward to introducing Zac to everyone in the coming months.
 Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Vince to begin the Q&A.

But since you mentioned, fiscal year '11, it's probably good for me right now to discuss foreign currency and our hedging program as we look forward. We made a rough estimate on how currencies may impact our next year results if they held at current rates. We estimate that revenues would be negatively impacted by about 2%. If you factor in the normal drop of roughly 25% to 35% to operating income. And tax effect that, the negative impact would be about 2% to our EPS growth, reported EPS growth. And at this point, we still haven't entered into any hedges as they continue to be very costly and there's a lot of volatility obviously that still exists.

But the only environmental change we've been able to pick up is the potential movement in Spain to go to a national tender rather than regional tenders. It's not clear whether that can happen or will happen, so that's about the only thing. But we're watching this very closely. From what we've seen so far, we're in a constrained pricing environment and has not really changed where it's been over the last several years in that respect.

Again, it's a little bit of a mixed bag of performance if you look worldwide. So overall, U.S. is, I would say, doing okay. And I will separate the TriPath and molecular so that you understand better. But really, Europe and Canada are the two regions where we've been suffering. So although in TriPath, the sales this quarter were about $33 million, and we see a growth which is kind of slow in the U.S., reflecting the economy, the weak economy, and the lower visits to the physicians. We're seeing very good growth in Asia on the TriPath products. But unfortunately, these have been offset by a decline in Europe where we see, in some of the countries, the increase in troubles being mandated. So for instance in Belgium today, instead of having one cervical cancer test per year, it's now every two years, and this is really impacting directly the business. And the last piece is that we have, in the same quarter of last year in Canada, a very large cash order of instrument that didn't repeat this year. In molecular, the picture is a bit different. Actually, the U.S. has been doing pretty good. But clearly, it's because of the good performance of our Affirm product. We know that the CT/GC market seems to be flattening in terms of its growth overall. Europe also is kind of declining for several reasons. But one of them is really that we see some increased competition in the mid- to low-volume segment popping up. And also, again in Europe, we're seeing some instrument sales that we had last year, cash sales, which really account for 3% to 4% growth that did not repeat this year. So that's basically the picture on the Women's Health and Cancer.

Actually, I think it's important to mention the very good growth that we've had in the U.S., which is about 20% growth year-on-year in this quarter. And this is really driven by Cdiff, which is very strong, but also, I would say supported by the new MRSA achromopeptidase and chemistry we have for MRSA, which is getting a lot of traction on the market and has enabled us also to gain some competitive conversion to our systems. So I'm very pleased on the this front. A couple of things I want to mention also on both sides is that for GeneOhm and HAI, we're doing good progress with our new platform, BD MAX. As you know, we've got the approval for [indiscernible] (49:33) on the two colors in May and we're working with the FDA to gain moderate complexity status. And so I just would like you to stay tuned on that. So as soon we know more, we will let you know. The plan to develop the BD MAX six colors is going on as planned and so far launch by the end of 2011, beginning of 2012. We are still on plan to do that. Clinical trials starting at the end of this calendar year. We can see very clearly a lot of good traction already. Customers asking us for this platform, given its potential use as an open platform. So this is great on GeneOhm. And just the last thing I want to come back on TriPath is that we are doing our BBL trials on GasPak Plus, which are doing very well. And so we are also on track to start our clinical trials at the end of this quarter for GasPak Plus.

It's very difficult to kind of normalize for the things that are going on. But if you look at over the next three years, which is the way we like to look at things and normalize for things like the stimulus and the pandemic, we believe that in the mid to later part of this three-year horizon, you will see a normalized growth rate for Biosciences in the higher-single digits, something in the 7%, 8%, 9% range. We think that with the launch of new products in Molecular Diagnostics and in cancer screening and with the recovery of testing to more normal levels, we think that the Diagnostics business can be in the 6% to 7% range. It is a little bit below that now. In Medical, with strong growth in Diabetes Care, which is above trend. With a return to stronger growth in Pharma Systems with the launch of some new products that we see in the pipeline and with international expansion, particularly in China and India and Latin America, et cetera, we think Medical can kind of be at the average in the 5%, 6%, 7% range. So if you put that into your longer-term perspective, we think that 6% on average over the next three years is a prudent way to go.

So of course CT/GC is going to be on the LT. Clearly, BD MAX today, we focus our efforts in making sure that we're going to get BD MAX in the market with our HAI assay, which is really the burning issue for us, so that's where we put all our efforts. Soon after that, we'll expand the menu. Menu is key to this platform, and certainly the customers will be able to run assays later on like CT/GC or others on BD MAX have a different type of volume than what you see on customers using Vipers today. So it's a more flexible platform and on which we intend to increase menu after we get the HAI assay's on board. But again, you're going to have, I think, the segmentation that we're looking at and we've been discussing internally about the market in terms of volume batch versus on demand and also with the BD MAX again being an open platform where our customers will be able to run their own assays. And I could even think like in the case of a pandemic, like we've seen last year, instead of us putting a lot of effort in developing a molecular test, our customers could develop their own that they would get from either the CBC in the U.S. or the equivalent of the CBC in other country and be able to run on BD MAX very quickly. So we believe this is a pretty compelling argument for our customers to get into BD MAX.

Today, I'll begin with a brief overview of BD's performance for Q4 and the full year 2010 and provide some context around BD's consistency in delivering against our commitments to shareholders over time. Then I'll spend some time highlighting the company's strategy and key focus areas for 2011 and beyond. Next, David will provide a drill down financial view of our company overall and segment performance, as well as key components of our 2011 guidance, including our capital structure and some of the key risks and opportunities over the near term. Lastly, Vince will spend the balance of our time discussing in greater detail how we will execute our strategies and the key things to think about relative to BD's strategy going forward. After that, we'll open the floor for questions.
Starting with Slide 4. BD's performance in both the Q4 and full year 2010 was solid. We delivered against our own internal targets and against our commitments to our shareholders. This is the 10th consecutive year BD has achieved its annual objectives. It is also the 38th consecutive year of increasing our dividends. In addition, in 2010, we maintained consistent operational excellence across the P&L. We invested in capital expenditures, invested in emerging market infrastructure, increased our investment in R&D and delivered steady predictable cash flow and return to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.
Moving on to Slide 5. Going forward, our strategy remains sound. BD's strategy is to apply technology to address unmet and sometimes underappreciated, but important needs within healthcare and life sciences. Our four areas of focus are as follows: number one, enabling safer, simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery, and this translates to safer drug delivery for patients and for healthcare workers; number two, improving clinical outcomes through new, accurate faster diagnostics; number three, providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitate basic science, drug discovery and cell therapy; and number four, enhancing disease management in Diabetes, Women's Health and Cancer and Infection Control. If you sum these four areas up, essentially BD is all about helping life science research and healthcare work better. We do this by helping them to lower their costs and improve the quality of their outcomes. And it's very consistent with our purpose of helping all people live healthy lives. We are confident that these four areas of focus are rich with opportunities for BD to add value and to continue to grow.
Turning to Slide 6. Despite these challenging economic times, the company remains committed to driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening the core, which remains a significant lever for BD's success. In addition, as Vince will discuss in detail later, we will leverage our core by making focused investments in R&D for platform extensions and innovative new products. We're also making significant investments in growing our businesses in emerging markets. And also very importantly, we continue to focus on operational excellence and the programs that we're building across the P&L to maintain and build upon a strong cost position, as well as to return free cash flow to shareholders.
On Slide 7, you will see our guidance for the full year fiscal 2011, which takes into account all of the key points I've discussed in my opening remarks. David will discuss the guidance in more detail, but the net is guidance for 2011 of 4% revenue growth and 10% to 11% adjusted EPS growth or a range of EPS between $5.45 and $5.55. As you will hear from David in a minute, the 4% revenue growth is FX neutral and really represents about 6% growth over 2010 if you normalize for flu, stimulus and supplemental spending events in 2010. 
Our guidance for operating income growth of about 5% includes about five points of headwind due to investments we are making in infrastructure and R&D in 2011. So that allowing for these investments, we're showing good operating margin improvement in 2011. Looking further out, our outlook for 2011, 2012 is for an average revenue growth of 6% and an average EPS growth of 10% to 12% over this three-year period, and this was previously communicated on our Q3 2010 earnings call. 
Now I'm delighted to turn the call over to David."
103678,114504025,85341,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the company's results, I'd like to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we completed the sale of the Ophthalmic business, as well as surgical blades product platform an",2369,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the company's results, I'd like to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we completed the sale of the Ophthalmic business, as well as surgical blades product platform and our critical care platform and the extended dwell catheter product platforms. The results of operations associated with Ophthalmic Systems, surgical blade platform and the critical care platforms have been classified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this presentation. A portion of the assets related to the extended dwell catheter product platform are still reported within continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met for this asset group.
On Slide 9, I would like to walk through the impact of the divestiture in the second quarter pro forma item on our EPS. At the end of fiscal year 2010, our EPS was $5.11, excluding the $0.38 gain from the sale of our businesses as discussed earlier. The result of operations associated with these business have been classified as discontinued operations. This had a $0.21 impact, which brings you to our reported EPS of $4.90. In the second quarter of our fiscal year, we had a noncash charge related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. That charge is worth $0.04. If you add that to our reported EPS, you would arrive at a pro forma EPS of $4.94. Looking forward to fiscal year 2011, we will be growing about 10% to 12% of our pro forma EPS of $4.94. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'd like to briefly highlight some of our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the company's expectations. Revenue came in at almost 3%, currency neutral, which was partially impacted by tough comparisons to the fourth fiscal quarter in 2009, due to pandemic flu sales in both Medical and Diagnostics segments. We are pleased with the results we saw in our emerging markets as well, experiencing double-digit top line growth across most regions. We also delivered on our EPS guidance coming in at $1.24 for the quarter.
On Slide 11, you will see that revenues came in at almost $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS increased to $1.24 or almost 2% currency neutral. Our total year revenues of $7.4 billion reflects solid growth of about 5.5% on a currency-neutral basis and an adjusted EPS growth of about 9% currency neutral.
Now let's move on to Slide 12 where we review our growth by segment. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased about 2% currency neutral. The growth in this segment was mainly driven by our Diabetes Care business with continued strong sales of pen needles. The Medical segment was negatively impacted by about four percentage point due to sales related to the flu pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the total year, the Medical segment grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis.
Revenues in BD Diagnostics segment grew about 3% currency neutral, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic flu-related orders in 2009 by about two percentage points. The Diagnostics segment also experienced softness due to lower lab testing and physician office visits. However, we have seen this trend stabilize in the fourth quarter, particularly in our Preanalytical Systems business. For the total year, the Diagnostics segment grew 4% currency neutral. 
BD Biosciences revenue growth was about 5% currency neutral, driven by strong instrument and reagent sales in our Cell Analysis business. For the total year, the Biosciences segment grew 6.8% currency neutral, benefited by the supplemental and stimulus spending in Japan and the U.S.
Now turning to Slide 13. We'll look at our geographic results. In the fourth quarter, BD's U.S. revenues increased about 1% or about 3% when adjusting for the impact of flu-related sales in 2009. U.S. Medical revenues increased about 2% year-over-year. U.S. sales of Diagnostics products increased about 1%, partially due to reduced OB/GYN visits negatively impacting our TriPath business unit. Biosciences revenue in the U.S. increased about 0.6% due to growth in Cell Analysis business unit being offset by the timing of several large customer orders in our Advanced Bioprocessing business unit.
International revenues grew about 4% on a currency-neutral basis in the fourth quarter. After taking out the impact of flu, about four percentage points, underlying growth was 8.2% in the fourth quarter, which represents an upward trend in sequential quarterly growth rates and is driven by emerging markets in high-growth regions. For the total year, U.S. revenues were about 5%, with Medical increasing about 6% and Diagnostics increasing about 3%, with Biosciences also growing about 6%. International revenues grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Overall, international growth was adversely affected by lingering macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe and a tough comparison from flu-related sales. This was more than offset by the double-digit growth in our emerging markets, which are Asia Pacific, EMA and Latin America. In these areas, we continue to see expansion of healthcare funding and patient access. BD is investing heavily in certain high-growth markets, such as China and India, where we see unmet need that align well with BD's capabilities. 
Moving now to global safety on Slide 14. Reported sales grew almost 4% in the quarter to $443 million. On a currency-neutral basis, safety growth was about 5%. This was comprised of about 2.5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 9%. For the total year, safety growth was 6% on a currency-neutral basis, which is a combination of about 5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 8% on a currency-neutral basis. In the Medical segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Nexiva and safety diet products, while international safety is being driven by infusion therapy products. In the Diagnostics segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, and the international growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, as well as Eclipse.
Now I'd like to move on to Slide 15, where I'll walk you through the impact of pandemic flu had on our quarterly revenue growth rate on our business in fiscal year 2010. In the first half of the year, pandemic flu provided a benefit to our revenue growth of 2.5%, which is mainly in the U.S. For the second half of the fiscal year, the pandemic flu resulted in an almost 2% negative impact to our revenue growth, due to the international pandemic revenues that we recorded in the second half of fiscal year 2009 that did not repeat in fiscal year 2010. For the full year, the net impact to revenues is about 20 basis point benefit. As we discussed last quarter, we also received additional Biosciences stimulus and supplemental orders in the U.S. and Japan. This benefited fiscal year 2010 by about 50 basis points. 
As we look at fiscal year 2011, the pandemic flu revenues that were recorded in the first half of fiscal year 2010 will represent a difficult comparison, particularly in the first quarter. In the full fiscal year 2011, we are not anticipating either of these events to recur, which is about a 200 basis point impact on our growth, as Ed discussed earlier. 
Now moving on to Slide 16. We'll review our revenue growth in the fourth quarter, where our reported growth rate was 1%. Currency-neutral revenue growth was about 3%, which was negatively impacted by about 2% points of currency translation. There was no hedge impact in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 17. And looking at our gross margin, we experienced about 100 basis points of positive currency impact. Within the performance category of 110 basis points, we had positive operating performance of about 70 basis points, which was more than offset by higher raw material costs, higher pension costs and start-up costs. As a result, net margin was down about 10 basis points.
Slide 18 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. As discussed earlier, fourth quarter revenue was about 3% currency neutral, and gross profit grew about 1% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement line, SSG&A increased about 4% currency neutral, due to pension and EVEREST and our SAP implementation costs. 
R&D increased 10% or about 50 basis points as a percent of revenue over the prior period. This acceleration in R&D is in line with our expectations as we're continuing to invest in new products and platforms. Our operating margin decreased 4.5% due to the higher resin, start-up and ReLoCo costs. In addition, increased SSG&A and accelerated R&D costs were contributing factors. I would also like to point out that our earnings also reflect two items that essentially offset each other. The gain on the sale of our extended dwell catheter product platform that remains in continuing operations of about $18 million was mostly offset by $14 million write-off of equity investments. 
Now turning to Slide 19. I'd like to look at the total year revenue, which growth increased about 5.5%. Performance and currency contributed about 5.6% and 2%, respectfully [respectively], which was partially offset by the hedge with about 2% unfavorable impact.
On Slide 20, we can see that our gross margin change year-over-year was a positive 20 basis point improvement. It was comprised of a 100 basis point improvement of underlying performance, which was more than offset by ReLoCo and pension costs. This positive performance was offset by 90 basis points of negative hedge impact.
Slide 21 now recaps the total year income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. Revenue growth was 5.6% currency neutral, and gross profit was 6% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 3% currency neutral, primarily impacted by higher EVEREST and pension costs. Excluding those items, our costs would have been essentially flat. For the total year, R&D increased 6% currency neutral, which is in line with our expectations. Operating income increased almost 9% as a result of strong gross margin and controlled SSG&A expenses. I would also like to point out that the tax rate for the year is higher than prior year, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.
Now before I discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2011, I want to briefly address BD's capital structure. Given our solid investment grade ratings and the historically low interest rates in the market, we believe it's prudent for BD to seek use of this opportunity to improve the efficiency of our capital structure. Our guiding principles as we look at this are: one, to maintain a solid investment grade rating; second, to ensure ongoing access to debt markets for strategic opportunities; and third, to optimize the cost of capital based upon market conditions. As a result, we plan to access the credit markets in the coming weeks. While a definitive amount of debt has yet to be determined, we don't expect it to exceed $1 billion. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, as well as share repurchases. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of common stock in 2011 and an additional $600 million in 2012. The company plans to fund the repurchases through ongoing cash flow and the issuance of debt.
Now I'd like to move on to fiscal year '11 guidance. Moving to Slide 23. I'd like to walk you through that guidance. For the year, we are guiding top line growth of about 4% to $7.7 billion. If you exclude the impact of pandemic sales and stimulus dollars in 2010, the underlying growth is about 6%. We expect our gross profit margins to improve by 30 to 50 basis points as we start to see the benefits of ReLoCo and improved product mix. 
SSG&A is expected to increase about 4% due to increased pension costs, EVEREST, SAP implementation costs and investment in our shared services centers. This is an incremental cost of about $50 million, which will be partially offset by G&A efficiency programs. We plan to increase R&D about 10%, mainly driven by the investments in Diabetes Care and Women's Health and Cancer platforms, which Vince will elaborate on later. 
Operating income is expected to increase about 10 to 30 points. Excluding the effects of pandemic, stimulus and the previously mentioned incremental investments, underlying growth will be about 13%. We expect our tax rate to moderately decrease as a result of the geographic mix of our business and the anticipation of the R&D tax credit being extended in fiscal year '11. We expect our cash flow to remain strong and our operating cash is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in fiscal year '11, as I mentioned earlier. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion in shares. Capital expenditures will remain in line with our 2010 spending at approximately $550 million to $575 million.
For our bottom line, we expect EPS to grow about 10% to 12%, resulting in our EPS guidance of $5.45 to $5.55. At this point, we are not anticipating any year-over-year impact from currency. The $0.08 hedge loss that occurred in fiscal year '10 will be offset by holding losses on our cost of goods sold in fiscal year '11. For fiscal year '11, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to be broadly in line with fiscal year '10.
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to remind you that our first quarter will be significantly impacted by the tough comparison to fiscal year 2010 as related to the pandemic flu. Therefore, our revenues and earnings in the first quarter will essentially be flat. 
Before I turn the call over to Vince, I would just like to highlight our solid finish to the year in a difficult environment. Our performance this year has given us continued confidence that our strategy is sound and our efficiency programs are delivering. We are continuing to drive top and bottom line growth by investing in key R&D projects and by investing in new programs to drive operational efficiencies. We're also seeking to maximize our capital structure, and in doing so, release more cash to our shareholders. 
Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Vince."
103678,114504025,85341,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the",1867,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the short run. However, we are very confident in -- what we are very confident in is the universal human drive to improve our standard of living and to live longer, healthier lives. That desire is pervasive globally and will ultimately drive greater demand for healthcare products and services over the long run. And that's how BD thinks about the business, successfully meeting these needs in existing and innovative ways over the long run.
In the short run, there are opportunities to help customers improve the quality and cost of healthcare in the developed world, while we also help developing countries improve their healthcare systems. BD has strong growth drivers in place to capitalize on these needs, and as you've heard, we are increasing our investments in R&D despite these challenging times. BD is also investing heavily in emerging markets to ensure we are serving the fastest-growing opportunities with the right products for those markets profitably. And lastly, BD is consistently investing in ongoing operational excellence programs across the P&L to continually improve our competitiveness.
Turning to Slide 26. I would like to briefly review the fiscal year 2011 guidance by segment. Again, it's important to note, as David highlighted, this guidance is relative to tough comparisons, particularly in Q1 due to the factors he enumerated earlier. For the year, we're looking at an average of about 4% for the business overall. By segment, this equates to about 4% for Medical and Biosciences, with Diagnostics slightly faster at 5% FX neutral. Excluding the effects of 2010 flu pandemic, stimulus and supplemental spending, that equates to approximately 6% for total BD as David mentioned earlier.
Now I'd like to turn to the growth drivers we expect to drive success for BD over both the short and long terms. Turning to Slide 27. There are a number of things we are excited about with respect to BD's Medical business going forward. For example, many of you have heard us to discuss our reliable low cost, or ReLoCo, program in the past. In short, ReLoCo is a global, cross-functional business initiative established to sustain a low-cost capability and advantage for Medical Surgical Systems. We began implementation in 2009 and we'll continue through 2013. ReLoCo targets a number of areas, including our manufacturing architecture, process technology, work systems, product design, materials and packaging. We expect the program to break even in 2011 and to reach steady state savings of approximately $50 million to $60 million annually in 2013.
Our ReLoCo program also enables a second major benefit for BD, which is accelerating growth in cost-sensitive markets where the company is underpenetrated. Today, the current focus of the program is in Hypodermic. We refer to this initiative as our ReKindle program. The ReKindle strategy is supported by three strategic pillars. First, achieving a cost-competitive position for the Hypodermic portfolio to enable the necessary pricing flexibility to compete and drive markets to affordable, higher-value products; second, offering a complete portfolio of Hypodermic products to meet the unique needs of all key target segments globally; and third, bringing a highly effective local execution approach to each segment we're targeting, aligned with the circumstances and the needs of those segments. At this time, we're not going to disclose the precise products or segments targeted for ReLoCo and ReKindle for obvious competitive reasons, but there will be more to follow on future calls as we continue to make progress.
Looking at Slide 28. There are also other examples of growth drivers in the Medical segment. In our IV Catheter offering, we recently launched the first Healthcare Worker Safety product in China called Intima II safety and earlier, the Intima II. Intima II and Intima II safety were both specifically designed to meet the local clinical practices for the Chinese market. This is a good example of combining BD's capabilities with strong knowledge of local product needs to grow in emerging markets like China.
In fiscal year 2010, the Pharmaceutical Systems business expanded our offering of self-administration products with Physioject, our new AutoInjector. We have obtained several customers and are building a nice pipeline.
In Diabetes Care, we are extending our leadership with pen needles, as well as innovating with new safety pen needles in 2011. We are also partnering with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and will be leveraging our expertise as a leader in insulin delivery and acute care infusion to launch new products that will improve the patient experience and therapy outcomes for insulin pump users.
Turning to Slide 29. I'd like to walk through some of the future growth drivers in the Diagnostics segment. In this space, we are strengthening our leadership in microbiology, while investing in innovation to expand our position in molecular and cancer diagnostics. Many of you have expressed interest in BD MAX, our new and upcoming automated HAI Molecular Diagnostics system. We're pleased with the progress of the new six-color BD MAX. It's performing very well in our labs, and we're on track to launch that as an open system in Q3 of calendar '11. The more significant BD MAX MRSA assay launch is on track for the beginning of calendar 2012 in the EU and mid-2012 in the U.S. Beyond BD MAX, we are continuing to invest in the BD Viper XTR with fully automated specimen processing and a smaller Viper LT system, which was exhibited for the first time this year at ASM, and this is to replace ProbeTec. In addition to investing in those two platforms, we are also continuing to develop our HPV test. In our Women's Health and Cancer business, we expect to launch our BD SurePath Plus Molecular Pap test in calendar 2013, which is in clinical trial right now. 
Turning to Slide 30. In our Biosciences segment, we have strong reagent and instrument opportunities. In this space, we continue to be the leader in providing researchers and clinicians with the tools they need to better and more fully understand the cell and to be seen as the partner of choice in providing the answer to cells-based scientific challenges. As examples, we are developing two next-generation analyzers. One for the research Cell Analysis segment and one for CD4 testing for the developing world. This year, we will also be launching a next-generation lower-cost desk top sorter to make this product line more accessible to researchers globally. 
Additionally, we recently announced the opening of our animal-free, antibiotic-free facility in Miami for cell culture media and peptones, which opens up significant opportunity in this sizable market. We will launch a new animal-free media supplement for bioproduction and a new serum-free media for certain stem cells this year.
Turning to Slide 31. BD maintains a tremendous focus on emerging markets and geographic expansion. This is where a significant amount of our investment dollars have been going and will continue to go in the future. We've seen some of the benefits in 2010 as BD's International business grew approximately 6% FX neutral, and the emerging markets within that grew at approximately 13%, FX neutral. In these markets, we have some areas of specific product focus such as HIV monitoring, TB Diagnostics and Diabetes Care and some areas of operational excellence focus, such as ReLoCo, to name a few. But more broadly, the opportunity for BD is to align BD's traditional capabilities around the key health needs in these markets.
To do this, we're investing heavily in sales people, sales training and importantly, the customer education needed to manage the growth in these developing nations. We're taking a tiered approach to intra-region geographic expansion and account management, so we're maximizing feet on the street. We're engaging with public officials, opinion leaders and healthcare associations to assist with building better healthcare policy, guidelines and best practices and becoming a preferred partner in the regions.
Over time, we will complement our growing sales and marketing presence with increased local manufacturing and R&D. As we continue to analyze these markets and develop penetration plans one by one in order to tailor strategies to best compete based on each market's unique situation. Based on these continued investments in emerging markets, we believe we can deliver double-digit emerging market growth, again, in 2011 and continued strong growth in the future.
Turning to Slide 32. As I outlined in my initial comments, BD is continuously driving operational excellence into everything we do. At any given time, we have a number of cost improvement programs we are engaged in. Today, I'd like to just highlight a few of the key programs we're working on and the progress we're making. One key program is ReLoCo, which I discussed earlier in my remarks. Another key operational excellence program is EVEREST, which is our SAP program, a global enterprise resource planning initiative designed to optimize processes and refresh technology to drive operating effectiveness and improve service to our customers. We're pleased with the progress of this program and have completed the design phase. We are now in the implementation phase. Although we are still three years out from completing worldwide implementation of the full program, this full program will allow us to shut off several legacy systems and should enable us to reap significant savings over the long term.
We will also remain focused on SSG&A. For example, we are creating four shared service centers to consolidate things, such as back-office HR, finance and customer service. This will enable us to reduce the number of non-customer facing roles, so that we may invest more heavily in sales people in areas like China, Latin America and other emerging markets. We recently announced a shared service center in San Antonio, consolidating work for North America, and we will consolidate Asia-Pacific transactions in a shared service center in Singapore.
On Slide 33. Before we open the call to questions, I would just like to reiterate the key messages I'd like for you to take away from our discussion today. First, going forward, our strategy remains sound, to apply technology to address unmet and underappreciated, but important needs within the healthcare and life sciences. Second, despite the challenging economic times we're facing, the company remains focused on driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening our core franchise and leveraging that core through a number of important initiatives. These initiatives include making focused R&D investments, to deliver key platform extensions and innovative new products and in emerging markets, to take the strength of the global BD business model to these rapidly growing segments where the local needs are tremendous and unique.
And third, consistent with another core strength of BD, we continue to focus on operational excellence programs across the P&L to maintain our strong cost position. As a result, we remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

This year, we're just going to be seeing a similar thing going into fiscal year '11, and that is that the inventory was put in. If you look at the average rate for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year '10, the rate was in the mid-$1.20s, and now we know where the spot rate is. When that comes out, we're going to wind up experiencing a loss associated with it. So we're saying is that loss is roughly offsetting the hedge that we had this year, which was worth about $0.08 that wouldn't repeat going into next year.

So first at the R&D, there's both more of a short-term and long-term component to it. And what's happening right now is some of the significant programs are moving into the more final phases in clinical trials. So the biggest increase in R&D in the company is in the Diagnostic segment. And the biggest increase within that is in Women's Health and Cancer, and that is for SurePath Plus, and that has -- we've talked about that a number of times that we were anticipating going into the clinical trial. We have redone that product, and we have now got an automated solution that we're very excited about. So that's moving into clinicals, and that clinical is going to take a year or so. So your first benchmark on the Diagnostics spending is going to be completion of that clinical trial. The second big benchmark on Diagnostics, of course, is going to be the six-color BD MAX and over this plan period, we are, as we said, it's working well in the labs and then we'll be moving into clinical trials on that product first for MRSA, right? And of course, that ramps up our spending as we move into these clinical trials. So those are the first two biggest ones. HPV itself isn't ramping that much this year, but it'll ramp later. So when you hear us start to talk about HPV going into clinical trial, that'll be another benchmark. So those are kind of the big benchmarks on Diagnostics. Now coming back to BD Medical, some of the things that I would point to. Number one, would be the Diabetes business. And in the Diabetes Care business, in the short run, it's the launch of the new safety pen needle. But the more significant one will be the new set of infusion products for pumps, for insulin pumps. And that work is a new program for us, so that is also driving some of the increase in R&D. Also, we're investing in self-injection in Pharmaceutical Systems. I did mention the first product there, Physioject. And so I think we'll be monitoring the ramp up of that product and then we'll talk to you as things progress, other products in that area. Come back to Biosciences, Biosciences, it is this new sorter and these other two analyzers, a small research analyzer and a small clinical analyzer, CD4 analyzer, for the emerging markets. So those are kind of the core areas. Now lastly, and I think we could all measure quite specifically on those. We are also increasing our investment in longer-term technologies. And when those come out of feasibility, then and we enter into product development, then we'll start talking about them more. So if you'll hear that, that will be the last indicator we'd look for."

What you are seeing is on a performance basis, the performance basis, we're expecting our gross margin increase 40 to 60 basis points, which is excellent product underlying operating performance and our margins being offset, as I talked about earlier, higher resins and higher pension costs. And within that operating performance, we're also expecting to see some benefits in our ReLoCo program. So overall, I think the operations group, as well as the Medical organization is doing a fantastic job in driving margin improvements in those areas. We've got some one-offs that are outside our control, like the pensions and the resins that are pulling that down a little bit, but we're feeling really good about our operating margins and the improvement in our profitability."

And then next year, what we're saying we're assuming we get the R&D tax credit and a different mix of business, and that's why we're guiding the tax rate for the full year to be in that 27% to 27.5%, which is similar to what we saw in fiscal year '09.

And as you think through the forecast, going out, what we try to achieve is that 50 basis point average year-over-year. I think your second question is the leverage. Obviously, as our top line revenue growth increases, that clearly provides more leverage to increase R&D. But we really don't think about our research and development investment level as a percent of revenue. What we do as we saw this year as we have the opportunities to invest in these new products and new platforms, we have the financial means to invest in those, and I think Vince went through that there's numerous opportunities. It's not just one program that's driving it. We just see a breadth of opportunities from an R&D perspective to invest in right now. So we're going to be doing the right thing.

Tom's responsibilities will include Molecular Diagnostics, TriPath, Point of Care, Microbiology Systems and GeneOhm. Tom began his BD career in 1997 and held a number of sales and marketing leadership roles with increasing responsibilities in both BD Biosciences and BD Diagnostics. In 2005, Tom left BD to join Baxter Healthcare, where he held a number of senior leadership positions, most recently as General Manager for Baxter Global Injectables. 
Last year, Tom rejoined BD as the President of Preanalytical Systems. We are delighted to have Tom joining our team and believe that his diverse experience across the diagnostic and medical device and pharmaceutical industries make him ideal to lead BD Diagnostics Systems through its next phase of growth.

Then I",722,"Thank you, Zach, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll begin with a brief overview of BD's performance for Q4 and the full year 2010 and provide some context around BD's consistency in delivering against our commitments to shareholders over time. Then I'll spend some time highlighting the company's strategy and key focus areas for 2011 and beyond. Next, David will provide a drill down financial view of our company overall and segment performance, as well as key components of our 2011 guidance, including our capital structure and some of the key risks and opportunities over the near term. Lastly, Vince will spend the balance of our time discussing in greater detail how we will execute our strategies and the key things to think about relative to BD's strategy going forward. After that, we'll open the floor for questions.
Starting with Slide 4. BD's performance in both the Q4 and full year 2010 was solid. We delivered against our own internal targets and against our commitments to our shareholders. This is the 10th consecutive year BD has achieved its annual objectives. It is also the 38th consecutive year of increasing our dividends. In addition, in 2010, we maintained consistent operational excellence across the P&L. We invested in capital expenditures, invested in emerging market infrastructure, increased our investment in R&D and delivered steady predictable cash flow and return to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.
Moving on to Slide 5. Going forward, our strategy remains sound. BD's strategy is to apply technology to address unmet and sometimes underappreciated, but important, needs within healthcare and life sciences. Our four areas of focus are as follows: number one, enabling safer, simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery, and this translates to safer drug delivery for patients and for healthcare workers; number two, improving clinical outcomes through new, accurate faster diagnostics; number three, providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitate basic science, drug discovery and cell therapy; and number four, enhancing disease management in Diabetes, Women's Health and Cancer and Infection Control. If you sum these four areas up, essentially BD is all about helping life science research and healthcare work better. We do this by helping them to lower their costs and improve the quality of their outcomes. And it's very consistent with our purpose of helping all people live healthy lives. We are confident that these four areas of focus are rich with opportunities for BD to add value and to continue to grow.
Turning to Slide 6. Despite these challenging economic times, the company remains committed to driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening the core, which remains a significant lever for BD's success. In addition, as Vince will discuss in detail later, we will leverage our core by making focused investments in R&D for platform extensions and innovative new products. We're also making significant investments in growing our businesses in emerging markets. And also very importantly, we continue to focus on operational excellence and the programs that we're building across the P&L to maintain and build upon a strong cost position, as well as to return free cash flow to shareholders.
On Slide 7, you will see our guidance for the full year fiscal 2011, which takes into account all of the key points I've discussed in my opening remarks. David will discuss the guidance in more detail, but the net is guidance for 2011 of 4% revenue growth and 10% to 11% adjusted EPS growth or a range of EPS between $5.45 and $5.55. As you will hear from David in a minute, the 4% revenue growth is FX neutral and really represents about 6% growth over 2010 if you normalize for flu, stimulus and supplemental spending events in 2010. 
Our guidance for operating income growth of about 5% includes about five points of headwind due to investments we are making in infrastructure and R&D in 2011. So that allowing for these investments, we're showing good operating margin improvement in 2011. Looking further out, our outlook for 2011, 2012 is for an average revenue growth of 6% and an average EPS growth of 10% to 12% over this three-year period, and this was previously communicated on our Q3 2010 earnings call. 
Now I'm delighted to turn the call over to David."

A portion of the assets related to the extended dwell catheter product platform are still reported within continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met for this asset group.
On Slide 9, I would like to walk through the impact of the divestiture and the second quarter pro forma item on our EPS. At the end of fiscal year 2010, our EPS was $5.11, excluding the $0.38 gain from the sale of our businesses as discussed earlier. The result of operations associated with these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations. This had a $0.21 impact, which brings you to our reported EPS of $4.90. In the second quarter of our fiscal year, we had a noncash charge related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. That charge is worth $0.04. If you add that to our reported EPS, you would arrive at a pro forma EPS of $4.94. Looking forward to fiscal year 2011, we will be growing about 10% to 12% of our pro forma EPS of $4.94. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'd like to briefly highlight some of our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the company's expectations. Revenue came in at almost 3%, currency neutral, which was partially impacted by tough comparisons to the fourth fiscal quarter in 2009, due to pandemic flu sales in both Medical and Diagnostics segments. We are pleased with the results we saw in our emerging markets as well, experiencing double-digit top line growth across most regions. We also delivered on our EPS guidance coming in at $1.24 for the quarter.
On Slide 11, you will see that revenues came in at almost $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS increased to $1.24 or almost 2% currency neutral. Our total year revenues of $7.4 billion reflects solid growth of about 5.5% on a currency-neutral basis and an adjusted EPS growth of about 9% currency neutral.
Now let's move on to Slide 12 where we review our growth by segment. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased about 2% currency neutral. The growth in this segment was mainly driven by our Diabetes Care business with continued strong sales of pen needles. The Medical segment was negatively impacted by about four percentage points due to sales related to the flu pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the total year, the Medical segment grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis.
Revenues in BD Diagnostics segment grew about 3% currency neutral, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic flu-related orders in 2009 by about two percentage points. The Diagnostics segment also experienced softness due to lower lab testing and physician office visits. However, we have seen this trend stabilize in the fourth quarter, particularly in our Preanalytical Systems business. For the total year, the Diagnostics segment grew 4% currency neutral. 
BD Biosciences revenue growth was about 5% currency neutral, driven by strong instrument and reagent sales in our Cell Analysis business. For the total year, the Biosciences segment grew 6.8% currency neutral, benefited by the supplemental and stimulus spending in Japan and the U.S.
Now turning to Slide 13. We'll look at our geographic results. In the fourth quarter, BD's U.S. revenues increased about 1% or about 3% when adjusting for the impact of flu-related sales in 2009. U.S. Medical revenues increased about 2% year-over-year. U.S. sales of Diagnostics products increased about 1%, partially due to reduced OB/GYN visits negatively impacting our TriPath business unit. Biosciences revenue in the U.S. increased about 0.6% due to growth in Cell Analysis business unit being offset by the timing of several large customer orders in our Advanced Bioprocessing business unit.
International revenues grew about 4% on a currency-neutral basis in the fourth quarter. After taking out the impact of flu, about four percentage points, underlying growth was 8.2% in the fourth quarter, which represents an upward trend in sequential quarterly growth rates and is driven by emerging markets in high-growth regions. For the total year, U.S. revenues were about 5%, with Medical increasing about 6% and Diagnostics increasing about 3%, with Biosciences also growing about 6%. International revenues grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Overall, international growth was adversely affected by lingering macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe and a tough comparison from flu-related sales. This was more than offset by the double-digit growth in our emerging markets, which are Asia Pacific, EMA and Latin America. In these areas, we continue to see expansion of healthcare funding and patient access. BD is investing heavily in certain high-growth markets, such as China and India, where we see unmet needs that align well with BD's capabilities. 
Moving now to global safety on Slide 14. Reported sales grew almost 4% in the quarter to $443 million. On a currency-neutral basis, safety growth was about 5%. This was comprised of about 2.5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 9%. For the total year, safety growth was 6% on a currency-neutral basis, which is a combination of about 5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 8% on a currency-neutral basis. In the Medical segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Nexiva and safety diet products, while international safety is being driven by infusion therapy products. In the Diagnostics segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, and the international growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, as well as Eclipse.
Now I'd like to move on to Slide 15, where I'll walk you through the impact of pandemic flu had on our quarterly revenue growth rate on our business in fiscal year 2010. In the first half of the year, pandemic flu provided a benefit to our revenue growth of 2.5%, which is mainly in the U.S. For the second half of the fiscal year, the pandemic flu resulted in an almost 2% negative impact to our revenue growth, due to the international pandemic revenues that we recorded in the second half of fiscal year 2009 that did not repeat in fiscal year 2010. For the full year, the net impact to revenues is about 20 basis point benefit. As we discussed last quarter, we also received additional Biosciences stimulus and supplemental orders in the U.S. and Japan. This benefited fiscal year 2010 by about 50 basis points. 
As we look at fiscal year 2011, the pandemic flu revenues that were recorded in the first half of fiscal year 2010 will represent a difficult comparison, particularly in the first quarter. In the full fiscal year 2011, we are not anticipating either of these events to recur, which is about a 200 basis point impact on our growth, as Ed discussed earlier. 
Now moving on to Slide 16. We'll review our revenue growth in the fourth quarter, where our reported growth rate was 1%. Currency-neutral revenue growth was about 3%, which was negatively impacted by about 2% points of currency translation. There was no hedge impact in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 17. And looking at our gross margin, we experienced about 100 basis points of positive currency impact. Within the performance category of 110 basis points, we had positive operating performance of about 70 basis points, which was more than offset by higher raw material costs, higher pension costs and start-up costs. As a result, net margin was down about 10 basis points.
Slide 18 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. As discussed earlier, fourth quarter revenue was about 3% currency neutral, and gross profit grew about 1% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement line, SSG&A increased about 4% currency neutral due to pension and EVEREST and our SAP implementation costs. 
R&D increased 10% or about 50 basis points as a percent of revenue over the prior period. This acceleration in R&D is in line with our expectations as we're continuing to invest in new products and platforms. Our operating margin decreased 4.5% due to the higher resin, start-up and ReLoCo costs. In addition, increased SSG&A and accelerated R&D costs were contributing factors. I would also like to point out that our earnings also reflect two items that essentially offset each other. The gain on the sale of our extended dwell catheter product platform that remains in continuing operations of about $18 million was mostly offset by $14 million write-off of equity investments. 
Now turning to Slide 19. I'd like to look at the total year revenue, which growth increased about 5.5%. Performance and currency contributed about 5.6% and 2%, respectfully [respectively], which was partially offset by the hedge with about 2% unfavorable impact.
On Slide 20, we can see that our gross margin change year-over-year was a positive 20 basis point improvement. It was comprised of a 100 basis point improvement of underlying performance, which was more than offset by ReLoCo and pension costs. This positive performance was offset by 90 basis points of negative hedge impact.
Slide 21 now recaps the total year income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. Revenue growth was 5.6% currency neutral, and gross profit was 6% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 3% currency neutral, primarily impacted by higher EVEREST and pension costs. Excluding those items, our costs would have been essentially flat. For the total year, R&D increased 6% currency neutral, which is in line with our expectations. Operating income increased almost 9% as a result of strong gross margin and controlled SSG&A expenses. I would also like to point out that the tax rate for the year is higher than prior year, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.
Now before I discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2011, I want to briefly address BD's capital structure. Given our solid investment grade ratings and the historically low interest rates in the market, we believe it's prudent for BD to seek use of this opportunity to improve the efficiency of our capital structure. Our guiding principles as we look at this are: one, to maintain a solid investment grade rating; second, to ensure ongoing access to debt markets for strategic opportunities; and third, to optimize the cost of capital based upon market conditions. As a result, we plan to access the credit markets in the coming weeks. While a definitive amount of debt has yet to be determined, we don't expect it to exceed $1 billion. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, as well as share repurchases. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of common stock in 2011 and an additional $600 million in 2012. The company plans to fund the repurchases through ongoing cash flow and the issuance of debt.
Now I'd like to move on to fiscal year '11 guidance. Moving to Slide 23. I'd like to walk you through that guidance. For the year, we are guiding top line growth of about 4% to $7.7 billion. If you exclude the impact of pandemic sales and stimulus dollars in 2010, the underlying growth is about 6%. We expect our gross profit margins to improve by 30 to 50 basis points as we start to see the benefits of ReLoCo and improved product mix. 
SSG&A is expected to increase about 4% due to increased pension costs, EVEREST, SAP implementation costs and investment in our shared services centers. This is an incremental cost of about $50 million, which will be partially offset by G&A efficiency programs. We plan to increase R&D about 10%, mainly driven by the investments in Diabetes Care and Women's Health and Cancer platforms, which Vince will elaborate on later. 
Operating income is expected to increase about 10 to 30 points. Excluding the effects of pandemic, stimulus and the previously mentioned incremental investments, underlying growth will be about 13%. We expect our tax rate to moderately decrease as a result of the geographic mix of our business and the anticipation of the R&D tax credit being extended in fiscal year '11. We expect our cash flow to remain strong and our operating cash is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in fiscal year '11, as I mentioned earlier. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion in shares. Capital expenditures will remain in line with our 2010 spending at approximately $550 million to $575 million.
For our bottom line, we expect EPS to grow about 10% to 12%, resulting in our EPS guidance of $5.45 to $5.55. At this point, we are not anticipating any year-over-year impact from currency. The $0.08 hedge loss that occurred in fiscal year '10 will be offset by holding losses on our cost of goods sold in fiscal year '11. For fiscal year '11, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to be broadly in line with fiscal year '10.
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to remind you that our first quarter will be significantly impacted by the tough comparison to fiscal year 2010 as related to the pandemic flu. Therefore, our revenues and earnings in the first quarter will essentially be flat. 
Before I turn the call over to Vince, I would just like to highlight our solid finish to the year in a difficult environment. Our performance this year has given us continued confidence that our strategy is sound and our efficiency programs are delivering. We are continuing to drive top and bottom line growth by investing in key R&D projects and by investing in new programs to drive operational efficiencies. We're also seeking to maximize our capital structure, and in doing so, release more cash to our shareholders. 
Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Vince."
103678,114504025,85636,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the",1867,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the short run. However, we are very confident in -- what we are very confident in is the universal human drive to improve our standard of living and to live longer, healthier lives. That desire is pervasive globally and will ultimately drive greater demand for healthcare products and services over the long run. And that's how BD thinks about the business, successfully meeting these needs in existing and innovative ways over the long run.
In the short run, there are opportunities to help customers improve the quality and cost of healthcare in the developed world, while we also help developing countries improve their healthcare systems. BD has strong growth drivers in place to capitalize on these needs, and as you've heard, we are increasing our investments in R&D despite these challenging times. BD is also investing heavily in emerging markets to ensure we are serving the fastest-growing opportunities with the right products for those markets profitably. And lastly, BD is consistently investing in ongoing operational excellence programs across the P&L to continually improve our competitiveness.
Turning to Slide 26. I would like to briefly review the fiscal year 2011 guidance by segment. Again, it's important to note, as David highlighted, this guidance is relative to tough comparisons, particularly in Q1 due to the factors he enumerated earlier. For the year, we're looking at an average of about 4% for the business overall. By segment, this equates to about 4% for Medical and Biosciences, with Diagnostics slightly faster at 5% FX neutral. Excluding the effects of 2010 flu pandemic, stimulus and supplemental spending, that equates to approximately 6% for total BD as David mentioned earlier.
Now I'd like to turn to the growth drivers we expect to drive success for BD over both the short and long terms. Turning to Slide 27. There are a number of things we are excited about with respect to BD's Medical business going forward. For example, many of you have heard us to discuss our reliable low cost, or ReLoCo, program in the past. In short, ReLoCo is a global, cross-functional business initiative established to sustain a low-cost capability and advantage for Medical Surgical Systems. We began implementation in 2009 and we'll continue through 2013. ReLoCo targets a number of areas, including our manufacturing architecture, process technology, work systems, product design, materials and packaging. We expect the program to break even in 2011 and to reach steady state savings of approximately $50 million to $60 million annually in 2013.
Our ReLoCo program also enables a second major benefit for BD, which is accelerating growth in cost-sensitive markets where the company is underpenetrated. Today, the current focus of the program is in Hypodermic. We refer to this initiative as our ReKindle program. The ReKindle strategy is supported by three strategic pillars. First, achieving a cost-competitive position for the Hypodermic portfolio to enable the necessary pricing flexibility to compete and drive markets to affordable, higher-value products; second, offering a complete portfolio of Hypodermic products to meet the unique needs of all key target segments globally; and third, bringing a highly effective local execution approach to each segment we're targeting, aligned with the circumstances and the needs of those segments. At this time, we're not going to disclose the precise products or segments targeted for ReLoCo and ReKindle for obvious competitive reasons, but there will be more to follow on future calls as we continue to make progress.
Looking at Slide 28. There are also other examples of growth drivers in the Medical segment. In our IV Catheter offering, we recently launched the first Healthcare Worker Safety product in China called Intima II safety and earlier, the Intima II. Intima II and Intima II safety were both specifically designed to meet the local clinical practices for the Chinese market. This is a good example of combining BD's capabilities with strong knowledge of local product needs to grow in emerging markets like China.
In fiscal year 2010, the Pharmaceutical Systems business expanded our offering of self-administration products with Physioject, our new AutoInjector. We have obtained several customers and are building a nice pipeline.
In Diabetes Care, we are extending our leadership with pen needles, as well as innovating with new safety pen needles in 2011. We are also partnering with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and will be leveraging our expertise as a leader in insulin delivery and acute care infusion to launch new products that will improve the patient experience and therapy outcomes for insulin pump users.
Turning to Slide 29. I'd like to walk through some of the future growth drivers in the Diagnostics segment. In this space, we are strengthening our leadership in microbiology, while investing in innovation to expand our position in molecular and cancer diagnostics. Many of you have expressed interest in BD MAX, our new and upcoming automated HAI Molecular Diagnostics system. We're pleased with the progress of the new six-color BD MAX. It's performing very well in our labs, and we're on track to launch that as an open system in Q3 of calendar '11. The more significant BD MAX MRSA assay launch is on track for the beginning of calendar 2012 in the EU and mid-2012 in the U.S. Beyond BD MAX, we are continuing to invest in the BD Viper XTR with fully automated specimen processing and the smaller Viper LT system, which was exhibited for the first time this year at ASM, and this is to replace ProbeTec. In addition to investing in those two platforms, we are also continuing to develop our HPV test. In our Women's Health and Cancer business, we expect to launch our BD SurePath Plus Molecular Pap test in calendar 2013, which is in clinical trial right now. 
Turning to Slide 30. In our Biosciences segment, we have strong reagent and instrument opportunities. In this space, we continue to be the leader in providing researchers and clinicians with the tools they need to better and more fully understand the cell and to be seen as the partner of choice in providing the answer to cells-based scientific challenges. As examples, we are developing two next-generation analyzers. One for the research Cell Analysis segment and one for CD4 testing for the developing world. This year, we will also be launching a next-generation lower-cost desk top sorter to make this product line more accessible to researchers globally. 
Additionally, we recently announced the opening of our animal-free, antibiotic-free facility in Miami for cell culture media and peptones, which opens up significant opportunity in this sizable market. We will launch a new animal-free media supplement for bioproduction and a new serum-free media for certain stem cells this year.
Turning to Slide 31. BD maintains a tremendous focus on emerging markets and geographic expansion. This is where a significant amount of our investment dollars have been going and will continue to go in the future. We've seen some of the benefits in 2010 as BD's International business grew approximately 6% FX neutral, and the emerging markets within that grew at approximately 13%, FX neutral. In these markets, we have some areas of specific product focus such as HIV monitoring, TB Diagnostics and Diabetes Care and some areas of operational excellence focus, such as ReLoCo, to name a few. But more broadly, the opportunity for BD is to align BD's traditional capabilities around the key health needs in these markets.
To do this, we're investing heavily in sales people, sales training and importantly, the customer education needed to manage the growth in these developing nations. We're taking a tiered approach to intra-region geographic expansion and account management, so we're maximizing feet on the street. We're engaging with public officials, opinion leaders and healthcare associations to assist with building better healthcare policy, guidelines and best practices and becoming a preferred partner in the regions.
Over time, we will complement our growing sales and marketing presence with increased local manufacturing and R&D. As we continue to analyze these markets and develop penetration plans one by one in order to tailor strategies to best compete based on each market's unique situation. Based on these continued investments in emerging markets, we believe we can deliver double-digit emerging market growth, again, in 2011 and continued strong growth in the future.
Turning to Slide 32. As I outlined in my initial comments, BD is continuously driving operational excellence into everything we do. At any given time, we have a number of cost improvement programs we are engaged in. Today, I'd like to just highlight a few of the key programs we're working on and the progress we're making. One key program is ReLoCo, which I discussed earlier in my remarks. Another key operational excellence program is EVEREST, which is our SAP program, a global enterprise resource planning initiative designed to optimize processes and refresh technology to drive operating effectiveness and improve service to our customers. We're pleased with the progress of this program and have completed the design phase. We are now in the implementation phase. Although we are still three years out from completing worldwide implementation of the full program, this full program will allow us to shut off several legacy systems and should enable us to reap significant savings over the long term.
We will also remain focused on SSG&A. For example, we are creating four shared service centers to consolidate things, such as back-office HR, finance and customer service. This will enable us to reduce the number of non-customer facing roles, so that we may invest more heavily in sales people in areas like China, Latin America and other emerging markets. We recently announced a shared service center in San Antonio, consolidating work for North America, and we will consolidate Asia-Pacific transactions in a shared service center in Singapore.
On Slide 33. Before we open the call to questions, I would just like to reiterate the key messages I'd like for you to take away from our discussion today. First, going forward, our strategy remains sound, to apply technology to address unmet and underappreciated, but important, needs within the healthcare and life sciences. Second, despite the challenging economic times we're facing, the company remains focused on driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening our core franchise and leveraging that core through a number of important initiatives. These initiatives include making focused R&D investments, to deliver key platform extensions and innovative new products and in emerging markets, to take the strength of the global BD business model to these rapidly growing segments where the local needs are tremendous and unique.
And third, consistent with another core strength of BD, we continue to focus on operational excellence programs across the P&L to maintain our strong cost position. As a result, we remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

It's an opportune time from this perspective, given as Vince said we're at historically low rates to maximize our capital structure without jeopardizing our ability to borrow into the future for strategic opportunities. As far as the buyback is concerned, a very important component of the value to shareholders is returning cash to our shareholders. And we believe all cash is fungible. We already have $1 billion sitting on our balance sheet. We're really borrowing -- the money that we are borrowing is to make us more efficient from a capital structure perspective. And we think the $1.5 billion and the $600 million that we talked about in fiscal year '12 is a reasonable level.

So first at the R&D, there's both more of a short-term and long-term component to it. And what's happening right now is some of the significant programs are moving into the more final phases in clinical trials. So the biggest increase in R&D in the company is in the Diagnostic segment. And the biggest increase within that is in Women's Health and Cancer, and that is for SurePath Plus, and that has -- we've talked about that a number of times that we were anticipating going into the clinical trial. We have redone that product, and we have now got an automated solution that we're very excited about. So that's moving into clinicals, and that clinical is going to take a year or so. So your first benchmark on the Diagnostics spending is going to be completion of that clinical trial. The second big benchmark on Diagnostics, of course, is going to be the six-color BD MAX and over this planned period, we are, as we said, it's working well in the labs and then we'll be moving into clinical trials on that product first for MRSA, right? And of course, that ramps up our spending as we move into these clinical trials. So those are the first two biggest ones. HPV itself isn't ramping that much this year, but it'll ramp later. So when you hear us start to talk about HPV going into clinical trial, that'll be another benchmark. So those are kind of the big benchmarks on Diagnostics. Now coming back to BD Medical, some of the things that I would point to. Number one, would be the Diabetes business. And in the Diabetes Care business, in the short run, it's the launch of the new safety pen needle. But the more significant one will be the new set of infusion products for pumps, for insulin pumps. And that work is a new program for us, so that is also driving some of the increase in R&D. Also, we're investing in self-injection in Pharmaceutical Systems. I did mention the first product there, Physioject. And so I think we'll be monitoring the ramp up of that product and then we'll talk to you as things progress, other products in that area. Coming back to Biosciences, Biosciences, it is this new sorter and these other two analyzers, a small research analyzer and a small clinical analyzer, CD4 analyzer, for the emerging markets. So those are kind of the core areas. Now lastly, and I think we could all measure quite specifically on those. We are also increasing our investment in longer-term technologies. And when those come out of feasibility, then and we enter into product development, then we'll start talking about them more. So if you'll hear that, that will be the last indicator we'd look for."

What you are seeing is on a performance basis, the performance basis, we're expecting our gross margin increase 40 to 60 basis points, which is excellent product underlying operating performance and our margins being offset, as I talked about earlier, higher resins and higher pension costs. And within that operating performance, we're also expecting to see some benefits in our ReLoCo program. So overall, I think the operations group, as well as the Medical organization is doing a fantastic job in driving margin improvements in those areas.

What we do as we saw this year as we have the opportunities to invest in these new products and new platforms, we have the financial means to invest in those, and I think Vince went through that there's numerous opportunities. It's not just one program that's driving it. We just see a breadth of opportunities from an R&D perspective to invest in right now. So we're going to be doing the right thing.

During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our press release and in the MD&A sections of our SEC filings. We will discuss some non-GAAP financial information relative to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our press release and accompanying financial tables and in our slide presentation.

At this time, I would also like to introduce Tom Polen, the new President of BD Diagnostics Systems, effective October 1. Tom's responsibilities will include Molecular Diagnostics, TriPath, Point of Care, Microbiology Systems and GeneOhm. Tom began his BD career in 1997 and held a number of sales and marketing leadership roles with increasing responsibilities in both BD Biosciences and BD Diagnostics. In 2005, Tom left BD to join Baxter Healthcare, where he held a number of senior leadership positions, most recently as General Manager for Baxter Global Injectables. 
Last year, Tom rejoined BD as the President of Preanalytical Systems. We are delighted to have Tom joining our team and believe that his diverse experience across the diagnostic and medical device and pharmaceutical industries make him ideal to lead BD Diagnostics Systems through its next phase of growth. Philippe Jacon, who formerly led BD Diagnostics Systems, has a new role reporting directly to Vince.

Then I'll spend some time highlighting the company's strategy and key focus areas for 2011 and beyond. Next, David will provide a drill down financial view of our company overall and segment performance, as well as key components of our 2011 guidance, including our capital structure and some of the key risks and opportunities over the near term. Lastly, Vince will spend the balance of our time discussing in greater detail how we will execute our strategies and the key things to think about relative to BD's strategy going forward. After that, we'll open the floor for questions.
Starting with Slide 4. BD's performance in both the Q4 and full year 2010 was solid. We delivered against our own internal targets and against our commitments to our shareholders. This is the 10th consecutive year BD has achieved its annual objectives. It is also the 38th consecutive year of increasing our dividends. In addition, in 2010, we maintained consistent operational excellence across the P&L. We invested in capital expenditures, invested in emerging market infrastructure, increased our investment in R&D and delivered steady predictable cash flow and return to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.
Moving on to Slide 5. Going forward, our strategy remains sound. BD's strategy is to apply technology to address unmet and sometimes underappreciated, but important, needs within healthcare and life sciences. Our four areas of focus are as follows: number one, enabling safer, simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery, and this translates to safer drug delivery for patients and for healthcare workers; number two, improving clinical outcomes through new, accurate faster diagnostics; number three, providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitate basic science, drug discovery and cell therapy; and number four, enhancing disease management in Diabetes, Women's Health and Cancer and Infection Control. If you sum these four areas up, essentially BD is all about helping life science research and healthcare work better. We do this by helping them to lower their costs and improve the quality of their outcomes. And it's very consistent with our purpose of helping all people live healthy lives. We are confident that these four areas of focus are rich with opportunities for BD to add value and to continue to grow.
Turning to Slide 6. Despite these challenging economic times, the company remains committed to driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening the core, which remains a significant lever for BD's success. In addition, as Vince will discuss in detail later, we will leverage our core by making focused investments in R&D for platform extensions and innovative new products. We're also making significant investments in growing our businesses in emerging markets. And also very importantly, we continue to focus on operational excellence and the programs that we're building across the P&L to maintain and build upon a strong cost position, as well as to return free cash flow to shareholders.
On Slide 7, you will see our guidance for the full year fiscal 2011, which takes into account all of the key points I've discussed in my opening remarks. David will discuss the guidance in more detail, but the net is guidance for 2011 of 4% revenue growth and 10% to 11% adjusted EPS growth or a range of EPS between $5.45 and $5.55. As you will hear from David in a minute, the 4% revenue growth is FX neutral and really represents about 6% growth over 2010 if you normalize for flu, stimulus and supplemental spending events in 2010. 
Our guidance for operating income growth of about 5% includes about five points of headwind due to investments we are making in infrastructure and R&D in 2011. So that allowing for these investments, we're showing good operating margin improvement in 2011. Looking further out, our outlook for 2011, 2012 is for an average revenue growth of 6% and an average EPS growth of 10% to 12% over this three-year period, and this was previously communicated on our Q3 2010 earnings call. 
Now I'm delighted to turn the call over to David."
103678,114504025,85638,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the company's results, I'd like to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we completed the sale of the Ophthalmic Business, as well as surgical blades product platform, o",2368,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the company's results, I'd like to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we completed the sale of the Ophthalmic Business, as well as surgical blades product platform, our critical care platform and the extended dwell catheter product platforms. The results of operations associated with Ophthalmic Systems, surgical blade platform and the critical care platforms have been classified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this presentation. A portion of the assets related to the extended dwell catheter product platform are still reported within continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met for this asset group.
On Slide 9, I would like to walk through the impact of the divestiture and the second quarter pro forma item on our EPS. At the end of fiscal year 2010, our EPS was $5.11, excluding the $0.38 gain from the sale of our businesses as discussed earlier. The result of operations associated with these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations. This had a $0.21 impact, which brings you to our reported EPS of $4.90. In the second quarter of our fiscal year, we had a noncash charge related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. That charge is worth $0.04. If you add that to our reported EPS, you would arrive at a pro forma EPS of $4.94. Looking forward to fiscal year 2011, we will be growing about 10% to 12% of our pro forma EPS of $4.94. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'd like to briefly highlight some of our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the company's expectations. Revenue came in at almost 3%, currency neutral, which was partially impacted by tough comparisons to the fourth fiscal quarter in 2009, due to pandemic flu sales in both Medical and Diagnostics segments. We are pleased with the results we saw in our emerging markets as well, experiencing double-digit top line growth across most regions. We also delivered on our EPS guidance coming in at $1.24 for the quarter.
On Slide 11, you will see that revenues came in at almost $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS increased to $1.24 or almost 2% currency neutral. Our total year revenues of $7.4 billion reflects solid growth of about 5.5% on a currency-neutral basis and an adjusted EPS growth of about 9% currency neutral.
Now let's move on to Slide 12 where we review our growth by segment. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased about 2% currency neutral. The growth in this segment was mainly driven by our Diabetes Care business with continued strong sales of pen needles. The Medical segment was negatively impacted by about four percentage points due to sales related to the flu pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the total year, the Medical segment grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis.
Revenues in BD Diagnostics segment grew about 3% currency neutral, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic flu-related orders in 2009 by about two percentage points. The Diagnostics segment also experienced softness due to lower lab testing and physician office visits. However, we have seen this trend stabilize in the fourth quarter, particularly in our Preanalytical Systems business. For the total year, the Diagnostics segment grew 4% currency neutral. 
BD Biosciences revenue growth was about 5% currency neutral, driven by strong instrument and reagent sales in our Cell Analysis business. For the total year, the Biosciences segment grew 6.8% currency neutral, benefited by the supplemental and stimulus spending in Japan and the U.S.
Now turning to Slide 13. We'll look at our geographic results. In the fourth quarter, BD's U.S. revenues increased about 1% or about 3% when adjusting for the impact of flu-related sales in 2009. U.S. Medical revenues increased about 2% year-over-year. U.S. sales of Diagnostics products increased about 1%, partially due to reduced OB/GYN visits negatively impacting our TriPath business unit. Biosciences revenue in the U.S. increased about 0.6% due to growth in Cell Analysis business unit being offset by the timing of several large customer orders in our Advanced Bioprocessing business unit.
International revenues grew about 4% on a currency-neutral basis in the fourth quarter. After taking out the impact of flu, about four percentage points, underlying growth was 8.2% in the fourth quarter, which represents an upward trend in sequential quarterly growth rates and is driven by emerging markets in high-growth regions. For the total year, U.S. revenues were about 5%, with Medical increasing about 6% and Diagnostics increasing about 3%, with Biosciences also growing about 6%. International revenues grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Overall, international growth was adversely affected by lingering macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe and a tough comparison from flu-related sales. This was more than offset by the double-digit growth in our emerging markets, which are Asia Pacific, EMA and Latin America. In these areas, we continue to see expansion of healthcare funding and patient access. BD is investing heavily in certain high-growth markets, such as China and India, where we see unmet needs that align well with BD's capabilities. 
Moving now to global safety on Slide 14. Reported sales grew almost 4% in the quarter to $443 million. On a currency-neutral basis, safety growth was about 5%. This was comprised of about 2.5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 9%. For the total year, safety growth was 6% on a currency-neutral basis, which is a combination of about 5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 8% on a currency-neutral basis. In the Medical segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Nexiva and safety diet products, while international safety is being driven by infusion therapy products. In the Diagnostics segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, and the international growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, as well as Eclipse.
Now I'd like to move on to Slide 15, where I'll walk you through the impact of pandemic flu had on our quarterly revenue growth rate on our business in fiscal year 2010. In the first half of the year, pandemic flu provided a benefit to our revenue growth of 2.5%, which is mainly in the U.S. For the second half of the fiscal year, the pandemic flu resulted in an almost 2% negative impact to our revenue growth, due to the international pandemic revenues that we recorded in the second half of fiscal year 2009 that did not repeat in fiscal year 2010. For the full year, the net impact to revenues is about 20 basis point benefit. As we discussed last quarter, we also received additional Biosciences stimulus and supplemental orders in the U.S. and Japan. This benefited fiscal year 2010 by about 50 basis points. 
As we look at fiscal year 2011, the pandemic flu revenues that were recorded in the first half of fiscal year 2010 will represent a difficult comparison, particularly in the first quarter. In the full fiscal year 2011, we are not anticipating either of these events to recur, which is about a 200 basis point impact on our growth, as Ed discussed earlier. 
Now moving on to Slide 16. We'll review our revenue growth in the fourth quarter, where our reported growth rate was 1%. Currency-neutral revenue growth was about 3%, which was negatively impacted by about 2% points of currency translation. There was no hedge impact in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 17. And looking at our gross margin, we experienced about 100 basis points of positive currency impact. Within the performance category of 110 basis points, we had positive operating performance of about 70 basis points, which was more than offset by higher raw material costs, higher pension costs and start-up costs. As a result, net margin was down about 10 basis points.
Slide 18 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. As discussed earlier, fourth quarter revenue was about 3% currency neutral, and gross profit grew about 1% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement line, SSG&A increased about 4% currency neutral due to pension and EVEREST and our SAP implementation costs. 
R&D increased 10% or about 50 basis points as a percent of revenue over the prior period. This acceleration in R&D is in line with our expectations as we're continuing to invest in new products and platforms. Our operating margin decreased 4.5% due to the higher resin, start-up and ReLoCo costs. In addition, increased SSG&A and accelerated R&D costs were contributing factors. I would also like to point out that our earnings also reflect two items that essentially offset each other. The gain on the sale of our extended dwell catheter product platform that remains in continuing operations of about $18 million was mostly offset by $14 million write-off of equity investments. 
Now turning to Slide 19. I'd like to look at the total year revenue, which growth increased about 5.5%. Performance and currency contributed about 5.6% and 2%, respectfully [respectively], which was partially offset by the hedge with about 2% unfavorable impact.
On Slide 20, we can see that our gross margin change year-over-year was a positive 20 basis point improvement. It was comprised of a 100 basis point improvement of underlying performance, which was more than offset by ReLoCo and pension costs. This positive performance was offset by 90 basis points of negative hedge impact.
Slide 21 now recaps the total year income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. Revenue growth was 5.6% currency neutral, and gross profit was 6% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 3% currency neutral, primarily impacted by higher EVEREST and pension costs. Excluding those items, our costs would have been essentially flat. For the total year, R&D increased 6% currency neutral, which is in line with our expectations. Operating income increased almost 9% as a result of strong gross margin and controlled SSG&A expenses. I would also like to point out that the tax rate for the year is higher than prior year, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.
Now before I discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2011, I want to briefly address BD's capital structure. Given our solid investment grade ratings and the historically low interest rates in the market, we believe it's prudent for BD to seek use of this opportunity to improve the efficiency of our capital structure. Our guiding principles as we look at this are: one, to maintain a solid investment grade rating; second, to ensure ongoing access to debt markets for strategic opportunities; and third, to optimize the cost of capital based upon market conditions. As a result, we plan to access the credit markets in the coming weeks. While a definitive amount of debt has yet to be determined, we don't expect it to exceed $1 billion. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, as well as share repurchases. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of common stock in 2011 and an additional $600 million in 2012. The company plans to fund the repurchases through ongoing cash flow and the issuance of debt.
Now I'd like to move on to fiscal year '11 guidance. Moving to Slide 23. I'd like to walk you through that guidance. For the year, we are guiding top line growth of about 4% to $7.7 billion. If you exclude the impact of pandemic sales and stimulus dollars in 2010, the underlying growth is about 6%. We expect our gross profit margins to improve by 30 to 50 basis points as we start to see the benefits of ReLoCo and improved product mix. 
SSG&A is expected to increase about 4% due to increased pension costs, EVEREST, SAP implementation costs and investment in our shared services centers. This is an incremental cost of about $50 million, which will be partially offset by G&A efficiency programs. We plan to increase R&D about 10%, mainly driven by the investments in Diabetes Care and Women's Health and Cancer platforms, which Vince will elaborate on later. 
Operating income is expected to increase about 10 to 30 points. Excluding the effects of pandemic, stimulus and the previously mentioned incremental investments, underlying growth will be about 13%. We expect our tax rate to moderately decrease as a result of the geographic mix of our business and the anticipation of the R&D tax credit being extended in fiscal year '11. We expect our cash flow to remain strong and our operating cash is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in fiscal year '11, as I mentioned earlier. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion in shares. Capital expenditures will remain in line with our 2010 spending at approximately $550 million to $575 million.
For our bottom line, we expect EPS to grow about 10% to 12%, resulting in our EPS guidance of $5.45 to $5.55. At this point, we are not anticipating any year-over-year impact from currency. The $0.08 hedge loss that occurred in fiscal year '10 will be offset by holding losses on our cost of goods sold in fiscal year '11. For fiscal year '11, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to be broadly in line with fiscal year '10.
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to remind you that our first quarter will be significantly impacted by the tough comparison to fiscal year 2010 as related to the pandemic flu. Therefore, our revenues and earnings in the first quarter will essentially be flat. 
Before I turn the call over to Vince, I would just like to highlight our solid finish to the year in a difficult environment. Our performance this year has given us continued confidence that our strategy is sound and our efficiency programs are delivering. We are continuing to drive top and bottom line growth by investing in key R&D projects and by investing in new programs to drive operational efficiencies. We're also seeking to maximize our capital structure, and in doing so, release more cash to our shareholders. 
Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Vince."
103678,114504025,85638,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the",1867,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the short run. However, we are very confident in -- what we are very confident in is the universal human drive to improve our standard of living and to live longer, healthier lives. That desire is pervasive globally and will ultimately drive greater demand for healthcare products and services over the long run. And that's how BD thinks about the business, successfully meeting these needs in existing and innovative ways over the long run.
In the short run, there are opportunities to help customers improve the quality and cost of healthcare in the developed world, while we also help developing countries improve their healthcare systems. BD has strong growth drivers in place to capitalize on these needs, and as you've heard, we are increasing our investments in R&D despite these challenging times. BD is also investing heavily in emerging markets to ensure we are serving the fastest-growing opportunities with the right products for those markets profitably. And lastly, BD is consistently investing in ongoing operational excellence programs across the P&L to continually improve our competitiveness.
Turning to Slide 26. I would like to briefly review the fiscal year 2011 guidance by segment. Again, it's important to note, as David highlighted, this guidance is relative to tough comparisons, particularly in Q1 due to the factors he enumerated earlier. For the year, we're looking at an average of about 4% for the business overall. By segment, this equates to about 4% for Medical and Biosciences, with Diagnostics slightly faster at 5% FX neutral. Excluding the effects of 2010 flu pandemic, stimulus and supplemental spending, that equates to approximately 6% for total BD as David mentioned earlier.
Now I'd like to turn to the growth drivers we expect to drive success for BD over both the short and long terms. Turning to Slide 27. There are a number of things we are excited about with respect to BD's Medical business going forward. For example, many of you have heard us to discuss our reliable low cost, or ReLoCo, program in the past. In short, ReLoCo is a global, cross-functional business initiative established to sustain a low-cost capability and advantage for Medical Surgical Systems. We began implementation in 2009 and we'll continue through 2013. ReLoCo targets a number of areas, including our manufacturing architecture, process technology, work systems, product design, materials and packaging. We expect the program to break even in 2011 and to reach steady state savings of approximately $50 million to $60 million annually in 2013.
Our ReLoCo program also enables a second major benefit for BD, which is accelerating growth in cost-sensitive markets where the company is underpenetrated. Today, the current focus of the program is in Hypodermic. We refer to this initiative as our ReKindle program. The ReKindle strategy is supported by three strategic pillars. First, achieving a cost-competitive position for the Hypodermic portfolio to enable the necessary pricing flexibility to compete and drive markets to affordable, higher-value products; second, offering a complete portfolio of Hypodermic products to meet the unique needs of all key target segments globally; and third, bringing a highly effective local execution approach to each segment we're targeting, aligned with the circumstances and the needs of those segments. At this time, we're not going to disclose the precise products or segments targeted for ReLoCo and ReKindle for obvious competitive reasons, but there will be more to follow on future calls as we continue to make progress.
Looking at Slide 28. There are also other examples of growth drivers in the Medical segment. In our IV Catheter offering, we recently launched the first Healthcare Worker Safety product in China called Intima II safety and earlier, the Intima II. Intima II and Intima II safety were both specifically designed to meet the local clinical practices for the Chinese market. This is a good example of combining BD's capabilities with strong knowledge of local product needs to grow in emerging markets like China.
In fiscal year 2010, the Pharmaceutical Systems business expanded our offering of self-administration products with Physioject, our new AutoInjector. We have obtained several customers and are building a nice pipeline.
In Diabetes Care, we are extending our leadership with pen needles, as well as innovating with new safety pen needles in 2011. We are also partnering with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and will be leveraging our expertise as a leader in insulin delivery and acute care infusion to launch new products that will improve the patient experience and therapy outcomes for insulin pump users.
Turning to Slide 29. I'd like to walk through some of the future growth drivers in the Diagnostics segment. In this space, we are strengthening our leadership in microbiology, while investing in innovation to expand our position in molecular and cancer diagnostics. Many of you have expressed interest in BD MAX, our new and upcoming automated HAI Molecular Diagnostics system. We're pleased with the progress of the new six-color BD MAX. It's performing very well in our labs, and we're on track to launch that as an open system in Q3 of calendar '11. The more significant BD MAX MRSA assay launch is on track for the beginning of calendar 2012 in the EU and mid-2012 in the U.S. Beyond BD MAX, we are continuing to invest in the BD Viper XTR with fully automated specimen processing and the smaller Viper LT system, which was exhibited for the first time this year at ASM, and this is to replace ProbeTec. In addition to investing in those two platforms, we are also continuing to develop our HPV test. In our Women's Health and Cancer business, we expect to launch our BD SurePath Plus Molecular Pap test in calendar 2013, which is in clinical trial right now. 
Turning to Slide 30. In our Biosciences segment, we have strong reagent and instrument opportunities. In this space, we continue to be the leader in providing researchers and clinicians with the tools they need to better and more fully understand the cell and to be seen as the partner of choice in providing the answer to cells-based scientific challenges. As examples, we are developing two next-generation analyzers. One for the research Cell Analysis segment and one for CD4 testing for the developing world. This year, we will also be launching a next-generation lower-cost desk top sorter to make this product line more accessible to researchers globally. 
Additionally, we recently announced the opening of our animal-free, antibiotic-free facility in Miami for cell culture media and peptones, which opens up significant opportunity in this sizable market. We will launch a new animal-free media supplement for bioproduction and a new serum-free media for certain stem cells this year.
Turning to Slide 31. BD maintains a tremendous focus on emerging markets and geographic expansion. This is where a significant amount of our investment dollars have been going and will continue to go in the future. We've seen some of the benefits in 2010 as BD's International business grew approximately 6% FX neutral, and the emerging markets within that grew at approximately 13%, FX neutral. In these markets, we have some areas of specific product focus such as HIV monitoring, TB Diagnostics and Diabetes Care and some areas of operational excellence focus, such as ReLoCo, to name a few. But more broadly, the opportunity for BD is to align BD's traditional capabilities around the key health needs in these markets.
To do this, we're investing heavily in sales people, sales training and importantly, the customer education needed to manage the growth in these developing nations. We're taking a tiered approach to intra-region geographic expansion and account management, so we're maximizing feet on the street. We're engaging with public officials, opinion leaders and healthcare associations to assist with building better healthcare policy, guidelines and best practices and becoming a preferred partner in the regions.
Over time, we will complement our growing sales and marketing presence with increased local manufacturing and R&D. As we continue to analyze these markets and develop penetration plans one by one in order to tailor strategies to best compete based on each market's unique situation. Based on these continued investments in emerging markets, we believe we can deliver double-digit emerging market growth, again, in 2011 and continued strong growth in the future.
Turning to Slide 32. As I outlined in my initial comments, BD is continuously driving operational excellence into everything we do. At any given time, we have a number of cost improvement programs we are engaged in. Today, I'd like to just highlight a few of the key programs we're working on and the progress we're making. One key program is ReLoCo, which I discussed earlier in my remarks. Another key operational excellence program is EVEREST, which is our SAP program, a global enterprise resource planning initiative designed to optimize processes and refresh technology to drive operating effectiveness and improve service to our customers. We're pleased with the progress of this program and have completed the design phase. We are now in the implementation phase. Although we are still three years out from completing worldwide implementation of the full program, this full program will allow us to shut off several legacy systems and should enable us to reap significant savings over the long term.
We will also remain focused on SSG&A. For example, we are creating four shared service centers to consolidate things, such as back-office HR, finance and customer service. This will enable us to reduce the number of non-customer facing roles, so that we may invest more heavily in sales people in areas like China, Latin America and other emerging markets. We recently announced a shared service center in San Antonio, consolidating work for North America, and we will consolidate Asia-Pacific transactions in a shared service center in Singapore.
On Slide 33. Before we open the call to questions, I would just like to reiterate the key messages I'd like for you to take away from our discussion today. First, going forward, our strategy remains sound, to apply technology to address unmet and underappreciated, but important, needs within the healthcare and life sciences. Second, despite the challenging economic times we're facing, the company remains focused on driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening our core franchise and leveraging that core through a number of important initiatives. These initiatives include making focused R&D investments, to deliver key platform extensions and innovative new products and in emerging markets, to take the strength of the global BD business model to these rapidly growing segments where the local needs are tremendous and unique.
And third, consistent with another core strength of BD, we continue to focus on operational excellence programs across the P&L to maintain our strong cost position. As a result, we remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

So first at the R&D, there's both more of a short-term and long-term component to it. And what's happening right now is some of the significant programs are moving into the more final phases in clinical trials. So the biggest increase in R&D in the company is in the Diagnostic segment. And the biggest increase within that is in Women's Health and Cancer, and that is for SurePath Plus, and that has -- we've talked about that a number of times that we were anticipating going into the clinical trial. We have redone that product, and we have now got an automated solution that we're very excited about. So that's moving into clinicals, and that clinical is going to take a year or so. So your first benchmark on the Diagnostics spending is going to be completion of that clinical trial. The second big benchmark on Diagnostics, of course, is going to be the six-color BD MAX and over this planned period, we are, as we said, it's working well in the labs and then we'll be moving into clinical trials on that product first for MRSA, right? And of course, that ramps up our spending as we move into these clinical trials. So those are the first two biggest ones. HPV itself isn't ramping that much this year, but it'll ramp later. So when you hear us start to talk about HPV going into clinical trial, that'll be another benchmark. So those are kind of the big benchmarks on Diagnostics. Now coming back to BD Medical, some of the things that I would point to. Number one, would be the Diabetes business. And in the Diabetes Care business, in the short run, it's the launch of the new safety pen needle. But the more significant one will be the new set of infusion products for pumps, for insulin pumps. And that work is a new program for us, so that is also driving some of the increase in R&D. Also, we're investing in self-injection in Pharmaceutical Systems. I did mention the first product there, Physioject. And so I think we'll be monitoring the ramp up of that product and then we'll talk to you as things progress, other products in that area. Coming back to Biosciences, Biosciences, it is this new sorter and these other two analyzers, a small research analyzer and a small clinical analyzer, CD4 analyzer, for the emerging markets. So those are kind of the core areas. Now lastly, and I think we could all measure quite specifically on those. We are also increasing our investment in longer-term technologies. And when those come out of feasibility, then and we enter into product development, then we'll start talking about them more. So if you'll hear that, that will be the last indicator we'd look for."

We're seeing the early stages of awareness building around the new EU directive, which as you know was cast in the spring and some additional interest being expressed in safety engineered devices, but it's still early stage. In general, Europe in 2010 grew a little under 10%, in the 8% range, in safety. We're expecting that to uptick going into 2011 and overall safety growth for the company to uptick in 2011, driven by international growth. We're also seeing, and I know you didn't ask specifically about other parts of the world, but we're seeing substantial growth in safety in other regions, including Latin America and Asia Pacific in particular. As I say, in general, in Europe as we've said in previous calls, it's still early. We're expecting most countries will take most of their actions to come into the clients with the new directive near the compliant state, which was three years after enactment. So we still have about two and a half years before we think we'll see the peak of the activity."

What you are seeing is on a performance basis, the performance basis, we're expecting our gross margin increase 40 to 60 basis points, which is excellent product underlying operating performance and our margins being offset, as I talked about earlier, higher resins and higher pension costs. And within that operating performance, we're also expecting to see some benefits in our ReLoCo program. So overall, I think the operations group, as well as the Medical organization is doing a fantastic job in driving margin improvements in those areas.

And then next year, what we're saying we're assuming we get the R&D tax credit and a different mix of business, and that's why we're guiding the tax rate for the full year to be in that 27% to 27.5%, which is similar to what we saw in fiscal year '09.

But we really don't think about our research and development investment level as a percent of revenue. What we do as we saw this year as we have the opportunities to invest in these new products and new platforms, we have the financial means to invest in those, and I think Vince went through that there's numerous opportunities. It's not just one program that's driving it. We just see a breadth of opportunities from an R&D perspective to invest in right now. So we're going to be doing the right thing.

Today, I'll begin with a brief overview of BD's performance for Q4 and the full year 2010 and provide some context around BD's consistency in delivering against our commitments to shareholders over time. Then I'll spend some time highlighting the company's strategy and key focus areas for 2011 and beyond. Next, David will provide a drill down financial view of our company overall and segment performance, as well as key components of our 2011 guidance, including our capital structure and some of the key risks and opportunities over the near term. Lastly, Vince will spend the balance of our time discussing in greater detail how we will execute our strategies and the key things to think about relative to BD's strategy going forward. After that, we'll open the floor for questions.
 Starting with Slide 4. BD's performance in both the Q4 and full year 2010 was solid. We delivered against our own internal targets and against our commitments to our shareholders. This is the 10th consecutive year BD has achieved its annual objectives. It is also the 38th consecutive year of increasing our dividends. In addition, in 2010, we maintained consistent operational excellence across the P&L. We invested in capital expenditures, invested in emerging market infrastructure, increased our investment in R&D and delivered steady predictable cash flow and return to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.
 Moving on to Slide 5. Going forward, our strategy remains sound. BD's strategy is to apply technology to address unmet and sometimes underappreciated, but important needs within healthcare and life sciences. Our four areas of focus are as follows: number one, enabling safer, simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery, and this translates to safer drug delivery for patients and for healthcare workers; number two, improving clinical outcomes through new, accurate faster diagnostics; number three, providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitate basic science, drug discovery and cell therapy; and number four, enhancing disease management in Diabetes, Women's Health and Cancer and Infection Control. If you sum these four areas up, essentially BD is all about helping life science research and healthcare work better. We do this by helping them to lower their costs and improve the quality of their outcomes. And it's very consistent with our purpose of helping all people live healthy lives. We are confident that these four areas of focus are rich with opportunities for BD to add value and to continue to grow.
 Turning to Slide 6. Despite these challenging economic times, the company remains committed to driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening the core, which remains a significant lever for BD's success. In addition, as Vince will discuss in detail later, we will leverage our core by making focused investments in R&D for platform extensions and innovative new products. We're also making significant investments in growing our businesses in emerging markets. And also very importantly, we continue to focus on operational excellence and the programs that we're building across the P&L to maintain and build upon a strong cost position, as well as to return free cash flow to shareholders.
 On Slide 7, you will see our guidance for the full year fiscal 2011, which takes into account all of the key points I've discussed in my opening remarks. David will discuss the guidance in more detail, but the net is guidance for 2011 of 4% revenue growth and 10% to 11% adjusted EPS growth or a range of EPS between $5.45 and $5.55. As you will hear from David in a minute, the 4% revenue growth is FX neutral and really represents about 6% growth over 2010 if you normalize for flu, stimulus and supplemental spending events in 2010.
 Our guidance for operating income growth of about 5% includes about five points of headwind due to investments we are making in infrastructure and R&D in 2011. So that allowing for these investments, we're showing good operating margin improvement in 2011. Looking further out, our outlook for 2011, 2012 is for an average revenue growth of 6% and an average EPS growth of 10% to 12% over this three-year period, and this was previously communicated on our Q3 2010 earnings call.
 Now I'm delighted to turn the call over to David.

103678,114504025,86535,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives"," Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the company's results, I'd like to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we completed the sale of the Ophthalmic business, as well as surgical blades product platform a",2369," Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the company's results, I'd like to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we completed the sale of the Ophthalmic business, as well as surgical blades product platform and our critical care platform and the extended dwell catheter product platforms. The results of operations associated with Ophthalmic Systems, surgical blade platform and the critical care platforms have been classified as discontinued operations for all quarters and years referred to in this presentation. A portion of the assets related to the extended dwell catheter product platform are still reported within continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met for this asset group.
 On Slide 9, I would like to walk through the impact of the divestiture in the second quarter pro forma item on our EPS. At the end of fiscal year 2010, our EPS was $5.11, excluding the $0.38 gain from the sale of our businesses as discussed earlier. The result of operations associated with these business have been classified as discontinued operations. This had a $0.21 impact, which brings you to our reported EPS of $4.90. In the second quarter of our fiscal year, we had a noncash charge related to healthcare reform impacting Medicare Part D reimbursements. That charge is worth $0.04. If you add that to our reported EPS, you would arrive at a pro forma EPS of $4.94. Looking forward to fiscal year 2011, we will be growing about 10% to 12% of our pro forma EPS of $4.94.
 Moving to Slide 10. I'd like to briefly highlight some of our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the company's expectations. Revenue came in at almost 3%, currency neutral, which was partially impacted by tough comparisons to the fourth fiscal quarter in 2009, due to pandemic flu sales in both Medical and Diagnostics segments. We are pleased with the results we saw in our emerging markets as well, experiencing double-digit top line growth across most regions. We also delivered on our EPS guidance coming in at $1.24 for the quarter.
 On Slide 11, you will see that revenues came in at almost $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS increased to $1.24 or almost 2% currency neutral. Our total year revenues of $7.4 billion reflects solid growth of about 5.5% on a currency-neutral basis and an adjusted EPS growth of about 9% currency neutral.
 Now let's move on to Slide 12 where we review our growth by segment. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased about 2% currency neutral. The growth in this segment was mainly driven by our Diabetes Care business with continued strong sales of pen needles. The Medical segment was negatively impacted by about four percentage point due to sales related to the flu pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the total year, the Medical segment grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis.
 Revenues in BD Diagnostics segment grew about 3% currency neutral, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic flu-related orders in 2009 by about two percentage points. The Diagnostics segment also experienced softness due to lower lab testing and physician office visits. However, we have seen this trend stabilize in the fourth quarter, particularly in our Preanalytical Systems business. For the total year, the Diagnostics segment grew 4% currency neutral.
 BD Biosciences revenue growth was about 5% currency neutral, driven by strong instrument and reagent sales in our Cell Analysis business. For the total year, the Biosciences segment grew 6.8% currency neutral, benefited by the supplemental and stimulus spending in Japan and the U.S.
 Now turning to Slide 13. We'll look at our geographic results. In the fourth quarter, BD's U.S. revenues increased about 1% or about 3% when adjusting for the impact of flu-related sales in 2009. U.S. Medical revenues increased about 2% year-over-year. U.S. sales of Diagnostics products increased about 1%, partially due to reduced OB/GYN visits negatively impacting our TriPath business unit. Biosciences revenue in the U.S. increased about 0.6% due to growth in Cell Analysis business unit being offset by the timing of several large customer orders in our Advanced Bioprocessing business unit.
 International revenues grew about 4% on a currency-neutral basis in the fourth quarter. After taking out the impact of flu, about four percentage points, underlying growth was 8.2% in the fourth quarter, which represents an upward trend in sequential quarterly growth rates and is driven by emerging markets in high-growth regions. For the total year, U.S. revenues were about 5%, with Medical increasing about 6% and Diagnostics increasing about 3%, with Biosciences also growing about 6%. International revenues grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Overall, international growth was adversely affected by lingering macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe and a tough comparison from flu-related sales. This was more than offset by the double-digit growth in our emerging markets, which are Asia Pacific, EMA and Latin America. In these areas, we continue to see expansion of healthcare funding and patient access. BD is investing heavily in certain high-growth markets, such as China and India, where we see unmet need that align well with BD's capabilities.
 Moving now to global safety on Slide 14. Reported sales grew almost 4% in the quarter to $443 million. On a currency-neutral basis, safety growth was about 5%. This was comprised of about 2.5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 9%. For the total year, safety growth was 6% on a currency-neutral basis, which is a combination of about 5% growth in the U.S. and an international growth rate of about 8% on a currency-neutral basis. In the Medical segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Nexiva and safety diet products, while international safety is being driven by infusion therapy products. In the Diagnostics segment, the U.S. growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, and the international growth rate is being driven by Push Button conversion, as well as Eclipse.
 Now I'd like to move on to Slide 15, where I'll walk you through the impact of pandemic flu had on our quarterly revenue growth rate on our business in fiscal year 2010. In the first half of the year, pandemic flu provided a benefit to our revenue growth of 2.5%, which is mainly in the U.S. For the second half of the fiscal year, the pandemic flu resulted in an almost 2% negative impact to our revenue growth, due to the international pandemic revenues that we recorded in the second half of fiscal year 2009 that did not repeat in fiscal year 2010. For the full year, the net impact to revenues is about 20 basis point benefit. As we discussed last quarter, we also received additional Biosciences stimulus and supplemental orders in the U.S. and Japan. This benefited fiscal year 2010 by about 50 basis points.
 As we look at fiscal year 2011, the pandemic flu revenues that were recorded in the first half of fiscal year 2010 will represent a difficult comparison, particularly in the first quarter. In the full fiscal year 2011, we are not anticipating either of these events to recur, which is about a 200 basis point impact on our growth, as Ed discussed earlier.
 Now moving on to Slide 16. We'll review our revenue growth in the fourth quarter, where our reported growth rate was 1%. Currency-neutral revenue growth was about 3%, which was negatively impacted by about 2% points of currency translation. There was no hedge impact in the quarter.
 Moving to Slide 17. And looking at our gross margin, we experienced about 100 basis points of positive currency impact. Within the performance category of 110 basis points, we had positive operating performance of about 70 basis points, which was more than offset by higher raw material costs, higher pension costs and start-up costs. As a result, net margin was down about 10 basis points.
 Slide 18 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. As discussed earlier, fourth quarter revenue was about 3% currency neutral, and gross profit grew about 1% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement line, SSG&A increased about 4% currency neutral, due to pension and EVEREST and our SAP implementation costs.
 R&D increased 10% or about 50 basis points as a percent of revenue over the prior period. This acceleration in R&D is in line with our expectations as we're continuing to invest in new products and platforms. Our operating margin decreased 4.5% due to the higher resin, start-up and ReLoCo costs. In addition, increased SSG&A and accelerated R&D costs were contributing factors. I would also like to point out that our earnings also reflect two items that essentially offset each other. The gain on the sale of our extended dwell catheter product platform that remains in continuing operations of about $18 million was mostly offset by $14 million write-off of equity investments.
 Now turning to Slide 19. I'd like to look at the total year revenue, which growth increased about 5.5%. Performance and currency contributed about 5.6% and 2%, respectfully [respectively], which was partially offset by the hedge with about 2% unfavorable impact.
 On Slide 20, we can see that our gross margin change year-over-year was a positive 20 basis point improvement. It was comprised of a 100 basis point improvement of underlying performance, which was more than offset by ReLoCo and pension costs. This positive performance was offset by 90 basis points of negative hedge impact.
 Slide 21 now recaps the total year income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. Revenue growth was 5.6% currency neutral, and gross profit was 6% currency neutral. Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 3% currency neutral, primarily impacted by higher EVEREST and pension costs. Excluding those items, our costs would have been essentially flat. For the total year, R&D increased 6% currency neutral, which is in line with our expectations. Operating income increased almost 9% as a result of strong gross margin and controlled SSG&A expenses. I would also like to point out that the tax rate for the year is higher than prior year, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.
 Now before I discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2011, I want to briefly address BD's capital structure. Given our solid investment grade ratings and the historically low interest rates in the market, we believe it's prudent for BD to seek use of this opportunity to improve the efficiency of our capital structure. Our guiding principles as we look at this are: one, to maintain a solid investment grade rating; second, to ensure ongoing access to debt markets for strategic opportunities; and third, to optimize the cost of capital based upon market conditions. As a result, we plan to access the credit markets in the coming weeks. While a definitive amount of debt has yet to be determined, we don't expect it to exceed $1 billion. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, as well as share repurchases. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of common stock in 2011 and an additional $600 million in 2012. The company plans to fund the repurchases through ongoing cash flow and the issuance of debt.
 Now I'd like to move on to fiscal year '11 guidance. Moving to Slide 23. I'd like to walk you through that guidance. For the year, we are guiding top line growth of about 4% to $7.7 billion. If you exclude the impact of pandemic sales and stimulus dollars in 2010, the underlying growth is about 6%. We expect our gross profit margins to improve by 30 to 50 basis points as we start to see the benefits of ReLoCo and improved product mix.
 SSG&A is expected to increase about 4% due to increased pension costs, EVEREST, SAP implementation costs and investment in our shared services centers. This is an incremental cost of about $50 million, which will be partially offset by G&A efficiency programs. We plan to increase R&D about 10%, mainly driven by the investments in Diabetes Care and Women's Health and Cancer platforms, which Vince will elaborate on later.
 Operating income is expected to increase about 10 to 30 points. Excluding the effects of pandemic, stimulus and the previously mentioned incremental investments, underlying growth will be about 13%. We expect our tax rate to moderately decrease as a result of the geographic mix of our business and the anticipation of the R&D tax credit being extended in fiscal year '11. We expect our cash flow to remain strong and our operating cash is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in fiscal year '11, as I mentioned earlier. We plan to repurchase $1.5 billion in shares. Capital expenditures will remain in line with our 2010 spending at approximately $550 million to $575 million.
 For our bottom line, we expect EPS to grow about 10% to 12%, resulting in our EPS guidance of $5.45 to $5.55. At this point, we are not anticipating any year-over-year impact from currency. The $0.08 hedge loss that occurred in fiscal year '10 will be offset by holding losses on our cost of goods sold in fiscal year '11. For fiscal year '11, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to be broadly in line with fiscal year '10.
 While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to remind you that our first quarter will be significantly impacted by the tough comparison to fiscal year 2010 as related to the pandemic flu. Therefore, our revenues and earnings in the first quarter will essentially be flat.
 Before I turn the call over to Vince, I would just like to highlight our solid finish to the year in a difficult environment. Our performance this year has given us continued confidence that our strategy is sound and our efficiency programs are delivering. We are continuing to drive top and bottom line growth by investing in key R&D projects and by investing in new programs to drive operational efficiencies. We're also seeking to maximize our capital structure, and in doing so, release more cash to our shareholders.
 Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Vince.

103678,114504025,86535,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives"," Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the",1867," Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As Ed and David have discussed and as all of you following the industry know, we are clearly in uncharted waters for the global economy, and what this may mean for many industries, including healthcare in the short run. However, we are very confident in -- what we are very confident in is the universal human drive to improve our standard of living and to live longer, healthier lives. That desire is pervasive globally and will ultimately drive greater demand for healthcare products and services over the long run. And that's how BD thinks about the business, successfully meeting these needs in existing and innovative ways over the long run.
 In the short run, there are opportunities to help customers improve the quality and cost of healthcare in the developed world, while we also help developing countries improve their healthcare systems. BD has strong growth drivers in place to capitalize on these needs, and as you've heard, we are increasing our investments in R&D despite these challenging times. BD is also investing heavily in emerging markets to ensure we are serving the fastest-growing opportunities with the right products for those markets profitably. And lastly, BD is consistently investing in ongoing operational excellence programs across the P&L to continually improve our competitiveness.
 Turning to Slide 26. I would like to briefly review the fiscal year 2011 guidance by segment. Again, it's important to note, as David highlighted, this guidance is relative to tough comparisons, particularly in Q1 due to the factors he enumerated earlier. For the year, we're looking at an average of about 4% for the business overall. By segment, this equates to about 4% for Medical and Biosciences, with Diagnostics slightly faster at 5% FX neutral. Excluding the effects of 2010 flu pandemic, stimulus and supplemental spending, that equates to approximately 6% for total BD as David mentioned earlier.
 Now I'd like to turn to the growth drivers we expect to drive success for BD over both the short and long terms. Turning to Slide 27. There are a number of things we are excited about with respect to BD's Medical business going forward. For example, many of you have heard us to discuss our reliable low cost, or ReLoCo, program in the past. In short, ReLoCo is a global, cross-functional business initiative established to sustain a low-cost capability and advantage for Medical Surgical Systems. We began implementation in 2009 and we'll continue through 2013. ReLoCo targets a number of areas, including our manufacturing architecture, process technology, work systems, product design, materials and packaging. We expect the program to break even in 2011 and to reach steady state savings of approximately $50 million to $60 million annually in 2013.
 Our ReLoCo program also enables a second major benefit for BD, which is accelerating growth in cost-sensitive markets where the company is underpenetrated. Today, the current focus of the program is in Hypodermic. We refer to this initiative as our ReKindle program. The ReKindle strategy is supported by three strategic pillars. First, achieving a cost-competitive position for the Hypodermic portfolio to enable the necessary pricing flexibility to compete and drive markets to affordable, higher-value products; second, offering a complete portfolio of Hypodermic products to meet the unique needs of all key target segments globally; and third, bringing a highly effective local execution approach to each segment we're targeting, aligned with the circumstances and the needs of those segments. At this time, we're not going to disclose the precise products or segments targeted for ReLoCo and ReKindle for obvious competitive reasons, but there will be more to follow on future calls as we continue to make progress.
 Looking at Slide 28. There are also other examples of growth drivers in the Medical segment. In our IV Catheter offering, we recently launched the first Healthcare Worker Safety product in China called Intima II safety and earlier, the Intima II. Intima II and Intima II safety were both specifically designed to meet the local clinical practices for the Chinese market. This is a good example of combining BD's capabilities with strong knowledge of local product needs to grow in emerging markets like China.
 In fiscal year 2010, the Pharmaceutical Systems business expanded our offering of self-administration products with Physioject, our new AutoInjector. We have obtained several customers and are building a nice pipeline.
 In Diabetes Care, we are extending our leadership with pen needles, as well as innovating with new safety pen needles in 2011. We are also partnering with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and will be leveraging our expertise as a leader in insulin delivery and acute care infusion to launch new products that will improve the patient experience and therapy outcomes for insulin pump users.
 Turning to Slide 29. I'd like to walk through some of the future growth drivers in the Diagnostics segment. In this space, we are strengthening our leadership in microbiology, while investing in innovation to expand our position in molecular and cancer diagnostics. Many of you have expressed interest in BD MAX, our new and upcoming automated HAI Molecular Diagnostics system. We're pleased with the progress of the new six-color BD MAX. It's performing very well in our labs, and we're on track to launch that as an open system in Q3 of calendar '11. The more significant BD MAX MRSA assay launch is on track for the beginning of calendar 2012 in the EU and mid-2012 in the U.S. Beyond BD MAX, we are continuing to invest in the BD Viper XTR with fully automated specimen processing and a smaller Viper LT system, which was exhibited for the first time this year at ASM, and this is to replace ProbeTec. In addition to investing in those two platforms, we are also continuing to develop our HPV test. In our Women's Health and Cancer business, we expect to launch our BD SurePath Plus Molecular Pap test in calendar 2013, which is in clinical trial right now.
 Turning to Slide 30. In our Biosciences segment, we have strong reagent and instrument opportunities. In this space, we continue to be the leader in providing researchers and clinicians with the tools they need to better and more fully understand the cell and to be seen as the partner of choice in providing the answer to cells-based scientific challenges. As examples, we are developing two next-generation analyzers. One for the research Cell Analysis segment and one for CD4 testing for the developing world. This year, we will also be launching a next-generation lower-cost desk top sorter to make this product line more accessible to researchers globally.
 Additionally, we recently announced the opening of our animal-free, antibiotic-free facility in Miami for cell culture media and peptones, which opens up significant opportunity in this sizable market. We will launch a new animal-free media supplement for bioproduction and a new serum-free media for certain stem cells this year.
 Turning to Slide 31. BD maintains a tremendous focus on emerging markets and geographic expansion. This is where a significant amount of our investment dollars have been going and will continue to go in the future. We've seen some of the benefits in 2010 as BD's International business grew approximately 6% FX neutral, and the emerging markets within that grew at approximately 13%, FX neutral. In these markets, we have some areas of specific product focus such as HIV monitoring, TB Diagnostics and Diabetes Care and some areas of operational excellence focus, such as ReLoCo, to name a few. But more broadly, the opportunity for BD is to align BD's traditional capabilities around the key health needs in these markets.
 To do this, we're investing heavily in sales people, sales training and importantly, the customer education needed to manage the growth in these developing nations. We're taking a tiered approach to intra-region geographic expansion and account management, so we're maximizing feet on the street. We're engaging with public officials, opinion leaders and healthcare associations to assist with building better healthcare policy, guidelines and best practices and becoming a preferred partner in the regions.
 Over time, we will complement our growing sales and marketing presence with increased local manufacturing and R&D. As we continue to analyze these markets and develop penetration plans one by one in order to tailor strategies to best compete based on each market's unique situation. Based on these continued investments in emerging markets, we believe we can deliver double-digit emerging market growth, again, in 2011 and continued strong growth in the future.
 Turning to Slide 32. As I outlined in my initial comments, BD is continuously driving operational excellence into everything we do. At any given time, we have a number of cost improvement programs we are engaged in. Today, I'd like to just highlight a few of the key programs we're working on and the progress we're making. One key program is ReLoCo, which I discussed earlier in my remarks. Another key operational excellence program is EVEREST, which is our SAP program, a global enterprise resource planning initiative designed to optimize processes and refresh technology to drive operating effectiveness and improve service to our customers. We're pleased with the progress of this program and have completed the design phase. We are now in the implementation phase. Although we are still three years out from completing worldwide implementation of the full program, this full program will allow us to shut off several legacy systems and should enable us to reap significant savings over the long term.
 We will also remain focused on SSG&A. For example, we are creating four shared service centers to consolidate things, such as back-office HR, finance and customer service. This will enable us to reduce the number of non-customer facing roles, so that we may invest more heavily in sales people in areas like China, Latin America and other emerging markets. We recently announced a shared service center in San Antonio, consolidating work for North America, and we will consolidate Asia-Pacific transactions in a shared service center in Singapore.
 On Slide 33. Before we open the call to questions, I would just like to reiterate the key messages I'd like for you to take away from our discussion today. First, going forward, our strategy remains sound, to apply technology to address unmet and underappreciated, but important needs within the healthcare and life sciences. Second, despite the challenging economic times we're facing, the company remains focused on driving both top line and bottom line growth through an intense focus on strengthening our core franchise and leveraging that core through a number of important initiatives. These initiatives include making focused R&D investments, to deliver key platform extensions and innovative new products and in emerging markets, to take the strength of the global BD business model to these rapidly growing segments where the local needs are tremendous and unique.
 And third, consistent with another core strength of BD, we continue to focus on operational excellence programs across the P&L to maintain our strong cost position. As a result, we remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time.
 Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.

If you remember back to 2009, when interest rates, particularly for the euro, was in the $1.50s and then we went into the beginning of fiscal year '10, rates had dropped and we had a holding gain in our cost of goods sold. This year, we're just going to be seeing a similar thing going into fiscal year '11, and that is that the inventory was put in. If you look at the average rate for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year '10, the rate was in the mid-$1.20s, and now we know where the spot rate is. When that comes out, we're going to wind up experiencing a loss associated with it. So we're saying is that loss is roughly offsetting the hedge that we had this year, which was worth about $0.08 that wouldn't repeat going into next year. On the top line, really the average rate for this year was around $1.36, and what we're saying, what makes up that $1.36, if you remember in the first half of this year, the dollar euro was in the mid-$1.40s. In the second half of this year, it was down into the $1.20s, and now we're back, here we are in the beginning of fiscal year '11, we're back into the $1.40s. So what we're saying is from a currency perspective right now, where we're sitting today, we're assuming similar exchange rates for that average out next year as what we have this year.

So first at the R&D, there's both more of a short-term and long-term component to it. And what's happening right now is some of the significant programs are moving into the more final phases in clinical trials. So the biggest increase in R&D in the company is in the Diagnostic segment. And the biggest increase within that is in Women's Health and Cancer, and that is for SurePath Plus, and that has -- we've talked about that a number of times that we were anticipating going into the clinical trial. We have redone that product, and we have now got an automated solution that we're very excited about. So that's moving into clinicals, and that clinical is going to take a year or so. So your first benchmark on the Diagnostics spending is going to be completion of that clinical trial. The second big benchmark on Diagnostics, of course, is going to be the six-color BD MAX and over this plan period, we are, as we said, it's working well in the labs and then we'll be moving into clinical trials on that product first for MRSA, right? And of course, that ramps up our spending as we move into these clinical trials. So those are the first two biggest ones. HPV itself isn't ramping that much this year, but it'll ramp later. So when you hear us start to talk about HPV going into clinical trial, that'll be another benchmark. So those are kind of the big benchmarks on Diagnostics. Now coming back to BD Medical, some of the things that I would point to. Number one, would be the Diabetes business. And in the Diabetes Care business, in the short run, it's the launch of the new safety pen needle. But the more significant one will be the new set of infusion products for pumps, for insulin pumps. And that work is a new program for us, so that is also driving some of the increase in R&D. Also, we're investing in self-injection in Pharmaceutical Systems. I did mention the first product there, Physioject. And so I think we'll be monitoring the ramp up of that product and then we'll talk to you as things progress, other products in that area. Come back to Biosciences, Biosciences, it is this new sorter and these other two analyzers, a small research analyzer and a small clinical analyzer, CD4 analyzer, for the emerging markets. So those are kind of the core areas. Now lastly, and I think we could all measure quite specifically on those. We are also increasing our investment in longer-term technologies. And when those come out of feasibility, then and we enter into product development, then we'll start talking about them more. So if you'll hear that, that will be the last indicator we'd look for.

Poster children here would be HandyLab and GeneOhm, TriPath and the small acquisitions we've been making in Biosciences. So the strategy is the same. And acquisitions, should we make them, would be strategically obvious, well disciplined, dilution, if any, would be short-lived and they would be strategically obvious, so staying the course.

So that we monitor as a leading indicator here at the office of the CEO level milestone achievement of our key R&D programs to make sure they're on track and get them back on track if they ever get off-track. And so that was an important prerequisite that we installed before we started increasing the pace of spending. So we're ready to go. We've got good discipline, and now this pace of spending can uptick. And again, we're looking at increases in R&D next year of about 10%, 11%. So that's important. It's very positive, but it's not anything we can't control very effectively.

In general, Europe in 2010 grew a little under 10% in the 8% range in safety. We're expecting that to uptick going into 2011 and overall safety growth for the company to uptick in 2011, driven by international growth. We're also seeing, and I know you didn't ask specifically about other parts of the world, but we're seeing substantial growth in safety in other regions, including Latin America and Asia Pacific in particular. As I say, in general, in Europe as we've said in previous calls, it's still early. We're expecting most countries will take most of their actions to come into the clients with the new directive near the compliant state, which was three years after enactment. So we still have about two and a half years before we think we'll see the peak of the activity.
