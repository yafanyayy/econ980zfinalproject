I'm pleased to report that we continue to see a strengthening across many of our product lines and with the business rebounding, we are getting very good earnings leverage as we keep our fixed cost stru",1015,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see a strengthening across many of our product lines and with the business rebounding, we are getting very good earnings leverage as we keep our fixed cost structure in check. The lead story in the fourth quarter was a broadening of orders in our Semi Test business.
Bookings in that sector were up 13% to over 260 million, led by increases in wireless and microcontroller segments. This is on top of a nearly 70% uptick in the third quarter. Predictions of an industry pause in bookings as we entered the fourth quarter did not materialize. On the contrary, we have seen continued strong buying from both our IDM and OSAT customers.
So as we exit 2009, we have had a solid recovery in Semi Test from the $65 million trough order rate in the first quarter to nearly $265 million in the fourth quarter. Our System Test bookings were down 28% sequentially totaling $40 million in the quarter. This kind of swing was not surprising nor will it be going forward as the lumpy buying patterns within that group are expected to continue.
I will say that our Automotive Diagnostics and Commercial Board Test units have not seen the rebound during the year that has occurred in other lines, so when they do start clicking, they will give you a small boost to our overall results. I should also mention that the System Test group remained profitable throughout 2009, anchored by steady performance in our defense business which held up the best through this downturn.
So the overall picture for the quarter completed is the total company bookings increased 5% to just over $300 million and that's the basis for our increased revenue guidance of 290 million to $310 million for this first quarter. I'd like to spend several minutes on a few other topics which I think will be of interest to you and then I'll turn it over to Greg for a recap on the numbers, especially focusing on how the business model is performing now and should perform going forward.
There are three things I'll touch on. First is the health of the product portfolio and Semi Test. Second is the status of our memory initiative and third is a temperature check on demand going forward. We also want to keep you abreast of lead times and supply line issues. So I've asked Greg to expand on that subject for you as our product line demand profile has had some very sharp swings resulting in some lead time stretch outs in the short term.
On the product portfolio, we’re now very well positioned in every market segment across semiconductor test with Magnum and the low speed memory sector, Eagle’s ETS family and performance analog, J750 for consumer digital and the FLEX for the high performance memory and SOC segments.
Every platform in our Semi Test catalog has had at least one new instrument introduction during the past year and every one of those products has been bought, shipped and installed during this last 12 months. So we are entering 2010 with the broadest and most refreshed portfolio that we have had in recent years and we can ramp these products into this upsurge. On the individual product front, we’ve just had two very strong quarters for Eagle products with an all time bookings record in Q3 and only 10% less in Q4.
In addition, this last quarter we had a major surge in J750 orders as a microcontroller market turned up smartly, driven by a long awaited rekindling of automotive demand. In fact, you have to go back over three years to find a quarter where J750 orders were higher. This is one of the major areas where lead times are stretching out. So I've asked Greg to comment further on that shortly and on what we are doing to meet the demand. But the upturn hasn't touched every end market or geographic segment. Image sensor and flash memory demand remains low, consumer audio/video and gaming driven orders are off from their third quarter levels and Japan and Europe based capacity orders remain subdued.
While we have gained memory share through the year, the memory order rate remains low. We have had follow-on orders in high speed memory but major capacity orders from our customers haven't occurred yet and the flash sector continues to be a spot buying environment despite high utilization rates in the install base.
In anticipation of your questions on the order outlook, I'll say the following
We have clearly seen a broadening of demand, more customers are participating each quarter. The tone of customer interactions is more optimistic and more urgent so the short-term outlook remains strong.
Now, from an end user standpoint, OSAT has accounted for 32% of total Semi Test orders and with a major driver of the Q4 bookings increase having grown by over 70% sequentially. But the OSAT order level still remains well below the top two quarters of the last cycle.
Overall, semiconductor test buy rates for 2009 will be under 1% at about 0.8% for the year. And if 2010 runs at the Q4 '09 rate, we would see that buy rate notch up to maybe 1%, still quite low against any historical level. While we are not making forecasts about 2010 or even about the next quarter's bookings, I want you to know that the short-term demand outlook remains strong as we work our production slot plans.
In summary, we are on a solid recovery path. We are hitting on a lot of cylinders but not all. Our new product offerings are all in production of customers and the operating model delivers about 10 points of higher operating profit at like sales levels of the past. It's been a very challenging 18 months but our employees and our supply line partners have shown great adaptability and innovation in gearing us for the future.
Now, let me turn it over to Greg for the financial view.
"
94728,84499835,47414,"Teradyne Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike and good morning everyone. In addition to providing a recap of fourth quarter results and details on the first quarter, I'd like to step back and highlight some of the key accomplishments this past year that should contribute to our future ea",1528,"Thanks, Mike and good morning everyone. In addition to providing a recap of fourth quarter results and details on the first quarter, I'd like to step back and highlight some of the key accomplishments this past year that should contribute to our future earnings power.
First, though, as a quick way to illustrate the degree of renovation in our cost structure, as you point out that we generated a 13% operating profit on sales of $267 million in the fourth quarter. This is about 10 points higher than we achieved at comparable sales levels in the past five years. The renovation of our cost structure has touched every part of our company and enabled us to earn a 10% operating profit rate in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter.
Without detailing the litany of changes over the past few years, let me highlight just a few of them. We have one major outsource FLEX manufacturing site in China that does order assembly all the way through final configuration and test. We now source about 70% of our material in low cost locations. Our board repair is consolidated in low cost locations and in engineering we have established technology building blocks that are reused in our products.
In SG&A, we have consolidated work and sales and HR, while in finance and IT, we have used low cost locations or providers for transactional support and processing. Rest assured, we will keep a firm grip on fixed costs as our model can scale without adding significant permanent headcount.
Looking ahead maturity of our cost changes should be variable compensation in nature based on the level of profitability. So, apart from a much lower operating breakeven level and a model that can scale, what else was accomplished in 2009 that increases our earnings power?
One, we brought in the two leading high-speed memory accounts with our product's frequency, throughput and flexibility advantages. While there is much more to be done to exploit the advantages we bring, we are in the tent now and we have got a compelling product. Buying and high speed memory has been very low compared to historical measures as the prior generation has been stretched further, yet as time marches on, the likelihood of a refresh is ever increasing as memory, speeds and units both increase.
Two, we successfully entered the hard disk drive market and captured significant market share in the latest generation of drive products. Units in this segment are forecasted to grow more than 20% per year over the next several years which bodes well for tests.
Lastly, we reached an agreement with Xyratex to dismissal of the pending litigation between one another. Although the settlement agreement is confidential, it will not have three financial impact on Teradyne.
Third, we successfully integrated Eagle Test into the Teradyne family. Eagle itself has been expanding its TAM and matched with our distribution muscle was able to break into multiple new accounts in 2009. Eagle on a standalone basis has historically delivered very strong financial performance with their highly differentiated offerings and that performance should continue.
So in 2009, we significantly expanded our TAM into high speed memory, hard disk drive and low cost analog testing. We are also renovating our cost structure. I should also note that our core SOC test business finished strong in the fourth quarter with the highest bookings since the first half of 2008.
As Mike noted, the J750 product was the standout topping 100 units ordered. This was the highest quarterly order level since mid 2006 for the J750 which is valued for his low cost, high parallel capabilities in the micro-controller and wafer probe markets.
In addition, our System Test group was profitable for the full year at 7%, led by our Mil/Aero business which is the defacto standard for a family of test instruments with the Department of Defense.
On the balance sheet side, we ended the year with gross cash of about $519 million, up from $374 million at the end of 2008, 80 million of that came from operations after deducting capital additions. Our cash plans for the foreseeable future are to accumulate cash. We have no plans to buy back stock. And we ended the year with net operating losses of about $300 million along with other favorable tax attributes. We expect to have a 15% tax rate for the foreseeable future. So we are very pleased with our product lineup, our lean cost structure and our financial muscle. And the start of 2010 is about as different as it could be from a year ago.
First quarter sales are expected to be about 2.5 times higher than first quarter 2009 and operating profit will swing about $108 million. While 2010 has plenty of promise as outlined in several recent analysts reports, we will focus our forecasting brain power on the supply chain lead times and closing part shortages.
On that front, we have made good progress in the quarter but with very strong orders. Lead times from order receipt have stretched out to eight to ten weeks and in some cases to over ten weeks versus our normal model of six to eight weeks. We are working very hard with our suppliers as they scramble to catch up with demand.
As to our model, it's delivering as outlined in prior calls. We have included on the website information on the convertible debt dilution which again we plan to pay the principal off in cash in 2014 and fill the option element with net shares. So the overall story is we have emerged much healthier, the short-term outlook is improving and we have made very good progress in expanding our serve markets.
So now moving to the fourth quarter results. The top line of $267 million was up $5 million it from the third quarter. Semi Test was 198 million, up 25 million and System Test group was $69 million down $20 million. Semi Test product shipments were ramped 20% from a quarter ago. Within the $267 million, service revenue was $57 million, flat with a quarter ago, Semi Test service revenue was $39 million. Product turns business was 30% versus 37% a quarter ago. Semi Test product turns business was 35% versus 50% a quarter ago. Memory revenue was $18 million in the quarter, up from $8 million a quarter ago.
Moving down the P&L, non-GAAP gross margins increased from 42.5% in the third quarter to 48.2% in the fourth quarter due to mix and a lower obsolescence provision. R&D expenses were $40.9 million or 15.3% of sales compared to $38.3 million or 14.6% of sales in the third quarter. SG&A expenses were $51.5 million or 19.3% of sales compared to $46.3 million or 17.7% of sales in the third quarter. Our operating expenses in total of $92.4 million were up $7.8 million from the third quarter primarily due to the removal of the temporary seller-related reductions. Our net non-GAAP interest and other expense was $2 million, taxes were $2.7 million in the quarter and our headcount totaled about 2900 people.
In the fourth quarter semiconductor sales were 74% of the total and the System Test group was 26%. Our book-to-bill ratio for the fourth quarter was 1.13 for the overall Company, 1.33 for Semiconductor Tests and 0.58 for System Test group. At the end of the quarter our backlog stood at $372 million of which 84% is scheduled to ship within the next six months. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations totaled approximately $50 million after capital additions of $15 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $33 million including $6.3 million of stock based compensation, $7.6 million for acquired intangible asset amortization and $2 million for the amortization of the GAAP imputed debt discount.
As noted in the press release, sales for the first quarter are expected to be between $290 million and $310 million and the non-GAAP EPS range is $0.20 to $0.26 on 182 million diluted shares. I should add that the guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and a non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our GAAP EPS range is $0.14 to $0.19. The operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is about 17%. I'd like to point out that the last time we were at this level of profitability our sales were about $390 million or $90 million higher and this was in the second quarter of 2006. I should also add that our operating expenses will be approximately $100 million due to higher variable compensation with the above model performance and some added engineering spend due to the timing of NREs.
Now, moving to the P&L percentages in the first quarter. We expect gross margins to be 50 to 51%. R&D should be 17% to 16% and SG&A should be 18% to 17%. Non-GAAP net interest expense is expected to be about $2.1 million. The tax provision should be about $6.5 million.
In summary, our model is delivering, end markets are improving and we are successfully penetrating new markets. Now I'll turn the call back over to Andy.

We feel quite good about the status of the 750 and I'm saying that not because we had a good quarter of bookings, but if you look back over the last year and a half and then look forward, what our customers see is they see that there's been a product capability refresh on the 750, so an increase in frequency that gives them more headroom and more coverage in the microcontroller space. As they go forward and look at the road map they will see the same thing over the next couple of years as a continuation of that product, new instrumentation, new capability for even higher through put, so as a product, it's a pretty solid product with 3000 systems and no indications that it mismatches against the technical requirements or the economic requirements in its face.
Now, in the overall Semi market, everybody wants to cover as much space as they can so there are competitors coming in, but it's not an arena that it is easy to get in, in a big way. You can find a place where you can get one system in or two systems in but moving into triple digits in that space in unit bookings is quite a challenge. That's true over on the analog side as well.
In the Eagle product there is -- actually, that's the offensive play in the low end as we move against some of the legacy products that are being discontinued there. So it's a tough space but we feel pretty comfortable about the arsenal we have got down at that end.

The Eagle Test product has a new family member, the ETS-88. That gives us a low cost configuration multiple device type testing in -- off the same platform -- in parallel, so that's an expansion of TAM at the low end of the analog space.
On the flex, we have got high density, high voltage DC instrumentation that has been introduced so in the mid-range, mixed signal space, that gives us more capability for more sockets. On UltraFLEX, we have got high speed expansion of our high speed digital capability. That's been important in some networking applications. What else?
Well, UltraFLEX-M obviously gives us a greater TAM expander. So it's a mixture of instruments that keep fleshing out the product. Remember, we are 40 plus percent share in the SOC space so most of what we add, actually, is -- it's to get additional sockets in our current install base. But those are some of the examples.

Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us on the call this morning. We are off to a strong start to 2010 with a very solid first quarter and increased revenue on profit guidance for the second quarter. It’s been an exceptional start f",925,"Thanks Andy. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us on the call this morning. We are off to a strong start to 2010 with a very solid first quarter and increased revenue on profit guidance for the second quarter. It’s been an exceptional start for the year in three respects. 
First our SOC test product line up is seeing increase in demand across a wide array of customers in technology segments. Second, the business model we’ve shaped in the last two years is delivering markedly improved performance, and third this performance is being achieved without a strong rebound in the memory test markets so far, which means that we should have another contributor once that market gets moving. 
I’ll asked Greg to focus on the financial model comparisons in his comments, but I would like to expand on what’s behind our bookings and sales numbers for the first half of the year.
As you saw on our press release, we logged $534 million in bookings in the first quarter, up over $230 million from the Q4 total of $303 million. Semi Test led the way up about $200 million sequentially and totaling $460 million in the quarter, the highest Semi Test total in ten years. System test group orders which include our defense automotive commercial board test and hard disk drive test units saw their own healthy order surge up above 85% from the fourth quarter, driven mostly by disk drive and commercial board test.
Since many of these businesses and system tests have longer lead time profiles, you’ll see much of that revenue flow through starting in the third quarter, but back to semiconductor tests. There are a number of things contributing to our strong showing; first of all the utilization remains very high in our leading edge products. Device unit volumes are increasing and the appetite for testers that are for high performance and high productivity is on the rise.
During the downturn, many older generation testers were permanently decommissioned, and as the market has recovered customers are buying new capability for the future rather than bringing old testers back in production. We’ve seen evidence of this in our higher end in our UltraFLEX system sales where more than half of the testers ordered in the first quarter included new options were introduced since mid 2008. 
We had record demand for the J750 with over 150 units ordered, over a third of which were for the new J750EX. The EX improves throughput and doubles the 750’s operating frequency giving customers better economics and additional performance headroom for the micro-controller and wafer sort application.
The Eagle ETS88 introduced early last year, targeting the very cost sensitive segment of the analog market, also had record bookings in the quarter. The lead technology segments driving the first quarter’s strong demand were wireless, power management and our continued resurgence in micro-controller tests which had started to pick up in the fourth quarter and continued to expand throughout this first quarter. 
But in addition to these lead segments, there has been renewed customer demand in a wide variety of applications where we provide test solutions, from network components, to network and server class processors, to digital TV and mobile internet devices. 
The only SOC segments that remain subdued are the image sensor and LCD driver segments, but even without them we are seeing robust buying across all other markets. As I mentioned earlier, the memory test market is not on the same recovery trajectory as SOC. Nevertheless, we’ve seen our best results in the last two years, but in the context of a market that is only slowly starting to increase CapEx outlays. 
Both our Magnum products for low speed memory test and our UltraFLEX-M for high-speed memory saw sequential order increases in the quarter, but in comparison to SOC, the memory market is still lagging. 
I would like to spend a couple of more minutes on the first quarter Semi Test numbers from a competitive perspective. We had an outstanding quarter of design wins in Q1 logging over 30 contestant socket wins across SOC and memory. Half of these came from the Nextest, Eagle and the high-speed memory products, and half from the SOC portfolio we had prior to our acquisitions. 
So we are very pleased with the market breadth of our product offerings and with the ability of our field organization to sell and support this broad portfolio into new applications. In particular, the combination of Eagle’s lower cost platform with our Asian distribution footprint making an impact in the market. Finally, let me address the likely questions around sustainability.
Clearly, this past quarter has been exceptional, both in the breadth of the demand and in the leverage that we get in our P&L from the business model. Out of the demand comes from the return of capital for the test sector after two years of very low buy rates, and part comes from the tool in for the future with next generation performance buying, but even with the strong momentum across the market, the two and three year buy rates remain historically low.
So rather than speculate on exactly where we are on a cycle, let me instead emphasize how much leverage exists in our model, how strong the drop-through on revenue growth is, how much we are committed to holding our fixed costs and check as we grow our market presence. 
Now let me turn it over to Greg for some added depth on the numbers for the first half of this year.

In addition to providing a detailed review of first quarter results and second quarter guidance, I’d also like to expand on our earnings growth from the last cycle and our leverage on our business model going forwa",1416,"Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. In addition to providing a detailed review of first quarter results and second quarter guidance, I’d also like to expand on our earnings growth from the last cycle and our leverage on our business model going forward. Starting with the first quarter recap, we delivered a 21% non-GAAP operating profit on sales of $330 million. 
This resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $0.33, $0.07 over the top end of our first quarter guidance. Our first quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 is already well above last cycles second quarter 2008 peak earnings per share of $0.16 without significant contributions from our new market entries in memory and hard disk drive test.
Second quarter sales are predicted to be $390 to $420 million and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.45 to $0.52 per share. For the second quarter, we expect a non-GAAP operating profit rate of 25% to 27%, which would be the highest operating profit rate in ten years. This non-GAAP EPS guidance is also about three times higher than the last cycle’s quarterly peak earnings, again with only modest contributions in the new market offerings. 
On the top line, we are clearly benefiting from our broad SOC test product coverage. The SOC unit recovery that has started in the third quarter of 2009 has spread out to almost all the right segments, with power management, micro-controller and wireless being the strongest. The breadth of the SOC market coverage, combined with our strong market share gains, is driving our second quarter revenue guidance up approximately 25% over our last cycle’s peak quarterly revenue.
Our Semi Test business achieved a non-GAAP operating profit of approximately 26% in the first quarter on sales of $290 million despite only moderately increasing CapEx and memory tests. SOC totaled 95% of the revenues and memory was 5%. 
In the first quarter, our systems test group lost money due to anticipated lows in hard disk drives and lower [ph] demands. With that said, we expect a strong second half in 2010 for a systems test group.
Stepping back though for a moment, we recognize there are questions on exactly where we are on a CapEx cycle, but our focus is on maintaining the right fixed cost structure to achieve our model profitability or better over the cycle. You will recall that we said that our fixed cost structure so that when the annualized SOC test market is about two billion, we generate 15% or better operating profits. 
Over the last four years ended in 2009, the SOC test market has averaged about $2.5 billion. So we feel that two billion is prudent market size to plan for a mid cycle profitability. Equally important, is that our earnings leverage, when the SOC market is above two billion or if we gain a few additional points of SOC share, is very attractive as about $0.50 or more of the incremental sales drops to our operating profits. 
Well, there are a host of other assumptions in the model. The major factor remains the size of the SOC test markets, given our greater than 40% and growing share. The other important aspect of our model is that we have sized the company so that our new adjacencies, hard disk drive and high-speed memory are upside rather than base requirements to achieving model profitability. 
So, in this first half, you are seeing the earnings leverage in our model during the SOC market upturn and we expect more contributions from our new market entries in the second half. On the cost side of the ledger, we plan on keeping a tight rein on fixed costs and maintaining our head counts at about 2900.
We are doing some selective hiring, mostly in the distribution arena and are utilizing some contract talents in strategic product development areas. Moving now to the supply side, we’ve made good and steady progress in ramping all products. Our main test product demand nearly doubled in two quarters with some models seeing more than ten-fold growth, an astonishing reflection of the inherent volatility in the industry. 
In spite of the surge, we were able to keep our SOC test lead times in the first quarter to an average of about ten weeks. So overall, while we’ve done well in gathering components and expediting materials, we remain in a war room mentality until we are back down to a single digit weekly times. 
On the balance sheet we entered the first quarter with gross cash of about $533 million, of which $8.5 million came from operations after capital additions. We expect to end the second quarter with about $610 million in cash and marketable securities. Our carry forward and operating losses totaled about $295 million and we have federal tax credits for about $55 million.
We expect our 2010 tax rate to be closer to 10%, than the 15% estimate that we provided earlier. We posted some slides on our website that provide details and expected performance at different sales, levels and mix and include some historical comparisons. This is important as mix can have a significant impact. We’ve also included information on the compatible debt delusion, which again we plan to pay off the principal in cash in 2014 until the optional element with net shares.
Now moving to the first quarter results, the top line of $330 million was up $63 million from the fourth quarter. Semi Test was $290 million, up $92 million and system test group was $40 million, down $29 million. System Test product shipments increased 55% from a quarter ago. Within the $330 million, service revenue was $61 million, up $4 million from a quarter ago.
Semi Test service revenue was $44 million. Total company product turns business was 37% versus 30% a quarter ago. Semi Test product turns business was 39% versus 35% a quarter ago. Memory revenue was $16 million in the quarter, down from $18 million sequentially. 
Moving down to P&L, non-GAAP gross margins increased from 48.2% in the fourth quarter to 52.6% in the first quarter due to mix and higher volume. R&D expenses were $49.1 or 14.9% of sales compared to $40.9 or 15.3% of sales in the fourth quarter. SG&A expenses were $55.9 million or 17% of sales compared to $51.5 million or 19.3% of sales in the fourth quarter. 
Operating expenses of a $105 million were up $12.5 million from the fourth quarter primarily due to variable compensation and some added engineering spend for new products. Our net non-GAAP interest and other expense was $2.5 million, taxes were $4.8 million in the quarter. Our headcount totaled 2,900.
In the first quarter semiconductor test sales were 88% of the total and the System Test group was 12%. Our book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter was 1.62 for the overall company, 1.59 for semiconductor test and 1.84 for the Systems Test group. 
At the end of the quarter our backlogs stood at $577 million, of which 89% is scheduled to ship within the next six months. Cash flow from operations totaled approximately $8.5 million after capital additions, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $34 million, including $8 million of stock based compensation, $7 million for acquired intangible asset amortization and $2.5 million for amortization of the GAAP imputed debt discount. 
As noted in the press release, sales for the second quarter are expected to be between $390 million and $420 million and the non-GAAP EPS range is $0.45, $0.52 and 200 million diluted shares. I should add that the guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangible and the non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. 
Our GAAP EPS range is $0.33 to $0.40. The operating profit rate at the mid point of our second quarter guidance is above 26.5% and I’d like to point out, but the last time we were at this level of profitability our sales were $641 million or $236 million higher, this was in the third quarter of 2000. 
Now moving to the P&L percentages in the second quarter; we expect gross margins to be about 53%, R&D should be about 13% and SG&A should be about 14%. Non-GAAP net interest is expected to be about $2.2 million, the tax provision should be about $10 million. 
In summary our model is delivering, end-markets are improving, our designing in momentum is very robust and the product portfolio is at strongest in many years. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Andy.

I would think about that as also, obviously a second half story if we are successful on that. So that’s our objective and we hope to be able to deliver on something on that in the second half of this year. 
On the share side, let me put it in perspective over the last few years. In SOC if we go back three or four years we were mid-30s in share and moved that up in ‘08 to just over 40% and held our share position in 2009 around 41% share in SOC. 
Now, we think that, and it’s on a much smaller, obvious on a much smaller test market of about $1.3 million. We are pretty optimistic that we are going to gain some ground this year, how much I’m not sure, but the hold at 41% last year was done without much real contribution from the microcontroller segment, from the image sensor segment, from the digital wafer probe segment. 
So holding last year was actually in retrospect to pretty good accomplishment. So, we are hopeful we can get a couple of points share this year, but we won’t know that until we have a few quarters under our belt.

The first half of the year for us will be strong, and our short-term expectation here from a customer-by-customer standpoint is that there is still an appetite to continue to add. 
If you took it at the other end of the spectrum and said “Well, how large could the market be?” If you put a $3 billion market and through SOC and you might be gulping as I say that, because that sounds high historically, but if you put a $3 billion market in, you still have a three year cycle here that is lower than the prior two three years. 
So the productivity and the buy rates continue to go down, and if you don’t mind me giving the numbers, the buy rate in the first three years and the last nine would be 2.1%, and the middle three years 1.8%, and then even if I embed a $3 billion market, which is not in my view out of the realm of possibility for this year, because of the correction and because of all of the leading technology that’s being developed by our customers, you still move that buy rate down to 1.4%. 
So it really hasn’t rocked the boat so much to have that kind of year, that kind of market performance. If we do that, our market share moves up less than you describe, but its still a good move on market shares.

I think the way that I would approach this is to say, what if the market in memory has been north of $1 billion in the number of years in the last five or six years, so the way we model it is we say, if it gets back -- and right now I think its running at about annualized, running at about a $300 million rate, up from $200 million last year. So if it’s a $500 million market and we are trying to get a 20% share, that’s $100 million for us. 
If it works its way incrementally back up to $1 billion, our hope is that we could have 20% plus in that environment. So rather than call exactly how big the market is, which we have sized an investment and we have got two product lines that are attacking that, that we hope to be able to deliver between $100 million and $200 million business, depending upon how that market does shape up.

I’m having a little trouble remembering the beginning of 2000. Ask me a 1984 question, I’d probably know. One of the things that are happening now, there is clearly a very broad and strong demand, heavy optimism in our customers about their projections for unit growth and new product introduction. 
I think one of the big things that’s different between 2004 and now is that the OSAT’s don’t buy the way they did in 2004 now, that was a built newer environment. It is far more thoughtful now and tied much more to commitments from their customers. So you don’t have the built-in bubble from the OSAT side of the equation, but when you are in an up market everybody does feel good, so we are very careful about whether there’s any double ordering as we were asked a few minutes ago, or whether there was some exuberance in the market. We are certainly seeing strength, but we are not seeing the signs of double ordering. 
The other thing I comment on is, there has really been quite a significant decommissioning in this cycle of older generation equipment, and even though customers do want to squeeze out as much as they can out of fully depreciated assets, they really decommissioned a number systems; as much as if I take a combination of complete decommissioning and low utilization, that could have eaten as much as 30% or 40% into the cumulative installed base of legacy equipment. 
So a bit of this buying here is offensive buying to get on with the new generation of product, and it’s filling in a little bit of that hole that exists because of the heavy decommissioning in the cycle. I think that’s different from 2004 as well.

So, its really a function of will the unit volumes continuing to grow, and will their forecast continue to strengthen that we’ll have the impact as the whether there is any pause in the digestion. 
But again, as I come back to this, I think there is a scenario here; the probability of a sharp fall-off starting in the third quarter.

The fact that we were at 10 weeks in the first quarter despite the incredible ramp we had on average I think is very positive in terms of how our supply line guys were able to get the necessary parts. There was extraordinary wall room effort to pull that off. 
I think lead times are likely to move out a little now, but we expect to pull them right back in; some what like we did last quarter. When we started the quarter, we thought lead times could be a little beyond 10, but we ended up at 10, and our normal is six to eight, so we are not that far out the range right now. So we are going to do everything we humanly can and our suppliers are making good progress. So we see that we are making progress everyday. 
Occasionally we will set back, but we tend to recover very fast. So we are feeling very good about where we are on the supply line and have more work to do, but we are confident that we will meet our customers’ expectations.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being with us you for joining us today. Our results in the third speak for themselves, so I won’t go into detail there other than to say that we posted record numbers and are quite pleased with how the financial results reflect the overall strength of the company.
We’re significantly different operations from a few years back with a richer product portfolio, stronger market share position, a very efficient cost structure and a solid balance sheet. Add to that the upside of our growth initiatives and we believe the picture going forward is quite promising. So, I’ll let Greg go through how our business model is performing as well as our cash strategy and the cash calendar.
But I’d like to focus my reminders first on what’s happening in the test market in the short run; second, how we expect our full year results to play out and third, what we expect over a longer horizon. The most obvious show term issue is the sharp correction and demand we’ve seen in this past quarter in the SOC space. Although memory orders were up slightly, our SOC test orders declined 47% led by an OSAT pull back of $120 million.
As I’ve mentioned in the past, our industry’s annual run rate was over $3 billion, which is above the trend line, so this correction isn’t unexpected. For 2010, the SOC market will now likely come in at $2.6 to 2.7 billion or double the market size in 2009, but will likely exit year at an annualize ship rate of about $2 billion. So, it’s been a sharp correction down to a level below the average market size of the past few cycles.
I would note that we’ll be operating in Q4 at about model profitability in this correction, roughly 10 points higher than in prior cycles. So, our structure work for the last couple of years should stand up well, equally important is our continued progress on market share. While the overall the SOC market will double in 2010, we’ll grow by nearly 2.5 times. This will lift our share position to somewhere between 45 and 50% for the year. This is obviously a bigger gain than on the last few years, so it deserves some comment.
There are three things happening here. First, we’ve been focused on high growth end markets like smartphones, automotive electronics and consumer white goods. These markets are growing faster than other end market segments like personal computers, netbooks or low end cellphones.
Second, the test content in these products has a tight fit to our instrument portfolio and system architectures. Most notably, our power management and wireless instrumentation, plus our microcontroller test capability. As an example of how that plays out, we capture about 50% of the test seconds in a typical tablet versus only 15% of the test seconds in a netbook.
And third, design for test methods are implemented more heavily in digitally dominant chips like PC processors with a result of reducing the test bitrate in these segments versus the mixed signal technologies in the consumer, automotive and industrial spaces where the test market continues to grow.
The bottom line is that our FLEX and Eagle products have tapped in to the growing demand for mobile, energy efficient ICs. They’re at the heart of this new wave of consumer products. So, the share gains we’ve seen from us in the last few years are real. They’re hard one, of course, socket by socket and of course, we don’t win every battle, but our cumulative performances have been undeniable.
Shifting now to memory, you’ll see in a table on our website that memory test demand is inching up, but remains well below prior cycle peaks. In that environment, we’ve had a small increase in our bookings in Q3 up to $27 million and will continue to ship at about $30 million in the fourth quarter. More significant is our continued progress in strategic design ends [ph].
This past quarter, we won new business in DDR3 wafer short testing with our Magnum II Test System from Nextest. This is a new beach head for the Magnum and represents another revenue - I’m sorry, another avenue for growth in high volume, high parallel wafer probe applications. Having said that, the memory revenue growth story continues to be tied to fab expansion plans for next year, while we’re increasingly well-positioned with the UltraFLEX and Magnum products in that space.
Turning now to systems test, we nearly doubled our bookings with $91 million in orders for the quarter. This was led by our defense business and our hard disk drive products. If you recall that these sectors were lagging earlier this year, so the resurgent in those groups plus some continued strength in commercial board test has improved the overall systems test outlook.
So, the overall picture is a correction in the SOC test market back below the trend line as company’s digest the new capacity put in place earlier this year. But continued growth going forward in semiconductor industry units and revenue productions driven principally by next generation smartphones, automotive electronics and mobile connectivity products. All of these bode well for the long-term semi test outlook.
In summary, we’ll have one of the highest revenue years in our history in 2010, we’ll have our highest proper rate ever this year due to steady cost controls and market share leverage and our performance will compare well to the lead companies in the overall industry and will stand out in the test sector.
So, independent of how this correction plays out, we’re positioned well for future over the cycle performance both in our core and in new markets.
Now, I’ll turn this over to Greg for an in-depth review of the financials.

I’d like to touch upon some of the key highlights before I get into the details of our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. I’ll also update you on our model and our cash plans.Starting with th",1799,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to touch upon some of the key highlights before I get into the details of our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. I’ll also update you on our model and our cash plans.
Starting with the third quarter recap, we posted sales of $502 million, with a non-GAAP operating profit rate of 32.8%, and EPS of $0.82. This was our highest non-GAAP operating profit rate in history eclipsing the 32% rate set just last quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we’re expecting sales to be between $300 to 325 million with non-GAAP EPS of $0.21 to 0.28. This would put us on course for a full year sales of $1.6 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $2.05 to 2.12, which would top our annual EPS record. It would also put us on course to achieve our highest full year operating profit rate in history at approximately 27% and will likely be our first year of operating above our model 15% profit target for each quarter.
One short hand way to show how we’ve modeled the company for improve over the cycle performance is to combine 2009 and 2010 and compare this two-year period with similar two-year periods. We’ve done that on our supporting slides on our website and you can see that we’re on course to generate just over 16% non-GAAP operating profit over the 2009-10 periods. This is at least 10 points better than the 2007-2008 combined periods or the 2005-2006 combined periods.
You’d also have to go back very far in the archives to find a year where the SOC test market was as low as $1.3 billion as it was in 2009 or averaging about $2 billion over this two-year period. So, this is by no means an easy comparison. Perhaps though, more important than our strong over the cycle earnings performance is our free cash flow generation per share.
Our 2010 free cash flow is expected to be approximately $430 million plus or minus $15 million. Using our non-GAAP diluted shares, this amounts to about $2.20 per diluted share. This would significantly exceed our past record of $1.21 per diluted share in 1999. This would also be a new record for free cash flow yield at about 20%.
This past upturn was extraordinary. Our revenue grew from $121 million in the first quarter of 2009 to just over $500 million this past quarter. And the third quarter just ended, Eagle and Nextest were the standouts, each topping their past high watermarks in revenue.
We grew faster than our peers as our SOC test market share expanded from about 41 percent in 2009 to an estimated 50% through the first nine months of 2010. The reason for the significant share gain is twofold. We have high market share and faster growing markets and we’ve also gain considerable share across all products on a socket by socket basis.
Moving now to the demand side, semi test demand fell sharply in the quarter. OSAT bookings were only 47 million, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Customers are clearly in a digestion phase, which overall is healthy.
On the other side of the bookings ledger, systems test group had record bookings. This was primarily due to strong bookings for hard disk drives and defense test systems. While we’re expecting a significant drop in sequential sales for the total company of about $190 million in the fourth quarter, we expect to be operating at model profitability. We’ve pulled the only lever we need to in a slowdown, which is to adjust our inventory pipeline.
As sales decline, we expect our cost to come down similar to how they rose as the vast majority of our quarterly cost growth was in variable compensation. I should add that this variable cost are spread over their respective performance periods, which range from a year to six months and this can cost some bumpiness in quarterly cost. We’ll also have some puffiness in engineer as we incur NREs or from time to time invest slightly more to capture additional growth.
Stepping back for a moment, the macroeconomic environment and our customer sentiment is nothing like what we saw at the end of 2008. It feels much more like what we saw in late 2004. What we call what is around the corner, whatever unfolds, we’re clearly in a much stronger position than at any time in our past with our much improved model and strong product lineup.
Moving next to cash, in our last conference call, I said that we intended to go a full cycle and then update you on our plans. But given the strength of the operating model, we now plan to move this update into our next conference call as we are currently reviewing our cash requirements and alternative uses of cash. What I can say now is that we intend to maintain sufficient cash resources for our worldwide operations under both very harsh operating environments and periods of fast growth.
We’ll also maintain sufficient cash for attractive M&A that is close to our core capabilities and exceeds our cost of capital. As you know, over the last five years, we’ve returned just over $500 million through stock buybacks when we have excess capital and invested about $530 million in aggregate in Ecotest and Nextest when we determine that we can earn more than our cost of capital with those acquisitions. We believe there will other attractive acquisitions close to our core of smaller size to these two acquisitions.
Before I move onto the details of the quarter, I want to clarify our non-GAAP EPS calculations as there has been some confusion. You may recall that when we issued the convert, we entered into a call overlay to reduce dilution. We bought a call on 34.7 million of our shares matching the number of shares embedded in the convert at the convert exercise price of $5.48. We also sold a warrant at $7.67 for the same number of shares 34.7 million, which help offset the cost of the call. These two instruments essentially moved the dilution from our convert from$5.48 a share to $7.67 per share.
In our non-GAAP EPS calculation, we include our call option at $5.48. GAAP harbored [ph] does not include our call option in the EPS calculation rather it recognizes only the dilutive components, which is the embedded option in the convert at $5.48 and the warrant we sold at $7.67. Sorry for the long winded explanation, but I thought it was important to explain while we make this adjustment.
On the balance sheet, we ended third quarter with gross and marketable securities of $899 million. Our net cash after deducting the $190 million face amount of convertible debt due in 2014 and a $9 million loan in Japan is $700 million. We expect to add approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter to our cash balances. I should add that we also contributed $45 million to our frozen U.S. pension plan to fully fund it in 2010 and we don’t expect the need to make any significant future contributions.
As to the end of the third quarter, our U.S. carry forth net operating losses total about $240 million and we have federal tax credits of about $55 million. The third quarter top line of $502 million was up $47 million from the second quarter. Semi test was 448, up $35 million and systems test group was $54 million, up $12 million.
Semi Test product shipments increased 10% from a quarter ago and tenfold from a drop in 2009. Then the $205 million, service revenue was $66 million, up $2 million from a quarter ago. Semi test service revenue was $48 million. Total company product turns business was 18% versus 29% a quarter ago. Semi test turns business was 18% versus 29% a quarter ago. Memory revenue was $29 million in the quarter, up from $21 million sequentially.
Moving on to P&L, gross margins decreased from 55.9% in the second quarter to 54.9% in the third quarter due to lower sales of written down inventory, higher [inaudible] charges and less favorable product mix.
R&D expenses were $50.1 million or 10% of sales compared to $50.4 million or 11.1% of sales in the second quarter. SG&A expenses were $61.1 million or 12.2% of sales compared to $58.3 million or 12.8 of sales in the second quarter.     Operating expenses of $111.2 million were up $2.5 million from the second quarter due to variable compensation, offset somewhat by savings elsewhere. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses were up $27 million, of which $22 million is variable compensation and $5 million is from the restoration of temporary pay cuts. We’ve obviously kept it very firm hand on fixed cost.
  Our net non-GAAP interest and other expense was $1.4 million. Taxes were $6.7 million in the quarter and benefitted from the full year rate adjustment to 6%.
  In the third quarter, semiconductor test sales were 89% of the total. System test group was 11%. Our book-to-bill ratio for the second quarter was 0.7 for the overall company, 2.58 for semiconductor tests, and 1.7 for the systems test group.
At the end of the quarter, our back log stood at $482 million, of which 79% is scheduled to ship and be recognize as revenue within the next six months. Cash flow from operations totaled approximately $237 million after capital additions. Depreciation and amortization for the third was $32 million including $8 million of stock-based compensation, $7 million for acquired intangible asset amortization, and $2.7 million for amortization of the GAAP imputed debt discount.     As noted in the press release, sales for the fourth quarter are expected to be between $300 million and $325 million, and the non-GAAP EPS range is $0.21 to $0.28 on 198 million diluted shares. I should add that this guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our GAAP EPS range is $0.14 to $0.20.     The operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is about 16%.
Now, moving to the P&L percentages in the fourth quarter, we expect gross margins to be 49 to 50%, R&D should be 16 to 15% and SG&A should be about 18% to 17%. I should quickly add that [inaudible] model in the fourth quarter when you adjust for mixed. Non-GAAP net interest expense is expected to be about $1.7 million. The tax provision should be about $3 million.     In summary, our over the cycle model is clearly delivering. We’re well-positioned in good markets and our products are winning.
Now, I will turn the call back over to Andy.     Andrew Blanchard</TAG>
Thanks, Greg. Pia, we’d now like to take some questions.

If you look at what’s going on with backend tester orders and you look at how strong front end orders are still are. There’s obviously a pretty big digestion happening at the OSAT levels, but foundries continue to really order a lot of equipment. I get that there is this copper gold issue in the bonding world, but why - is there something different going on in the tester world this time why the OSATs would be digesting so much tester capacity and yet front end orders haven’t come down very much.
I’m just sort of wondering like in your business if there’s something different this time that’s causing them to digest orders more than they would in the front end.

So, for us, it isn’t a - you know it’s dramatic, but it isn’t a different pattern. I don’t know how to speculate on the front end.

We do also believe that there are some attractive, very close to our core opportunities, not in test but some other very close adjacencies that could be a good fit, if the valuation stars align and at a point like this where we think our valuation is low, we’d be more inclined to use cash. So, we are going to keep a reasonable amount of cash for some attractive acquisitions as well.

That chart on our website that you’ll see today reflects the overall demand in memory and its inch its way up over the course of the last four quarters, so that the run rate and memory is annualized about $700 million a year. So, a piece of that shortfall between that and the past is that the backend and the DDR3 buying have not been very, very strong.
I think I mentioned - I want to just comment that that’s why opening up the probe side, the wafer test side of the DDR3 space important to us. It’s not a lot of volume at this point, but it does open up really the last segment if you think about it in the memory space for us.
On the HDD side, as we mentioned in prior calls, the capacity adds this year, we’re pushed from the first half of the year into the second half. We’re seeing that now and we’ve built some backlog up in that business that will ship into 2011. So, there has been a shift in capacity adds in that space and we felt that shift.
Now, our position in hard disk drive is pretty much consistent with what we said last quarter and that is that we expanded our product coverage from mobile drives, 2.5 inch drives to enterprise drives and at the same time, we’re getting a beach ahead of the second customer. So, as we look into next year, our objective is to be able to put all that together and the objective is to double our business from the $40 to 60 million annual run rates to twice that. So, that would be shared gains.

So, you know, customers are earning so little on their cash. They’re more willing to part with their cash earlier and obviously, it gives a little more flexibility. So, it’s all part of a multi-period strategic deal. So, this will happen now and then and this is - the cash really is one small element to a bigger deal.

But in all the skirmishes, there’s always some that we’re able to prevail on and there’s always some that leak away from us.
The monitor on this thing is the market share shift. Now, I think this year, what’s important about this year because it’s a dramatically different share growth picture. There are two or three components, there’s the design in net win situation. If you said we went from the low 40s to the high 40s, about a third of that is just straight net gains from that wins and loss side of it.
The second thesis, sometimes customers buy more than other customers do, so there’s maybe a temporary phenomenon. And then, the third one is that if you’re riding the hot segments then those segments grow more and that becomes real share gain overtime. That is why even though the number suggest we’re 50%, we take that second piece the one of asynchronous buying and put that aside and say that might not go on forever.
But from a real socket win standpoint and from a real sub-share in the mobile communications and microcontrollers and power management, automotive, in those areas, those share ships by our customers, I think are real and we’re on the strong horses there. So, net [ph] we are gaining, we have been over the last few years. The numbers are clear on that front and we think this is a unique year because some of the phenomena in markets that we’ve been riding are amplifying the socket winds that we’ve had.

We think microcontroller and automotive go from single high digits, maybe 9% up almost to the mid ‘teens, 14%.
So, those two together, we think take about 8 points of the markets that they didn’t have before. At the same time, microprocessors and graphics and chipsets, we think those because of the high digital content are more susceptible to the structural test DFT techniques and so that compression, we think that pushes that segment from what’s already today is high ‘teens, 18ish% down into the low ‘teens.
