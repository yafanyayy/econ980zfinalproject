31197,84103758,47627,"Mattel Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-29-2010",2010-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Mattel, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dianne and good morning, everyone. At the beginning of 2009, I made some promises on behalf of these thousands of employees who work in Mattel. I said, ""Our agenda is clear, to deliver improved execution, to position the company for the future",792,"Thank you, Dianne and good morning, everyone. At the beginning of 2009, I made some promises on behalf of these thousands of employees who work in Mattel. I said, ""Our agenda is clear, to deliver improved execution, to position the company for the future and our promise is simple, to reward investors, run the business well and responsibly and make kids lives fun."" And in 2009, we accomplished just that. We improved execution across the supply chain and throughout the company by realigning our infrastructure, controlling cost and expenses, tightly managing working capital, especially inventories, and reducing capital spending by doing only business-critical projects and doing them exceptionally well. The results is improved profitability, a stronger balance sheet and improved cash flow, which we used to lower debt, increase cash balances and continue to reward shareholders through our strong annual dividend. We were also successful in bringing magic to the lives of children through innovative new toys, including the revitalization of some of our classic and time honored brands, such as Barbie and Hot Wheels. Last year, as you know, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the world's most iconic doll, and the worlds celebrated with us. This incredible milestone for the Barbie brand allowed us a unique platform to reconnect girls of all ages with the legacy of the brand: Fashion, aspiration and cultural relevance. And we connected with girls beyond the traditional 30-second television spot, Barbie was everywhere. We hosted global events like fashion shows and birthday bashes, made break through partnerships with fashion icons, like Karl Lagerfeld and Christian Louboutin, as well as with specialty retail outlets, like Pottery Barn and Sephora, and talk to girls in their own voice through social media outlets, like FaceBook and Twitter. And the results of all these cultural conversation, I'm proud to say, is that for the first time in years, all three brand-help indicators are headed in the right direction for Barbie. Our U.S. shipments in the retailers are up, retail takeaway is up, share is up. That's the trifecta, Barbie is back. And in 2010, we expect to build on the momentum we created in 2009. I'm also pleased to report growth across much of our portfolio in our Wheels business, both Hot Wheels and Matchbox, experienced strong global performance driven by continued strength in the core product lines, which includes basic cars and track and playsets, as well as key innovations, such as Hot Wheels' Color Shifters and Matchboxes' Rocky The Robot Truck, which was a sellout by the holidays. In our Other Girls business, the Little Mommy large doll line did very well in the holiday season, driven by a successful launch of our innovative Walk & Giggle Doll. As for our Games business, we so growth in core products, like Uno and Apples to Apples, as well as with our adult and family games, like Pictionary and Blokus. But the most exciting news in the Games arena was Mindflex, an early sellout and ultimately, one of the hottest toys of the year. Max Steel also enjoyed another year of record sales as Latin America's number one Boys Action brand. We also experienced success with our partners, with outstanding performance in our Disney Princess line, driven by core dolls, fashions and accessories, including robust sales lately in Europe [ph] that Princess and the Frog line. Disney Pixar's relaunch of the Toy Story franchise in fall 2009 drove performance with our Toy Story line of toys. Additionally, Disney Pixar Cars had another strong year, further establishing it as an evergreen brand. As you're well aware, we were awarded new toy licenses last year that are coming to life in 2010. WWE Wrestling and Heat Entertainment's Thomas and Friends have already hit store shelves, with Disney Pixar's Toy Story 3 hitting in  early summer. And even though 2009 was a year of sacrifice and hard work for Mattel employees, I'm extremely proud that for the third consecutive year, FORTUNE magazine has named Mattel to its 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Think about it, a year with essentially no performance bonus payouts, no merit or promotional salary increases and a significant reduction in force in our employees continue to proclaim their dedication and loyalty to our company. And like me, I know they're really looking forward to seizing the opportunities this year. As I've said throughout the past year, companies that deliver improved execution during the tough times will be the ones best positioned to capitalize on the economic turnaround which will most certainly occur. 2009 was important because it sets the stage for what I'm confident will be a strong year for Mattel in 2010 and for many years to come. And now for the financial review, Kevin?"

As we've consistently said, we entered 2009 with a number of significant headwinds and plan to deliver results based upon realistic revenue assumptions, with our top priorities being to improve profitability, strengthen the balance sheet and increase cash flow. Despite the headwinds that are still challenging us and the industry, I'm pleased to say, we did what we said. We delivered our 2009 priorities with profits and margins up versus last year, with $500 million more cash on hand than last year and finished the year with a stronger balance sheet. As I've done in previous years, I'll first review the results for the fourth quarter before reviewing full year results.

U.S. sales were down 2% while international sales were up 3%, including an eight percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates.

Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales for the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands segment were up 4%, including a six percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide Barbie sales were up 12%, including a six percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Barbie sales in the U.S. were up 9% and Barbie sales in the international markets increased 14%, including a nine percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales for the quarter reflects strong performance in core lines, including Fashionistas and I CAN BE…, as well as hot products like the Camper and Townhouse. Consumer takeaway for Barbie in the U.S. was up double digits for the quarter, as well as full year, leaving U.S. retail inventories clean.Worldwide sales of Other Girls Brands were down 17%, including a five percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. Sales in the U.S. were down 20% while international sales of Other Girls Brands were down 15%, including an eight percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales decrease for the quarter was driven primarily by decline from the sales of High School Musical products. Sales in the Wheels business, which includes Hot Wheels, Speed Racer, Matchbox and Tyco R/C, increased 11% including a five percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales increase for the quarter reflected strong performance in Hot Wheels and Matchbox, partially offset by sales declines in Tyco R/C and Speed Racer product.For core Hot Wheels, which exclude Speed Racer, worldwide sales were up 16%, including a six percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Domestic sales increased 13% and international sales increased 19%, including a 12 percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Sales in our Entertainment business, which includes games and puzzles, were up 2% including a five percentage point positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. For the quarter, excluding the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange, the worldwide sales decrease was driven primarily by lower sales of Radica and toys geared to prior year's three summer movie properties: Batman, Speed Racer and Kung Fu Panda. These declines were partially offset by sales of toys geared to Toy Story and Toy Story 2, solid performance in the Game business, along with the U.S. sales of Cars-related products [ph]. Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Brands were down 3% for the fourth quarter, including a three percentage point positive impact from changes in currency rates.

U.S. sales of Fisher-Price core were down 3% and international sales were up 6%, including a seven percentage point positive impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. The worldwide sales increase for the quarter was driven primarily by double-digit growth in Baby Gear, partially offset by disappointing sales of higher priced point key drivers. Worldwide Fisher-Price Friends sales declined 14%, including a two percentage point positive impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. were down 22% and international sales were down 3%, including a six percentage point positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. The worldwide sales decreased for the quarter primarily reflected the difficult comparison to a successful 2008 performance for Elmo Live and similar products. American Girl Brands. Fourth quarter sales of American Girl Brands were flat, reflecting solid performance in the retail channel, offset by softness in the direct channel primarily driven by a difficult comparison to strong Entertainment-related sales in 2008.I'll now review sales for the full year. Worldwide gross sales were down 9% for the full year, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. U.S. sales are down 4%. International sales were down 13%, including a four percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates.

Worldwide sales for Other Girls Brands were down 20%, which includes a two percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales performance for the full year was driven primarily by declines in sale of High School Musical products.Worldwide sales for the Wheels business were down 7%, which exclude a three percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The decline in worldwide sales reflected lower sales of Speed Racer product and Tyco R/C, partially offset by strong performances in Hot Wheels and Matchbox. For core Hot Wheels, worldwide sales were up 5%, including a three percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Domestic sales increased 17% and international sales declined 3%, including a five percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.Sales in our Entertainment business, which includes Games and Puzzles were down 14%, with a two percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales decrease for the year was driven primarily by lower sales of Radica and toys geared to prior year's three summer movie properties: Batman, Speed Racer and Kung Fu Panda.

U.S. sales declined 18%, while international sales were down 5%, including no impact from changes in foreign exchange.American Girl Brands. Full year sales of American Girl Brands were flat versus the prior year, driven primarily by the November 2008 openings of our two new boutique stores in Boston, Minneapolis, offset by softness, resulting primarily from a difficult comparison to strong Entertainment-related sales in 2008.Now let's review the P&L which is shown on Exhibit 1. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 53.4%, up 740 basis points from 46% for the fourth quarter last year. Gross margin benefited primarily from price increases, savings from our Global Cost Leadership Program, favorable product cost and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.  For the year, gross margin was 50%, up 460 basis points from 45.4% in 2008. Compared with the prior year, gross margin benefited primarily from price increases, savings from our Global Cost Leadership Program, partially offset by foreign exchange. For the fourth quarter, advertising expense was $238.8 million, or 12.2% of net sales, versus 14.2% for the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, advertising expenses was $609.8 million, or 11.2% in net sales, compared to 12.2% last year.For the quarter, selling, general, administrative expenses increased approximately $3.8 million to $388 million. As a percent to net sales, SG&A expense was 19.8% or flat compared with the prior year. The year-to-year dollar increase was primarily driven by higher prudent incentive compensation, partially offset by gross savings before severance of $25 million related to our Global Cost Leadership Program and a $22 million benefit for lower severance charges. SG&A also benefited from the absence of a $15 million legal settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.For the full year, SG&A expense is $1.37 billion, a decrease of $50 million from 2008. As a percent to net sales, SG&A increased by 120 basis points to 25.3%. The dollar decrease in SG&A was primarily driven by incremental year-over-year gross savings before severance of $88 million, related to our Global Cost Leadership Program, a benefit from foreign exchange and $27 million of lower litigation and legal settlement related cost. These savings were partially offset by $81 million of higher incentive compensation expense and $14 million of higher equity compensation expense. For the year, overall equity compensation expense was $50 million compared to $36 million in 2008. For the full year, our Global Cost Leadership Program delivered gross savings before severance of $164 million. The full year gross savings includes about $88 million in SG&A, $62 million in gross margin and $14 million in advertising. With $164 million of gross savings and $32 million of severance charges, we achieved 2009 net savings of $132 million from our Global Cost Leadership Program. As a reminder, in 2008, we had severance charges of about $35 million. We remain on track to deliver accumulative net savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million from this program by the end of 2010.Operating income in the fourth quarter was $417.4 million or 21.3% in net sales, up 930 basis points compared with last year's fourth quarter, due primarily to higher gross margins and lower advertising expenses. For the year, operating income was $731.2 million or 13.5% of net sales, up 430 basis points from the prior year, reflecting higher gross margins and lower advertising expenses, partially offset by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales.For the fourth quarter, interest expense was $19.1 million, down from the prior-year fourth quarter of $28.9 million. For the full year, interest expense decreased from $81.9 million in 2008 to $71.8 million in 2009, due to lower average borrowings and lower average rates. Interest income for the quarter was $600,000 versus $3.2 million in 2008. For the year, interest income decreased from $25 million to $8.1 million, reflecting a lower yield on lower average cash balances through the year.In the fourth quarter, other non-operating expense net was $1.9 million versus income of $19 million in 2008. For the full year, other non-operating expense net was $7.5 million versus income of $3.1 million in 2008. The change in other non-operating income expense relates to foreign currency exchange gains and losses, primarily in Venezuela.The income tax provision for the year was $131.3 million compared to $108.4 million for 2008. The 2009 cash provision includes net benefits related to the prior years of $28.8 million or $0.08 a share, primarily due to reassessments of previously accrued taxes based upon the current status of federal, state and foreign audits. These benefits lowered the full year effective rate by 4.4 percentage points. For the full year 2010, we expect the tax rate to be about 27% based on current tax laws.For the fourth quarter, reported net income of $328.4 million or $0.89 per share versus last year's $176.4 million or $0.49 per share. For the year, reported net income of $538.7 billion or $1.45 per share versus last year's $379.6 million or $1.04 per share. So to summarize the P&L for 2009, the increase in full year net income resulted from higher gross margins, lower advertising expense and lower SG&A cost, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume. Now turning to the cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for the year was $945 million, driven primarily by net income of $529 million and working capital improvements of $261 million. Consistent with 2009 priorities for capital deployment, capital expenditures for the full year where $120.5 million down from last year's $198.8 million. In 2009, we also continued to reward our shareholders with a strong annual cash dividend at $0.75 per share, flat with the prior year.  Year-end cash on hand was $1.1 billion, up from approximately $618 million at the end of 2008, primarily due to strong cash flow generated from operations and disciplined capital deployment. Receivables were $749 million or 35 days of sales outstanding, down six days compared with last year.  Excluding the year-to-year change in factoring, receivables are down $45 million versus prior year, with days sales outstanding down two days versus prior year to 50 days. Inventories of $355.7 million were down $130 million or 27% versus 2008, primarily driven by a tight inventory management given the current economic environment and the lower cost of producing inventory in 2009. Additionally, [indiscernible] suggest retail inventory levels of our products with our major U.S. customers finished the year below prior-year levels.Our total balance sheet debt was $752 million, a decrease of $148 million from the prior year. During 2009, the company paid down $150 million of a maturing long-term debt. Our debt to total capital ratio ended the year at 22.9% versus 29.8% last year.So to summarize, as expected, Mattel experienced overall sales declines in 2009. However, our core brand performed well in terms of consumer takeaway then we executed on the things we control to deliver on our priorities of improving profitability and strengthening the balance sheet. As we've move into 2010, we feel much better about our top line growth prospects due to the benefit of new license entertainment properties we announced last year, a good momentum in our core brand portfolio. But we're also aware of the continuing challenges resulting from economic and employment conditions. In 2009, in terms of profitability, our gross margins rebounded nicely and we delivered as planned on our efficiency initiatives, resulting a return to low teens operating margins. While we are pleased with these results, our long-term performance goals for profitability are unchanged, with an overall operating margin goal of 15% to 20%. So for 2010, our focus will be to build upon our progress towards our profitability goal in the face of what we expect to be a challenging cost environment and a continuation of a difficult economic climate. As you heard from Bob, we believe our disciplined execution of what was a challenge in 2009 has positioned us well for 2010 in many years to come. That completes my review of financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

We'd see the benefits of a strengthening ForEx in the fourth quarter in next year. With regard to the SKU reduction, that was part of the benefit of getting improved margins but it was small, really a part of the Global Cost Leadership Program. If you look at our full year gross margins, they were to 50%, up 460 basis points from 45.4% in 2008. Compared with the prior year, gross margin benefited from price increases and savings from the Global Cost Leadership Program, which was about $62 million benefit for the full year. And only a small part of that benefit really impacted margin this year. We expect more benefits from that in 2010."

So predicting our gross margins is very difficult due to the complexity, all the moving pieces, the lack of transparency and predictability. But looking forward, we'll know we have royalty cost in 2010 due to our new entertainment partnerships, and we'll also -- possible predictable what will happen with commodity and labor markets, we're likely to see year-to-year cost increases. For example, there's been a steady recovery in crude oil price, as the current level about $75 a barrel, compared to $30 to $40 a barrel at this time a year ago. That said, we're going to continue to execute our Global Cost Leadership Program and other cost to manufacturing efficiency programs in 2010, and price our products consistent with making progress against a long-term annual goal of 15% to 20% operating margins."

Obviously, different retailers have different promotional and marketing plans, some focus more heavily on price, others don't. In general, those retailers who didn't focus as aggressively on price, did quite well and picked up some market share. So I think once again, there was evidence that we've now seen year after year, that one can sell toys. It's not a commodity, and it doesn't require huge price reductions to be successful in toys. The second question was about Fisher-Price. Business overall was a little soft last year. And in this case, it was particularly true in our higher-priced drivers. So we have made some adjustments in that line for 2010, both we and our customers are optimistic about the Fisher-Price line for 2010. Baby Gear rebounded a bit in the fourth quarter, that is the non-toy business in Fisher-Price. The Power Wheels and Friends were still soft. So we've got some work to do on Fisher-Price but overall, the sell through was good, and I think we've made the adjustments we need to make for 2010. What was the next question, Tony?"

I don't think it was significantly changed. One retailer has talked about strategically emphasizing food and other sorts of things in its stores, and so there probably was a little bit of contraction there. But I don't know that I could conclude today that there was any big impact from shelf space on the toy business overall. I don't have real good data in front of me. And as it relates to MGA, the Court of Appeal hasn't yet issued any opinion addressing the merits of the case. But it has issued an order staying the equitable relief and that includes the transfer of the Bratz copyrights and the Bratz trademarks to Mattel. So in light of that development, we've put our 2010 Bratz line on hold until we hear further from the court. We do have a great line of dolls. We're confident girls are going to love them. And it's unfortunate we're not going to be able to proceed at this point. We are continuing with the mediation process that we began after the initial verdict and that was ordered as part of the stay execution. And we're preparing intensively for phase two of the trial, which could occur as early as this spring. And overall while we adduced legal expense in total in 2009 and we resolved much of the product recall litigation, we'll continue to make the appropriate level of investments and do the right thing, to defend our brands and our positions [indiscernible] until everything is resolved."

In 2008, $15 million was incurred with a connection with the recall-related multi-state settlement. Going forward, we expect legal fees related to recall-related litigation will be relatively minor given the recent legal settlement for product liability related litigation. As Bob said, we're still in litigation with MGA and incurring legal costs associated with the case being heard by the Court of Appeals. In addition, as Bob said, we're also incurring legal fees and we prepare for Phase II of the MGA trial which could occur as soon as spring of 2010.

There's no question in my mind that the economic conditions overseas have been more challenging, at least on our business compared to the conditions here in the U.S. Throughout the year, we saw some pretty widespread sales declines in all major markets and across all major brands. So it wasn't a product line and a country or two or three or four or even, really made a difference. I think it's reasonable to conclude that there are just more retailers, either unable to buy or unwilling to buy or unable to pay. But all that being said, our international group really did a tremendous job in my mind delivering the P&L and balance sheet in the face of a tough revenue environment. They had solid margin improvement, whether it's gross margin or operating margins. They had tight inventory management and most importantly, they collected the cash. And I would say somewhat encouragingly, we did see a wee bit of sales momentum late in the year that really started with Barbie around the globe. So my view is we're not out of the woods yet, outside of the U.S. But we're clearly in a stronger position now than we were a year ago at the same time."

We finished 2009 with the retail inventories down about 9%. So we've played out about as we expected. When we look at our performance at NPD, the industry as I've said, was down. I think it was some number like eight tenths of a percent, or 1%. We were down a little bit more than despite the fact that we did gain share in dolls and vehicles, in infant, in preschool.

And for kids, there's this Force Flex (sic) [FlexForce] sort of, I think it's called technology where the toy actually does what the character does. And I was reading USA Today last week on an airplane and I was looking once again at the ratings, the top two shows in cable were WWE. So we've got some great properties. We clearly got more entertainment than we've had in the past. But I also have to tell you, our core brands are performing well in the market place. Hot Wheels has been up for several years. I think Matchbox finished its third year of really solid, I think in every case, double-digit POS growth. Fisher-Price is the one where it was a little soft this year and it's really just in the high priced key drivers and we've corrected that.

The devaluation of their currency announced in January 8 did not have a material impact on our results. We also don't expect to have a material impact on our 2010 results because we typically obtain U.S. dollars at the parallel rate. So we continue to manage the risk associated with Venezuelan government and post-currency controls by prices and products based upon the expectations at local currency cost, requiring inventory in the U.S. dollars generally at the parallel rate. So generally, we more or less have been running the business based upon the parallel rate and have the official government rate. And. If we look at next year, there's actually inflationary accounting required in Venezuela and will be considered to be highly inflationary effective January 1, 2010. As a result, they will use to U.S. dollars as functional currency effective January 1, 2010, and local currency monetary assets and liabilities will be re- measured at the end of each reporting period, with the net adjustment being recorded in earnings additionally, Mattel uses the official rate to translate earnings in Venezuela to U.S. dollars in 2009. In 2010, Mattel expects to use the parallel rate to translate earnings. We estimate that Mattel's consolidated net income would have been reduced by less than $10 million in 2010 if we have used the parallel rate in 2009."

And so this year as Kevin's mantra has been all year long, it was about realistic revenue assumptions in light of the economy, and we executed the advertising program almost exactly as we had planned it this year in terms of expenditures. There were some reductions, mostly a couple of things, part of our Global Cost Leadership Program. We consolidated some things and lowered some costs. We're obviously using more of social media, Twitter and FaceBook and those sorts of things, as opposed to television commercials.

I'm pleased with the company's overall performance for the quarter, with worldwide net sales of 12% reflecting good performance in the U.S. as well as international, with continued improvement on gross margin",853,"Thank you, Dianne, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with the company's overall performance for the quarter, with worldwide net sales of 12% reflecting good performance in the U.S. as well as international, with continued improvement on gross margins. That said, the first quarter is just that, the first 90 days of the year, and we still have a lot of work to do to deliver another strong year for our investors. It's nice to be off to a good start with our core brands, as we've successfully transitioned into the new year with the momentum and energy from the fourth quarter. Our core brands, like Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and American Girl, continue to grow. And the newest members of our rich portfolio are performing quite well. As you know, we launched our WWE line of toys on January 1, and it's been very well-received by both collectors and kids, domestically and internationally. The toys are not only available at retail, but are also sold at WWE live events throughout the years. In anticipation for Toy Story 3, Disney relaunched the Toy Story franchise last fall, building to the release of Toy Story 3, which will hit theaters on June 18. While the majority of our Toy Story sales in the first quarter were tied to the overall franchise, we're very excited about the release of the Toy Story 3-specific products, which hit shelves in about two weeks. For those of you who have seen our Toy Story 3 product line, you know that the toy range covers every way to play out the movie. It includes many categories across several of our divisions: Action figures, dolls, plush, vehicles, preschool toys and games. In the preschool aisle, the Thomas and Friends property posted very solid performance, particularly with the Track Master and the die-cast Take-n-Play segments. Not surprisingly, Thomas and Friends is tracking to become the number one brand in the Fisher-Price Brands portfolio. From my perspective, what's most exciting about our newest licensed properties is that we expect them to perform more akin to evergreen toy brands and then one-hit wonders, which should augur well for our business, not only in 2010 but beyond. As some of you may know, the year 2010 is a personal milestone for me. May 17 marks my 10-year anniversary with Mattel. I joined the company during some tough times and in the midst of change. On my first day, I told employees, gathered in the company's cafeteria, that we were going to do three things: Build brands, cut costs and develop people. And we've made good progress on all three fronts. So after 10 years, what I'm asked most often, whether by investors and analysts or employees in the cafeteria is, what's next for Mattel? Let me start with where we've been. In 2000, the senior management team created a vision for the company to be the world's premier toy brands today and tomorrow. This vision has served our company well during the past decade. And every single word has helped guide us to become a more focused and cohesive company, shepherding absolutely stellar brands.Last week, our latest annual report to shareholders was posted on our website for shareholders and other stakeholders. Every year, you may have come to expect a theme or word to drive the year. This year's call to action is ""next"". And in the context of what's next, we challenged our thinking around the vision itself. This year, we're launching a new guiding vision for the company, creating the future of ""play"". At Mattel, we have the imaginations beyond some of the most-recognized and best-loved products around the world. But I'll let you in on a secret: We don't just make toys. We create emotional connections that last a lifetime, by encouraging children to stretch their imaginations, creating joy and allowing children to become washed in play. That's the real value of our toys. That's the value of play. And in keeping with our new vision, we've added new innovation and playfulness to our annual report, through the launch of an interactive video on our corporate website that takes viewers through a dynamic tour of the company and our products.Creating the future of play is evolution. Our goal is to build on the progress we've made and to push ourselves to achieve more. That's consistent with our business goals for 2010, which include: Capitalizing on opportunities to increase revenues; by continuing core brand momentum, while maximizing the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties; maintaining cost and expense controls; and delivering another strong year, profits and cash flow. We believe in the value of play, the possibilities that create some of the joy that it brings. At Mattel, we have the unique opportunity to work at the intersection of what is enduring and what is innovative. When we do this, there are no limits to what we can invent and the joy we can create. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through a financial review of the quarter. Kevin?"

I'll begin my review for the first quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today's press release. Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter were up 12%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. U.S. sales were up 12% and international sales were up 12%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. On a regional basis, sales in Europe were up 9%, including a five-percentage point positive impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were up 10%, including a two-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. And sales in Asia-Pacific were up 32%, including a 16-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. I'll now review our core businesses and brands for the first quarter. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands segment were up 14%, including a four-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales were up 18% and international sales were up 11%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. Worldwide Barbie sales were up 5% compared to last year, including a four-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in international markets were flat, including a five-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, while Barbie's sales in the U.S. was up 13%.Worldwide sales of Other Girls Brands were up 21%, including a six-percentage point positive impact from exchange rates. Sales of the Other Girls Brands in the U.S. were up 44% and international sales were up 6%, including a nine-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Good growth in Disney Princesses was partially offset by declines in High School Musical. Worldwide sales in Wheels increased 3%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales performance reflects good growth in sales of the Hot Wheels, offset by declines in sales of other Wheels products not continuing into 2010. Core Hot Wheels increased 9% worldwide, including a four-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Core Hot Wheels sales increased mid-single digits in the U.S. and were up low single digits internationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide sales in our Entertainment business, which includes Games and Puzzles, were up 35%, including a four-percentage point positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Sales were equally strong in the U.S. and internationally, driven by the addition of new entertainment properties, Worldwide Wrestling and Toy Story, as well as good growth in our core Games business. Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Brands were up 11%, including a two-percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales of Fisher-Price Brands increased 8% and international sales increased 17%, including a six-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide Core Fisher-Price was up 5%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. International sales were up 10%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, and U.S. sales of Fisher-Price Core were up 2%. Fisher-Price Friends worldwide sales increased 44%, including a one-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange rates.International sales were up 58%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, while sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. grew 35%. The growth of Fisher-Price Friends was driven primarily by the addition of products supporting the new Thomas and Friends property, as well as good growth in Disney products. American Girl Brands. Sales of American Girl Brands were up 6% reflecting growth across all key channels, primarily due to strong sales of Lanie, the 2010 Girl of the Year, as well as a slight benefit from an earlier Easter.Now let's review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Gross margin was 49.1% compared to 44% last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower product costs, savings from global cost leadership initiatives and price increases. Given the current commodity and labor cost environment relative to year-ago levels, we expect input cost pressure on our gross margin beginning in the second half of this year. Advertising expense was $94.2 million, or 10.7% of net sales, compared to $84.1 million, or 10.7% of net sales, in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $24.5 million to $292.5 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 33.2% compared to 40.4% last year. The year-to-year improvement primarily reflects $22 million of lower litigation and legal settlement-related costs and savings related to our Global Cost Leadership Program. For the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership Program delivered overall gross savings before severance of about $17 million. The gross savings includes about $5 million in SG&A, $11 million in gross margin and $1 million in advertising. For the quarter, we recorded a severance charge of $2 million, bringing the net savings related to the Global Cost Leadership Program to about $15 million. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million from this program by the end of 2010.Operating income during this quarter was $45.2 million compared to a loss of $55.2 million last year. The year-to-year improvement was due primarily to higher sales, gross margin improvement and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Interest expense of $13.6 million was down from $15.9 million last year, reflected lower average borrowings, as well as lower average interest rates. Interest income was $2.5 million versus $3.5 million last year. The lower interest income was due to lower average investment rates, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances during the quarter. Other non-operating income expense was an expense of $800,000 versus income of $2.1 million in 2009.The current-year expense reflects and relates primarily to foreign currency exchange losses versus foreign currency exchange gains last year. The income tax provision for the quarter was $8.5 million, which translates to an effective rate of 25.4% compared to prior year's benefit of $14.5 million. For the full year 2010, we currently expect the tax rate to be about 24% to 25% based on current tax laws. Overall, we reported net income of $24.8 million, or $0.07 per share, versus last year's net loss of $51 million, or $0.14 per share.Now turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow used for operations for the quarter was $245 million compared to $215 million in the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by the use of cash for seasonal working capital requirements. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $871.9 million, up $467 million from prior year's first quarter, primarily due to higher beginning cash balance of $1.1 billion this year versus $618 million last year.Receivables were $661.9 million, or 68 days of sales outstanding, three days higher than last year. Factoring decreased from $101 million to zero. Prior to factoring, days sales outstanding decreased eight days. During the first quarter of 2010, we made the decision not to factor receivables due to our current cash position and the availability of lower cost-funding alternatives. Inventories at $429.6 million were down $58.3 million or 12% versus 2009. Our total balance sheet debt was $750 million, a decrease of $150 million from the prior year, reflecting the paydown of maturing long-term notes. Our debt-to-total capital ratio ended the quarter at 22.4% versus 30.5% for last year's first quarter. Capital expenditures were $24.2 million, up slightly from last year's $20.1 million.So to summarize, as Bob mentioned, we are pleased with this quarter's results. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and the end of the year to deliver on our priorities of continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintaining cost and expense controls and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow. That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

I think, Tony, you know we've made good progress in rebuilding our gross margins in 2009 with full year gross margins of 50%. And our goal is to sustain gross margins consistent with our long-term goal. And when we look at gross margins for the second half of the year, there's many factors that impact those margins besides input costs, like freight and distribution costs, minimum wage, royalties, foreign exchange, mix and tooling, to name a few. So predicting our gross margin is very difficult due to the complexity of all the moving pieces and lack of transparency and predictability. But we know, looking forward, we have high royalty costs in 2010 due to our new entertainment partnerships. And while it's impossible to predict what will happen with commodity and labor costs, we're already seeing year-to-year cost increases, which would impact our gross margins in the second half of 2010. For example, there's been a steady recovery in crude oil prices, with the current level of $85 a barrel compared with about $40 a barrel this time a year ago. We're also seeing minimum wage and foreign exchange pressures in China. That said, we're going to continue to execute our Global Cost Leadership Programs and other cost and manufacturing efficiency programs in 2010. But we've priced our products consistent with making progress against our long-term annual goal of 15% to 20% of operating margins."

It makes a little bit more difficult to look at the quarter and point of sale. But if you kind of try and normalize for that, as best one can, by looking kind of the point of sale through the most recent weeks, I'd say our point of sale is up sort of low to mid-single digits across the company. And I think there's no question that an important factor in the first quarter's results is the absence of the prior year's inventory depletions. In essence, retailers bought what they sold this year. Last year, they really could support their business without having to buy much from us. So I wouldn't say they're rebuilding inventories. In fact, we're still seeing inventories a bit below the prior year. And I've seen some studies that suggest broadly, and that is not just toys and not just in the U.S, retailers are continuing to focus on reducing inventories. And from everything I read in here, they see this as a sustainable strategy for the foreseeable future. As it relates to international, POS is tracking ahead of our shipments in international. Retailers are continuing to very tightly manage inventories, particularly in markets where economies are struggling more so. We have seen pretty good growth in the first quarter around the globe. We had good performance in Latin America. We had good performance in virtually all of the markets of Asia-Pacific, although that's off of a very small base. And we had pretty solid performance in some of the more mature markets of Western Europe. So this was one of those quarters where we love all our children, whether it's brands or markets, and fortunately they seem to have all done pretty well."

And I think, as we said, the size of the price with regard to SKU reductions is that 30% of our SKUs generate about 1% to 2% of our revenues. And managing a number of SKUs and improving our SKU productivity is a strategic way to cut non-value-added work in the organization. SKU rationalization cuts across the entire value chain. It touches all functions like D&D sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, testing and other supply chain areas. And that rationalization should result in less -- taking out lower tooling spend, less testing, less inventory and lower markdowns. And it's a sustainable advantage to us by managing SKUs because it aligns us well with SKU efficiency focus of our major retailers. We have made progress in 2009 with respect to reduction of SKUs in 2010. We continue to work on SKU reduction in 2011. I think you're going to see more of the benefits from SKU rationalization really in 2011 as we get momentum on this strategic initiative."

In fact, today, kids seem to be playing with our brands in the ages that are inconsistent with kids getting older and younger. They're just playing in a different way.

If you look at that store as how many toys it sells relative to all the toys sold by all the retailers in Shanghai or even in China, it's actually performing quite well. But you still have to think about the future potential of China and the future potential of Barbie in China. And as much as anything else, that store is designed to sort of introduce China to Barbie. Generally speaking, when we're talking about Barbie or talking about all of our brands in China, we're seeing good growth. We didn't grow last year in China as kind of a global economy into as well as it had previously, but we've kind of picked up again this year in virtually all of the emerging economies like China and India. That being said, while the growth rates look really good and it's really impressive when you put the percentage signs next to them, it's off of a very small base. We're making progress, but it's really a long-term strategy, still not material for the company."

And I think Fisher-Price is probably the most shining example of that. There's certainly some areas in core toys that are doing well. But the momentum on Fisher-Price is, right now, more consistent with the fourth quarter or the holiday season in the POS and the Fisher-Price than we expected to be later this year. We've made some changes to the key drivers of the line in terms of the innovations that we have and the price points that we'll be offering.

I'm pleased with the company's overall performance for the quarter, with worldwide net sales of 12% reflecting good performance in the U.S. as well as international, with continued improvement on gross margins. That said, the first quarter is just that, the first 90 days of the year, and we still have a lot of work to do to deliver another strong year for our investors. 
It's nice to be off to a good start with our core brands, as we've successfully transitioned into the new year with the momentum and energy from the fourth quarter. Our core brands, like Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and American Girl, continue to grow. And the newest members of our rich portfolio are performing quite well. As you know, we launched our WWE line of toys on January 1, and it's been very well-received by both collectors and kids, domestically and internationally. The toys are not only available at retail, but are also sold at WWE live events throughout the years. 
In anticipation for Toy Story 3, Disney relaunched the Toy Story franchise last fall, building to the release of Toy Story 3, which will hit theaters on June 18. While the majority of our Toy Story sales in the first quarter were tied to the overall franchise, we're very excited about the release of the Toy Story 3-specific products, which hit shelves in about two weeks. For those of you who have seen our Toy Story 3 product line, you know that the toy range covers every way to play out the movie. It includes many categories across several of our divisions: Action figures, dolls, plush, vehicles, preschool toys and games. 
In the preschool aisle, the Thomas and Friends property posted very solid performance, particularly with the Track Master and the die-cast Take-n-Play segments. Not surprisingly, Thomas and Friends is tracking to become the number one brand in the Fisher-Price Brands portfolio. From my perspective, what's most exciting about our newest licensed properties is that we expect them to perform more akin to evergreen toy brands and then one-hit wonders, which should augur well for our business, not only in 2010 but beyond. 
As some of you may know, the year 2010 is a personal milestone for me. May 17 marks my 10-year anniversary with Mattel. I joined the company during some tough times and in the midst of change. On my first day, I told employees, gathered in the company's cafeteria, that we were going to do three things: Build brands, cut costs and develop people. And we've made good progress on all three fronts. So after 10 years, what I'm asked most often, whether by investors and analysts or employees in the cafeteria is, what's next for Mattel? Let me start with where we've been. 
In 2000, the senior management team created a vision for the company to be the world's premier toy brands today and tomorrow. This vision has served our company well during the past decade. And every single word has helped guide us to become a more focused and cohesive company, shepherding absolutely stellar brands.
Last week, our latest annual report to shareholders was posted on our website for shareholders and other stakeholders. Every year, you may have come to expect a theme or word to drive the year. This year's call to action is ""next"". And in the context of what's next, we challenged our thinking around the vision itself. This year, we're launching a new guiding vision for the company, creating the future of ""play"". 
At Mattel, we have the imaginations beyond some of the most-recognized and best-loved products around the world. But I'll let you in on a secret: We don't just make toys. We create emotional connections that last a lifetime, by encouraging children to stretch their imaginations, creating joy and allowing children to become washed in play. That's the real value of our toys. That's the value of play. And in keeping with our new vision, we've added new innovation and playfulness to our annual report, through the launch of an interactive video on our corporate website that takes viewers through a dynamic tour of the company and our products.
Creating the future of play is evolution. Our goal is to build on the progress we've made and to push ourselves to achieve more. That's consistent with our business goals for 2010, which include: Capitalizing on opportunities to increase revenues; by continuing core brand momentum, while maximizing the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties; maintaining cost and expense controls; and delivering another strong year, profits and cash flow. 
We believe in the value of play, the possibilities that create some of the joy that it brings. At Mattel, we have the unique opportunity to work at the intersection of what is enduring and what is innovative. When we do this, there are no limits to what we can invent and the joy we can create. 
Thank you. At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through a financial review of the quarter. Kevin?"

I'll begin my review for the first quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today's press release. Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter were up 12%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. U.S. sales were up 12% and international sales were up 12%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. 
On a regional basis, sales in Europe were up 9%, including a five-percentage point positive impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were up 10%, including a two-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. And sales in Asia-Pacific were up 32%, including a 16-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. I'll now review our core businesses and brands for the first quarter. 
Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands segment were up 14%, including a four-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales were up 18% and international sales were up 11%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. 
Worldwide Barbie sales were up 5% compared to last year, including a four-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in international markets were flat, including a five-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, while Barbie's sales in the U.S. was up 13%.
Worldwide sales of Other Girls Brands were up 21%, including a six-percentage point positive impact from exchange rates. Sales of the Other Girls Brands in the U.S. were up 44% and international sales were up 6%, including a nine-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Good growth in Disney Princesses was partially offset by declines in High School Musical. 
Worldwide sales in Wheels increased 3%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales performance reflects good growth in sales of the Hot Wheels, offset by declines in sales of other Wheels products not continuing into 2010. Core Hot Wheels increased 9% worldwide, including a four-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Core Hot Wheels sales increased mid-single digits in the U.S. and were up low single digits internationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales in our Entertainment business, which includes Games and Puzzles, were up 35%, including a four-percentage point positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Sales were equally strong in the U.S. and internationally, driven by the addition of new entertainment properties, Worldwide Wrestling and Toy Story, as well as good growth in our core Games business. 
Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Brands were up 11%, including a two-percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales of Fisher-Price Brands increased 8% and international sales increased 17%, including a six-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide Core Fisher-Price was up 5%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. International sales were up 10%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, and U.S. sales of Fisher-Price Core were up 2%. Fisher-Price Friends worldwide sales increased 44%, including a one-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange rates.
International sales were up 58%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, while sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. grew 35%. The growth of Fisher-Price Friends was driven primarily by the addition of products supporting the new Thomas and Friends property, as well as good growth in Disney products. 
American Girl Brands. Sales of American Girl Brands were up 6% reflecting growth across all key channels, primarily due to strong sales of Lanie, the 2010 Girl of the Year, as well as a slight benefit from an earlier Easter.
Now let's review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Gross margin was 49.1% compared to 44% last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower product costs, savings from global cost leadership initiatives and price increases. Given the current commodity and labor cost environment relative to year-ago levels, we expect input cost pressure on our gross margin beginning in the second half of this year. 
Advertising expense was $94.2 million, or 10.7% of net sales, compared to $84.1 million, or 10.7% of net sales, in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $24.5 million to $292.5 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 33.2% compared to 40.4% last year. The year-to-year improvement primarily reflects $22 million of lower litigation and legal settlement-related costs and savings related to our Global Cost Leadership Program. 
For the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership Program delivered overall gross savings before severance of about $17 million. The gross savings includes about $5 million in SG&A, $11 million in gross margin and $1 million in advertising. For the quarter, we recorded a severance charge of $2 million, bringing the net savings related to the Global Cost Leadership Program to about $15 million. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million from this program by the end of 2010.
Operating income during this quarter was $45.2 million compared to a loss of $55.2 million last year. The year-to-year improvement was due primarily to higher sales, gross margin improvement and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Interest expense of $13.6 million was down from $15.9 million last year, reflected lower average borrowings, as well as lower average interest rates. 
Interest income was $2.5 million versus $3.5 million last year. The lower interest income was due to lower average investment rates, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances during the quarter. Other non-operating income expense was an expense of $800,000 versus income of $2.1 million in 2009.
The current-year expense reflects and relates primarily to foreign currency exchange losses versus foreign currency exchange gains last year. The income tax provision for the quarter was $8.5 million, which translates to an effective rate of 25.4% compared to prior year's benefit of $14.5 million. For the full year 2010, we currently expect the tax rate to be about 24% to 25% based on current tax laws. Overall, we reported net income of $24.8 million, or $0.07 per share, versus last year's net loss of $51 million, or $0.14 per share.
Now turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow used for operations for the quarter was $245 million compared to $215 million in the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by the use of cash for seasonal working capital requirements. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $871.9 million, up $467 million from prior year's first quarter, primarily due to higher beginning cash balance of $1.1 billion this year versus $618 million last year.
Receivables were $661.9 million, or 68 days of sales outstanding, three days higher than last year. Factoring decreased from $101 million to zero. Prior to factoring, days sales outstanding decreased eight days. During the first quarter of 2010, we made the decision not to factor receivables due to our current cash position and the availability of lower cost-funding alternatives. 
Inventories at $429.6 million were down $58.3 million or 12% versus 2009. Our total balance sheet debt was $750 million, a decrease of $150 million from the prior year, reflecting the paydown of maturing long-term notes. Our debt-to-total capital ratio ended the quarter at 22.4% versus 30.5% for last year's first quarter. Capital expenditures were $24.2 million, up slightly from last year's $20.1 million.
So to summarize, as Bob mentioned, we are pleased with this quarter's results. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and the end of the year to deliver on our priorities of continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintaining cost and expense controls and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow. That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

I think, Tony, you know we've made good progress in rebuilding our gross margins in 2009 with full year gross margins of 50%. And our goal is to sustain gross margins consistent with our long-term goal. And when we look at gross margins for the second half of the year, there's many factors that impact those margins besides input costs, like freight and distribution costs, minimum wage, royalties, foreign exchange, mix and tooling, to name a few. So predicting our gross margin is very difficult due to the complexity of all the moving pieces and lack of transparency and predictability. But we know, looking forward, we have high royalty costs in 2010 due to our new entertainment partnerships. And while it's impossible to predict what will happen with commodity and labor costs, we're already seeing year-to-year cost increases, which would impact our gross margins in the second half of 2010. For example, there's been a steady recovery in crude oil prices, with the current level of $85 a barrel compared with about $40 a barrel this time a year ago. We're also seeing minimum wage and foreign exchange pressures in China. That said, we're going to continue to execute our Global Cost Leadership Programs and other cost and manufacturing efficiency programs in 2010. But we've priced our products consistent with making progress against our long-term annual goal of 15% to 20% of operating margins."

It makes a little bit more difficult to look at the quarter end point of sale. But if you kind of try and normalize for that, as best one can, by looking kind of the point of sale through the most recent weeks, I'd say our point of sale is up sort of low to mid-single digits across the company. And I think there's no question that an important factor in the first quarter's results is the absence of the prior year's inventory depletions. In essence, retailers bought what they sold this year. Last year, they really could support their business without having to buy much from us. So I wouldn't say they're rebuilding inventories. In fact, we're still seeing inventories a bit below the prior year. And I've seen some studies that suggest broadly, and that is not just toys and not just in the U.S, retailers are continuing to focus on reducing inventories. And from everything I read in here, they see this as a sustainable strategy for the foreseeable future. As it relates to international, POS is tracking ahead of our shipments in international. Retailers are continuing to very tightly manage inventories, particularly in markets where economies are struggling more so. We have seen pretty good growth in the first quarter around the globe. We had good performance in Latin America. We had good performance in virtually all of the markets of Asia-Pacific, although that's off of a very small base. And we had pretty solid performance in some of the more mature markets of Western Europe. So this was one of those quarters where we love all our children, whether it's brands or markets, and fortunately they seem to have all done pretty well."

And I think, as we said, the size of the price with regard to SKU reductions is that 30% of our SKUs generate about 1% to 2% of our revenues. And managing a number of SKUs and improving our SKU productivity is a strategic way to cut non-value-added work in the organization. SKU rationalization cuts across the entire value chain. It touches all functions like D&D sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, testing and other supply chain areas. And that rationalization should result in less -- taking out lower tooling spend, less testing, less inventory and lower markdowns. And it's a sustainable advantage to us by managing SKUs because it aligns us well with SKU efficiency focus of our major retailers. We have made progress in 2009 with respect to reduction of SKUs in 2010. We continue to work on SKU reduction in 2011. I think you're going to see more of the benefits from SKU rationalization really in 2011 as we get momentum on this strategic initiative."

POS is increasing, even when we compare it to last year's 50th birthday celebration of Barbie. The I Can Be... segment is performing particularly well.

Our Barbie Basics are doing well, that's the Little Black Dress line right now. So I think there's no question that Barbie is gaining share and continues to have a good momentum. And beyond Barbie, Disney Princesses is doing very well, both in the U.S. and abroad. We've had good success with the Princess and the Frog line. The DVD was released just a couple of weeks ago. And I think Disney Princesses is going to do well all year, particularly as we approach the fall movie, Tangled, which is the Rapunzel story. And that -- probably the offset there, to some degree, is High School Musical. But the momentum we have on Disney Princesses was pretty solid."

Our operations and supply chain really haven't been materially affected by what's going on over there. And in history, at least in the 10 years since I have been here, there's usually one or two places that are of concern from a supply-chain standpoint, and we're not solely dependent on one area of the world. So even if we run into hiccups, we generally have an ability to overcome those, and I would say the situation in Thailand is consistent with that right now. As you think about the company going forward, I really think over the last decade, we've been very focused and very disciplined, and it has served us well. We have built shareholder value. We look at the benchmarks and what's happened over the past 10 years, and I'm generally pleased with the progress we've made. As we think about the company going forward, one of the points I wanted to make in the opening comments is, it is evolution, not revolution. But we think there's a lot of potential in value and thinking more about play. Toys are certainly an important component of play. And I think 10 years from now, if all goes well, we're going to continue being the leading toy company in the world. But we see avenues for growth in the years ahead beyond just traditional toy play. As an example, we're doing a lot of work right now in the digital space. And we know kids are playing digitally and they're playing with our brands digitally, and they're staying in the marketplace longer than they used to. I remember kids [ph] (59:50) in 2000, I remember talking about kids getting older and younger, and a lot of us seemed focused on that phenomenon. In fact, today, kids seem to be playing with our brands in the ages that are inconsistent with kids getting older and younger. They're just playing in a different way. And we have to figure that all out, we have to figure out how to generate revenues out of that and how to make money in that. But I think that's one example of a new avenue of growth for the company, and hopefully, profitable growth when we think about the years to come."

Additionally, in the first quarter of 2009, we recorded $21 million in charges related to a legal settlement for product liability-related litigation. The good news is, going forward, we expect legal fees related to recall-related litigation to be relatively minor, given the recent legal settlement for product liability litigation. And as Bob said, and as you know, we're still in litigation with MGA and the current legal costs associated with the case being reviewed by the Court of Appeals. In addition, we're also incurring legal fees as we prepare for the next MGA trial, which could occur in 2010.

I'm pleased with the company's overall performance for the quarter, with worldwide net sales of 12% reflecting good performance in the U.S. as well as international, with continued improvement on gross margin",855,"Thank you, Dianne, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with the company's overall performance for the quarter, with worldwide net sales of 12% reflecting good performance in the U.S. as well as international, with continued improvement on gross margins. That said, the first quarter is just that, the first 90 days of the year, and we still have a lot of work to do to deliver another strong year for our investors. 
It's nice to be off to a good start with our core brands, as we've successfully transitioned into the new year with the momentum and energy from the fourth quarter. Our core brands, like Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and American Girl, continue to grow. And the newest members of our rich portfolio are performing quite well. As you know, we launched our WWE line of toys on January 1, and it's been very well-received by both collectors and kids, domestically and internationally. The toys are not only available at retail, but are also sold at WWE live events throughout the years. 
In anticipation for Toy Story 3, Disney relaunched the Toy Story franchise last fall, building to the release of Toy Story 3, which will hit theaters on June 18. While the majority of our Toy Story sales in the first quarter were tied to the overall franchise, we're very excited about the release of the Toy Story 3-specific products, which hit shelves in about two weeks. For those of you who have seen our Toy Story 3 product line, you know that the toy range covers every way to play out the movie. It includes many categories across several of our divisions: Action figures, dolls, plush, vehicles, preschool toys and games. 
In the preschool aisle, the Thomas and Friends property posted very solid performance, particularly with the Track Master and the die-cast Take-n-Play segments. Not surprisingly, Thomas and Friends is tracking to become the number one brand in the Fisher-Price Brands portfolio. From my perspective, what's most exciting about our newest licensed properties is that we expect them to perform more akin to evergreen toy brands and then one-hit wonders, which should augur well for our business, not only in 2010 but beyond. 
As some of you may know, the year 2010 is a personal milestone for me. May 17 marks my 10-year anniversary with Mattel. I joined the company during some tough times and in the midst of change. On my first day, I told employees, gathered in the company's cafeteria, that we were going to do three things: Build brands, cut costs and develop people. And we've made good progress on all three fronts. So after 10 years, what I'm asked most often, whether by investors and analysts or employees in the cafeteria is, what's next for Mattel? Let me start with where we've been. 
In 2000, the senior management team created a vision for the company to be the world's premier toy brands today and tomorrow. This vision has served our company well during the past decade. And every single word has helped guide us to become a more focused and cohesive company, shepherding absolutely stellar brands.
Last week, our latest annual report to shareholders was posted on our website for shareholders and other stakeholders. Every year, you may have come to expect a theme or word to drive the year. This year's call to action is ""next"". And in the context of what's next, we challenged our thinking around the vision itself. This year, we're launching a new guiding vision for the company, creating the future of ""play"". 
At Mattel, we have the imaginations beyond some of the most-recognized and best-loved products around the world. But I'll let you in on a secret: We don't just make toys. We create emotional connections that last a lifetime, by encouraging children to stretch their imaginations, creating joy and allowing children to become washed in play. That's the real value of our toys. That's the value of play. And in keeping with our new vision, we've added new innovation and playfulness to our annual report, through the launch of an interactive video on our corporate website that takes viewers through a dynamic tour of the company and our products.
Creating the future of play is evolution. Our goal is to build on the progress we've made and to push ourselves to achieve more. That's consistent with our business goals for 2010, which include: Capitalizing on opportunities to increase revenues; by continuing core brand momentum, while maximizing the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties; maintaining cost and expense controls; and delivering another strong year, profits and cash flow. 
We believe in the value of play, the possibilities that create some of the joy that it brings. At Mattel, we have the unique opportunity to work at the intersection of what is enduring and what is innovative. When we do this, there are no limits to what we can invent and the joy we can create. 
Thank you. At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through a financial review of the quarter. Kevin?"

I'll begin my review for the first quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today's press release. Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter were up 12%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. U.S. sales were up 12% and international sales were up 12%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. 
On a regional basis, sales in Europe were up 9%, including a five-percentage point positive impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were up 10%, including a two-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. And sales in Asia-Pacific were up 32%, including a 16-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. I'll now review our core businesses and brands for the first quarter. 
Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands segment were up 14%, including a four-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales were up 18% and international sales were up 11%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. 
Worldwide Barbie sales were up 5% compared to last year, including a four-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in international markets were flat, including a five-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, while Barbie's sales in the U.S. was up 13%.
Worldwide sales of Other Girls Brands were up 21%, including a six-percentage point positive impact from exchange rates. Sales of the Other Girls Brands in the U.S. were up 44% and international sales were up 6%, including a nine-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Good growth in Disney Princesses was partially offset by declines in High School Musical. 
Worldwide sales in Wheels increased 3%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The worldwide sales performance reflects good growth in sales of the Hot Wheels, offset by declines in sales of other Wheels products not continuing into 2010. Core Hot Wheels increased 9% worldwide, including a four-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. Core Hot Wheels sales increased mid-single digits in the U.S. and were up low single digits internationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales in our Entertainment business, which includes Games and Puzzles, were up 35%, including a four-percentage point positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Sales were equally strong in the U.S. and internationally, driven by the addition of new entertainment properties, Worldwide Wrestling and Toy Story, as well as good growth in our core Games business. 
Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Brands were up 11%, including a two-percentage point positive impact from changes in currency exchange rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales of Fisher-Price Brands increased 8% and international sales increased 17%, including a six-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide Core Fisher-Price was up 5%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. International sales were up 10%, including a seven-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, and U.S. sales of Fisher-Price Core were up 2%. Fisher-Price Friends worldwide sales increased 44%, including a one-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange rates.
International sales were up 58%, including a three-percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange, while sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. grew 35%. The growth of Fisher-Price Friends was driven primarily by the addition of products supporting the new Thomas and Friends property, as well as good growth in Disney products. 
American Girl Brands. Sales of American Girl Brands were up 6% reflecting growth across all key channels, primarily due to strong sales of Lanie, the 2010 Girl of the Year, as well as a slight benefit from an earlier Easter.
Now let's review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Gross margin was 49.1% compared to 44% last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower product costs, savings from global cost leadership initiatives and price increases. Given the current commodity and labor cost environment relative to year-ago levels, we expect input cost pressure on our gross margin beginning in the second half of this year. 
Advertising expense was $94.2 million, or 10.7% of net sales, compared to $84.1 million, or 10.7% of net sales, in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $24.5 million to $292.5 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 33.2% compared to 40.4% last year. The year-to-year improvement primarily reflects $22 million of lower litigation and legal settlement-related costs and savings related to our Global Cost Leadership Program. 
For the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership Program delivered overall gross savings before severance of about $17 million. The gross savings includes about $5 million in SG&A, $11 million in gross margin and $1 million in advertising. For the quarter, we recorded a severance charge of $2 million, bringing the net savings related to the Global Cost Leadership Program to about $15 million. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million from this program by the end of 2010.
Operating income during this quarter was $45.2 million compared to a loss of $55.2 million last year. The year-to-year improvement was due primarily to higher sales, gross margin improvement and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Interest expense of $13.6 million was down from $15.9 million last year, reflected lower average borrowings, as well as lower average interest rates. 
Interest income was $2.5 million versus $3.5 million last year. The lower interest income was due to lower average investment rates, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances during the quarter. Other non-operating income expense was an expense of $800,000 versus income of $2.1 million in 2009.
The current-year expense reflects and relates primarily to foreign currency exchange losses versus foreign currency exchange gains last year. The income tax provision for the quarter was $8.5 million, which translates to an effective rate of 25.4% compared to prior year's benefit of $14.5 million. For the full year 2010, we currently expect the tax rate to be about 24% to 25% based on current tax laws. Overall, we reported net income of $24.8 million, or $0.07 per share, versus last year's net loss of $51 million, or $0.14 per share.
Now turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow used for operations for the quarter was $245 million compared to $215 million in the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by the use of cash for seasonal working capital requirements. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $871.9 million, up $467 million from prior year's first quarter, primarily due to higher beginning cash balance of $1.1 billion this year versus $618 million last year.
Receivables were $661.9 million, or 68 days of sales outstanding, three days higher than last year. Factoring decreased from $101 million to zero. Prior to factoring, days sales outstanding decreased eight days. During the first quarter of 2010, we made the decision not to factor receivables due to our current cash position and the availability of lower cost-funding alternatives. 
Inventories at $429.6 million were down $58.3 million or 12% versus 2009. Our total balance sheet debt was $750 million, a decrease of $150 million from the prior year, reflecting the paydown of maturing long-term notes. Our debt-to-total capital ratio ended the quarter at 22.4% versus 30.5% for last year's first quarter. Capital expenditures were $24.2 million, up slightly from last year's $20.1 million.
So to summarize, as Bob mentioned, we are pleased with this quarter's results. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and the end of the year to deliver on our priorities of continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintaining cost and expense controls and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow. That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

I think, Tony, you know we've made good progress in rebuilding our gross margins in 2009 with full year gross margins of 50%. And our goal is to sustain gross margins consistent with our long-term goal. And when we look at gross margins for the second half of the year, there's many factors that impact those margins besides input costs, like freight and distribution costs, minimum wage, royalties, foreign exchange, mix and tooling, to name a few. So predicting our gross margin is very difficult due to the complexity of all the moving pieces and lack of transparency and predictability. But we know, looking forward, we have high royalty costs in 2010 due to our new entertainment partnerships. And while it's impossible to predict what will happen with commodity and labor costs, we're already seeing year-to-year cost increases, which would impact our gross margins in the second half of 2010. For example, there's been a steady recovery in crude oil prices, with the current level of $85 a barrel compared with about $40 a barrel this time a year ago. We're also seeing minimum wage and foreign exchange pressures in China. That said, we're going to continue to execute our Global Cost Leadership Programs and other cost and manufacturing efficiency programs in 2010. But we've priced our products consistent with making progress against our long-term annual goal of 15% to 20% of operating margins."

It makes a little bit more difficult to look at the quarter end point of sale. But if you kind of try and normalize for that, as best one can, by looking kind of the point of sale through the most recent weeks, I'd say our point of sale is up sort of low to mid-single digits across the company. And I think there's no question that an important factor in the first quarter's results is the absence of the prior year's inventory depletions. In essence, retailers bought what they sold this year. Last year, they really could support their business without having to buy much from us. So I wouldn't say they're rebuilding inventories. In fact, we're still seeing inventories a bit below the prior year. And I've seen some studies that suggest broadly, and that is not just toys and not just in the U.S, retailers are continuing to focus on reducing inventories. And from everything I read in here, they see this as a sustainable strategy for the foreseeable future. As it relates to international, POS is tracking ahead of our shipments in international. Retailers are continuing to very tightly manage inventories, particularly in markets where economies are struggling more so. We have seen pretty good growth in the first quarter around the globe. We had good performance in Latin America. We had good performance in virtually all of the markets of Asia-Pacific, although that's off of a very small base. And we had pretty solid performance in some of the more mature markets of Western Europe. So this was one of those quarters where we love all our children, whether it's brands or markets, and fortunately they seem to have all done pretty well."

And I think, as we said, the size of the price with regard to SKU reductions is that 30% of our SKUs generate about 1% to 2% of our revenues. And managing a number of SKUs and improving our SKU productivity is a strategic way to cut non-value-added work in the organization. SKU rationalization cuts across the entire value chain. It touches all functions like D&D sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, testing and other supply chain areas. And that rationalization should result in less -- taking out lower tooling spend, less testing, less inventory and lower markdowns. And it's a sustainable advantage to us by managing SKUs because it aligns us well with SKU efficiency focus of our major retailers. We have made progress in 2009 with respect to reduction of SKUs in 2010. We continue to work on SKU reduction in 2011. I think you're going to see more of the benefits from SKU rationalization really in 2011 as we get momentum on this strategic initiative."

Last year, in the first quarter, retailers didn't need to buy that much from us in order to support the POS that they had. This year, they had to do that. And I think Fisher-Price is probably the most shining example of that. There's certainly some areas in core toys that are doing well. But the momentum on Fisher-Price is, right now, more consistent with the fourth quarter or the holiday season in the POS and the Fisher-Price than we expected to be later this year. We've made some changes to the key drivers of the line in terms of the innovations that we have and the price points that we'll be offering. So I think, right now, the Fisher-Price success from the first quarter is really more related to what retailers needed to do than the POS trends."

And while reports",806,"Thank you, Dianne. And good morning, everyone. What a difference a year makes! Last year at this time, Mattel, along with many other consumer goods companies and retailers, was lamenting how much further the economy was going to decline. And while reports remain mixed on whether or not we are out of the woods, I can tell you that I’m very pleased with the company’s performance for the quarter with worldwide net sales up 13%, reflecting good performance in the US as well as internationally, and continued improvement in our profit margins.
Our positive top-line sales trend in this quarter in both the US and abroad benefited from our newest entertainment properties, Toy Story 3, World Wrestling Entertainment, and Thomas and Friends, as well as solid growth from core brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels. As it relates to Barbie, the core fashion, beach and accessory product lines continue to perform well. In our spring entertainment offering, Barbie in Mermaid Tale nicely outperformed last year’s movie.
Our I Can Be line, driven by a very strong spring promotional program, continues to perform well at retail. And I’m proud to report that the Barbie leadership team hasn’t missed a beat and is continuing to drive the brand to deliver on fashion, aspiration and cultural relevance. I know there is a lot of interest in the watch of our Monster High franchise, which has just begun.
We know girls are becoming engaged with the brand as evidenced by the millions of Monster High episodes downloaded in the website. The Justice apparel program is just rolling out to more than 900 stores nationwide, and the Monsters will be taking over YouTube’s home page this summer with an all new Monster High music video.
Toy advertising begins around the back-to-school timeframe, which also coincides with sales of the first Little, Brown hardback chapter book, which hits retail in September. In the Wheels item, Hot Wheels performance has been solid, driven by both core play with basic tires and track sets, as well as the feature product lines like Custom Motors and Color Shifters.
And we are excited about the Matchbox launch and Stinky the Garbage Truck, following on the successful launch of Rocky the Robot Truck last year. These characters are now part of the new Big Rig Buddies line, which we are introducing to kids this fall via CGI animated episodes being packed with the products.
And of course, there is the incredible success of this year’s summer movie, Toy Story 3. Not surprisingly, our Toy Story 3 lines are selling well across all businesses, including infant and preschool, action figures, collectibles, play sets, vehicles, roll play, Barbie and Ken dolls and games. And now that Spain has taken home the World Cup title, the movie will be hitting theaters in the European markets.
The World Wrestling, WWE sales continue to be strong, driven not only by our core line that appeals to collectors, but by the Flexforce toys, which are more kid-focused and feature driven. As I said before, what’s most exciting about our newest license properties is that we expect them to perform more akin to evergreen toy brands than one hit wonders, which charter well for our business not only in 2010, but beyond.
In the infant and preschool, our Fisher-Price Friends business performed quite well, with Dora the Explorer rebounding nicely, and of course the addition of Thomas and Friends. We are also looking forward to Dora’s ten-year anniversary, which Nickelodeon is kicking off this fall.
This summer American Girl will launch the Shine On Now program, a new charitable initiative that harnesses the collective power of girls to help others in need. To further encourage and inspire girls, American Girl is also launching a brand new virtual campus, Innerstar University of fun, safe website for girls, access to the new virtual world that comes with each 18-inch My American Girl doll, the company’s newly enhanced contemporary product line, which is currently available.
From our Time Warner brands to our newest entertainment partners, I’m encouraged by the strong momentum in the first half of the year, as we begin to come down to the all important holiday season. We remain committed to maximizing long-term value for our shareholders. As you know, we are focused on controlling costs and effectively deploying capital.
Over the last seven years, we have repurchased about 114 million shares of our stock at a total cost of $2.2 billion, including repurchasing about 5 million shares this quarter, and distributed $1.6 billion in dividends. Effective capital deployment combined with solid top-line growth and improving margins will allow us to win the marketplace and for our shareholders.
At this time, I’d like to introduce Mattel’s Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through the financial review of the quarter. Kevin?

I will begin my review for the second quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today’s press release. Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter were up 13%, including a 3 percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. US sales were up 17% and international sales were up 9%, including a 5 percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange.
On a regional basis, sales in Europe were up 7%, including a 7 percentage point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were up 1%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Sales in Asia Pacific were up 28%, including a 6 percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates.
Worldwide Barbie sales were up 6%, including a 4 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in the US were up 16%, while Barbie sales in the international markets were up 1%, including a 6 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide sales in the Other Girls brands were up 3%, including a 3 percentage point negative impact from exchange rates.
Continued good growth in Disney Princess was partially offset by international declines in High School Musical, Hanna Montana, and Polly Pocket. The sales of Other Girls brands in the US were up 15% and international sales were down 7%, including a 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide sales in Wheels increased 5%, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The growth in Wheels was led by strong worldwide sales of Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels increased 11% worldwide, including zero impact from foreign exchange. Hot Wheels sales increased 19% in the US and were up 5% internationally, including a 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide sales in our entertainment business, which included games and puzzles, were up 60%, including a 5 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. Sales were up 90% in the US and up 40% internationally, including an 8 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. Sales increases were primarily driven by our new Toy Story 3 products and continued momentum from other new entertainer properties, WWE Wrestling, as well as good growth in our core games business.
Fisher-Price brands. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were up 4%, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in currency rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales in Fisher-Price brands increased 4% and international sales increased 5%, including a 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide core Fisher-Price was flat, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. International sales were up 1%, including a 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. And US sales of Fisher-Price core were down 1%.
Fisher-Price Friends worldwide sales increased 35%, including a 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange rates. International sales were up 25%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange while sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the US were up 45%. The growth in Fisher-Price Friends was driven primarily by the addition of products supporting the new Thomas and Friends property as well as growth in Dora the Explorer and Disney products.
American Girl brands. Sales of American Girl brands were down 4%, primarily the result of last year’s second quarter launch of Rebecca and a slightly earlier Easter this year, partially offset by continued strong sales of Laney, the 2010 Girl of the Year, and good performance from our new Denver store.
Now let’s review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Gross margin was 48.1% compared to 45.2% last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower product costs, price increases, and savings from our Global Cost Leadership initiatives, partially offset by higher royalties. We continue to expect input cost pressures in our gross margin beginning in the second half of this year, given the current commodity and labor cost environments relative to year-ago levels.
Advertising expense was $101.9 million or 10% of net sales compared to $89.8 million or 10% of net sales in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $34.5 million to $318.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 31.3% compared to 31.6% last year.
The year-to-year dollar increase primarily reflects increased legal-related costs and employee-related related costs including incentive accruals and merit increases, as well as severance costs, partially offset by savings related to our Global Cost Leadership program. For the first half of the year, SG&A expenses were up $10 million or 2% and represent 32.2% of net sales compared with 35.7% for the first half of 2009.
For the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership program delivered overall gross savings before severance of about $12 million. The gross savings includes about $4 million in SG&A, $5 million in gross margin, and $3 million in advertising. For the quarter, we recorded severance charges of $9 million. The net year-over-year incremental savings related to Global Cost Leadership program is about $3 million for the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net savings at the high end of the target range for the program of $180 million to $200 million by the end of 2010.
Operating income during the quarter was $69.4 million compared to $32.5 million in 2009. The year-to-year improvement was primarily due to higher sales and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A and advertising expense. Interest expense of $13.4 million was down from $17.5 million last year, reflecting lower average borrowings as well as lower average interest rates. Interest income was $2.8 million versus $2.5 million last year. The higher interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances during the quarter.
Other non-operating income expense was $3.3 million during the quarter versus $6.3 million in 2009. The income in both periods relates primarily to foreign currency exchange gains. The quarter’s income tax provision of $10.5 million includes discrete tax benefits of $4.6 million. This compares to prior year’s provision of $2.3 million, which included discrete tax benefits of $2.5 million. For the year, we continue to expect the worldwide effective tax rate to be about 24% to 25% based on current tax laws. Overall, we reported net income of $51.6 million or $0.14 per share versus last year’s net income of $21.5 million or $0.06 per share.
Now turning to cash flow and balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow used for operations was $372 million compared to $350 million in the first half of 2009. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $545 million, up $122 million from prior year. The increase in cash is primarily due to higher beginning cash balances of $1.1 billion this year versus $618 million last year, partially offset primarily by a lack of short-term borrowings and capital deployment.
During the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 5 million of its shares of common stock at an average price of $22.05 per share for a total cost of approximately $111 million. I’m pleased with our management of working capital, especially in light of 13% growth in the business.
Receivables were $805 million or 71 days of sales outstanding, four days lower than last year. Factoring decreased from $81 million to zero. Prior to factoring, days of sales outstanding decreased 12 days. During the first half of 2010, we made the decision not to factor receivables due to our current cash position and the availability of lower cost funding alternatives.
Inventories at $598 million were up $8 million or 1% versus 2009. Our total balance sheet debt was $710 million, a decrease of $344 million from the prior year, reflecting the lack of short-term borrowings and the pay-down of maturing long-term notes. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio ended the quarter at 22.1% versus 32.7% for last year’s second quarter. Capital expenditures were $33.4 million, down from last year’s $41.7 million.
So to summarize, we are pleased with this quarter’s results, but there is a lot of work to be done between now and year-end to deliver on our priorities; continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintain cost and expense controls, and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow.
That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we’d like to open the call to questions. Operator?

I think in constant dollars our Other Girls business was up 6% in the quarter. Maybe it was 3% in actual dollars. So there was a little bit of Forex. And we generally had pretty good trends in the Other Girls business. Clearly, Disney Princess continues to have very strong momentum, and we are excited about this fall’s Tangled movie, which is the story of Rapunzel. Monster High is in the Other Girls segment. It is a very small business in the second quarter, but obviously we are quite hopeful on that. Polly has seen improved results more recently in the US, including during the quarter, but we still have some work to do internationally with Polly. And we are also facing some declines from the prior year and things like High School Musical and Hanna Montana, which we distributed outside of the US. So it’s a portfolio of brands, generally speaking, will continue to do well than that if they cycle through.

You may recall that given the seasonality of our business, the vast majority of accrued incentive compensations reported in the second half of the year, driven primarily by the achievement of our annual performance goals in the key [ph] season. That being said, accounting rules require higher accrual in the second quarter versus last year due to year-to-date performance improvements.
And maybe I’ll take the opportunity as a result of the question really getting to the SG&A increase for the quarter. For the quarter, SG&A expenses increased approximately $35 million to $318 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense was 31.3% or down 30 basis points compared to the prior year.
The year-over-year dollar increase primarily reflects $12 million of legal-related costs, $16 million of employee-related costs, and $7 million of incremental severance, which was partially offset by approximately $5 million of gross savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program. About one-third of the higher employee-related costs was due to merit increases affected in March and the other two-thirds was due to the timing of incentive accruals.
And as I said that due to seasonality, really most of the incentive compensation is accrued in the second half. As I said, the accounting rules require us our performances better to accrue more in the second quarter versus last year. In the second quarter of 2010, we incurred higher incentive costs of $9 million versus $2 million in the prior year related to Global Cost Leadership program. So it was $9 million of severance in the second quarter versus $2 million last year.

Let me start and then Kevin, if you want to chime in, feel free. If you recall back in December, the Ninth Circuit Court heard arguments surrounding the trial court’s orders from the phase one of the case, which had resulted in a unanimous jury verdict in favor of Mattel. The court hasn’t yet issued any opinion on that. So nothing has changed from that front. But you will recall the bid issue in order to sustain the equitable relief, which included the transfer of the Bratz copyright registrations and trademarks to Mattel.
So there is nothing new on phase one of the case other than we are still awaiting the Circuit Court’s opinion. We are now moving forward with phase two of the case at the District Court level. That’s the phase that alleges among other things that MGA systematically stole Mattel’s trade secrets, and there hasn’t been a trial date set yet for phase two. So overall, I’d say we continue to have faith in the judicial system and confidence in our claims and the evidence, just as we did in phase one, and we will pursue this as long as we need to.

In the second quarter of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of approximately $8 million, primarily related to preparing for phase two of the MGA trial, which could occur in 2010. If you look at the first half of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of approximately $14 million, again primarily related to the preparing for phase two of the MGA trial.
And then moving on to settlements, legal settlements related to the recall, if you remember, in the first quarter 2009, we took a $21 million charge for legal settlement reserve for product liability related litigation. And then in the second quarter of 2009, we adjusted this charge down by $5 million, primarily due to insurance recovery. So in the first half of 2009 - sorry, in the first half of 2010, we reversed $9 million of the recall-related charges to reflect the actual settlement amounts approved by the court in 2010. So altogether for the first half of 2010, the total year-over-year improvement pertain to the 2009 recall-related legal settlement was $25 million. And if you look at both legal fees and legal settlements for the first half of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of $14 million primarily related to MGA. These incremental fees were more than offset by the year-to-date favorable change in recall settlement charges of $25 million.

I guess I’d say overall the momentum built not surprisingly. We had pretty good sales early in the quarter, as retailers were gearing up for Toy Story 3. And then POS did very well for Toy Story 3. But I’d also tell you that the POS momentum was more broadly based than just Toy Story. If you look at the quarterly flow of the point-of-sale, clearly the momentum is picking up broadly around the globe. Today I’m probably more concerned about supply than demand. In China, we see labor supply tightening, the rates are up, shipping containers are in short supply, freights taking longer to move than it sometimes does.
In Mexico, there was a hurricane near one of our facilities in Monterrey and there has been floods from essentially Monterrey to Laredo, Texas. So all this was occurring while our business was picking up and orders were strong. The good news is we have a long history of overcoming supply chain obstacles like this. So, as always, we are continuing to focus on getting the right toys at the right place at the right time. But I think right now and certainly in the near-term, in my view, the supply chain is relatively more important to POS momentum, which continues to be quite strong.

I don’t think they are going to broadly rebuild inventory anywhere around the world. I think that’s just their view of the marketplace. It’s consistent with our view of the marketplace. So, similar to last year, people are going to be cautious and they tend to buy what they are selling as opposed to buying a lot in advance of selling. If we look at - the US is our best data.
If we look at retail inventories in the US, which we calculate from shipments and point-of-sale information that receive from retailers, on a year-to-date basis, the inventories today - let me put it that way, the inventories today in the US at retail are up maybe low-to-mid single digits, but most of that - all of that’s really due to the natural build for these entertainment properties that are very strong right now. If you exclude the entertainment properties, the retail inventories are down below a year ago. And people are pretty tight with inventory last year.

I think your focus on royalties are correct this quarter versus the first quarter and that we did see more entertainment license property sales in the second quarter.
But also this quarter we continued to benefit from lower commodity costs that occurred last year when we were buying inputs and manufacturing to our 2010 spring line relative to the near record high input cost that we experienced in late 2008 when we were purchasing inputs for the manufacture of spring 2009 product line. And our 2010 gross margins also improved due to continuous improvement program as well as our Global Cost Leadership program and other manufacturing programs across the supply chain.

We’ve come off a tough Christmas in 2008 when the global economy tanked. And retailers and manufacturers like us were all anxious about what the holidays would look like in 2009. We were pretty cautious about the inventories going into 2009. Retailers were quite cautious about inventories. The good news is the market cleared, everybody did well, products sold, and holidays were good.
So if you fast forward now, our view of the world this year is, okay, from a POS and consumer standpoint, we are hopeful the worst is behind us. So we don’t have that pessimism that we had a year ago at this time. That being said, I don’t think anybody thinks we are back to good growth in the macro economy and I don’t think anybody is building inventory in anticipation of renewed consumer spending. So I think we’re going to continue with sentiments that we probably had for the last six or eight months.

And in general, I think that some of the fall toys coming out of either Mattel or some of our competitors are starting to appear at retail. And my sense is based on sort of the POS in the last several weeks. Things are off to a pretty good start. I think in answer to your question on the Toy Story 3 DVD, my recollection is it comes out around Thanksgiving or sometime in the November time period in time for the holiday season.

Last year at this time, Mattel, along with many other consumer goods companies and retailers, was lamenting how much further the economy was going to decline. And while reports remain mixed on whether or not we're out of the woods, I can tell you that I'm very pleased with the company's performance for the quarter, with worldwide net sales of 13%, reflecting good performance in the U.S., as well as internationally and continued improvement in our profit margins. 
Our positive top line sales trend this quarter, in both the U.S. and abroad, benefited from our newest entertainment properties, Toy Story 3, World Wrestling Entertainment and Thomas and Friends, as well as solid growth from core brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels. 
As it relates to Barbie, the core fashion, beach and accessory product lines continue to perform well. At our spring entertainment offering, Barbie, A Mermaid Tale, nicely outperformed last year's movie. Our icon B line, driven by a very strong spring promotional program, continues to perform well at retail. And I'm proud to report that the Barbie leadership team hasn't missed a beat, and is continuing to drive the brand to deliver on fashion, aspiration and cultural relevance. 
I know there's a lot of interest in the launch of our Monster High franchise, which has just began. We know girls are becoming engaged with the brand, as evidenced by the millions of Monster High episodes downloaded from the website. 
The Justice Apparel program is just growing up to more than 900 stores nationwide, and the Monsters will be taking over YouTube's homepage this summer, with an all-new Monster High music video. Toy advertising begins around the back-to-school timeframe, which also coincides with sales of the first Little, Brown hardback, chapter book, which hits retail in September.
In the Wheels item. Hot Wheels performance has been solid, driven by both core play, with basic cars and track sets, as well as the feature product lines, like Custom Motors and Color Shifters, and we're excited about the Matchbox launch of Stinky the Garbage Truck, following on the successful launch of Rocky the Robot Truck last year. These characters are now part of the new Big Rig Buddies line, which we're introducing to kids this fall via CGI-animated episodes, being packed with the products.
And of course, there's the incredible success of this year's summer movie, Toy Story 3. Not surprisingly, our Toy Story 3 lines are selling well across all businesses including infant and preschool, action figures, collectibles, playsets, vehicles, role play, Barbie and Ken dolls and games. And now that Spain has taken on the World Cup title, the movie will be hitting theaters in key European markets. 
In the World Wrestling. WWE sales continue to be strong, driven not only by our core line that appeals to collectors, but by the FlexForce toys, which are more kid-focused and feature-driven. As I said before, what's most exciting about our newest licensed properties is that we expect them to perform work into Evergreen toy brands than one-hit wonders, which augur well for our business, not only in 2010, but beyond.
In the infant & preschool aisle. Our Fisher-Price Friends business performed quite well, with Dora the Explorer, rebounding nicely, and of course, the addition of Thomas and Friends. We're also looking forward to Dora's 10-year anniversary, which Nickelodeon is kicking off this fall. 
This summer, American Girl launched the Shine On Now program, a new charitable initiative that harnesses the collective power of girls to help others in need. To further encourage and inspire girls, American Girl is also launching a brand-new virtual campus, Innerstar University, a fun, safe website for girls. Access to the new virtual world comes with each 18-inch, My American Girl doll, the new company's newly enhanced contemporary product line, which is currently available. 
From our time-honored brands to our newest entertainment partners, I'm encouraged by the strong momentum in the first half of the year, as we begin to count down to the all-important holiday season. We remain committed to maximizing long term value for our shareholders. As you know, we're focused on controlling costs and effectively deploying capital. 
Over the last seven years, we have repurchased about 114 million shares of our stock, with a total cost of $2.2 billion, including repurchasing about 5 million shares this quarter, and it distributed $1.6 billion in dividends. Effective capital deployment, combined with solid top line growth and improving margins, will allow us to win in the marketplace and for our shareholders. 
At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through a financial review of the quarter. Kevin?"

I'll begin my review for the second quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today's press release. 
Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter were up 13%, including a three-percentage-point negative impact and changes in exchange rates. U.S. sales were up 17%. International sales were up 9%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
On a retail basis, sales in Europe were up 7%, including a seven-percentage-point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were up 1%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact on foreign exchange, and sales in Asia-Pacific were up 28%, including a six-percentage-point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. 
I will now review our core business and brands for the second quarter. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales from Mattel Girls & Boys Brands segment were up 21%, including a three-percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. On a retail basis, domestic sales were up 37% and international sales were up 11%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. 
Worldwide Barbie sales were up 6%, including a four-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in the U.S. were up 16%, while Barbie sales in the international markets were up 1%, including a six-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales at Other Girls Brands were up 3%, including a three-percentage-point negative impact from exchange rates. Continued good growth in Disney Princesses was partially offset by international declines in High School Musical, Hannah Montana and Polly Pocket. Sales of Other Girls Brands in the U.S. were up 15%, and international sales were down 7%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales of Wheels increased 5%, including a two-percentage-point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The growth in Wheels was led by strong worldwide sales of Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels increased 11% worldwide, including zero impact from foreign exchange. Hot Wheels sales increased 19% in U.S., and were up 5% internationally, including a one-percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales in our Entertainment business, which included Games and Puzzles, was up 60%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. Sales were up 90% in the U.S. and up 40% internationally, including an eight-percentage-point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. 
Sales increases were primarily driven by our new Toy Story 3 products and continued momentum from other new Entertainment properties, WWE Wrestling, as well as good growth in our Core Games business. 
Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales of Fisher-Price brands were up 4%, including a two-percentage-point negative impact from changes in currency rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales of Fisher-Price Brands increased 4% and international sales increased 5%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide Core Fisher-Price was flat, including a two-percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. International sales were up 1%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange, and U.S. sales of Fisher-Price Core were down 1%. Fisher-Price Brands worldwide sales increased 35%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
International sales were up 25%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, while sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. were up 45%. The growth of Fisher-Price Friends is driven primarily by the addition of products supporting a new Thomas and Friends property, as well as growth in Dora the Explorer and Disney products. 
American Girl Brands. Sales of American Girl Brands were down 4%, primarily the result of last year's second quarter launch of Rebecca, and a slightly earlier Easter this year, partially offset by continued strong sales of Lanie, the 2010 Girl of the Year and good performance from our new Denver store.
Now let's review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Gross margin was 48.1% compared to 45.2% last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower product costs, price increases and savings from our Global Cost Leadership initiatives, partially offset by higher royalties. We continue to expect input comp pressures in our gross margin beginning in the second half of this year, given the current commodity and labor costs environments relative to year-ago levels. Advertising expense was $101.9 million or 10% of net sales compared to $89.8 million, or 10% of net sales in 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative  expenses increased approximately $34.5 million to $318.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 31.3% compared to 31.6% last year. The year-to-year dollar increase primarily reflects increased legal-related costs, and employee-related costs, including incentive accruals and merit increases, as well as severance costs, partially offset by savings related to our Global Cost Leadership program. 
For the first half of the year, SG&A expenses are up $10 million or 2%, and represent 32.2% of net sales compared with 35.7% for the first half of 2009. For the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership program delivered overall gross savings before severance of about $12 million. The gross savings includes about $4 million in SG&A, $5 million in gross margin and $3 million in advertising. 
For the quarter, we recorded severance charges of $9 million. The net year-over-year incremental savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program is about $3 million for the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net savings at the high end of the target range for the program of $180 million to $200 million by the end of 2010. 
Operating income during the quarter was $69.4 million compared to $32.5 million in 2009. The year-to-year improvement was primarily due to higher sales and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A and advertising expense. 
Interest expense of $13.4 million was down from $17.5 million last year, reflecting lower average borrowings, as well as lower average interest rates. Interest income was $2.8 million versus $2.5 million last year. The higher interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances during the quarter. 
Other non-operating income was $3.3 million during the quarter versus $6.3 million in 2009. The income in both period relates primarily to foreign currency exchange gains. The quarter's income tax provision of $10.5 million includes discrete tax benefits of $4.6 million. This compares to prior year's provision of $2.3 million, which included discrete tax benefits of $2.5 million. 
For the year, we continue to expect the worldwide effective tax rate to be about 24% to 25%, based on current tax laws. Overall, we reported net income of $51.6 million or $0.14 per share versus last year's net income of $21.5 million or $0.06 per share.
Now turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow used for operations was $372 million compared to $350 million in the first half of 2009. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $545 million, up $122 million from prior year. The increase in cash is primarily due to higher beginning cash balances of $1.1 billion this year versus $618 million last year, partially offset primarily by a lack of short-term borrowings and capital deployment. 
During the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 5 million of its shares of common stock at an average price of $22.05 per share, for a total cost of approximately $111 million. I'm pleased with our management of working capital, especially in light of 13% growth in the business. 
Receivables were $805 million or 71 days of sales outstanding, four days lower than last year. Factoring decreased from $81 million to 0. Prior to factoring, days of sales outstanding decreased 12 days. During the first half of 2010, we made a decision not to factor receivables due to our current cash position and availability of lower-cost funding alternatives. 
Inventories at $598 million were up $8 million or 1% versus 2009. Our total balance sheet debt was $710 million, a decrease of $344 million from the prior year, reflecting the lack of short-term borrowings and the paydown in maturing long-term notes. Our debt to total capital ratio ended the quarter at 22.1% versus 32.7% for last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures were $33.4 million, down from last year's $41.7 million.
So to summarize, we are pleased with this quarter's results. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and year end to deliver on our priorities: Continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintain cost and expense controls and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow. 
That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

And we generally have pretty good trends in the Other Girls business. Clearly, Disney Princess continues to have very strong momentum, and we are excited about this fall's movie, Tangle Movie, which is the story of Rapunzel. Monster High is in the Other Girls segment. It is a various small business in the second quarter, but obviously, we're quite hopeful on that. Polly is seeing improved results more recently in the U.S., including during the quarter, but we still have some work to do internationally with Polly. And we're also facing some declines from the prior year and things like High School Musical and Hannah Montana, which we distribute outside of the U.S. So it's a portfolio of brands, generally speaking, more continue to do well than that if they cycle through."

You may recall that given the seasonality of our business, the vast majority of accrued incentive compensation is recorded in the second half of the year, driven primarily by the achievement of our annual performance goals in the key season. That being said, accounting rules require a higher accrual in the second quarter versus last year due to year-to-date performance improvements, and maybe I'll take the opportunity as a result of the question, really, to get into the SG&A increase for the quarter. For the quarter, SG&A expenses increased approximately $35 million to $318 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense was 31.3% or down 30 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year dollar increase primarily reflects $12 million of legal-related costs, $16 million of employee-related costs and $7 million of incremental severance, which was partially offset by approximately $5 million of gross savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program. About 1/3 of the higher employee-related costs was due to merit increases affected in March and the other 2/3 was due to the timing of incentive accruals. And as I said that, due to the seasonality, really most of the incentive compensation is accrued in the second half, but as I said, the accounting rules require us is -- our performance was better. We accrued more in the second quarter versus last year. In the second quarter of 2010, we incurred higher incentive costs of $9 million versus $2 million in the prior year related to Global Cost Leadership program. So it's $9 million of severance in the second quarter versus $2 million last year."

So nothing's changed from that front, but you will recall they did issue an order stating the equitable relief, which included the transfer of the Bratz's copyright registrations and trademarks to Mattel. So there's nothing new on Phase 1 of the case other than we're still awaiting the circuit court's opinion. We're now moving forward with Phase 2 of the case at the district court level. That's the phase that alleges, among other things, that MGA systematically stole Mattel's trade secrets, and there hasn't been a trial date set yet for Phase 2.

If you look at the first half of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of approximately $14 million, again, primarily related to brand from Phase 2 of the MGA trial. And then moving on to settlements, legal settlements related to recall. If you remember in the first quarter of 2009, we took a $21 million charge for a legal settlement reserved for product liability related to litigation. And then in the second quarter of 2009, we adjusted this charge down by $5 million, primarily due to insurance recovery. So the first half of 2010, we reversed $9 million of the recall-related charges to reflect the action settlement amounts approved by the court in 2010. So altogether for the first half of 2010, the total year-over-year improvement pertaining to the 2009 recall-related legal settlement was $25 million. And if you look at both legal fees and legal settlements, for the first half of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of $14 million, primarily related to MGA.

I guess, I'd say overall, the momentum built not surprisingly. We had pretty good sales early in the quarter as retailers were gearing up for Toy Story 3, and then POS did very well for Toy Story 3. But I'd also tell you that the POS momentum was more broadly based than just Toy Story. If you look at the quarterly flow of the point of sale, clearly, the momentum is picking up broadly around the globe. Today, I'm probably more concerned about supply than demand. In China, we see labor supply tightening, the rates are up, shipping containers are in short supply, freight's taking longer to move than it sometimes does. In Mexico, there was a hurricane near one our of our facilities in Monterrey and there's been floods from essentially, Monterrey to Laredo, Texas. So all of these was occurring while our business was picking up and orders were strong. The good news is we have a long history of overcoming supply chain obstacles like this. So as always, we're continuing to focus on getting the right toys at the right place at the right time. But I think right now and then certainly in the near term, in my view, the supply chain is relatively more important than POS momentum, which continues to be quite strong."

If we look at retail inventories in the U.S., which we calculate from shipments and point-of-sale information that we receive from retailers, the inventories today, let me put it that way. The inventories today in the U.S. at retail are up maybe in the low to mid-single digits. But most of that, all of that's really due to the natural build for these entertainment properties that are very strong right now. If you exclude the entertainment properties, the retail inventories are down below year ago, and people are pretty tight with inventory last year.

And as I said earlier, gross margin benefited from favorable product costs, price increases and savings from the Global Cost Leadership Program, partially offset by the mix due to higher royalties related to our new entertainment properties. I think your focus on the royalties are correct this quarter versus the first quarter, and that we did see more entertainment license property sales in the second quarter. But also this quarter, we continued to benefit from lower commodity costs that occurred last year. We were buying inputs and manufacturing to our 2010 spring line relative to the near record high input cost that we experienced in late 2008, when we were purchasing inputs for manufacture of our spring 2009 product line. In our 2010 first launch, it also improved due to the continuous improvement programs like our Global Cost Leadership Program, and other manufacturing programs across our supply chain. So I think we made good progress again to rebuilding our gross margins and our goals to sustain gross margins consistent with our long-term goal. I think again, royalties was part of that. I think also cycling through the commodity costs as we were building 2010 product, those commodity costs got more expensive as we moved from the first quarter to the second quarter."

A lot of retailers saw the market clear pretty quickly last year, and I'm sure they're hopeful to continue that again this year. They're not going to get ahead of themselves."

So I think in general, Fisher-Price, if you go back over the last 10 years, it's probably been the best performing major brand in the toy industry. Certainly one of the best. Fisher-Price is a terrific franchise. But from a core product standpoint, we've been a little disappointed in the POS. Fortunately, if you look at recent weeks, the momentum is improving a bit.

And while reports",793,"Thank you, Dianne, and good morning, everyone. What a difference a year makes. Last year at this time, Mattel, along with many other consumer goods companies and retailers, was lamenting how much further the economy was going to decline. And while reports remain mixed on whether or not we're out of the woods, I can tell you that I'm very pleased with the company's performance for the quarter, with worldwide net sales of 13%, reflecting good performance in the U.S., as well as internationally and continued improvement in our profit margins. 
Our positive top line sales trend this quarter, in both the U.S. and abroad, benefited from our newest entertainment properties, Toy Story 3, World Wrestling Entertainment and Thomas and Friends, as well as solid growth from core brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels. 
As it relates to Barbie, the core fashion, beach and accessory product lines continue to perform well. At our spring entertainment offering, Barbie, A Mermaid Tale, nicely outperformed last year's movie. Our icon B line, driven by a very strong spring promotional program, continues to perform well at retail. And I'm proud to report that the Barbie leadership team hasn't missed a beat, and is continuing to drive the brand to deliver on fashion, aspiration and cultural relevance. 
I know there's a lot of interest in the launch of our Monster High franchise, which has just began. We know girls are becoming engaged with the brand, as evidenced by the millions of Monster High episodes downloaded from the website. 
The Justice Apparel program is just growing up to more than 900 stores nationwide, and the Monsters will be taking over YouTube's homepage this summer, with an all-new Monster High music video. Toy advertising begins around the back-to-school timeframe, which also coincides with sales of the first Little, Brown hardback, chapter book, which hits retail in September.
In the Wheels item. Hot Wheels performance has been solid, driven by both core play, with basic cars and track sets, as well as the feature product lines, like Custom Motors and Color Shifters, and we're excited about the Matchbox launch of Stinky the Garbage Truck, following on the successful launch of Rocky the Robot Truck last year. These characters are now part of the new Big Rig Buddies line, which we're introducing to kids this fall via CGI-animated episodes, being packed with the products.
And of course, there's the incredible success of this year's summer movie, Toy Story 3. Not surprisingly, our Toy Story 3 lines are selling well across all businesses including infant and preschool, action figures, collectibles, playsets, vehicles, role play, Barbie and Ken dolls and games. And now that Spain has taken on the World Cup title, the movie will be hitting theaters in key European markets. 
In the World Wrestling. WWE sales continue to be strong, driven not only by our core line that appeals to collectors, but by the FlexForce toys, which are more kid-focused and feature-driven. As I said before, what's most exciting about our newest licensed properties is that we expect them to perform work into Evergreen toy brands than one-hit wonders, which augur well for our business, not only in 2010, but beyond.
In the infant & preschool aisle. Our Fisher-Price Friends business performed quite well, with Dora the Explorer, rebounding nicely, and of course, the addition of Thomas and Friends. We're also looking forward to Dora's 10-year anniversary, which Nickelodeon is kicking off this fall. 
This summer, American Girl launched the Shine On Now program, a new charitable initiative that harnesses the collective power of girls to help others in need. To further encourage and inspire girls, American Girl is also launching a brand-new virtual campus, Innerstar University, a fun, safe website for girls. Access to the new virtual world comes with each 18-inch, My American Girl doll, the new company's newly enhanced contemporary product line, which is currently available. 
From our time-honored brands to our newest entertainment partners, I'm encouraged by the strong momentum in the first half of the year, as we begin to count down to the all-important holiday season. We remain committed to maximizing long term value for our shareholders. As you know, we're focused on controlling costs and effectively deploying capital. 
Over the last seven years, we have repurchased about 114 million shares of our stock, with a total cost of $2.2 billion, including repurchasing about 5 million shares this quarter, and it distributed $1.6 billion in dividends. Effective capital deployment, combined with solid top line growth and improving margins, will allow us to win in the marketplace and for our shareholders. 
At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through a financial review of the quarter. Kevin?"

I'll begin my review for the second quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today's press release. 
Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter were up 13%, including a three-percentage-point negative impact and changes in exchange rates. U.S. sales were up 17%. International sales were up 9%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
On a retail basis, sales in Europe were up 7%, including a seven-percentage-point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were up 1%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact on foreign exchange, and sales in Asia-Pacific were up 28%, including a six-percentage-point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. 
I will now review our core business and brands for the second quarter. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales from Mattel Girls & Boys Brands segment were up 21%, including a three-percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. On a retail basis, domestic sales were up 37% and international sales were up 11%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. 
Worldwide Barbie sales were up 6%, including a four-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in the U.S. were up 16%, while Barbie sales in the international markets were up 1%, including a six-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales at Other Girls Brands were up 3%, including a three-percentage-point negative impact from exchange rates. Continued good growth in Disney Princesses was partially offset by international declines in High School Musical, Hannah Montana and Polly Pocket. Sales of Other Girls Brands in the U.S. were up 15%, and international sales were down 7%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales in Wheels increased 5%, including a two-percentage-point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. The growth in Wheels was led by strong worldwide sales of Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels increased 11% worldwide, including zero impact from foreign exchange. Hot Wheels sales increased 19% in U.S., and were up 5% internationally, including a one-percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide sales in our Entertainment business, which included Games and Puzzles, was up 60%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. Sales were up 90% in the U.S. and up 40% internationally, including an eight-percentage-point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. 
Sales increases were primarily driven by our new Toy Story 3 products and continued momentum from other new Entertainment properties, WWE Wrestling, as well as good growth in our Core Games business. 
Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales of Fisher-Price brands were up 4%, including a two-percentage-point negative impact from changes in currency rates. On a regional basis, domestic sales of Fisher-Price Brands increased 4% and international sales increased 5%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Worldwide Core Fisher-Price was flat, including a two-percentage-point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. International sales were up 1%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange, and U.S. sales of Fisher-Price Core were down 1%. Fisher-Price Brands worldwide sales increased 35%, including a five-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
International sales were up 25%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, while sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. were up 45%. The growth of Fisher-Price Friends is driven primarily by the addition of products supporting a new Thomas and Friends property, as well as growth in Dora the Explorer and Disney products. 
American Girl Brands. Sales of American Girl Brands were down 4%, primarily the result of last year's second quarter launch of Rebecca, and a slightly earlier Easter this year, partially offset by continued strong sales of Lanie, the 2010 Girl of the Year and good performance from our new Denver store.
Now let's review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Gross margin was 48.1% compared to 45.2% last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower product costs, price increases and savings from our Global Cost Leadership initiatives, partially offset by higher royalties. We continue to expect input comp pressures in our gross margin beginning in the second half of this year, given the current commodity and labor cost environments relative to year-ago levels. Advertising expense was $101.9 million or 10% of net sales compared to $89.8 million, or 10% of net sales in 2009. 
Selling, general and administrative  expenses increased approximately $34.5 million to $318.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 31.3% compared to 31.6% last year. The year-to-year dollar increase primarily reflects increased legal-related cost, employee-related cost, including incentive accruals and merit increases, as well as severance costs, partially offset by savings related to our Global Cost Leadership program. 
For the first half of the year, SG&A expenses are up $10 million or 2%, and represent 32.2% of net sales compared with 35.7% for the first half of 2009. For the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership program delivered overall gross savings before severance of about $12 million. The gross savings includes about $4 million in SG&A, $5 million in gross margin and $3 million in advertising. 
For the quarter, we recorded severance charges of $9 million. The net year-over-year incremental savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program is about $3 million for the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net savings at the high end of the target range for the program of $180 million to $200 million by the end of 2010. 
Operating income during the quarter was $69.4 million compared to $32.5 million in 2009. The year-to-year improvement was primarily due to higher sales and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A and advertising expense. 
Interest expense of $13.4 million was down from $17.5 million last year, reflecting lower average borrowings, as well as lower average interest rates. Interest income was $2.8 million versus $2.5 million last year. The higher interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances during the quarter. 
Other non-operating income was $3.3 million during the quarter versus $6.3 million in 2009. The income in both period relates primarily to foreign currency exchange gains. The quarter's income tax provision of $10.5 million includes discrete tax benefits of $4.6 million. This compares to prior year's provision of $2.3 million, which included discrete tax benefits of $2.5 million. 
For the year, we continue to expect the worldwide effective tax rate to be about 24% to 25%, based on current tax laws. Overall, we reported net income of $51.6 million or $0.14 per share versus last year's net income of $21.5 million or $0.06 per share.
Now turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow used for operations was $372 million compared to $350 million in the first half of 2009. Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $545 million, up $122 million from prior year. The increase in cash is primarily due to higher beginning cash balances of $1.1 billion this year versus $618 million last year, partially offset primarily by a lack of short-term borrowings and capital deployment. 
During the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 5 million of its shares in common stock at an average price of $22.05 per share, for a total cost of approximately $111 million. I'm pleased with our management of working capital, especially in light of 13% growth in the business. 
Receivables were $805 million or 71 days of sales outstanding, four days lower than last year. Factoring decreased from $81 million to 0. Prior to factoring, days of sales outstanding decreased 12 days. During the first half of 2010, we made the decision not to factor receivables due to our current cash position and availability of lower-cost-funding alternatives. 
Inventories at $598 million were up $8 million or 1% versus 2009. Our total balance sheet debt was $710 million, a decrease of $344 million from the prior year, reflecting the lack of short-term borrowings and the paydown in maturing long-term notes. Our debt to total capital ratio ended the quarter at 22.1% versus 32.7% for last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures were $33.4 million, down from last year's $41.7 million.
So to summarize, we are pleased with this quarter's results. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and year end to deliver on our priorities: Continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintain cost and expense controls and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow. 
That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?"

And we generally have pretty good trends in the Other Girls business. Clearly, Disney Princess continues to have very strong momentum, and we are excited about this fall's movie, Tangle Movie, which is the story of Rapunzel. Monster High is in the Other Girls segment. It is a various small business in the second quarter, but obviously, we're quite hopeful on that. Polly is seeing improved results more recently in the U.S., including during the quarter, but we still have some work to do internationally with Polly. And we're also facing some declines from the prior year and things like High School Musical and Hannah Montana, which we distribute outside of the U.S. So it's a portfolio of brands, generally speaking, more continue to do well than that if they cycle through."

You may recall that given the seasonality of our business, the vast majority of accrued incentive compensation is recorded in the second half of the year, driven primarily by the achievement of our annual performance goals in the key season. That being said, accounting rules require a higher accrual in the second quarter versus last year due to year-to-date performance improvements, and maybe I'll take the opportunity as a result of the question, really, to get into the SG&A increase for the quarter. For the quarter, SG&A expenses increased approximately $35 million to $318 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense was 31.3% or down 30 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year dollar increase primarily reflects $12 million of legal-related costs, $16 million of employee-related costs and $7 million of incremental severance, which was partially offset by approximately $5 million of gross savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program. About 1/3 of the higher employee-related costs was due to merit increases affected in March and the other 2/3 was due to the timing of incentive accruals. And as I said that, due to the seasonality, really most of the incentive compensation is accrued in the second half, but as I said, the accounting rules require us is -- our performance was better. We accrued more in the second quarter versus last year. In the second quarter of 2010, we incurred higher incentive costs of $9 million versus $2 million in the prior year related to Global Cost Leadership program. So it's $9 million of severance in the second quarter versus $2 million last year."

The court hasn't yet issued any opinion on that. So nothing's changed from that front, but you will recall they did issue an order stating the equitable relief, which included the transfer of the Bratz's copyright registrations and trademarks to Mattel. So there's nothing new on Phase 1 of the case other than we're still awaiting the circuit court's opinion. We're now moving forward with Phase 2 of the case at the district court level. That's the phase that alleges, among other things, that MGA systematically stole Mattel's trade secrets, and there hasn't been a trial date set yet for Phase 2.

In the second quarter of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of approximately $8 million, primarily related to preparing for Phase 2 of the MGA trial, which could occur in 2010. If you look at the first half of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of approximately $14 million, again, primarily related to brand from Phase 2 of the MGA trial. And then moving on to settlements, legal settlements related to recall. If you remember in the first quarter of 2009, we took a $21 million charge for a legal settlement reserved for product liability related to litigation. And then in the second quarter of 2009, we adjusted this charge down by $5 million, primarily due to insurance recovery. So the first half of 2010, we reversed $9 million of the recall-related charges to reflect the action settlement amounts approved by the court in 2010. So altogether for the first half of 2010, the total year-over-year improvement pertaining to the 2009 recall-related legal settlement was $25 million. And if you look at both legal fees and legal settlements, for the first half of 2010, we incurred incremental legal fees of $14 million, primarily related to MGA.

I guess, I'd say overall, the momentum built not surprisingly. We had pretty good sales early in the quarter as retailers were gearing up for Toy Story 3, and then POS did very well for Toy Story 3. But I'd also tell you that the POS momentum was more broadly based than just Toy Story. If you look at the quarterly flow of the point of sale, clearly, the momentum is picking up broadly around the globe. Today, I'm probably more concerned about supply than demand. In China, we see labor supply tightening, the rates are up, shipping containers are in short supply, freight's taking longer to move than it sometimes does. In Mexico, there was a hurricane near one our of our facilities in Monterrey and there's been floods from essentially, Monterrey to Laredo, Texas. So all of these was occurring while our business was picking up and orders were strong. The good news is we have a long history of overcoming supply chain obstacles like this. So as always, we're continuing to focus on getting the right toys at the right place at the right time. But I think right now and then certainly in the near term, in my view, the supply chain is relatively more important than POS momentum, which continues to be quite strong."

I don't think they're going to broadly rebuild inventory anywhere around the world. I think that's just their view of the marketplace. It's consistent with our view of the marketplace. So similar to last year, people are going to be cautious, and they tend to buy what they're selling as opposed to buying a lot in advance of selling. If we look at -- the U.S. is our best data. If we look at retail inventories in the U.S., which we calculate from shipments and point-of-sale information that we receive from retailers, the inventories today, let me put it that way. The inventories today in the U.S. at retail are up maybe in the low to mid-single digits. But most of that, all of that's really due to the natural build for these entertainment properties that are very strong right now. If you exclude the entertainment properties, the retail inventories are down below year ago, and people are pretty tight with inventory last year. And so my view is that trend's going to continue this year. I don't think retailers anywhere that I'm aware are looking to rebuild inventories. And when the consumer buys it, we'll buy more."

And as I said earlier, gross margin benefited from favorable product cost, price increases and savings from the Global Cost Leadership Program, partially offset by mix due to higher royalties related to our new entertainment properties. I think your focus on the royalties are correct this quarter versus the first quarter, and that we did see more entertainment license property sales in the second quarter. But also this quarter, we continued to benefit from lower commodity costs that occurred last year when we were buying inputs and manufacturing to our 2010 spring line relative to the near record high input cost that we experienced in late 2008, when we were purchasing inputs for manufacture of our spring 2009 product line. In our 2010 first launch, it also improved due to the continuous improvement programs like our Global Cost Leadership Program, and other manufacturing programs across our supply chain. So I think we made good progress again in rebuilding our gross margins and our goals to sustain gross margins consistent with our long-term goal. I think again, royalties was part of that. I think also cycling through the commodity costs as we were building 2010 product, those commodity costs got more expensive as we moved from the first quarter to the second quarter."

I did find one of our products out there. I saw iXL the other day. So I think in general, Fisher-Price, if you go back over the last 10 years, it's probably been the best performing major brand in the toy industry. Certainly one of the best. Fisher-Price is a terrific franchise. But from a core product standpoint, we've been a little disappointed in the POS. Fortunately, if you look at recent weeks, the momentum is improving a bit. We're also hampered in that segment by things like Power Wheels, which is a very large expensive item. So it's disproportionate because of the retail dollars involved.

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the business, while the all important holiday season still lies ahead. We remain on track to deliver solid revenue and profit growth, driven by our portfolio of brands across various countries and regions.
As such, there are still some challenges ahead in relation to the biggest selling season for toys. After scrutinizing what was written about the back-to-school season, the consensus seems to be that sales came, but they came late, with analysts surmising that consumers are still cautious about the economy and therefore purchasing closer to the actual event or need than in previous seasons. As such, retailers remain guarded with inventories and several are betting on a late holiday season this year.
So anticipating the question I'm asked most often during this time of the year, yes, there will be a Christmas and Mattel toys will be under the tree and we'll likely sell more toys than anyone else. That said, I suspect it will play out later than we're accustomed to.
As we move into the all important holiday season, toy industry gurus as well as our retailer customers had named Mattel and Fisher-Price toys to their must-have holiday toy list, including Barbie Video Girl, Monster High Dolls, Sing-A-Ma-Jig, Loopz, Stealth Rides, Dance Star Mickey, iXL, Imaginext BIGFOOT and a variety of toys from the Toy Story 3 line as well as My American Girl and the 2010 Girl of the Year Doll, Lanie.
Speaking of American Girl, beginning the week of October 18, the brand's first ever product-focused national television commercial is scheduled to air and features the new My American Girl line of contemporary dolls, books and accessories as well as American Girl's new interactive online world, innerstaru.com.
In Barbie's world, our I Can Be campaign continues to excel worldwide and our new Barbie entertainment strategy, which is focused on more relevant and contemporary stories and themes, has proven quite successful this year. Our spring release Barbie in A Mermaid Tale resonated with girls, and our fall offering Barbie A Fashion Fairytale is just starting to hit shelves.
Monster High sales are up to a strong start across multiple categories, including toys, apparel, accessories and costumes. Both the Justice and Party City retail chains report strong sell-through of Monster High merchandize, and Party City reports that Monster High costumes are in its top 10 for kids' costumes.
The Monster High hardcover twin chapter book written by New York Times bestseller, Lisi Harrison, is now number five on the New York Times Children's Bestseller list, and that's only after one month of being on the shelves. And on Halloween, Nickelodeon will be airing a special 22-minute episode of Monster High, featuring the music of American Idol contestant, Allison Iraheta. This new princess is having an excellent year, driven by expansion in games and play patterns as well as a full line supporting Disney's next major Princess theatrical release, Tangled which hits theaters this November.
Disney Pixar's Toy Story 3, now the biggest animated film of all time in global box office continues to drive strong sales across figures, vehicles, playsets, role-play dolls and games. Toy Story 3 will release on DVD November 2, and we expect retailers to continue to strongly support the property through that period and well into 2011 as Disney continues to drive the franchise as an evergreen property.
Sales in Hot Wheels have been strong in the basic car, Monster Jam and Color Shifters lines. And this year we are seeing growth for our colors across a broader array of accounts than ever before, including grocery and drug stores. The business overseas is also doing well.
Our overall games business is up, and we are experiencing good momentum on all our core brands like Uno, Apples to Apples, Blokus, Mad Gab and Pictionary. And I'd like to highlight the strong performance of our Kid and Preschool games, led by Whac-a-Mole, Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots and our Thomas the Tank Engine games.
Included in games is Radica, which is experiencing nice growth, driven by strong second-year sales of Mindflex as well as new entries like Puppy Tweets and Loopz, which is off to an incredible start and is shown up on almost every hot toy list in the U.S. so far.
In the world of Fisher-Price, there are some bright spots as Thomas & Friends is performing above expectations globally. Dora the Explorer has rebounded in the U.S. during Nickelodeon's 10th anniversary celebration which kicked off on television and at retail in August.
Additionally, Fisher-Price is running a more focused television ad campaign this fall in the U.S., which we've shifted later back. It's just starting to debut now as we believe consumers will be shopping later than usual for this holiday season.
And as I said last year and still rings true today, I appreciate that many families will have to make choices this year when it comes to buying toys for their children. I'm convinced that Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and American Girl and some of our new introductions like Monster High, Sing-a-ma-jigs and Loopz will provide superior value for parents and great play experiences for the kids.
At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through a financial review of the quarter.

Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter increased 2%, including a 3 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Total worldwide gross sales on a year-to-date basis increased 7%, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.
U.S. sales were up 3%, and international sales were up 2%, including a 7 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, driven primarily by exchange rate changes in Venezuela.
On a regional basis, sales in Europe were up 3%, including an 8 percentage point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were down 6%, including an 11 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange driven primarily by exchange rate changes in Venezuela.
Sales in Asia-Pacific were up 13%, including a 3 percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates.
I will now review our core categories and brands for the third quarter.
Mattel Girls and Boys Brands: Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls and Boys brands were up 8%, including a 4 percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. Worldwide Barbie sales were up 6%, including a 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Barbie sales in the U.S. were up 16%, and Barbie sales in the international markets were flat, including a 7 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide sales of other Girls brands were up 7%, including a 4 percentage point negative impact from exchange rates.
Sales in the U.S. were up 12%, while international sales of other Girls brands were up 3%, including a 6 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. The worldwide sales increase was driven primarily by higher sales of Disney Princess and the launch of Monster High, partially offset by sales declines in Little Mommy, Polly Pocket and High School Musical.
Worldwide sales in the Wheels category were down 5%, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide sales reflected sales declines in Tyco R/C.
For core Hot Wheels, worldwide sales were down 3 percentage points, including a 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Domestic sales decreased 7%, driven primarily by declines in sales of Track Sets and Playsets.
Sales in international markets increased 1%, including a 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide sales in our entertainment business, which includes games and puzzles and Radica increased 23%, including a 6 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. The overall increase in entertainment business was primarily attributable to sales of toys due to Toy Story 3 and WWE Wrestling.
Fisher-Price Brands, worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands decreased 5%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. International sales of Fisher-Price brands decreased 1% including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. And sales in the U.S. declined 7%. Worldwide core Fisher-Price decreased 10% including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates.
U.S. sales of Fisher-Price core declined 13% while international sales were down 5% including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange rates. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Friends increased 16% which included a four percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. were up 19% while international sales were up 12% including a ten percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
The overall increase in Fisher-Price Friends was primarily driven by sales of products supporting Thomas & Friends and the launch of Sing-a-ma-jigs partially offset by sales decline in Sesame Street in certain smaller licensed properties.
American Girl brands, sales of American Girl brands were up 2% primarily, reflecting strong sales of Felicity dolls, Lanie the Girl of the Year doll, and the benefit of two new store openings in Denver and Kansas City.
Now, let's review the P&L which is shown on exhibit one. Our gross margin in this year's third quarter was 51.1% as compared to last year's margin of 51.3%. The decline was primarily due to higher royalties and input costs partially offset by price increases and mix.
Advertising expense was $201.6 million, 11% of net sales flat with third quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $7.7 million to $377.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 20.6% compared to 21.5% last year. The year and year decrease is primarily driven by lower severance charges and savings related to our global cost leadership initiative, partially offset by a higher employee related cost in asset impairments of $8 million for the house of Barbie.
In SG&A, global cost leadership savings of $8 million were partially offset by a severance charge of $2 million. In the quarter, our global cost leadership program delivered overall net savings of approximately $12 million bringing the cumulative net savings to $194 million.
In addition to the $6 million net savings reflected in SG&A, there were savings of roughly $1 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in advertising. We are on track to deliver cumulative net savings slightly above the high end of our target range of $180 million to $200 million from this program by the end of 2010.
Operating income during the quarter was $358.6 million compared to operating income of $336.5 million last year. The improvement was driven by higher sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset product recall impact of $7.6 million and higher advertising. Interest expense was $13.8 million versus $19.3 million in 2009. The decrease in interest expense versus last year is primarily due to lower average rates and lower average borrowers.
As you know on September 28, we issued 250 million senior unsecured notes due 2020 and 250 million senior unsecured notes due in 2040. We'll use these funds for general corporate purposes including paying off $260 million of long term debt maturities over the next year. Interest income was $1.8 million versus $1.5 million last year. The higher interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances during the quarter partially offset by lower average investment rates.
Other non-operating income expense was zero versus an expense of $14.1 million in 2009. This quarter's income tax provision was $63.3 million compared to prior year's expense of $74.8 million. This quarter's income tax provision included net discrete tax benefits of $16.8 million or $0.05 per share. We currently estimate the 2010 full year effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% excluding discrete items.
Overall, we reported net income of $283.3 million or $0.77 per share versus last year's net income of $229.8 million or $0.63 per share.
Now, turning to the cash flow and balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow used for operations was $428 million as compared to $319 million for the first three quarter of 2009. The higher use was primarily driven by the decision not to factor domestic receivables and higher working capital requirements partially offset by higher net income.
Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $961 million, up from $324 million in the prior year. The higher cash balance at the end of third quarter of 2010 was primarily due to a higher beginning cash balance of $1.117 billion this year versus $618 million last year and higher long-term borrowings partially offset by lower short-term borrowings and the decision not to factor receivables.
During the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $21.49 per share, a total cost of approximately $42 million.
Receivables were $1.55 billion or 76 days of sales outstanding, three days higher than last year. Factoring of domestic receivables decreased from $126 million in 2009 to $0 in 2010. Prior to factoring, days sales outstanding decreased four days.
During the first nine months of 2010, we made the decision not to factor domestic receivables due to our current cash position and the availability of lower cost funding alternatives. At this point, we do not expect to factor domestic receivables in the fourth quarter.
Inventories at $741 million were up $135 million or 22% versus 2009. Our third quarter inventories were more in line with levels experienced in 2007 and 2008 prior to the global economic decline. Our total balance sheet debt increased by $296 million from the prior year, reflecting a recent debt issuance of $500 million, partially offset by payment of $50 million of the maturing medium-term debt, and $154 million reduction of short-term borrowings. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio ended the quarter at 29.8% as compared to 27.6% at the end of last year's third quarter.
Capital expenditures during the quarter were $37.6 million, up from last year's third quarter of $28.6 million.
So to summarize, as Bob mentioned, we remain on track to have a good year, but there is a lot of work to be done between now and year-end to deliver on our priorities; continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintain cost and expense controls, and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow.
That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions.

Our shipments in the retailers here in the States were a bit soft late in the quarter. That wasn't the case in international markets. And from a supply-side standpoint, we're still struggling a bit with a few lines, mostly in Fisher-Price. But overall, our inventories have returned to normal levels if you go back over the past couple of years.
We do continue to see good performance in POS data. The NPD reports indicate that the toy industry is holding up well and we're continuing to gain share. I also think, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we'll have our share of the bestselling toys this year, based on the various holiday toy lists. But if you look at our inventory levels at retail in the U.S., they've now fallen below year-ago levels, despite last year been a tight year for us all and the fact that we have some new growing brands in our portfolio like WWE, Toy Story and Thomas.
So how the holiday season is going to play out is still up in the air. We do know that some key retailers are betting on late Christmas, based in part on their experience during back-to-school. We also know that we are in good shape with advertising and shelf space and merchandising commitments.

And so we have retooled the price value architecture. This fall's key driver products, they're now hitting shelves. And recognizing what both we and retailers think will be a late Christmas, we delayed the timing of our marketing programs on Fisher-Price.

It's reasonably widespread across the major retailers. If we look at our overall retail inventory position, as we measure it based on what we ship into retailers and into the POS data that we get from them, our inventories are now down low-to-mid single digit versus a year ago. And last year's inventories at retail were quite low compared to normal years.
If you exclude some of the new properties that we have like Toy Story and WWE, the retail inventories right now are down double digits below what they were last year. And again, last year was pretty tight.
I wouldn't isolate it to one or two retailers. I think several of the major retailers are betting out on late Christmas this year. We've aligned with them in terms of our support and our programs. And I think that's how it's going to play out.
The first part of your question, we're in the position that we're in a lot at this time of year where we do have some SKUs and some products where we're just not going to be able to fulfill demand. Monster High is a good example. It's gotten off to a terrific start. Justice has done well with it. Party City has done well with it. The toy retailers have done well with it. And it's unlikely that we're going to be able to keep up with demand for Monster High this year.
There is always that handful of brands on the one side of the normal distribution curve where we don't have enough of them, and we don't talk much about the other end of the normal distribution curve where we've made too many of something. But overall, we tend to do well in the middle of the product line.

Maybe, I could talk a little bit about our capital deployment here. First, I'd like to help you with yearend cash. We started the year with about $1.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet.

Additionally, at this point, we do not expect to factor domestic receivables in the fourth quarter. In past years, we have typically factored about $300 million of domestic receivables each fourth quarter. The net impact of the recent debt issuance and our decision not to factor receivables in 2010 should result in a favorable impact to our yearend 2010 cash balances of approximately $200 million. And again, we intend to pay down $260 million of long-term debt that matures over the next year.
Moving on to capital deployment for 2010, we have continued to execute based upon our capital investment framework. We can use our excess cash to reinvest in the business, make strategic acquisitions or return funds to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Consistent with this framework, in the first nine months of 2010, we repurchased 7 million shares of our total stock at a total cost of $153 million, and that included 2 million shares in Q3 for $43 million. As most of you probably know, our Board of Directors will consider the payment of the dividend in November, remain committed to deploying capital, build shareholder value just as we have done for the last 10 years.

Most toys cost under $20 at retail. And certainly the bestselling toy on an individual unit basis is a Hot Wheels car that for many retailers still sells for less than $1.
The sweet spot for toys tends to be in that $10 to $20 range. The majority of toys are in that range. But on an incremental basis, particularly late in the year as we get close to Christmas, the big track sets go, the big Fisher-Price items go, the big Dollhouses go, and those tend to be the things in the $50 to $100 range.
And as we look back, you'd remember last year, we had in our judgment and based on our analysis, too many of those Fisher-Price items priced in the $60 to $100 range. This year, we're down to a couple in that range, things like the BIGFOOT which is a big seller. We'll probably run out of that. iXL, which is a big seller. And really those are the only couple of items that are really highest price point.
The majority of the key drivers in Fisher-Price have been retooled, they have been reengineered to sell for lower prices at still attractive margins.

I remember walking through New York city on Michigan Avenue would have been four and a half years ago, talking about this. So congratulations. Anyway, you know I won' specifically answer lines or size of business in individual lines. But Cars is a big deal. Let me put it in some perspective for you.
Toy Story is a big deal, we and Disney and retailers have had high expectations for Toy Story. And as you're seeing, those are being realized. That said, on a nine month year-to-date basis this year, our Cars shipments are this year four years after the movie only about 10% lower than what we've shipped on Toy Story. That gap will widen in the forth quarter because of the DVD release for Toy Story 3.
But in fact, four years after we've had the big entertainment, Cars is still a big deal. And despite all the attention Toy Story and a lot of other entertainment properties, that business is still growing at Pos this year is up on Cars. So the bottomline is Disney and Pixar create terrific brands and we're thrilled to partner with them. And I think Cars is going to be a big deal next year just like it already is today.

Number one, as you know, we started this year and finished last year and the fourth quarter with insufficient inventories. We just want sufficiently filling orders certainly at the beginning of this year for our customers. And that's our responsibility is to have enough goods to fill the orders. And so we've been in catch-up mode with our inventory.
Number two, you know as we talked about last quarter, the supply chain was slower and has taken us longer to get the goods in, but we've now got the goods. Number three, there are at least some retailers who are really betting on a late Christmas and they want the goods later this year than normal, and we're holding the goods for longer than normal.
And number four, if you really go back to 2008-2007, our inventories are right about in line with where they were then. We've got more business today, particularly as we picked up things like WWE and Toy Story and Thomas. But our inventories are back to what I would think of as a reasonably normal level. So some of it is clearly related to in the tight times with all the anxiety about last year's holiday season, we didn't make enough goods, but this year we have.

That said, certainly if you look at starting last year, particularly infant/pre-school section Wal-Mart has added some house brands in that department and that cut into our Fisher-Price business. At the same time, my expectation is Wal-Mart is going to be quite aggressive for this holiday season. We've seen what they did in Mexico where we have a significant toy business and a significant toy business with them. And I think they're going to flex their space this fourth quarter and be strong in the toy business. But, we'll have to see is how it plays out.

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the business, while the all-important holiday season still lies ahead. We remain on track to deliver solid revenue and profit growth, driven by our portfolio",903,"Thank you, Dianne, and good morning, everyone. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the business, while the all-important holiday season still lies ahead. We remain on track to deliver solid revenue and profit growth, driven by our portfolio of brands across various countries and regions. As said, there are still some challenges ahead in relation to the biggest selling season for toys. After scrutinizing what was written about the Back-to-School season, the consensus seems to be that's sales came, but they came late with analysts surmising that consumers are still cautious about the economy, and therefore purchasing closer to the actual event or need than in previous seasons. As such, retailers remain guarded with inventories and several are betting on a late holiday season this year.
So anticipating the question I'm asked most often during this time of year, yes, there will be a Christmas and Mattel toys will be under the tree and will likely sell more toys than anyone else. That said, I suspect it'll play out later than we are accustomed to. As we move into the all-important holiday season, toy industry gurus, as well as our retailer customers have named Mattel and Fisher-Price toys to their must-have holiday toy lists, including Barbie Video Girl, Monster High dolls, Sing-A-Ma-Jigs!, Loops, Hot Wheels Stealth Rides, Dance Star Mickey, iXL, Imaginext BIGFOOT and a variety toys from the Toy Story 3 line, as well as our My American Girl and the 2010 Girl of the Year doll Lanie. 
And speaking of American Girl, beginning the week of October 18, the brand's first ever product-focused national television commercial is scheduled to air and features the new My American Girl line of contemporary dolls, books and accessories, as well as American Girl's new interactive online world, interstaru.com.
In Barbie's world, our I CAN BE campaign continues to excel worldwide in our new Barbie entertainment strategy, which is focused on more relevant and contemporary stories in themes has proven quite successful this year. Our spring release, Barbie in A Mermaid Tale resonated with girls. And our fall offering, Barbie A Fashion Fairytale is just starting to hit shelves. 
Monster High sales are up to a strong start across multiple categories, including toys, apparel, accessories and costumes. Both the Justice and Party City retail chains report strong sell-through of Monster High merchandise, and Party City reports that Monster High costumes are in its top 10 for kids' costumes. The Monster High Hardcover, twin chapter book, written by New York Times bestseller Lisi Harrison, is now number five on the New York Times children's bestseller list, and that's only after one month of being on the shelves. 
And on Halloween, Nickelodeon will be airing a special 22-minute episode of Monster High, featuring the music of American Idol contestant, Allison Iraheta. Disney Princess is having an excellent year, driven by an expansion in themes and play patterns, as well a full line, supporting Disney's next major princess theatrical release, Tangled, which hits theaters this November. 
Disney/Pixar's Toy Story 3 now the biggest animated film of all time in global box office continues to drive strong sales across figures, vehicles, play sets, role play dolls and games. Toy Story 3 will release on DVD, November 2, and we expect retailers to continue to strongly support the property through that period and well into 2011 as Disney continues to drive the franchise as an evergreen property. 
Sales on Hot Wheels have been strong on the basic car, Monster Jam and Color Shifters lines. And this year, we're seeing growth for our cars across a broader array of accounts than ever before, including grocery and drug stores. The business overseas is also doing well. 
Our overall Games business is up, and we're experiencing good momentum on all of our core brands, like to UNO, Apples to Apples, Blokus, Mad Gab, Pictionary. And I'd like to highlight the strong of performance kid and preschool games, led by Whac-A-Mole, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and our Thomas the Tank Engine games. Included in games is Radica, which is experiencing nice growth, driven by strong second year sales of Mindflex, as well as new entries, like Puppy Tweets and Loops, which is off to an incredible start and has shown up on almost every hot toy list in the U.S. so far. 
In the world of Fisher-Price, there are some bright spots, as Thomas and Friends was performing above expectations globally. Dora the Explorer has rebounded by a ceiling in the U.S. during the Nickelodeon's 10th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on television and at a retail in August. Additionally, Fisher-Price is running a more focused television ad campaign this fall in the U.S., which we've shifted later back to just starting to debut now, as we believe consumers will be shopping later than usual for this holiday season.
 
And as I said last year and still rings through today, I pretty appreciate that many families will have to make choices this year when it comes to buying toys for their children. I'm convinced that Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and American Girl and some of our newer introductions, like Monster High, Sing-A-Ma-Jigs! and Loops will provide superior value for parents and great play experiences for the kids. 
At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will you through a financial review of the quarter. Kevin?"

I'll begin my review of the third quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today's press release. 
Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter increased 2%, including a three percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Total worldwide gross sales on a year-to-date basis increased 7%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. U.S. sales were up 3% and international sales were up 2%, including a seven percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, driven primarily by exchange rate changes in Venezuela.
On a regional basis, sales in Europe were up 3%, including an eight percentage point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were down 6%, including an 11 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, driven primarily by exchange rate changes in Venezuela. And sales in Asia Pacific were up 13%, including a three percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. 
I will now review our core categories and brands for the third quarter. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands were up 8%, including a four percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. Worldwide Barbie sales were up 6%, including a five percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in the U.S. were up 16% and Barbie sales in international markets were flat, including a seven percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide sales of Other Girls Brands were up 7%, including a four percentage point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in the U.S. were up 12%, while international sales of Other Girls Brands were up 3%, including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. The worldwide sales increase was driven primarily by higher sales of Disney Princesses and the launch of Monster High, partially offset by sales declines in Little Mommy, Polly Pocket and High School Musical.
Worldwide sales in the wheels category were down 5%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide sales reflected sales declines in Tyco R/C.
For core Hot Wheels, worldwide sales were down three percentage points, including a three percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Domestic sales decreased 7%, driven primarily by declines in sales of track sets and play sets. Sales in international markets increased 1%, including a five percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide sales in our Entertainment business, which includes games and puzzles and Radica increased 23%, including a six percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. The overall increase in Entertainment business was primarily attributable to sales of toys geared to Toy Story 3 and WWE Wrestling. 
Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Brands decreased 5%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. International sales of Fisher-Price Brands decreased 1%, including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange and sales in the U.S. declined 7%.
Worldwide core Fisher-Price decreased 10%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. U.S. sales of Fisher-Price core declined 13%, while international sales were down 5%, including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Friends increased 16%, which included a four percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. were up 19%, while international sales were up 12%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. The overall increase in Fisher-Price Friends was primarily driven by sales of product supporting Thomas and Friends and the launch of Sing-A-Ma-Jigs!, partially offset by sales declines of Sesame Street and certain smaller licensed properties.
American Girl Brands. Sales of American Girl Brands were up 2%, primarily reflecting strong sales of, Felicity dolls, Lanie the Girl of the Year doll and the benefit of two new store openings in Denver and Kansas City.
Now let's review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Our gross margin in this year's third quarter was 51.1% as compared to last year's margin of 51.3%. Decline was primarily due to higher royalties in input costs, partially offset by price increases and mix.
Advertising expense was $201.6 million, 11% of net sales flat with third quarter of last year. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $7.7 million to $377.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 20.6% compared to 21.5% last year. The year-on-year decrease is primarily driven by lower severance charges and savings related to our Global Cost Leadership initiative, partially offset by higher employee-related costs and asset impairments of $8 million for the house of Barbie. 
In SG&A, Global Cost Leadership savings of $8 million were partially offset by a severance charge of $2 million. In the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership program delivered overall net savings of approximately $12 million, bringing the cumulative net savings to $194 million. In addition to the $6 million net savings reflected in SG&A, there were savings of roughly $1 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in advertising. We are on track to deliver cumulative net savings slightly above the high end of our target range of $180 million to $200 million from this program by the end of 2010. 
Operating income during the quarter was $358.6 million compared to operating income of $336.5 million last year. The improvement was driven by higher sales and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by product recall impact of $7.6 million and higher advertising. 
Interest expense was $13.8 million versus $19.3 million in 2009. The decrease in interest expense versus last year is primarily due to lower average rates and lower average borrowings. 
As you know, on September 28, we issued $250 million senior unsecured notes due 2020 and $250 million senior unsecured notes due 2040. We use these funds for general corporate purposes, including paying off $260 million of long-term debt maturities over the next year.
Interest income was $1.8 million versus $1.5 million last year. The higher interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances during the quarter, partially offset by lower average investment rates. 
Other non-operating income expense was zero versus an expense of $14.1 million in 2009. This quarter's income tax provision was $63.3 million compared to prior year's expense of $74.8 million. This quarter's income tax provision included net discrete tax benefits of $16.8 million or $0.05 per share.
We currently estimate that 2010 full year effective tax rate to be 23% to 24%, excluding discrete items. Overall, we reported net income of $283.3 million or $0.77 per share versus last year's net income of $229.8 million or $0.63 per share. 
Now turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow used for operations was $428 million as compared to $319 million for the first three quarters of 2009. The higher use is primarily driven by the decision not to factor domestic receivables and higher working capital requirements, partially offset by higher net income. 
Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $961 million, up from $324 million in the prior year. The higher cash balance at the end of the third quarter of 2010 was primarily due to a higher beginning cash balance of $1.117 billion this year versus $618 million last year and higher long-term borrowings, partially offset by lower short-term borrowings and the decision not to factor receivables.
During the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $21.49 per share, a total cost of approximately $42 million. Receivables were $1.55 billion or 76 days of sales outstanding, three days higher than last year. Factoring of domestic receivables decreased from $126 million in 2009 to zero in 2010. Prior to factoring days sales outstanding decreased four days. During the first nine months of 2010, we made the decision not to factor domestic receivables due to our current cash position and the availability of lower-cost funding alternatives. At this point, we do not expect to factor domestic receivables in the fourth quarter.
Inventories at $741 million were up $135 million or 22% versus 2009. Our third quarter inventories were more in line with levels experience in 2007 and 2008 prior to the global economic decline. Our total balance sheet debt increased by $296 million from the prior year, reflecting a recent debt issuance of $500 million, partially offset by payment of $50 million of maturing medium-term debt and $154 million reduction of short-term borrowings. Our debt to total capital ratio ended the quarter at 29.8% as compared to 27.6% at the end of last year's third quarter. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $37.6 million, up from last year's third quarter of $28.6 million. 
So to summarize, as Bob mentioned, we remain on track to have a good year. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and year end to deliver on our priorities, continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintain cost and expense controls and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow. 
That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator?"

Our shipments in the retailers here in the states were a bit soft late in the quarter. That wasn't the case in international markets. And from the supply-side standpoint, we're still struggling a bit with a few lines, mostly in Fisher-Price. But overall, our inventories have returned to normal levels, if you go back over the past couple of years. We do continue to see good performance in POS data. The NPD reports indicate that the toy industry is holding up well and we're continuing to gain share. I also think, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we'll have our share of the best-selling toys this year based on the various holiday toy lists. But if you look at our inventory levels at retail in the U.S., they have now fallen below year-ago levels. Despite last year being a tight year for us all and the fact that we have some new growing brands in our portfolio like WWE, Toy Story and Thomas. So how the holiday season is going to play out is still up in the air. We do know that some key retailers are betting on a late Christmas based in part on their experience during Back-to-School. And we also that we're in good shape in advertising and shelf space and merchandising commitments. So my own belief is the inventories will move. Christmas will come, consumers will show up and buy toys and we'll gain share both here and abroad."

And so we have retooled the price value architecture of this fall's key driver products, they're now hitting shelves and recognizing what both we and retailers think will be a late Christmas. We delayed the timing of our marketing programs on Fisher-Price. For example, last year on September, we ran 17 product ads on Fisher-Price and this September we ran five. So the marketing support has now kicked in. I've seen ads on TV for Fisher-Price in the last couple of days. The retail sales are a bit more encouraging in recent weeks, but it's still very early and I would describe it as the jury is still out until we read the holidays on Fisher-Price."

It's reasonably widespread across the major retailers. If we look at our overall retail inventory position as we measure it, based on what we ship into retailers and in the POS data that we get from them. Our inventories are now down sort of low- to mid-single digits versus a year ago. And last year's inventories at retail were quite low compared to normal years. If you exclude some of the new properties that we have, like Toy Story and WWE, the retail inventories right now are down double digits below what they were last year, and again last year was pretty tight. And I wouldn't isolate it to one or two retailers. I think several of the major retailers are betting on a late Christmas this year. We've aligned with them in terms of our support and our programs. And I think that's how it's going to play out. And the first part of your question, we're in the position that we're in a lot of this time of year where we do have some SKUs and some products where we're just not going to be able to fulfill demand. Monster High is a good example, it's gotten off to a terrific start. Justice has done well with it. Party City has done well with it. The toy retailers have done well with it. And it's unlikely that we're going to be able to keep up with demand for Monster High this year. There's always that handful of brands on the one side of the normal distribution curve, where we don't have enough of them. And we don't talk much about the other end of the normal distribution curve, where we made too many of something. But overall, we tend to do well in the middle of the product line."

Here's how we're thinking about our cash position at year-end 2010. We started the year with about $1.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As you know, in late September we issued about $500 million of senior unsecured notes giving the attractiveness of the debt markets and knowing that we had intend to pay down $260 million of long-term debt that matures over the next year, which is I previously stated is in June of '11 and October '11. Additionally, at this point, we do not expect to factor domestic receivables in the fourth quarter. In past years, we have typically factored about $300 million of domestic receivables each fourth quarter. The net impact of the recent debt issuance and our decision not to factor receivables in 2010 should result in a favorable impact to our year-end 2010 cash balances of approximately $200 million. And again, we intend to pay down $260 million of long-term debt that matures over the next year. Moving on to capital deployment for 2010, we have continued to execute based upon our capital investment framework. We can use our excess cash to reinvest in the business, make strategic acquisitions or return funds for our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with this framework, in the first nine months of 2010, we repurchased 7 million shares of our total stock at a total cost of $153 million and that included 2 million shares in Q3 for $43 million. As you know, as you most of you probably know, our Board of Directors will consider the payment of the dividend in November, we remained committed to deploying capital, build shareholder value just as we've done for the last 10 years."

I remember walking through New York City on Michigan Avenue would have been four and a half years ago talking about this.

We and Disney and retailers have had high expectations for Toy Story and as you're seeing, those are being realized. That said, on a nine-month year-to-date basis, this year our Cars shipments are this year, four years after the movie, only about 10% lower than what we've shipped on Toy Story. That gap will widen in the fourth quarter because of the DVD release for Toy Story 3. But in fact, four years after we've had the big entertainment, Cars is still a big deal.

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the business while the all-important holiday season still lies ahead. We remain on track to deliver solid revenue and profit growth, driven by our portfolio of brands across various countries and regions. As said, there are still some challenges ahead in relation to the biggest selling season for toys. After scrutinizing what was written about the Back-to-School season, the consensus seems to be that sales came, but they came late with analysts surmising that consumers are still cautious about the economy and therefore purchasing closer to the actual event or need than in previous seasons. As such, retailers remain guarded with inventories and several are betting on a late holiday season this year.
So anticipating the question I'm asked most often during this time of year, yes, there will be a Christmas, and Mattel toys will be under the tree, and weÕll likely sell more toys than anyone else. That said, I suspect it'll play out later than we are accustomed to. As we move into the all-important holiday season, toy industry gurus as well as our retailer customers have named Mattel and Fisher-Price toys to their must-have holiday toy lists, including Barbie Video Girl, Monster High dolls, Sing-A-Ma-Jigs!, Loops, Hot Wheels Stealth Rides, Dance Star Mickey, iXL, Imaginext BIGFOOT and a variety toys from the Toy Story 3 line, as well as our My American Girl and the 2010 Girl of the Year doll Lanie. 
And speaking of American Girl, beginning the week of October 18, the brand's first ever product-focused national television commercial is scheduled to air and features the new My American Girl line of contemporary dolls, books and accessories, as well as American Girl's new interactive online world, interstaru.com.
In Barbie's world, our I CAN BE campaign continues to excel worldwide in our new Barbie entertainment strategy, which is focused on more relevant and contemporary stories and themes, has proven quite successful this year. Our spring release, Barbie in A Mermaid Tale resonated with girls. And our fall offering, Barbie A Fashion Fairytale is just starting to hit shelves. 
Monster High sales are up to a strong start across multiple categories, including toys, apparel, accessories and costumes. Both the Justice and Party City retail chains report strong sell-through of Monster High merchandise, and Party City reports that Monster High costumes are in its top 10 for kids' costumes. The Monster High Hardcover, twin chapter book, written by New York Times bestseller Lisi Harrison, is now number five on the New York Times children's bestseller list, and that's only after one month of being on the shelves. 
And on Halloween, Nickelodeon will be airing a special 22-minute episode of Monster High, featuring the music of American Idol contestant, Allison Iraheta. Disney Princess is having an excellent year driven by an expansion in themes and play patterns, as well a full line supporting Disney's next major princess theatrical release, Tangled, which hits theaters this November. 
Disney/Pixar's Toy Story 3, now the biggest animated film of all time in global box office continues to drive strong sales across figures, vehicles, play sets, role play dolls and games. Toy Story 3 will release on DVD November 2, and we expect retailers to continue to strongly support the property through that period and well into 2011 as Disney continues to drive the franchise as an evergreen property. 
Sales on Hot Wheels have been strong on the basic car, Monster Jam and Color Shifters lines. And this year, we're seeing growth for our cars across a broader array of accounts than ever before, including grocery and drug stores. The business overseas is also doing well. 
Our overall Games business is up, and we're experiencing good momentum on all our core brands, like to UNO, Apples to Apples, Blokus, Mad Gab, and Pictionary. And I'd like to highlight the strong of performance kid and preschool games, led by Whac-A-Mole, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and our Thomas the Tank Engine games. Included in games is Radica, which is experiencing nice growth driven by strong second year sales of Mindflex, as well as new entries, like Puppy Tweets and Loops, which is off to an incredible start and has shown up on almost every hot toy list in the U.S. so far. 
In the world of Fisher-Price, there are some bright spots, as Thomas and Friends is performing above expectations globally. Dora the Explorer has rebounded nicely in the U.S. during the Nickelodeon's 10th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on television and at retail in August. Additionally, Fisher-Price is running a more focused television ad campaign this fall in the U.S., which we've shifted later Ð in fact, itÕs just starting to debut now -- as we believe consumers will be shopping later than usual for this holiday season.
 
And as I said last year and still rings true today, I appreciate that many families will have to make choices this year when it comes to buying toys for their children. I'm convinced that Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and American Girl and some of our newer introductions, like Monster High, Sing-A-Ma-Jigs! and Loops will provide superior value for parents and great play experiences for the kids. 
At this time, I'd like to introduce Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr, who will take you through a financial review of the quarter. Kevin?"

I'll begin my review of the third quarter with a discussion of worldwide gross sales shown on Exhibit 2 of today's press release. 
Total worldwide gross sales for the quarter increased 2%, including a three percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Total worldwide gross sales on a year-to-date basis increased 7%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. U.S. sales were up 3% and international sales were up 2%, including a seven percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, driven primarily by exchange rate changes in Venezuela.
On a regional basis, sales in Europe were up 3%, including an eight percentage point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in Latin America were down 6%, including an 11 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, driven primarily by exchange rate changes in Venezuela. And sales in Asia Pacific were up 13%, including a three percentage point positive impact from changes in exchange rates. 
I will now review our core categories and brands for the third quarter. Mattel Girls & Boys Brands. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands were up 8%, including a four percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. Worldwide Barbie sales were up 6%, including a five percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Barbie sales in the U.S. were up 16% and Barbie sales in international markets were flat, including a seven percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide sales of Other Girls Brands were up 7%, including a four percentage point negative impact from exchange rates. Sales in the U.S. were up 12%, while international sales of Other Girls Brands were up 3%, including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. The worldwide sales increase was driven primarily by higher sales of Disney Princesses and the launch of Monster High, partially offset by sales declines in Little Mommy, Polly Pocket and High School Musical.
Worldwide sales in the wheels category were down 5%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide sales reflected sales declines in Tyco R/C.
For core Hot Wheels, worldwide sales were down three percentage points, including a three percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Domestic sales decreased 7%, driven primarily by declines in sales of track sets and play sets. Sales in international markets increased 1%, including a five percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.
Worldwide sales in our Entertainment business, which includes games and puzzles and Radica increased 23%, including a six percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. The overall increase in Entertainment business was primarily attributable to sales of toys geared to Toy Story 3 and WWE Wrestling. 
Fisher-Price Brands. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Brands decreased 5%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates. International sales of Fisher-Price Brands decreased 1%, including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange and sales in the U.S. declined 7%.
Worldwide core Fisher-Price decreased 10%, including a two percentage point negative impact from changes in exchange rates. U.S. sales of Fisher-Price core declined 13%, while international sales were down 5%, including a six percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Friends increased 16%, which included a four percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of Fisher-Price Friends in the U.S. were up 19%, while international sales were up 12%, including a 10 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. The overall increase in Fisher-Price Friends was primarily driven by sales of products supporting Thomas and Friends and the launch of Sing-A-Ma-Jigs!, partially offset by sales declines of Sesame Street and certain smaller licensed properties.
American Girl Brands. Sales of American Girl Brands were up 2%, primarily reflecting strong sales of Felicity dolls, Lanie the Girl of the Year doll and the benefit of two new store openings in Denver and Kansas City.
Now let's review the P&L, which is shown on Exhibit 1. Our gross margin in this year's third quarter was 51.1% as compared to last year's margin of 51.3%. The decline was primarily due to higher royalties in input costs, partially offset by price increases and mix.
Advertising expense was $201.6 million, 11% of net sales flat with third quarter of last year. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $7.7 million to $377.3 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 20.6% compared to 21.5% last year. The year-on-year decrease is primarily driven by lower severance charges and savings related to our Global Cost Leadership initiative, partially offset by higher employee-related costs and asset impairments of $8 million for the house of Barbie. 
In SG&A, Global Cost Leadership savings of $8 million were partially offset by a severance charge of $2 million. In the quarter, our Global Cost Leadership program delivered overall net savings of approximately $12 million, bringing the cumulative net savings to $194 million. In addition to the $6 million net savings reflected in SG&A, there were savings of roughly $1 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in advertising. We are on track to deliver cumulative net savings slightly above the high end of our target range of $180 million to $200 million from this program by the end of 2010. 
Operating income during the quarter was $358.6 million compared to operating income of $336.5 million last year. The improvement was driven by higher sales and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by product recall impact of $7.6 million and higher advertising. 
Interest expense was $13.8 million versus $19.3 million in 2009. The decrease in interest expense versus last year is primarily due to lower average rates and lower average borrowings. 
As you know, on September 28, we issued $250 million senior unsecured notes due 2020 and $250 million senior unsecured notes due 2040. We use these funds for general corporate purposes, including paying off $260 million of long-term debt maturities over the next year.
Interest income was $1.8 million versus $1.5 million last year. The higher interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances during the quarter, partially offset by lower average investment rates. 
Other non-operating income expense was zero versus an expense of $14.1 million in 2009. This quarter's income tax provision was $63.3 million compared to prior year's expense of $74.8 million. This quarter's income tax provision included net discrete tax benefits of $16.8 million or $0.05 per share.
We currently estimate that 2010 full year effective tax rate to be 23% to 24%, excluding discrete items. Overall, we reported net income of $283.3 million or $0.77 per share versus last year's net income of $229.8 million or $0.63 per share. 
Now turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow used for operations was $428 million as compared to $319 million for the first three quarters of 2009. The higher use is primarily driven by the decision not to factor domestic receivables and higher working capital requirements, partially offset by higher net income. 
Our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $961 million, up from $324 million in the prior year. The higher cash balance at the end of the third quarter of 2010 was primarily due to a higher beginning cash balance of $1.117 billion this year versus $618 million last year and higher long-term borrowings partially offset by lower short-term borrowings and the decision not to factor receivables.
During the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $21.49 per share, a total cost of approximately $42 million. Receivables were $1.55 billion or 76 days of sales outstanding, three days higher than last year. Factoring of domestic receivables decreased from $126 million in 2009 to zero in 2010. Prior to factoring days sales outstanding decreased four days. During the first nine months of 2010, we made the decision not to factor domestic receivables due to our current cash position and the availability of lower-cost funding alternatives. At this point, we do not expect to factor domestic receivables in the fourth quarter.
Inventories at $741 million were up $135 million or 22% versus 2009. Our third quarter inventories were more in line with levels experience in 2007 and 2008 prior to the global economic decline. Our total balance sheet debt increased by $296 million from the prior year, reflecting a recent debt issuance of $500 million, partially offset by payment of $50 million of maturing medium-term debt and $154 million reduction of short-term borrowings. Our debt to total capital ratio ended the quarter at 29.8% as compared to 27.6% at the end of last year's third quarter. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $37.6 million, up from last year's third quarter of $28.6 million. 
So to summarize, as Bob mentioned, we remain on track to have a good year. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and year end to deliver on our priorities, continued core brand momentum, maximize the opportunities surrounding our new entertainment properties, maintain cost and expense controls and deliver another strong year of profits and cash flow. 
That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator?"

Our shipments in the retailers here in the states were a bit soft late in the quarter. That wasn't the case in international markets. And from a supply-side standpoint, we're still struggling a bit with a few lines, mostly in Fisher-Price. But overall, our inventories have returned to normal levels, if you go back over the past couple of years. We do continue to see good performance in POS data. The NPD reports indicate that the toy industry is holding up well and we're continuing to gain share. I also think, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we'll have our share of the best-selling toys this year based on the various holiday toy lists. But if you look at our inventory levels at retail in the U.S., they have now fallen below year-ago levels, despite last year being a tight year for us all and the fact that we have some new growing brands in our portfolio like WWE, Toy Story and Thomas. So how the holiday season is going to play out is still up in the air. We do know that some key retailers are betting on a late Christmas based in part on their experience during Back-to-School. We also know that we're in good shape in advertising and shelf space and merchandising commitments. So my own belief is the inventories will move. Christmas will come, consumers will show up and buy toys and we'll gain share both here and abroad."

It's reasonably widespread across the major retailers. If we look at our overall retail inventory position as we measure it, based on what we ship into retailers and in the POS data that we get from them, our inventories are now down sort of low- to mid-single digits versus a year ago. And last year's inventories at retail were quite low compared to normal years. If you exclude some of the new properties that we have, like Toy Story and WWE, the retail inventories right now are down double digits below what they were last year, and again last year was pretty tight. And I wouldn't isolate it to one or two retailers. I think several of the major retailers are betting on a late Christmas this year. We've aligned with them in terms of our support and our programs. And I think that's how it's going to play out. And the first part of your question, we're in the position that we're in a lot of this time of year where we do have some SKUs and some products where we're just not going to be able to fulfill demand. Monster High is a good example. It's gotten off to a terrific start. Justice has done well with it. Party City has done well with it. The toy retailers have done well with it. And it's unlikely that we're going to be able to keep up with demand for Monster High this year. There's always that handful of brands on the one side of the normal distribution curve where we don't have enough of them. And we don't talk much about the other end of the normal distribution curve, where we made too many of something. But overall, we tend to do well in the middle of the product line."

Here's how we're thinking about our cash position at year-end 2010. We started the year with about $1.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As you know, in late September we issued about $500 million of senior unsecured notes given the attractiveness of the debt markets and knowing that we had intend to pay down $260 million of long-term debt that matures over the next year, which is I previously stated is in June of '11 and October '11. Additionally, at this point, we do not expect to factor domestic receivables in the fourth quarter. In past years, we have typically factored about $300 million of domestic receivables each fourth quarter. The net impact of the recent debt issuance and our decision not to factor receivables in 2010 should result in a favorable impact to our year-end 2010 cash balances of approximately $200 million. And again, we intend to pay down $260 million of long-term debt that matures over the next year. Moving on to capital deployment for 2010, we have continued to execute based upon our capital investment framework. We can use our excess cash to reinvest in the business, make strategic acquisitions or return funds for our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with this framework, in the first nine months of 2010, we repurchased 7 million shares of our total stock at a total cost of $153 million and that included 2 million shares in Q3 for $43 million. As you know, as you most of you probably know, our Board of Directors will consider the payment of the dividend in November, remain committed to deploying capital, build shareholder value just as we've done for the last 10 years."

The majority of the key drivers in Fisher-Price have been retooled, they have been re-engineered to sell for lower prices at still attractive margins."

I remember walking through New York City on Michigan Avenue, would have been four and a half years ago talking about this. I won't specifically answer the lines, size of business in individual lines, but Cars is a big deal. Let me put it in some perspective for you. Toy Story is a big deal. We and Disney and retailers have had high expectations for Toy Story and as you're seeing, those are being realized. That said, on a nine-month year-to-date basis this year, our Cars shipments are this year, four years after the movie, only about 10% lower than what we've shipped on Toy Story. That gap will widen in the fourth quarter because of the DVD release for Toy Story 3. But in fact, four years after we've had the big entertainment, Cars is still a big deal. And despite all the attention, Toy Story and a lot of other entertainment properties, that business is still growing at POS. The year-to-date POS this year is up on Cars. So the bottom line is Disney and Pixar create terrific brands, and we're thrilled to partner with them. And I think Cars is going to be a big deal next year just like it already is today."

Number three, there are at least some retailers who are really betting on a late Christmas, and they want the goods later this year than normal and we're holding the goods for longer than normal. And number four, if you really go back to, I'm going to say, 2008, 2007, our inventories are right about in line with where they were then. We've got more business today, particularly as we've pick up things like WWE and Toy Story and Thomas. But our inventories are back to what I would think of as a reasonably normal level.
