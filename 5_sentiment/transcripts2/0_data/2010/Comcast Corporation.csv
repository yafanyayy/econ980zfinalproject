Today, we are pleased to report healthy operating and financial results that demonstrate the underlying strength of our subscription businesses and our ability to continue to manage effectively in a challenging",1040,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are pleased to report healthy operating and financial results that demonstrate the underlying strength of our subscription businesses and our ability to continue to manage effectively in a challenging environment. In 2009, consolidated revenue grew 4% and cash flow increased by 4.4%. We generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow and showed a very strong increase of 21% in that category. This reflects our focus on expense and capital management. We continue to be able to reduce the capital intensity of our Cable business, even as we invest in key strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position now and in the future. From an operating standpoint, despite a combination of a weak economy and increasing competition in video, we added 1.5 million net new customers between Video, High-Speed Data and Voice. Business Services, a new high-growth area for us, was a significant driver in 2009, and the advertising market, which went backwards for most of the year, seem to solidify toward the end of the year.  So as we review 2009, I think you will see that we executed well, fine tuning our operating strategy during the year to balance revenue, cash flow and customer growth to deliver solid results.As you all know, just two months ago, we announced the NBC Universal transaction with GE. And last week, we made our public interest filing at the FCC [Federal Communication Commission]. Beyond that, we are beginning the planning process and remain very excited about the prospects of this transaction and the opportunity to accelerate value creation for our shareholders.Steve Burke is leading this effort for Comcast to maximize the opportunities available from the combination of cable and content assets. Given Steve's new focus, I'm delighted that Neil Smith will be joining Comcast in March as President of Comcast Cable. Neil is an incredibly-talented executive, with significant cable, Internet and consumer products experience and is a terrific addition to our already-strong cable management team. Like Steve and me, and Dave Watson and Dave Scott, Neil strongly believes in our goal to deliver the best customer experience in the marketplace, driving meaningful innovation and dramatically expanding the products and features we offer our customers. To do that, we have been aggressively rolling out All-Digital and Wideband. These are initiatives that are central to our strategy, and so we're investing about $1 billion in these two projects between 2009 and 2010. And we've made rapid progress deploying these technologies and new products that follow the roll out. So for instance, we are actively deploying All-Digital in about 60% of our markets, recapturing and more efficiently using our bandwidth. As we go All-Digital, we offer consumers in those markets 100 or more high-depth channels. We double the amount of foreign-language programming available to between 50 and 70 channels per market. We also significantly increased the amount of content available on demand to nearly 20,000 choices, with 3,000 HD options available to our digital customers each month.In December, we launched On Demand Online nationally, with over 19,000 TV and movie choices, adding a valuable benefit to our customers' cable subscription. We also finished 2009 with Wideband capability in 75% of our footprint, reinforcing our leadership position in broadband. Deploying Wideband gives us significant capacity to deliver higher Internet speeds that continue to differentiate our broadband product. It provides us an additional speed advantage, particularly in the 85% of the country without fiber-based competition. Each of these initiatives helps to strengthen our competitive position now and in the future and helps us make progress toward our vision of Project Infinity:  Giving consumers more content anytime, anywhere.So as we complete the roll out of Wideband and All-Digital and launch new services, we're not only repositioning the company technically, we're beginning to reposition the company with the consumer, demonstrating how the technical and product investments we have made and redefine how customers experience video, voice and the Internet. Beginning next week in 11 markets, we will introduce XFINITY, a new brand that encompasses our robust technology platform, expanded services we're offering today and the future innovations we are planning to deliver. In the next few months, we will launch XFINITY to almost half of our footprint, and we will reach the majority of our markets by the end of this year. XFINITY services will continue to evolve, but the important message to our customers is that Comcast is innovating in all our products across many platforms, giving these customers even more choice and control over the entertainment, communications and information they want.If you'll turn with me to the next slide, as we begin 2010, our goal is to continue to deliver and drive profitable growth. We have increasingly diverse revenue streams, with strong subscription businesses and increasing opportunities to leverage the robust network to make our products even more distinct and to build new businesses and new growth opportunities. As Steve and Michael will discuss, we're focused on balancing revenue, OCF and customer growth, while managing expenses and capital, so that we can generate significant free cash flow. The same time, we are not sacrificing investment in areas that significantly strengthen our competitive position or that offer future growth potential. So we expect to substantially complete our Wideband initiative early in 2010 and to substantially complete All-Digital by the end of this year. We plan to significantly expand wireless High-Speed 2go to many new markets in the new year. And we are now building on our strong momentum in Business Services to expand the customers we target and our offerings in that space. We will also continue to invest in our network, extending our technical capabilities even further, more widely deploying EBIF [Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format] technology for instance to support interactive TV and advertising. And through our newly-formed Comcast Labs, we will focus on extending and integrating IP technology in order to improve the customer experience, accelerate the pace at which we introduce new products, expand our cross-platform experiences. So therefore, I believe we are well positioned to continue to build a company that provides great products to consumers and creates long-term value for our shareholders. Let me now pass to Michael to review our results in more detail."
173341,83498574,48183,"Comcast Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-03-2010",2010-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Good morning. As Brian mentioned, 2009 was a year of strong financial and operational progress. We reported solid results and executed well, as we aggressively navigated the changing economic and competitive landscape and remained focuse",2643,"Thank you, Brian. Good morning. As Brian mentioned, 2009 was a year of strong financial and operational progress. We reported solid results and executed well, as we aggressively navigated the changing economic and competitive landscape and remained focused on profitable growth, as well as gained more efficiencies in our expense base and capital  program. We established our plans on an annual basis, so let's begin by reviewing Slide 5, which shows the company's consolidated result for the full year of 2009. For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 3.9% to $35.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 4.4% to $13.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.4%, a modest increase when compared to 38.1% during 2008.  In addition to growing our revenue and operating cash flow, we're also very focused on free cash flow per share, free cash flow and earnings per share as critical metrics in evaluating our earnings growth and the strength of our company. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the full year reflects meaningful progress and growth.On a full year basis, free cash flow increased 21% to $4.4 billion compared to $3.7 billion in 2008. And free cash flow per share increased 23% to $1.53 per share. Over the past year, we have converted 32% of our operating cash flow into free cash flow compared to a conversion rate of 28% in 2008 and 20% in 2007.We generated earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of 46.5% over 2008. 2009's EPS reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, lower interest expense due to lower net debt and a reduced effective tax rate, resulting from the recognition of income tax benefits during the year.  For 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40%. Broadly speaking, our results for the full year represent a balanced strategy and solid performance. As we remain focused on executing our strategic, operational and financial plans, there are several areas that should be highlighted. We continue to manage the business for long-term profitable growth and endeavor to find the right  balance between revenue, cash flow and customer growth. This year, we made adjustments during the year and delivered solid customer metrics across all products, despite an incredibly-difficult consumer environment and a substantially-larger competitive overlap with the RBOCs. Cable advertising was also challenged in 2009, down $265 million for the year due to the poor economic environment and the lack of political advertising. However, we are experiencing some signs of improvement in advertising. In the fourth quarter, advertising revenue declined 7% versus the prior year. However, if we exclude political, advertising revenue actually increased 10%, a notable improvement from the 20% to 25% declines we experienced in the first half of 2009.Business Services has experienced real momentum over the past year, with revenue increasing 48% to $828 million for 2009. In 2010, we are again enthusiastic about Business Services' prospects and expect this momentum to continue as we begin to expand our services to medium-size businesses and sell backhaul. As we begin to execute our 2010 strategies, we are focused on delivering further growth in revenue, operating cash flow and free cash flow, as well as continued improvement in our capital efficiency.Let's review our consolidated fourth quarter results, so please refer to Slide 6.  For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 2.9% to $9.1 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 1.1% to $3.4 billion, resulting in consolidated operating cash flow margin of 37.6% compared to 38.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Capital expenditures were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 6% decrease compared to 2008. As expected, fourth quarter capital expenditures were higher than the previous three quarters, as we accelerated capital to take advantage of favorable tax treatment related to the Economic Stimulus and attractive vendor discounts. We generated consolidated free cash flow of $768 million, a decline of 11.1% over the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting lower net cash provided by operating activities as a result of changes in working capital and higher cash taxes, partially offset by lower CapEx. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 136% to $0.33 per share, reflecting lower interest expense and the recognition of income tax benefits. While I would like to spend the majority of this call discussing our full year results and our views for 2010, there are a few notable items I would like to highlight regarding the fourth quarter. Total Video revenue declined slightly by 0.6%, reflecting 199,000 decline in basic Video customers. And Video ARPU growth was 2%. This slowdown in Video ARPU growth is a result of more moderate rate increases in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the increases in the fourth quarter of 2008 and additional bundling in promotion. As we mentioned previously, mid-way through the year, we decided to proactively pursue market share by aggressively refocusing our marketing efforts on the Triple Play offer. As a result, we lost fewer Video subs compared to the last year's second half and reaccelerated growth in high-speed Internet in CDV in the second half of 2009. In addition, we have improved our performance competitively by taking share even as the RBOCs have meaningfully increase their footprint.From a segment standpoint, Cable operating cash flow increased 2% to $3.5 billion. Programming expense growth slowed slightly to 8%, and non-Programming expenses increased modestly, as we continue to aggressively manage our costs. In addition, we remain very focused on controlling expenses and gaining efficiencies and continue to adjust our cost structure. As a result, we are taking and absorbing an $81 million severance charge in the fourth quarter compared to a $63 million severance charge we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. Just a note, this charge is included in our OCF.Our Programming Division, which has been performing well, reported a 5% increase in revenue, but a 17% decline in operating cash flow, reflecting an expected increase in marketing cost to launch new shows and the recognition of higher Programming expenses in the fourth quarter. Corporate and Other revenue increased 14% to $138 million, reflecting strong results at CIM or Comcast Interactive Media and Comcast-Spectacor, but operating cash flow decreased 10%, as it includes $20 million of expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction.Now let's review our Cable division's full year results in more detail, so please refer to Slide 7. For the full year of 2009, Cable revenue increased 3.8% to $33.9 billion, reflecting continued growth in high-speed Internet, Voice and Business Services partially offset by slower growth in Video revenue and a decline in advertising revenue. As I mentioned, we had solid customer additions during the year, total Video, high-speed Internet and Voice customers increasing by $1.5 million in 2009, with 47 million Video, Internet and Voice customers.Total revenue per Video customer remained healthy during 2009, increasing 6% to over $118 per month. Total subscription revenue per customer, which excludes advertising, grew 7 1/2% to $113, reflecting the following components: Total Video revenue increased 1%, reflecting a 4% increase in Video ARPU and a decline in basic Video customers. During 2009, we lost 623,000 Video customers compared to 575,000 in 2008. The growth in Video ARPU reflects rate increases and continued growth in advanced services, as we added or upgraded over 1.4 million customers to HD and our HD, DVR services These benefits were partially offset by additional bundling and promotions, a decrease in pay revenue, as well as a shift in our video mix, as customers have subscribed to lower-price levels of our digital service. High-speed Internet revenue increased 7% during the year. ARPU remained stable at $42, and we had solid unit additions of over 1 million this year, with our HSI penetration now exceeding 31%.Voice revenue increased 23% for the year, reflecting continued growth in our customer base and a modest decline in ARPU to $39 per month. We added over 1.1 million voice customers this year. Now have over 7.6 million customers, with penetration for our Voice service now approximately 16%. We have made terrific progress in bundling, and at the end of 2009, almost 28% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 23% at the end of 2008. Overall, we remain focused on profitable and sustainable growth. And while we expect additional Video customer losses as the RBOC expand their overlap, we believe we will see penetration gains in our Digital HD and DVR services, high-speed Internet, Voice and Business Services during 2010.Please refer to Slide 8  to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. In 2009, Cable operating cash flow increased 4% to $13.7 billion, which was in line with top line growth and contributed to a stable operating cash flow margin of 40.4%. Over the past 12 months, total expenses in our Cable segment increased 3.7%, including a 9% increase in programming expenses. The increase in our programming expenses reflect higher rates, additional Digital programming costs as we increase our Digital customer base and new programming that has been added to our services. As we look to 2010, we expect programming expenses to grow, but at a slightly slower rate than in 2009.Excluding programming, our expense base increased only 1% in 2009, even as we incurred incremental operating expenses to support the digital transition in the first half of the year to deploy All-Digital, Wideband and Wireless and to improve the customer experience. Investment in these key strategic initiatives contributed to a 6% increase in customer service expense and a 5% increase in technical labor expense during the year.To offset these higher expenses, we continue to extract scale benefits and efficiencies in our high-speed Internet and Voice businesses. Compared to the full year of 2008, our direct cost for high-speed Internet declined 1%, and our Voice direct cost have decreased 17%. At the same time, we have managed a reduction in both our marketing and administrative expenses compared to 2008.As part of our focus on cost management and considering the difficult economic environment, we have been very focused on delinquencies and bad debt expense. In 2009, we were successful with this effort, particularly in the second half where we reduced our net bad debt expense versus 2008. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking an $81 million severance charge in the fourth quarter to account for further efficiencies and a reduction in staffing levels. As we begin 2010, we are also undergoing a company-wide initiative, which should result in improved efficiencies and increase our speed to market for new products and features. We call this program Challenge 2010, and Steve will cover this in more detail later in the call. Efficiency gained through this program will help support additional investments we're making in cross-platform or converged services, Business Services and wireless. Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures.  For the full year of 2009, our capital expenditures decreased 11% from $5.7 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion, reflecting slower growth and meaningful reductions in equipment pricing. As you can see on the slide, this represent a meaningful decrease in the business' capital intensity to 14.3% of revenue from 16.7% in 2008 and 19.7% in 2007. This progress was achieved even as we invested in All-Digital and Wideband strategic initiatives, supported growth in advanced Video services, high-speed Internet and Voice penetrations and increased our capital investment in Business Services by over 51% to over $350 million. Consistent with historical trends, capital expenditures for 2009 continued to be predominantly growth oriented, with growth CapEx accounting for over 70% of total Cable CapEx. To recap how our CapEx was deployed in 2009, we added over 1.5 million Video, Voice and Data customers. We deployed 8.8 million digital set-top boxes and adapters, bringing our total deployed to over 36 million. We deployed over 6.2 million digital adapters in 2009 to support the All-Digital roll out. Also included in this number were almost 2.2 million advanced HD and/or DVR set-tops, as we added over 1.4 million advanced service customers in 2009, which is actually an increase over 2008.We now have almost 9.2 million HD and/or DVR customers, and our advanced service penetration is approximately 50% of our total digital Video customers. We also purchased equipment as we accelerated DOCSIS 3.0 for our Wideband initiative. And as Brian mentioned, we have already deployed this technology to 75% of our footprint.In 2010, we anticipate our capital intensity to decrease further, as capital expenditures are expected to be lower, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. We expect improved CPE pricing and further capital efficiencies to be realized in 2010. This further reduction in CapEx will occur even as we invest in areas of future growth. In 2010, we will invest aggressively to sustain our momentum in Business Services and expand its reach to mid-size businesses and to sell backhaul. We will complete our deployment of Wideband in early 2010 and the All-Digital effort, by year end. We'll expand our wireless efforts, including the launch of wireless High-Speed 2go in a number of new markets. We will also fund several new initiatives through our newly-formed Comcast Labs that focuses in the areas of converged products, IP technology and switch digital video. And these investments in these new initiatives will be included in discretionary CapEx, who represent less than 5% of our total capital.Please refer to Slide 10. We are executing on a disciplined and returns-focused approach to allocating capital both internally and externally, with the intention of further growing free cash flow and free cash flow per share. In 2009, as I previously mentioned, we increased free cash flow to $4.4 billion, and this increase represents a 21% increase versus 2008 and an 89% increase over the past 24 months. As previously indicated by our initiatives, our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses, as it provides attractive incremental returns, enhances our competitive position and deliver sustainable, organic growth. When it comes to considering potential acquisitions or external investments, we will remain extremely disciplined and execution-oriented, focusing on opportunities that extend our services or add features that allow us to build new complimentary revenue streams. However, in 2010, we expect our energies in this area will be spent on planning for the NBC Universal transition. A key principle in our capital-allocation strategy has been to return capital directly to shareholders in a form of both dividends and share repurchases.Even during a difficult economic environment of 2009, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends, totaling $761 million for the year and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we repurchased 18.1 million of our common shares for $300 million. So on a full year 2009 basis, we purchased 49.8 million of our common shares for $765 million. Combined, this represents a total return of capital to shareholders of 35% of free cash flow.As I believe most of you are aware, in December, we announced a 40% increase in our dividend. Our second increase in a year, which was effective last month and increases our annual dividend payments to $0.378 per share. As of December 31, we had approximately $3.3 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And as we have previously announced, we intend to complete this repurchase subject to market conditions by the end of 2012.The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in a total payout ratio in excess of 50% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and places our payout ratio on a total return of capital basis at the top of our peers. In addition, based on the current stock price, this combined return of capital allocation represents an excess of a 5% yield. Now let me pass the call to Steve."

As you look at 2009, we delivered solid financial results and made progress operationally in the face of a challenging economy, increased competition with over 5 million more homes built by the RBOC, a decline in advertising revenue of 15% and continuing to invest in important initiatives, like the country's digital transition, our own All-Digital efforts, DOCSIS 3.0 and Business Services.On previous calls, we've talked about the balance between financial and unit growth. We made a number of mid-course corrections in the middle of 2009 to concentrate more on units in the second half. The good news is this mid-course correction worked. We increased our promotions and refocused our marketing efforts on the Triple Play. In the fourth quarter, we also decided to take fewer rate increases. In the fourth quarter of 2009, 6.8 million customers had Video rate increases versus the fourth quarter of 2008, with 16.2 million customers getting rate increases. The good news is that we got the units, which proves that we can go after market share by getting more aggressive.We're really pleased with our unit results. In the second half, we did better on basic subs compared to the second half of 2008 despite more competition. In the second half of 2009, we added 895,000 combination Video, Voice and Data customers versus in the first half of '09, adding 633,000. This was driven by very strong high-speed Internet ads. In the second half of 2009, we added 608,000 versus 393,000 in the first half of '09.The fourth quarter is also the second consecutive quarter where we added almost as many residential high-speed data customers in the quarter as AT&T and Verizon combined. The RBOC number is all-in for fiber and DSL. We also had stronger Voice ads in the second half and the first half. Overall, these efforts resulted in total revenue per customer remaining healthy during 2009, increasing 6% during the year to over $118 per customer per month.During the year, we also remained very focused on managing expenses. With Challenge 2010, we adopted a company-wide program to standardize and simplify processes, which not only resulted in improved efficiencies but also increased our speed to market for new products and features. Moving toward a more standardized operating model will help us be more efficient. We're consolidating call centers, introducing more robust IVRs to handle more customer inquiries, reducing the number of truck rolls, increasing self-installation from our hot drop [ph] program, consolidating warehouses and improving our inventory management. The bottom line is we're cutting cost and becoming more efficient, while at the same time, investing in new businesses and marketing. We're continuing to enhance our products' superiority and drive long-term growth in our business. Our All-Digital efforts continue to go very well. We've now deployed over 6 million digital adapters. We completed the All-Digital conversion efforts in 35% of our footprint and are currently active in about 60% of our footprint. And by the end of 2010, we expect 80% of our systems to have made the conversion to All-Digital.Once you go through this conversion, it creates network and operating efficiencies, which complement previously mentioned cost-reduction initiatives. For example, 80% of our customers have been using self install kits for their digital adapters. And once the home goes All-Digital, we're able to do a number of things that we couldn't do before. The first market that went All-Digital was Portland, our first major All-Digital market. And they were seeing a number of very encouraging trends. Our high-depth penetration is growing faster in Portland than most the of the other markets in the country now that we have 100 high-depth channels. Truck rolls are down significantly in the Portland market, and OCF is growing faster in this market than most others. Importantly, customer service scores have also improved markedly. Portland is really leading the pack.Moving on to DOCSIS 3.0, or wideband, we've deployed this technology to over 75% of our footprint, and plan to complete our DOCSIS 3.0 deployment in early 2010. DOCSIS 3.0 means we have a much faster High-Speed data product, particularly in the 85% of the country that doesn't have fiber-based competition. About 35 million homes in our footprint can purchase 50 meg with the ability for even higher speeds using wideband technology. In fact, Comcast now has more homes capable of providing 50-meg service than all the other cable and telephone companies combined. We believe speed will continue to power the next generation of applications and growth in high-speed Internet, and we're delighted to have made such good progress with DOCSIS 3.0.In 2009, we believe we laid the foundation for our technology platform to stay ahead of competition. As Brian mentioned, now that we're almost complete with repositioning ourselves technically, we're repositioning ourselves with the consumer. Therefore, we're launching XFINITY on February 12 in 11 markets. This is a major rebranding effort for Comcast cable. XFINITY gives the customer more choices, more convenience, more control over their entertainment and information and communication choices in more innovative ways. And we're really excited to introduce the XFINITY brand to our customers.Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest in future growth. In Business Services, we continue to have real success in the small end of the business market with a lot of room for growth. In fact, we've been growing this business, which is now quite sizable. Revenues have been growing 40% to 50% very consistently. Now we feel we're ready to expand our offering further, targeting companies with 20 to 250 employees, in other words, a larger company size than what previously we've been targeting. This segment of the business' market spends $10 billion to $15 billion per year on the services we offer, which represents another opportunity roughly equal in size to the small end of the market where we've been concentrating so far. So backhaul is another nice complementary business that can further leverage our network, and one we're actively pursuing. We size this business at roughly $1 billion for Comcast overtime.Moving on to wireless, we're now in the execution phase with our High-Speed 2go product. In 2009, we launched in five major markets. In July, we launched Portland. Atlanta launched in July as well. In November, we launched Philadelphia. Chicago launched in December, and Seattle launched in December as well. As of year end, we're offering the product in more than 9 million of our homes passed. We look to significantly expand that by the end of 2010. High-Speed 2go is sold in conjunction with our High-Speed data products, sold in a bundle, which makes a lot of sense for the consumer and is a straightforward transaction for us to process. We've proven in Portland that Comcast High-Speed 2go bundled with our High-Speed data product is a way to increase our High-Speed Data business. In Portland, roughly 40% of the High-Speed 2go customers are new High-Speed Internet customers for Comcast. Moving on to advertising, during 2009, as Mike mentioned, our Advertising business went backwards $265 million. The good news is this core business is starting to turn around and could be possible upside in 2010. In addition, we continue to work on expanding the advertising opportunity within our activity. And in the last 18 months, in conjunction with Canoe, we've made real progress on the ITV front. We've enabled about 12 million households and 30 markets to use the eBiz [ph] platform to deliver reliable interactive applications to our customers. These applications include caller ID to the TV now available on 3.5 million homes, RFI, request for information highlighting in three markets, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit. We're testing Remind-Record, and we're also testing Shop by Remote with Home Shopping Network. In 2010, you'll see us continue to grow our footprint while launching new ITV applications. At the same time, we're working hand-in-hand with other MSOs and Canoe to establish standards and provide a national footprint. We think that's really important to making ITV really a breakthrough. We're excited about Canoe and think it represents a big opportunity for the industry as we ramp up interactive advertising products on a national basis. The upside for advertising in 2010, however, will really be led by the turn of the market, which we're seeing in the fourth quarter, as Mike mentioned, with our core business net of political growing 10% but also strong trends as we enter 2010. Due to weakness in ad sales in the first half and lack of political, our Advertising business declined and was a real drag on revenue and OCF. It really cost us about 200 basis points of OCF growth in 2009. If current trends continue, this drag could turn into a real lift as we enter 2010. To summarize, in the worst economy in decades, despite greater competition and investing in more new initiatives in 2009 than any year I can remember, we achieved solid unit and financial growth, and as importantly, are really positioned well for the future.

He'd, Obviously, when he got there, had lots of problems that preceded him and I think he did more than a great job, a yeoman's job, of dealing with the realities of a company that had too much debt and needed to go through a reorganization. As it came out of that reorganization, it created an opportunity for him to rethink where he wanted to work for the future. And the timing was amazingly perfect for us, and I think it's going to be -- allow us to continue what we've started, not have a big, strategic shift. He's working for Steve, but I think he will add an external perspective to help us accelerate and lead and make decisions.

But I just sort of want to get your reaction from a Comcast perspective at what's being talked about and discussed in the tablet and other distribution model front?"

This year, it was about a third. I would say, in general, we've been sort of, this second half of the year, trying to be more unit-focused. And then also during the second half of the year, we have a lot of places where we're converting to All-Digital, a lot of places where we're doing DOCSIS 3.0. We mentioned that we're launching XFINITY and we, I think, in many instances felt that from a timing point of view, you don't want to go to a tough digital conversion and raise prices at the same time. So it was a sort of combination of an overall philosophy that we wanted to go for units, but also some timing differential given what we're doing with the plan."

So I don't have a lot of specifics on the Apple tablet. I saw the presentation or parts of the presentation, I think there's incredible time for innovation going on right now, and I don't think it's ever been happening faster or more broadly. And there's going to be some hits and there's going to be some misses. What I think it's demonstrating or what's driving us is to have a company that is in a unique or a very special place where all of our focus is on getting to the consumer with some of the Comcast products. And sometimes, that will be at the expense of other Comcast products. And sometimes, it's going to be an additive experience. Personally, I don't think people wanting more content, wanting more devices, and what they want is anything but a good thing for our company, whether we make that content, whether that encourages them to use the continent more and therefore in and out of the home. But I want to see, yes, let me pick a slightly different -- it relates to your question. And at that time, and again, since then, it was the tablet. But at that time, the hot product was -- two hot products that I liked at CES [Consumer Electronics Show], one was Google's new Nexus Phone. It was smaller than the iPhone, so a smaller screen was the hot product. And the other hot product was 152-inch 3D TV in high def that everybody wanted. So you have these to have these two very different extremes that the consumer wants, something really small and portable and something really big in the home. And I think we continue to find ways to service and want to be servicing those needs. So broadband had a showing again in 2009 at faster speeds because folks want to consume more bits in their home, and our 4G platform that we're working with Clearwire to build, to have the fastest speeds outside of the home."

Churn is down year-to-year, which is, to me, a very interesting thing when the RBOCs have added 5 million new homes. And I think a good thing in -- there's a whole variety of theories as to  why churn is down. I think some of it is we get more and more bundled customers. I think we've made some efforts and seeing some success with improved service, et cetera. So churn is down, but gross adds are up for High-Speed data. And the High-Speed Data business, I think, has made a very interesting pivot in the first and second quarter, certainly, in the second quarter. We were down significantly for the prior year, and we've had a lot of weeks in the second half of the year where this business, which is a maturing business where we have 16 million customers, is doing better on a weekly basis than the prior year. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we've made this DOCSIS 3.0 investment, our speeds are better, but that has been surprising to us. So I think it's progress both on gross adds our gross ad and churn. And who knows where that goes? It's very difficult to assess the High-Speed Data business, I think, has been indexing at less than 100% of prior year, almost every year for certainly three, four, five years and then all of a sudden, in the second half, it's indexing higher. And I think that could be due to a whole variety of things. We're certainly not assuming that as a lock to continue to happen through 2010. We certainly hope it does. But I think you seem bounced around, and you'll see quarters with are better and quarters which are worse. But we're certainly pleased with where we are."

Some of these strategic initiatives and all the rest of the markets or most of the rest of the markets will complete throughout the year, but we'll get close to completion. We think we have a real consumer message that is this is a different experience than they got just two years ago. The world has changed. A lot has changed for the positive. Consumers are in control, and I think we're giving a better and better service experience. Thank you."

Today, we are pleased to report healthy operating and financial results that demonstrate the underlying strength of our subscription businesses and our ability to continue to manage effectively in a challenging",1042,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are pleased to report healthy operating and financial results that demonstrate the underlying strength of our subscription businesses and our ability to continue to manage effectively in a challenging environment. In 2009, consolidated revenue grew 4% and cash flow increased by 4.4%. We generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow and showed a very strong increase of 21% in that category. This reflects our focus on expense and capital management. We continue to be able to reduce the capital intensity of our Cable business, even as we invest in key strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position now and in the future. From an operating standpoint, despite a combination of a weak economy and increasing competition in video, we added 1.5 million net new customers between Video, High-Speed Data and Voice. Business Services, a new high-growth area for us, was a significant driver in 2009, and the advertising market, which went backwards for most of the year, seem to solidify toward the end of the year.  So as we review 2009, I think you will see that we executed well, fine tuning our operating strategy during the year to balance revenue, cash flow and customer growth to deliver solid results.As you all know, just two months ago, we announced the NBC Universal transaction with GE. And last week, we made our public interest filing at the FCC [Federal Communication Commission]. Beyond that, we are beginning the planning process and remain very excited about the prospects of this transaction and the opportunity to accelerate value creation for our shareholders.Steve Burke is leading this effort for Comcast to maximize the opportunities available from the combination of cable and content assets. Given Steve's new focus, I'm delighted that Neil Smith will be joining Comcast in March as President of Comcast Cable. Neil is an incredibly-talented executive, with significant cable, Internet and consumer products experience and is a terrific addition to our already-strong cable management team. Like Steve and me, and Dave Watson and Dave Scott, Neil strongly believes in our goal to deliver the best customer experience in the marketplace, driving meaningful innovation and dramatically expanding the products and features we offer our customers. To do that, we have been aggressively rolling out All-Digital and Wideband. These are initiatives that are central to our strategy, and so we're investing about $1 billion in these two projects between 2009 and 2010. And we've made rapid progress deploying these technologies and new products that follow the roll out. So for instance, we are actively deploying All-Digital in about 60% of our markets, recapturing and more efficiently using our bandwidth. As we go All-Digital, we offer consumers in those markets 100 or more high-depth channels. We double the amount of foreign-language programming available to between 50 and 70 channels per market. We also significantly increased the amount of content available on demand to nearly 20,000 choices, with 3,000 HD options available to our digital customers each month.In December, we launched On Demand Online nationally, with over 19,000 TV and movie choices, adding a valuable benefit to our customers' cable subscription. We also finished 2009 with wideband capability in 75% of our footprint, reinforcing our leadership position in broadband. Deploying wideband gives us significant capacity to deliver higher Internet speeds that continue to differentiate our broadband product. It provides us an additional speed advantage, particularly in the 85% of the country without fiber-based competition. Each of these initiatives helps to strengthen our competitive position now, and in the future, and helps us make progress toward our vision of Project Infinity: Giving consumers more content anytime, anywhere.So as we complete the roll out of wideband and All-Digital, and launch new services, we are not only repositioning the company technically, we're beginning to reposition the company with the consumer, demonstrating how the technical, and product investments we have made can redefine how customers experience video, voice and the Internet. Beginning next week in 11 markets, we will introduce XFINITY, a new brand that encompasses our robust technology platform, expanded services we're offering today and the future innovations we are planning to deliver. In the next few months, we will launch XFINITY to almost half of our footprint, and we will reach the majority of our markets by the end of this year. XFINITY services will continue to evolve, but the important message to our customers is that Comcast is innovating in all our products across many platforms, giving these customers even more choice, and control over the entertainment, communications and information they want.If you'll turn with me to the next slide. As we begin 2010, our goal is to continue to deliver, and drive profitable growth. We have increasingly diverse revenue streams, with strong subscription businesses and increasing opportunities to leverage the robust network to make our products even more distinct, and to build new businesses, and new growth opportunities. As Steve and Michael will discuss, we're focused on balancing revenue, OCF and customer growth, while managing expenses and capital, so that we can generate significant free cash flow. The same time, we are not sacrificing investment in areas that significantly strengthen our competitive position or that offer future growth potential. So we expect to substantially complete our wideband initiative early in 2010, and to substantially complete All-Digital by the end of this year. We plan to significantly expand wireless High-Speed 2go to many new markets in the new year. And we are now building on our strong momentum in Business Services to expand the customers we target, and our offerings in that space. We will also continue to invest in our network, extending our technical capabilities even further, more widely deploying EBIF [Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format] technology for instance to support interactive TV, and advertising. And through our newly-formed Comcast Labs, we will focus on extending, and integrating IP technology in order to improve the customer experience, accelerate the pace at which we introduce new products and expand our cross-platform experiences. So therefore, I believe we are well positioned to continue to build a company that provides great products to consumers, and creates long-term value for our shareholders. Let me now pass to Michael to review our results in more detail."

As Brian mentioned, 2009 was a year of strong financial, and operational progress. We reported solid results, and executed well as we aggressively navigated the changing economic, and competitive landscape, and remained focused on profitable growth, as well as gained more efficiencies in our expense base, and capital  program. We establish our plans on an annual basis, so let's begin by reviewing Slide 5, which shows the company's consolidated result for the full year of 2009. For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 3.9% to $35.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 4.4% to $13.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.4%, a modest increase when compared to 38.1% during 2008.  In addition to growing our revenue and operating cash flow, we're also very focused on free cash flow per share, free cash flow and earnings per share as critical metrics in evaluating our earnings growth and the strength of our company. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the full year reflects meaningful progress and growth.On a full year basis, free cash flow increased 21% to $4.4 billion compared to $3.7 billion in 2008. And free cash flow per share increased 23% to $1.53 per share. Over the past year, we have converted 32% of our operating cash flow into free cash flow compared to a conversion rate of 28% in 2008 and 20% in 2007.We generated earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of 46.5% over 2008. 2009's EPS reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, lower interest expense due to lower net debt and a reduced effective tax rate, resulting from the recognition of income tax benefits during the year.  For 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40%. Broadly speaking, our results for the full year represent a balanced strategy and solid performance. As we remain focused on executing our strategic, operational and financial plans, there are several areas that should be highlighted. We continue to manage the business for long-term profitable growth and endeavor to find the right  balance between revenue, cash flow and customer growth. This year, we made adjustments during the year and delivered solid customer metrics across all products, despite an incredibly-difficult consumer environment and a substantially-larger competitive overlap with the RBOCs. Cable advertising was also challenged in 2009, down $265 million for the year due to the poor economic environment and the lack of political advertising. However, we are experiencing some signs of improvement in advertising. In the fourth quarter, advertising revenue declined 7% versus the prior year. However, if we exclude political, advertising revenue actually increased 10%, a notable improvement from the 20% to 25% declines we experienced in the first half of 2009.Business Services has experienced real momentum over the past year, with revenue increasing 48% to $828 million for 2009. In 2010, we are again enthusiastic about Business Services' prospects and expect this momentum to continue as we begin to expand our services to medium-size businesses and sell backhaul. As we begin to execute our 2010 strategies, we are focused on delivering further growth in revenue, operating cash flow and free cash flow, as well as continued improvement in our capital efficiency.Let's review our consolidated fourth quarter results, so please refer to Slide 6.  For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 2.9% to $9.1 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 1.1% to $3.4 billion, resulting in consolidated operating cash flow margin of 37.6% compared to 38.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Capital expenditures were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 6% decrease compared to 2008. As expected, fourth quarter capital expenditures were higher than the previous three quarters, as we accelerated capital to take advantage of favorable tax treatment related to the Economic Stimulus and attractive vendor discounts. We generated consolidated free cash flow of $768 million, a decline of 11.1% over the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting lower net cash provided by operating activities as a result of changes in working capital and higher cash taxes, partially offset by lower CapEx. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 136% to $0.33 per share, reflecting lower interest expense and the recognition of income tax benefits. While I would like to spend the majority of this call discussing our full year results and our views for 2010, there are a few notable items I would like to highlight regarding the fourth quarter. Total Video revenue declined slightly by 0.6%, reflecting 199,000 decline in basic Video customers. And Video ARPU growth was 2%. This slowdown in Video ARPU growth is a result of more moderate rate increases in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the increases in the fourth quarter of 2008 and additional bundling in promotion. As we mentioned previously, mid-way through the year, we decided to proactively pursue market share by aggressively refocusing our marketing efforts on the Triple Play offer. As a result, we lost fewer Video subs compared to the last year's second half and reaccelerated growth in high-speed Internet in CDV in the second half of 2009. In addition, we have improved our performance competitively by taking share even as the RBOCs have meaningfully increase their footprint.From a segment standpoint, Cable operating cash flow increased 2% to $3.5 billion. Programming expense growth slowed slightly to 8%, and non-Programming expenses increased modestly, as we continue to aggressively manage our costs. In addition, we remain very focused on controlling expenses and gaining efficiencies and continue to adjust our cost structure. As a result, we are taking and absorbing an $81 million severance charge in the fourth quarter compared to a $63 million severance charge we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. Just a note, this charge is included in our OCF.Our Programming Division, which has been performing well, reported a 5% increase in revenue, but a 17% decline in operating cash flow, reflecting an expected increase in marketing cost to launch new shows and the recognition of higher Programming expenses in the fourth quarter. Corporate and Other revenue increased 14% to $138 million, reflecting strong results at CIM or Comcast Interactive Media and Comcast-Spectacor, but operating cash flow decreased 10%, as it includes $20 million of expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction.Now let's review our Cable division's full year results in more detail, so please refer to Slide 7. For the full year of 2009, Cable revenue increased 3.8% to $33.9 billion, reflecting continued growth in high-speed Internet, Voice and Business Services partially offset by slower growth in Video revenue and a decline in advertising revenue. As I mentioned, we had solid customer additions during the year, total Video, high-speed Internet and Voice customers increasing by $1.5 million in 2009, with 47 million Video, Internet and Voice customers.Total revenue per Video customer remained healthy during 2009, increasing 6% to over $118 per month. Total subscription revenue per customer, which excludes advertising, grew 7 1/2% to $113, reflecting the following components: Total Video revenue increased 1%, reflecting a 4% increase in Video ARPU and a decline in basic Video customers. During 2009, we lost 623,000 Video customers compared to 575,000 in 2008. The growth in Video ARPU reflects rate increases and continued growth in advanced services, as we added or upgraded over 1.4 million customers to HD and our HD, DVR services These benefits were partially offset by additional bundling and promotions, a decrease in pay revenue, as well as a shift in our video mix, as customers have subscribed to lower-price levels of our digital service. High-speed Internet revenue increased 7% during the year. ARPU remained stable at $42, and we had solid unit additions of over 1 million this year, with our HSI penetration now exceeding 31%.Voice revenue increased 23% for the year, reflecting continued growth in our customer base and a modest decline in ARPU to $39 per month. We added over 1.1 million voice customers this year. Now have over 7.6 million customers, with penetration for our Voice service now approximately 16%. We have made terrific progress in bundling, and at the end of 2009, almost 28% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 23% at the end of 2008. Overall, we remain focused on profitable and sustainable growth. And while we expect additional Video customer losses as the RBOC expand their overlap, we believe we will see penetration gains in our Digital HD and DVR services, high-speed Internet, Voice and Business Services during 2010.Please refer to Slide 8  to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. In 2009, Cable operating cash flow increased 4% to $13.7 billion, which was in line with top line growth and contributed to a stable operating cash flow margin of 40.4%. Over the past 12 months, total expenses in our Cable segment increased 3.7%, including a 9% increase in programming expenses. The increase in our programming expenses reflect higher rates, additional Digital programming costs as we increase our Digital customer base and new programming that has been added to our services. As we look to 2010, we expect programming expenses to grow, but at a slightly slower rate than in 2009.Excluding programming, our expense base increased only 1% in 2009, even as we incurred incremental operating expenses to support the digital transition in the first half of the year to deploy All-Digital, Wideband and Wireless and to improve the customer experience. Investment in these key strategic initiatives contributed to a 6% increase in customer service expense and a 5% increase in technical labor expense during the year.To offset these higher expenses, we continue to extract scale benefits and efficiencies in our high-speed Internet and Voice businesses. Compared to the full year of 2008, our direct cost for high-speed Internet declined 1%, and our Voice direct cost have decreased 17%. At the same time, we have managed a reduction in both our marketing and administrative expenses compared to 2008.As part of our focus on cost management and considering the difficult economic environment, we have been very focused on delinquencies and bad debt expense. In 2009, we were successful with this effort, particularly in the second half where we reduced our net bad debt expense versus 2008. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking an $81 million severance charge in the fourth quarter to account for further efficiencies, and a reduction in staffing levels. As we begin 2010, we are also undergoing a company-wide initiative, which should result in improved efficiencies, and increase our speed to market for new products and features. We call this program Challenge 2010, and Steve will cover this in more detail later in the call, efficiency gained through this program will help support additional investments we're making in cross-platform or converged services, Business Services and wireless. Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures.  For the full year of 2009, our capital expenditures decreased 11% from $5.7 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion, reflecting slower growth, and meaningful reductions in equipment pricing. As you can see on the slide, this represent a meaningful decrease in the business' capital intensity to 14.3% of revenue from 16.7% in 2008, and 19.7% in 2007. This progress was achieved even as we invested in All-Digital and wideband strategic initiatives, supported growth in advanced Video services, high-speed Internet and Voice penetrations and increased our capital investment in Business Services by over 51% to over $350 million. Consistent with historical trends, capital expenditures for 2009 continued to be predominantly growth oriented, with growth CapEx accounting for over 70% of total Cable CapEx. To recap how our CapEx was deployed in 2009, we added over 1.5 million Video, Voice and Data customers. We deployed 8.8 million digital set-top boxes, and adapters, bringing our total deployed to over 36 million. We deployed over 6.2 million digital adapters in 2009 to support the All-Digital roll out. Also included in this number were almost 2.2 million advanced HD and/or DVR set-tops, as we added over 1.4 million advanced service customers in 2009, which is actually an increase over 2008.We now have almost 9.2 million HD and/or DVR customers, and our advanced service penetration is approximately 50% of our total digital Video customers. We also purchased equipment as we accelerated DOCSIS 3.0 for our wideband initiative. And as Brian mentioned, we have already deployed this technology to 75% of our footprint.In 2010, we anticipate our capital intensity to decrease further, as capital expenditures are expected to be lower, both in absolute dollars, and as a percentage of revenue. We expect improved CPE pricing and further capital efficiencies to be realized in 2010. This further reduction in CapEx will occur even as we invest in areas of future growth. In 2010, we will invest aggressively to sustain our momentum in Business Services and expand its reach to mid-size businesses and to sell backhaul. We will complete our deployment of Wideband in early 2010 and the All-Digital effort, by year end. We'll expand our wireless efforts, including the launch of wireless High-Speed 2go in a number of new markets. We will also fund several new initiatives through our newly-formed Comcast Labs that focuses in the areas of converged products, IP technology and switch digital video. And these investments in these new initiatives will be included in discretionary CapEx, who represent less than 5% of our total capital.Please refer to Slide 10. We are executing on a disciplined and returns-focused approach to allocating capital both internally and externally, with the intention of further growing free cash flow and free cash flow per share. In 2009, as I previously mentioned, we increased free cash flow to $4.4 billion, and this increase represents a 21% increase versus 2008 and an 89% increase over the past 24 months. As previously indicated by our initiatives, our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses, as it provides attractive incremental returns, enhances our competitive position and deliver sustainable, organic growth. When it comes to considering potential acquisitions or external investments, we will remain extremely disciplined and execution-oriented, focusing on opportunities that extend our services or add features that allow us to build new complimentary revenue streams. However, in 2010, we expect our energies in this area will be spent on planning for the NBC Universal transition. A key principle in our capital-allocation strategy has been to return capital directly to shareholders in a form of both dividends and share repurchases.Even during a difficult economic environment of 2009, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends, totaling $761 million for the year and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we repurchased 18.1 million of our common shares for $300 million. So on a full year 2009 basis, we purchased 49.8 million of our common shares for $765 million. Combined, this represents a total return of capital to shareholders of 35% of free cash flow.As I believe most of you are aware, in December, we announced a 40% increase in our dividend. Our second increase in a year, which was effective last month and increases our annual dividend payments to $0.378 per share. As of December 31, we had approximately $3.3 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And as we have previously announced, we intend to complete this repurchase subject to market conditions by the end of 2012.The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in a total payout ratio in excess of 50% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and places our payout ratio on a total return of capital basis at the top of our peers. In addition, based on the current stock price, this combined return of capital allocation represents an excess of a 5% yield. Now let me pass the call to Steve."

As you look at 2009, we delivered solid financial results and made progress operationally in the face of a challenging economy, increased competition with over 5 million more homes built by the RBOC, a decline in advertising revenue of 15% and continuing to invest in important initiatives, like the country's digital transition, our own All-Digital efforts, DOCSIS 3.0 and Business Services.On previous calls, we've talked about the balance between financial and unit growth. We made a number of mid-course corrections in the middle of 2009 to concentrate more on units in the second half. The good news is this mid-course correction worked. We increased our promotions and refocused our marketing efforts on the Triple Play. In the fourth quarter, we also decided to take fewer rate increases. In the fourth quarter of 2009, 6.8 million customers had Video rate increases versus the fourth quarter of 2008, with 16.2 million customers getting rate increases. The good news is that we got the units, which proves that we can go after market share by getting more aggressive.We're really pleased with our unit results. In the second half, we did better on basic subs compared to the second half of 2008 despite more competition. In the second half of 2009, we added 895,000 combination Video, Voice and Data customers versus in the first half of '09, adding 633,000. This was driven by very strong high-speed Internet ads. In the second half of 2009, we added 608,000 versus 393,000 in the first half of '09.The fourth quarter is also the second consecutive quarter where we added almost as many residential high-speed data customers in the quarter as AT&T, and Verizon combined. The RBOC number is all-in for fiber and DSL. We also had stronger Voice ads in the second half than the first half. Overall, these efforts resulted in total revenue per customer remaining healthy during 2009, increasing 6% during the year to over $118 per customer per month.During the year, we also remained very focused on managing expenses. With Challenge 2010, we adopted a company-wide program to standardize, and simplify processes, which not only resulted in improved efficiencies but also increased our speed to market for new products, and features. Moving toward a more standardized operating model will help us be more efficient. We're consolidating call centers, introducing more robust IVRs to handle more customer inquiries, reducing the number of truck rolls, increasing self-installation from our hot drop [ph] program, consolidating warehouses and improving our inventory management. The bottom line is we're cutting costs, and becoming more efficient, while at the same time, investing in new businesses and marketing. We're continuing to enhance our products' superiority and drive long-term growth in our business. Our All-Digital efforts continue to go very well. We've now deployed over 6 million digital adapters. We completed the All-Digital conversion efforts in 35% of our footprint and are currently active in about 60% of our footprint. And by the end of 2010, we expect 80% of our systems to have made the conversion to All-Digital.Once you go through this conversion, it creates network and operating efficiencies, which complement previously mentioned cost-reduction initiatives. For example, 80% of our customers have been using self install kits for their digital adapters. And once the home goes All-Digital, we're able to do a number of things that we couldn't do before. The first market that went All-Digital was Portland, our first major All-Digital market. And they were seeing a number of very encouraging trends. Our high-depth penetration is growing faster in Portland than most the of the other markets in the country now that we have 100 high-depth channels. Truck rolls are down significantly in the Portland market, and OCF is growing faster in this market than most others. Importantly, customer service scores have also improved markedly. Portland is really leading the pack.Moving on to DOCSIS 3.0, or wideband, we've deployed this technology to over 75% of our footprint, and plan to complete our DOCSIS 3.0 deployment in early 2010. DOCSIS 3.0 means we have a much faster High-Speed data product, particularly in the 85% of the country that doesn't have fiber-based competition. About 35 million homes in our footprint can purchase 50 meg with the ability for even higher speeds using wideband technology. In fact, Comcast now has more homes capable of providing 50-meg service than all the other cable and telephone companies combined. We believe speed will continue to power the next generation of applications and growth in high-speed Internet, and we're delighted to have made such good progress with DOCSIS 3.0.In 2009, we believe we laid the foundation for our technology platform to stay ahead of competition. As Brian mentioned, now that we're almost complete with repositioning ourselves technically, we're repositioning ourselves with the consumer. Therefore, we're launching XFINITY on February 12 in 11 markets. This is a major rebranding effort for Comcast cable. XFINITY gives the customer more choices, more convenience, more control over their entertainment and information and communication choices in more innovative ways. And we're really excited to introduce the XFINITY brand to our customers.Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest in future growth. In Business Services, we continue to have real success in the small end of the business market with a lot of room for growth. In fact, we've been growing this business, which is now quite sizable. Revenues have been growing 40% to 50% very consistently. Now we feel we're ready to expand our offering further, targeting companies with 20 to 250 employees, in other words, a larger company size than what previously we've been targeting. This segment of the business' market spends $10 billion to $15 billion per year on the services we offer, which represents another opportunity roughly equal in size to the small end of the market where we've been concentrating so far. So backhaul is another nice complementary business that can further leverage our network, and one we're actively pursuing. We size this business at roughly $1 billion for Comcast overtime.Moving on to wireless, we're now in the execution phase with our High-Speed 2go product. In 2009, we launched in five major markets. In July, we launched Portland. Atlanta launched in July as well. In November, we launched Philadelphia. Chicago launched in December, and Seattle launched in December as well. As of year end, we're offering the product in more than 9 million of our homes passed. We look to significantly expand that by the end of 2010. High-Speed 2go is sold in conjunction with our High-Speed data products, sold in a bundle, which makes a lot of sense for the consumer and is a straightforward transaction for us to process. We've proven in Portland that Comcast High-Speed 2go bundled with our High-Speed data product is a way to increase our High-Speed Data business. In Portland, roughly 40% of the High-Speed 2go customers are new High-Speed Internet customers for Comcast. Moving on to advertising, during 2009, as Mike mentioned, our Advertising business went backwards $265 million. The good news is this core business is starting to turn around and could be possible upside in 2010. In addition, we continue to work on expanding the advertising opportunity within our activity. And in the last 18 months, in conjunction with Canoe, we've made real progress on the ITV front. We've enabled about 12 million households and 30 markets to use the eBiz [ph] platform to deliver reliable interactive applications to our customers. These applications include caller ID to the TV now available on 3.5 million homes, RFI, request for information highlighting in three markets, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit. We're testing Remind-Record, and we're also testing Shop by Remote with Home Shopping Network. In 2010, you'll see us continue to grow our footprint while launching new ITV applications. At the same time, we're working hand-in-hand with other MSOs and Canoe to establish standards and provide a national footprint. We think that's really important to making ITV really a breakthrough. We're excited about Canoe and think it represents a big opportunity for the industry as we ramp up interactive advertising products on a national basis. The upside for advertising in 2010, however, will really be led by the turn of the market, which we're seeing in the fourth quarter, as Mike mentioned, with our core business net of political growing 10% but also strong trends as we enter 2010. Due to weakness in ad sales in the first half and lack of political, our Advertising business declined and was a real drag on revenue and OCF. It really cost us about 200 basis points of OCF growth in 2009. If current trends continue, this drag could turn into a real lift as we enter 2010. To summarize, in the worst economy in decades, despite greater competition and investing in more new initiatives in 2009 than any year I can remember, we achieved solid unit and financial growth, and as importantly, are really positioned well for the future.

Neil's track record, both with AOL before Charter and then Charter through CableLabs and then CTA, I've known him for a long time. And I'm personally incredibly impressed with his leadership skills, how well I think he will fit into the culture of Comcast. He's a terrific executive of Charter. He'd, Obviously, when he got there, had lots of problems that preceded him and I think he did more than a great job, a yeoman's job, of dealing with the realities of a company that had too much debt and needed to go through a reorganization. As it came out of that reorganization, it created an opportunity for him to rethink where he wanted to work for the future. And the timing was amazingly perfect for us, and I think it's going to be -- allow us to continue what we've started, not have a big, strategic shift. He's working for Steve, but I think he will add an external perspective to help us accelerate and lead and make decisions. And he's a decisive guy and a very fair and decent guy, so I think he'll fit in perfectly. Steve?"

And we have not used here to forward DOCSIS 3.0 as a way to radically change the pricing structure. I think things will evolve in the future in terms of the product that we're actually offering and the packaging, but right now, our approach has been to get the technology out, to make sure that people understand that if they want 50 or 100 megs, that we're the place to get it, in 85% of our footprint, the only place to get it. And I think that the pricing strategy will evolve over time.

And given your comments in the call regarding having the right technical platform in place, soon having plenty of plant capacity across your footprint with the All-Digital coming to completion and your ability to offer better and new services to your customer's resolve, I mean, combine that with the economy getting better, right? So at least versus last year, especially for advertising, it seems the company could be an important inflection point revenue where revenue growth continues to accelerate. So I guess, first, do you agree with that philosophy? And then just separately, briefly, I'm sure any change is minor at this point, but I was hoping you could comment on NBCU's results and whether it's expected and have their budgets improved or deteriorated at all from what you thought pre-deal?"

That is a meaningful amount, and we're off to a relatively good start in advertising. But I think we're working hard to manage ARPU, and ARPU has grown. We hit $120 in the fourth quarter of total ARPU. So we're going to work through the best we can to certainly grow revenue, but I'll also want to caution you, we're looking at profitable revenue.

So I don't have a lot of specifics on the Apple tablet. I saw the presentation or parts of the presentation, I think there's incredible time for innovation going on right now, and I don't think it's ever been happening faster or more broadly. And there's going to be some hits and there's going to be some misses. What I think it's demonstrating or what's driving us is to have a company that is in a unique or a very special place where all of our focus is on getting to the consumer with some of the Comcast products. And sometimes, that will be at the expense of other Comcast products. And sometimes, it's going to be an additive experience. Personally, I don't think people wanting more content, wanting more devices, and what they want is anything but a good thing for our company, whether we make that content, whether that encourages them to use the continent more and therefore in and out of the home. But I want to see, yes, let me pick a slightly different -- it relates to your question. And at that time, and again, since then, it was the tablet. But at that time, the hot product was -- two hot products that I liked at CES [Consumer Electronics Show], one was Google's new Nexus Phone. It was smaller than the iPhone, so a smaller screen was the hot product. And the other hot product was 152-inch 3D TV in high def that everybody wanted. So you have these to have these two very different extremes that the consumer wants, something really small and portable and something really big in the home. And I think we continue to find ways to service and want to be servicing those needs. So broadband had a showing again in 2009 at faster speeds because folks want to consume more bits in their home, and our 4G platform that we're working with Clearwire to build, to have the fastest speeds outside of the home."

And I think a good thing in -- there's a whole variety of theories as to  why churn is down. I think some of it is we get more and more bundled customers. I think we've made some efforts and seeing some success with improved service, et cetera. So churn is down, but gross adds are up for High-Speed data. And the High-Speed Data business, I think, has made a very interesting pivot in the first and second quarter, certainly, in the second quarter. We were down significantly for the prior year, and we've had a lot of weeks in the second half of the year where this business, which is a maturing business where we have 16 million customers, is doing better on a weekly basis than the prior year. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we've made this DOCSIS 3.0 investment, our speeds are better, but that has been surprising to us. So I think it's progress both on gross adds our gross ad and churn. And who knows where that goes? It's very difficult to assess the High-Speed Data business, I think, has been indexing at less than 100% of prior year, almost every year for certainly three, four, five years and then all of a sudden, in the second half, it's indexing higher. And I think that could be due to a whole variety of things. We're certainly not assuming that as a lock to continue to happen through 2010. We certainly hope it does.

Some of these strategic initiatives and all the rest of the markets or most of the rest of the markets will complete throughout the year, but we'll get close to completion.

Today, we are pleased to report healthy operating and financial results that demonstrate the underlying strength of our subscription businesses and our ability to continue to manage effectively in a challenging environment. In 2009, consolidated revenue grew 4% and cash flow increased by 4.4%. We generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow and showed a very strong increase of 21% in that category. This reflects our focus on expense and capital management. We continue to be able to reduce the capital intensity of our Cable business, even as we invest in key strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position now and in the future. From an operating standpoint, despite a combination of a weak economy and increasing competition in video, we added 1.5 million net new customers between Video, High-Speed Data and Voice. Business Services, a new high-growth area for us, was a significant driver in 2009, and the advertising market, which went backwards for most of the year, seem to solidify toward the end of the year.  So as we review 2009, I think you will see that we executed well, fine tuning our operating strategy during the year to balance revenue, cash flow and customer growth to deliver solid results.As you all know, just two months ago, we announced the NBC Universal transaction with GE. And last week, we made our public interest filing at the FCC [Federal Communication Commission]. Beyond that, we are beginning the planning process and remain very excited about the prospects of this transaction and the opportunity to accelerate value creation for our shareholders.Steve Burke is leading this effort for Comcast to maximize the opportunities available from the combination of cable and content assets. Given Steve's new focus, I'm delighted that Neil Smit will be joining Comcast in March as President of Comcast Cable. Neil is an incredibly-talented executive, with significant cable, Internet and consumer products experience and is a terrific addition to our already-strong cable management team. Like Steve and me, and Dave Watson and Dave Scott, Neil strongly believes in our goal to deliver the best customer experience in the marketplace, driving meaningful innovation and dramatically expanding the products and features we offer our customers. To do that, we have been aggressively rolling out All-Digital and Wideband. These are initiatives that are central to our strategy, and so we're investing about $1 billion in these two projects between 2009 and 2010. And we've made rapid progress deploying these technologies and new products that follow the roll out. So for instance, we are actively deploying All-Digital in about 60% of our markets, recapturing and more efficiently using our bandwidth. As we go All-Digital, we offer consumers in those markets 100 or more high-depth channels. We double the amount of foreign-language programming available to between 50 and 70 channels per market. We also significantly increased the amount of content available on demand to nearly 20,000 choices, with 3,000 HD options available to our digital customers each month.In December, we launched On Demand Online nationally, with over 19,000 TV and movie choices, adding a valuable benefit to our customers' cable subscription. We also finished 2009 with Wideband capability in 75% of our footprint, reinforcing our leadership position in broadband. Deploying Wideband gives us significant capacity to deliver higher Internet speeds that continue to differentiate our broadband product. It provides us an additional speed advantage, particularly in the 85% of the country without fiber-based competition. Each of these initiatives helps to strengthen our competitive position now and in the future and helps us make progress toward our vision of Project Infinity:  Giving consumers more content anytime, anywhere.So as we complete the roll out of Wideband and All-Digital and launch new services, we're not only repositioning the company technically, we're beginning to reposition the company with the consumer, demonstrating how the technical and product investments we have made and redefine how customers experience video, voice and the Internet. Beginning next week in 11 markets, we will introduce XFINITY, a new brand that encompasses our robust technology platform, expanded services we're offering today and the future innovations we are planning to deliver. In the next few months, we will launch XFINITY to almost half of our footprint, and we will reach the majority of our markets by the end of this year. XFINITY services will continue to evolve, but the important message to our customers is that Comcast is innovating in all our products across many platforms, giving these customers even more choice and control over the entertainment, communications and information they want.If you'll turn with me to the next slide, as we begin 2010, our goal is to continue to deliver and drive profitable growth. We have increasingly diverse revenue streams, with strong subscription businesses and increasing opportunities to leverage the robust network to make our products even more distinct and to build new businesses and new growth opportunities. As Steve and Michael will discuss, we're focused on balancing revenue, OCF and customer growth, while managing expenses and capital, so that we can generate significant free cash flow. The same time, we are not sacrificing investment in areas that significantly strengthen our competitive position or that offer future growth potential. So we expect to substantially complete our Wideband initiative early in 2010 and to substantially complete All-Digital by the end of this year. We plan to significantly expand wireless High-Speed 2go to many new markets in the new year. And we are now building on our strong momentum in Business Services to expand the customers we target and our offerings in that space. We will also continue to invest in our network, extending our technical capabilities even further, more widely deploying EBIF [Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format] technology for instance to support interactive TV and advertising. And through our newly-formed Comcast Labs, we will focus on extending and integrating IP technology in order to improve the customer experience, accelerate the pace at which we introduce new products, expand our cross-platform experiences. So therefore, I believe we are well positioned to continue to build a company that provides great products to consumers and creates long-term value for our shareholders. Let me now pass to Michael to review our results in more detail."

As Brian mentioned, 2009 was a year of strong financial and operational progress. We reported solid results and executed well, as we aggressively navigated the changing economic and competitive landscape and remained focuse",2642,"Thank you, Brian. Good morning. As Brian mentioned, 2009 was a year of strong financial and operational progress. We reported solid results and executed well, as we aggressively navigated the changing economic and competitive landscape and remained focused on profitable growth, as well as gained more efficiencies in our expense base and capital  program. We established our plans on an annual basis, so let's begin by reviewing Slide 5, which shows the company's consolidated result for the full year of 2009. For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 3.9% to $35.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 4.4% to $13.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.4%, a modest increase when compared to 38.1% during 2008.  In addition to growing our revenue and operating cash flow, we're also very focused on free cash flow per share, free cash flow and earnings per share as critical metrics in evaluating our earnings growth and the strength of our company. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the full year reflects meaningful progress and growth.On a full year basis, free cash flow increased 21% to $4.4 billion compared to $3.7 billion in 2008. And free cash flow per share increased 23% to $1.53 per share. Over the past year, we have converted 32% of our operating cash flow into free cash flow compared to a conversion rate of 28% in 2008 and 20% in 2007.We generated earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of 46.5% over 2008. 2009's EPS reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, lower interest expense due to lower net debt and a reduced effective tax rate, resulting from the recognition of income tax benefits during the year.  For 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40%. Broadly speaking, our results for the full year represent a balanced strategy and solid performance. As we remain focused on executing our strategic, operational and financial plans, there are several areas that should be highlighted. We continue to manage the business for long-term profitable growth and endeavor to find the right  balance between revenue, cash flow and customer growth. This year, we made adjustments during the year and delivered solid customer metrics across all products, despite an incredibly-difficult consumer environment and a substantially-larger competitive overlap with the RBOCs. Cable advertising was also challenged in 2009, down $265 million for the year due to the poor economic environment and the lack of political advertising. However, we are experiencing some signs of improvement in advertising. In the fourth quarter, advertising revenue declined 7% versus the prior year. However, if we exclude political, advertising revenue actually increased 10%, a notable improvement from the 20% to 25% declines we experienced in the first half of 2009.Business Services has experienced real momentum over the past year, with revenue increasing 48% to $828 million for 2009. In 2010, we are again enthusiastic about Business Services' prospects and expect this momentum to continue as we begin to expand our services to medium-size businesses and sell backhaul. As we begin to execute our 2010 strategies, we are focused on delivering further growth in revenue, operating cash flow and free cash flow, as well as continued improvement in our capital efficiency.Let's review our consolidated fourth quarter results, so please refer to Slide 6.  For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 2.9% to $9.1 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow grew 1.1% to $3.4 billion, resulting in consolidated operating cash flow margin of 37.6% compared to 38.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Capital expenditures were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 6% decrease compared to 2008. As expected, fourth quarter capital expenditures were higher than the previous three quarters, as we accelerated capital to take advantage of favorable tax treatment related to the Economic Stimulus and attractive vendor discounts. We generated consolidated free cash flow of $768 million, a decline of 11.1% over the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting lower net cash provided by operating activities as a result of changes in working capital and higher cash taxes, partially offset by lower CapEx. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 136% to $0.33 per share, reflecting lower interest expense and the recognition of income tax benefits. While I would like to spend the majority of this call discussing our full year results and our views for 2010, there are a few notable items I would like to highlight regarding the fourth quarter. Total Video revenue declined slightly by 0.6%, reflecting 199,000 decline in basic Video customers. And Video ARPU growth was 2%. This slowdown in Video ARPU growth is a result of more moderate rate increases in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the increases in the fourth quarter of 2008 and additional bundling in promotion. As we mentioned previously, mid-way through the year, we decided to proactively pursue market share by aggressively refocusing our marketing efforts on the Triple Play offer. As a result, we lost fewer Video subs compared to the last year's second half and reaccelerated growth in high-speed Internet in CDV in the second half of 2009. In addition, we have improved our performance competitively by taking share even as the RBOCs have meaningfully increase their footprint.From a segment standpoint, Cable operating cash flow increased 2% to $3.5 billion. Programming expense growth slowed slightly to 8%, and non-Programming expenses increased modestly, as we continue to aggressively manage our costs. In addition, we remain very focused on controlling expenses and gaining efficiencies and continue to adjust our cost structure. As a result, we are taking and absorbing an $81 million severance charge in the fourth quarter compared to a $63 million severance charge we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. Just a note, this charge is included in our OCF.Our Programming Division, which has been performing well, reported a 5% increase in revenue, but a 17% decline in operating cash flow, reflecting an expected increase in marketing cost to launch new shows and the recognition of higher Programming expenses in the fourth quarter. Corporate and Other revenue increased 14% to $138 million, reflecting strong results at CIM or Comcast Interactive Media and Comcast-Spectacor, but operating cash flow decreased 10%, as it includes $20 million of expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction.Now let's review our Cable division's full year results in more detail, so please refer to Slide 7. For the full year of 2009, Cable revenue increased 3.8% to $33.9 billion, reflecting continued growth in high-speed Internet, Voice and Business Services partially offset by slower growth in Video revenue and a decline in advertising revenue. As I mentioned, we had solid customer additions during the year, total Video, high-speed Internet and Voice customers increasing by $1.5 million in 2009, with 47 million Video, Internet and Voice customers.Total revenue per Video customer remained healthy during 2009, increasing 6% to over $118 per month. Total subscription revenue per customer, which excludes advertising, grew 7 1/2% to $113, reflecting the following components: Total Video revenue increased 1%, reflecting a 4% increase in Video ARPU and a decline in basic Video customers. During 2009, we lost 623,000 Video customers compared to 575,000 in 2008. The growth in Video ARPU reflects rate increases and continued growth in advanced services, as we added or upgraded over 1.4 million customers to HD and our HD, DVR servicesThese benefits were partially offset by additional bundling and promotions, a decrease in pay revenue, as well as a shift in our video mix, as customers have subscribed to lower-price levels of our digital service. High-speed Internet revenue increased 7% during the year. ARPU remained stable at $42, and we had solid unit additions of over 1 million this year, with our HSI penetration now exceeding 31%.Voice revenue increased 23% for the year, reflecting continued growth in our customer base and a modest decline in ARPU to $39 per month. We added over 1.1 million voice customers this year. Now have over 7.6 million customers, with penetration for our Voice service now approximately 16%. We have made terrific progress in bundling, and at the end of 2009, almost 28% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 23% at the end of 2008. Overall, we remain focused on profitable and sustainable growth. And while we expect additional Video customer losses as the RBOC expand their overlap, we believe we will see penetration gains in our Digital HD and DVR services, high-speed Internet, Voice and Business Services during 2010.Please refer to Slide 8  to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. In 2009, Cable operating cash flow increased 4% to $13.7 billion, which was in line with top line growth and contributed to a stable operating cash flow margin of 40.4%. Over the past 12 months, total expenses in our Cable segment increased 3.7%, including a 9% increase in programming expenses. The increase in our programming expenses reflect higher rates, additional Digital programming costs as we increase our Digital customer base and new programming that has been added to our services. As we look to 2010, we expect programming expenses to grow, but at a slightly slower rate than in 2009.Excluding programming, our expense base increased only 1% in 2009, even as we incurred incremental operating expenses to support the digital transition in the first half of the year to deploy All-Digital, Wideband and Wireless and to improve the customer experience. Investment in these key strategic initiatives contributed to a 6% increase in customer service expense and a 5% increase in technical labor expense during the year.To offset these higher expenses, we continue to extract scale benefits and efficiencies in our high-speed Internet and Voice businesses. Compared to the full year of 2008, our direct cost for high-speed Internet declined 1%, and our Voice direct cost have decreased 17%. At the same time, we have managed a reduction in both our marketing and administrative expenses compared to 2008.As part of our focus on cost management and considering the difficult economic environment, we have been very focused on delinquencies and bad debt expense. In 2009, we were successful with this effort, particularly in the second half where we reduced our net bad debt expense versus 2008. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking an $81 million severance charge in the fourth quarter to account for further efficiencies and a reduction in staffing levels. As we begin 2010, we are also undergoing a company-wide initiative, which should result in improved efficiencies and increase our speed to market for new products and features. We call this program Challenge 2010, and Steve will cover this in more detail later in the call. Efficiency gained through this program will help support additional investments we're making in cross-platform or converged services, Business Services and wireless. Please refer to Slide 9 to review our capital expenditures.  For the full year of 2009, our capital expenditures decreased 11% from $5.7 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion, reflecting slower growth and meaningful reductions in equipment pricing. As you can see on the slide, this represent a meaningful decrease in the business' capital intensity to 14.3% of revenue from 16.7% in 2008 and 19.7% in 2007. This progress was achieved even as we invested in All-Digital and Wideband strategic initiatives, supported growth in advanced Video services, high-speed Internet and Voice penetrations and increased our capital investment in Business Services by over 51% to over $350 million. Consistent with historical trends, capital expenditures for 2009 continued to be predominantly growth oriented, with growth CapEx accounting for over 70% of total Cable CapEx. To recap how our CapEx was deployed in 2009, we added over 1.5 million Video, Voice and Data customers. We deployed 8.8 million digital set-top boxes and adapters, bringing our total deployed to over 36 million. We deployed over 6.2 million digital adapters in 2009 to support the All-Digital roll out. Also included in this number were almost 2.2 million advanced HD and/or DVR set-tops, as we added over 1.4 million advanced service customers in 2009, which is actually an increase over 2008.We now have almost 9.2 million HD and/or DVR customers, and our advanced service penetration is approximately 50% of our total digital Video customers. We also purchased equipment as we accelerated DOCSIS 3.0 for our Wideband initiative. And as Brian mentioned, we have already deployed this technology to 75% of our footprint.In 2010, we anticipate our capital intensity to decrease further, as capital expenditures are expected to be lower, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. We expect improved CPE pricing and further capital efficiencies to be realized in 2010. This further reduction in CapEx will occur even as we invest in areas of future growth. In 2010, we will invest aggressively to sustain our momentum in Business Services and expand its reach to mid-size businesses and to sell backhaul. We will complete our deployment of Wideband in early 2010 and the All-Digital effort, by year end. We'll expand our wireless efforts, including the launch of wireless High-Speed 2go in a number of new markets. We will also fund several new initiatives through our newly-formed Comcast Labs that focuses in the areas of converged products, IP technology and switch digital video. And these investments in these new initiatives will be included in discretionary CapEx, who represent less than 5% of our total capital.Please refer to Slide 10. We are executing on a disciplined and returns-focused approach to allocating capital both internally and externally, with the intention of further growing free cash flow and free cash flow per share. In 2009, as I previously mentioned, we increased free cash flow to $4.4 billion, and this increase represents a 21% increase versus 2008 and an 89% increase over the past 24 months. As previously indicated by our initiatives, our first priority remains to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses, as it provides attractive incremental returns, enhances our competitive position and deliver sustainable, organic growth. When it comes to considering potential acquisitions or external investments, we will remain extremely disciplined and execution-oriented, focusing on opportunities that extend our services or add features that allow us to build new complimentary revenue streams. However, in 2010, we expect our energies in this area will be spent on planning for the NBC Universal transition. A key principle in our capital-allocation strategy has been to return capital directly to shareholders in a form of both dividends and share repurchases.Even during a difficult economic environment of 2009, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends, totaling $761 million for the year and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we repurchased 18.1 million of our common shares for $300 million. So on a full year 2009 basis, we purchased 49.8 million of our common shares for $765 million. Combined, this represents a total return of capital to shareholders of 35% of free cash flow.As I believe most of you are aware, in December, we announced a 40% increase in our dividend. Our second increase in a year, which was effective last month and increases our annual dividend payments to $0.378 per share. As of December 31, we had approximately $3.3 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And as we have previously announced, we intend to complete this repurchase subject to market conditions by the end of 2012.The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in a total payout ratio in excess of 50% of our last 12 months' free cash flow and places our payout ratio on a total return of capital basis at the top of our peers. In addition, based on the current stock price, this combined return of capital allocation represents an excess of a 5% yield. Now let me pass the call to Steve."

As you look at 2009, we delivered solid financial results and made progress operationally in the face of a challenging economy, increased competition with over 5 million more homes built by the RBOC, a decline in advertising revenue of 15% and continuing to invest in important initiatives, like the country's digital transition, our own All-Digital efforts, DOCSIS 3.0 and Business Services.On previous calls, we've talked about the balance between financial and unit growth. We made a number of mid-course corrections in the middle of 2009 to concentrate more on units in the second half. The good news is this mid-course correction worked. We increased our promotions and refocused our marketing efforts on the Triple Play. In the fourth quarter, we also decided to take fewer rate increases. In the fourth quarter of 2009, 6.8 million customers had Video rate increases versus the fourth quarter of 2008, with 16.2 million customers getting rate increases. The good news is that we got the units, which proves that we can go after market share by getting more aggressive.We're really pleased with our unit results. In the second half, we did better on basic subs compared to the second half of 2008 despite more competition. In the second half of 2009, we added 895,000 combination Video, Voice and Data customers versus in the first half of '09, adding 633,000. This was driven by very strong high-speed Internet ads. In the second half of 2009, we added 608,000 versus 393,000 in the first half of '09.The fourth quarter is also the second consecutive quarter where we added almost as many residential high-speed data customers in the quarter as AT&T and Verizon combined. The RBOC number is all-in for fiber and DSL. We also had stronger Voice ads in the second half and the first half. Overall, these efforts resulted in total revenue per customer remaining healthy during 2009, increasing 6% during the year to over $118 per customer per month.During the year, we also remained very focused on managing expenses. With Challenge 2010, we adopted a company-wide program to standardize and simplify processes, which not only resulted in improved efficiencies but also increased our speed to market for new products and features. Moving toward a more standardized operating model will help us be more efficient. We're consolidating call centers, introducing more robust IVRs to handle more customer inquiries, reducing the number of truck rolls, increasing self-installation from our hot drop [ph] program, consolidating warehouses and improving our inventory management. The bottom line is we're cutting cost and becoming more efficient, while at the same time, investing in new businesses and marketing. We're continuing to enhance our products' superiority and drive long-term growth in our business. Our All-Digital efforts continue to go very well. We've now deployed over 6 million digital adapters. We completed the All-Digital conversion efforts in 35% of our footprint and are currently active in about 60% of our footprint. And by the end of 2010, we expect 80% of our systems to have made the conversion to All-Digital.            Once you go through this conversion, it creates network and operating efficiencies which complement previously mentioned cost-reduction initiatives. For example, 80% of our customers have been using self-install kits for their digital adapters. And once the home goes All-Digital, we're able to do a number of things that we couldn't do before. The first market that went All-Digital was Portland, our first major All-Digital market. And there we're seeing a number of very encouraging trends. Our high-depth penetration is growing faster in Portland than most the of the other markets in the country, now that we have 100 high-depth channels. Truck rolls are down significantly in the Portland market, and OCF is growing faster in this market than most others. Importantly, customer service scores have also improved markedly. Portland is really leading the pack.Moving on to DOCSIS 3.0, or wideband, we've deployed this technology to over 75% of our footprint, and plan to complete our DOCSIS 3.0 deployment in early 2010. DOCSIS 3.0 means we have a much faster high-speed data product, particularly in the 85% of the country that doesn't have fiber-based competition. About 35 million homes in our footprint can purchase 50 meg, with the ability for even higher speeds using wideband technology. In fact, Comcast now has more homes capable of providing 50-meg service than all the other cable and telephone companies combined. We believe speed will continue to power the next generation of applications and growth in high-speed Internet, and we're delighted to have made such good progress with DOCSIS 3.0.In 2009, we believe we laid the foundation for our technology platform to stay ahead of competition. As Brian mentioned, now that we're almost complete with repositioning ourselves technically, we're repositioning ourselves with the consumer. Therefore, we're launching XFINITY on February 12 in 11 markets. This is a major rebranding effort for Comcast cable. XFINITY gives the customer more choices, more convenience, more control over their entertainment, information and communication choices in more innovative ways. And we're really excited to introduce the XFINITY brand to our customers.Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest in future growth. In Business Services, we continue to have real success in the small end of the business market with a lot of room for growth. In fact, we've been growing this business, which is now quite sizable. Revenues have been growing 40% to 50% very consistently. Now we feel we're ready to expand our offering further, targeting companies with 20 to 250 employees; in other words, a larger company size than previously we've been targeting. This segment of the business' market spends $10 billion to $15 billion per year on the services we offer, which represents another opportunity roughly equal in size to the small end of the market, where we've been concentrating so far. So backhaul is another nice complementary business that can further leverage our network, and one we're actively pursuing. We size this business at roughly $1 billion for Comcast over time.Moving on to wireless, we're now in the execution phase with our High-Speed 2go product. In 2009, we launched in five major markets. In July, we launched Portland. Atlanta launched in July as well. In November, we launched Philadelphia. Chicago launched in December. And Seattle launched in December as well. As of year end, we're offering the product in more than 9 million of our homes passed. We look to significantly expand that by the end of 2010. High-Speed 2go is sold in conjunction with our high-speed data products, sold in a bundle which makes a lot of sense for the consumer and is a straightforward transaction for us to process. We've proven in Portland that Comcast High-Speed 2go, bundled with our high-speed data product, is a way to increase our High-Speed Data business. In Portland, roughly 40% of the High-Speed 2go customers are new high-speed Internet customers for Comcast. Moving on to advertising, during 2009, as Mike mentioned, our Advertising business went backwards $265 million. The good news is this core business is starting to turn around and could be possible upside in 2010. In addition, we continue to work on expanding the advertising opportunity with interactivity. And in the last 18 months, in conjunction with Canoe, we've made real progress on the iTV front. We've enabled about 12 million households in 30 markets to use the eBiz [ph] (00:46:51) platform to deliver reliable, interactive applications to our customers. These applications include Caller ID to the TV, now available in 3.5 million homes; RFI, Request for Information, piloting in three markets, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit. We're testing Remind/Record  [Ready Remind and Ready Record]. And we're also testing Shop-by-Remote with Home Shopping Network.   In 2010, you'll see us continue to grow our footprint while launching new iTV applications. At the same time, we're working hand in hand with other MSOs [multiple-system operators] and Canoe to establish standards and provide a national footprint. We think that's really important to making iTV really a breakthrough. We're excited about Canoe and think it represents a big opportunity for the industry, as we ramp up interactive advertising products on a national basis. The upside for advertising in 2010, however, will really be led by the turn in the market; which we're seeing in the fourth quarter, as Mike mentioned, with our core business net of political growing 10%,  but also strong trends as we enter 2010. Due to weakness in ad sales in the first half and lack of political, our Advertising business declined and was a real drag on revenue and OCF. It really cost us about 200 basis points of OCF growth in 2009. If current trends continue, this drag could turn into a real lift as we enter 2010. To summarize, in the worst economy in decades, despite greater competition and investing in more new initiatives in 2009 than any year I can remember, we achieved solid unit and financial growth; and as importantly, are really positioned well for the future.

Neil's track record, both with AOL before Charter and Charter through CableLabs and NCTA [National Cable & Telecommunications Association], I've known him for a long time. And I'm personally incredibly impressed with his leadership skills, how well I think he will fit into the culture at Comcast. He's just a terrific executive. Charter, obviously, when he got there, had lots of problems that preceded him. And I think he did more than a great job, an yeoman's job of dealing with the realities of a company that had too much debt and needed to go through a reorganization. As it came out of that reorganization, it created an opportunity for him to rethink where he wanted to work for the future. And the timing was amazingly perfect for us. And I think it's going allow us to continue what we've started, not have a big, strategic shift.

So I don't have a lot of specifics on the Apple tablet. I saw the presentation or parts of the presentation, I think there's incredible time for innovation going on right now. And I don't think it's ever been happening faster or more broadly, and there's going to be some hits and there's going to be some misses. What I think it's demonstrating or what's driving us is to have a company that is in a unique or a very special place, where all of our focus is on getting to the consumer with some of the Comcast products. And sometimes, that will be at the expense of other Comcast products and sometimes it's going to be an additive experience. Personally, I don't think people wanting more content want more devices. What they want is anything but a good thing for our company; whether we make that content, whether that encourages them to use the content more and therefore, in and out of the home. I went to CES [Consumer Electronics Show]. It relates to your question. And at that time, and again, since then, is the tablet. But at that time, the two hot products that I liked at CES [Consumer Electronics Show], one was Google's new Nexus phone. It was smaller than the iPhone, so a smaller screen was the hot product. And the other hot product was 152-inch 3D TV in high-def that everybody wanted. So you had these two very different extremes that the consumer wants, something really small and portable and something really big in the home. And I think we continue to find ways to service and want to be servicing those needs. So broadband had a showing again in 2009 at faster speeds, because folks want to consume more bits in their home; and our 4G platform that we're working with Clearwire to build, to have the fastest speeds outside of the home."

In terms of the programming expense slowdown, these things are very lumpy. And certain big deals will expire at certain times, and that'll drive some of the acceleration. And I think that lumpiness is probably a reason why '09 for us, and it's different for every cable company because their deals expire at different times, was a year that was higher than '10 is likely to be."

Churn is down year-to-year, which is, to me, a very interesting thing when the RBOCs have added 5 million new homes. There's a whole variety of theories as to why churn is down. I think some of it is we get more and more bundled customers. I think we've made some efforts and seeing some success with improved service, et cetera. So churn is down, but gross adds are up for high-speed data. And the High-Speed Data business, I think, has made a very interesting pivot in the first and second quarter. Certainly, in the second quarter, we were down significantly versus the prior year. And we've had a lot of weeks in the second half of the year where this business, which is a maturing business where we have 16 million customers, is doing better on a weekly basis than the prior year. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we've made the DOCSIS 3.0 investment, our speeds are better. But that has been surprising to us. So I think it's progress both on gross adds and churn. And who knows where that goes? It's very difficult to assess. The High-Speed Data business, I think, has been indexing at less than 100% of prior year, almost every year for certainly three, four, five years. And then all of a sudden, in the second half, it's indexing higher. And I think that could be due to a whole variety of things. We're certainly not assuming that as a lock to continue to happen through 2010. We certainly hope it does. But I think these things bounce around. And you will see quarters which are better and quarters which are worse, but we're certainly pleased with where we are."

And at the same time, with the launch of XFINITY and the emphasis on a lot has changed in our consumer proposition, this is again, a way to begin the new year by putting a real emphasis, particularly in those markets that are complete; some of these strategic initiatives that most of the rest of the markets will complete throughout the year, but would get close to completion. We think we have a real consumer message that is this is a different experience than we got just two years ago. The world has changed. A lot's changed for the positive.

Today, we are pleased to report a solid start to 2010. We achieved healthy financial and operating results in the first quarter driven by stronger customer growth, a rebound in advertising, continuing momentum",500,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are pleased to report a solid start to 2010. We achieved healthy financial and operating results in the first quarter driven by stronger customer growth, a rebound in advertising, continuing momentum in Business Services and a steady focus on expense and capital management.
This quarter, we added 590,000 Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers, a 7 1/2% increase over last year's first quarter. And we added more than $1 million RGUs, as we continue to deploy All-Digital and also, more customers upgraded or added higher levels of digital service. The first quarter marked a real turnaround in advertising, which helped our results in both Cable and Programming.
While it's not clear whether we're entirely out of the woods on the economy, we are cautious and optimistic and are clearly executing better in this environment and against the competition. We achieved growth in revenues, operating cash flow and strong free cash flow of $1.9 billion, a growth of 38% even as we reinvest to build a better, stronger company. 
Our results include ongoing investments in our products, in marketing and customer service and in new high-growth businesses like Comcast Business Services. We also continue to make significant progress deploying All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0. We reached nearly 80% of our footprint with DOCSIS 3.0, reinforcing our leadership position in broadband. As we deploy this capability, we are doubling the speed to our existing customers and introducing new higher-speed services in these markets.
Today, we offer 50 megabits speed service to 40 million homes where it's available and we'll soon begin to roll out a 100 megabit service. We are now actively deploying All-Digital in many of our markets, recapturing and more efficiently using our bandwidth. This project has dramatically increased our product offerings, particularly in HD television and foreign-language programming. We now offer a 100 or more high-def channels and we have doubled the amount of foreign-language programming available to between 50 and 70 channels in each of these XFINITY markets. 
As the year progresses, we will also significantly increased the amount of content available on demand to nearly 20,000 choices with 3,000 HD options available to our digital customers each month.  These strategic initiatives together with our focus on the customer experience beginning to bear fruit, as we see lower volumes of calls into our systems, improved customer satisfaction and retention. So across the board, I believe we're in solid position as we begin 2010.
Let me spend just one moment on NBC Universal. We're four and a half months into and approximate nine- to 12-month regulatory process. We are well underway in the planning and once the transaction closes, we believe we'll be ready to execute. We remain very excited about the prospects of this combination and the opportunity to deliver the best entertainment experiences to our consumers and to drive value creation for our shareholders. So let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in greater detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting solid execution as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth",1736,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting solid execution as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth, remain very focused on expense and capital management.
First quarter consolidated revenue increased 3.8% to $9.2 billion and operating cash flow grew 3.5% to $3.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.7%. This quarter's operating cash flow results include approximately $14 million of operating expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction, which is included in our Corporate and Other segment. Excluding these costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 3.9% and our operating cash flow margin increased to 38.9% from 38.8% in 2009. 
As I have mentioned previously, in addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we are also very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share, as important metric in evaluating the strength of our consolidated businesses. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the first quarter was very strong.
We generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, an increase of 38.1% versus the first quarter of 2009, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow into climbing capital intensity. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, free cash flow per share of $0.67 increased 42.6%, and EPS increased 14.8% to $0.31 per share. Excluding total NBC-related costs of $29 million this quarter and tax benefits in last year's first quarter, EPS would have grow 24% to $0.31 per share from $0.25 per share in 2009. With this review, our Cable division's first quarter results in more detail, please refer to Slide 5. 
First quarter Cable revenue increased 3 1/2% to $8.7 billion, reflecting continued growth in High-Speed Internet, Voice and Business Services, as well as a significant improvement in Cable advertising, partially offset by a decline in Video revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 6.3% to $123 per month in the first quarter, and reflects the increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the first quarter, 29% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 25% at the end of last year's first quarter.
We had stronger customer growth in the first quarter with 590,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customer additions, a 7 1/2% increase from last year's first quarter. This quarter's customer metrics were healthy across every product category. 
In Video, we lost 82,000 customers similar to last year's first quarter losses, even though the RBOCs added five million more homes to their footprint. And last year's first quarter included a benefit from the broadcast digital transition. 
In High-Speed Internet, net additions increased 21% to 399,000; and in Voice, net additions were solid at 273,000 indexing at 92% of last year. Overall, we are pleased with our customer additions in the first quarter, but please remember, we are also heading into a seasonally slow second quarter.
For the first quarter of 2010, total Video revenue decreased 1.8%, reflecting the impact of fewer rate increases in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Importantly, Video revenue did improve sequentially by 1.1%, as we saw an increasing number of our customers add or upgrade to higher level of the digital services, as we had continued growth in Advanced Services, adding 353,000 Advanced Service customers, which now represent over 50% of our digital customer base. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased 8 1/2% during the quarter, reflecting strong net additions and a slight increase in ARPU to almost $43, reflecting the impact of rate adjustments. Our HSI customer mix also remains strong, as we continue to add more than 2.5x as many higher-tier customers, than those on the economy level service. Our overall HSI penetration is now 32%.
Voice revenue increased 12.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in the customer base and a 3.6% decline in ARPU to $38 per month. We now have almost 7.9 million Voice customers with penetration now over 16%. 
As I mentioned, Cable advertising experienced a notable improvement in the first quarter of 2010, up 23 1/2%, as compared to the 15% decline experienced for the full year of 2009. While the improvement was led by the return of the automotive category, we saw a solid recovery in almost every category. Steve will review this in more detail in a few minutes. 
In addition, we continue to have real success in the small end of the business market with Business Services revenue increasing 49.1% to $263 million for the first quarter. We expect the momentum in a small end of the business market to continue, and we are also enthusiastic about the opportunity to develop our cell backhaul business and our capabilities to serving the mid-sized businesses. Please refer to Slide 6, to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results.
First quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 4.1% to $3.5 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin remain relatively stable at 40.8%, a 20 basis point improvement compared to last year's first quarter. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 3.1%, reflecting higher programming and marketing expenses.
Programming expenses increased 5% this quarter, reflecting the addition of new program, contract resets and the higher level of rate increases during last year's first quarter. We expect Programming expenses to increase at a higher rate in subsequent quarters, though we continue to expect full year Programming costs to grow at a slower rate than a 9% reported in 2009. 
Marketing expenses increased 16% this quarter, reflecting the upfront costs associated with the launch of our new XFINITY branding campaign, and a continued investment in direct sales and the retail channel. We will continue to invest in marketing, though we expect the rate of increase to be more moderate for the remainder of the year.
We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. And as a result, we continue to extract, scale benefits in our Voice and High-Speed Internet businesses. Compared to last year's first quarter, our direct cost for Voice declined 8.7% and High-Speed Internet cost reduced by 1.2%. Customer service expense declined 5.2% and technical labor expense declined 4.3% in the first quarter, as we benefited from lower activity levels, higher call automation in customer self-service, as well as other efficiencies related to what challenged 2010 initiative. These benefits were achieved even as we continue to expand the roll out of All-Digital and Wideband for a majority of our markets. 
Given the economic backdrop, we also have been very focused on delinquencies and bad debt expense and are now seeing bad debt expense decline for three consecutive quarters. Please refer to Slide 7, so we can review our capital expenditures for the quarter.
In the first quarter of 2010, capital expenditures decreased to 20% to $925 million, represented 10.1% of total revenue. The level of CapEx in this quarter benefited from timing as we accelerated some equipment purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment related to the economic stimulus and also attractive vendor discounts. 
In addition, the decline in first quarter CapEx was a result of improved efficiencies, lower spend in new construction and scalable infrastructure and continued reductions in equipment purchasing. Over the past three months, we deployed 3.2 million digital set tops and adapters, including almost 2.6 million digital adapters in support of the All-Digital roll out. We have now deployed approximately nine million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project. 
This quarter, we also deployed almost 600,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set tops, as we added 353,000 Advanced Service customers in the first quarter. We now have more than 9.5 million HD and/or DVR customers, equal to 50.5% of our digital customer base and 41% of all Video customers. 
Looking ahead, we expect CapEx will increase from first quarter levels, as we continue to invest to sustain momentum in Business Services and develop its efforts from mid-sized business and cell backhaul. With approximately 80% of our footprint now Wideband enabled, we have substantially completed our Wideband project. But we will continue our roll out of All-Digital and expect to substantially complete this project by year end. For the full year, we continue to expect our capital expenditures will be both lower in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when compared to 2009.
Please refer to Slide 8. Our priority for allocating capital remains the same, to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses that provide attractive incremental returns, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth. Our discipline and returns focused approach capital expenditures has helped drive significant free cash flow generation. And as I mentioned, previously, this quarter's free cash flow increased 38.1% to $1.9 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 42.6% to $0.67.
When we consider potential acquisitions or any external investments, we remain extremely disciplined and execution oriented, focused on the opportunities that extend our services or add features that allow us to build complementary revenue streams. 
During the first quarter, we closed two small transactions, Simcoe and NBT to help support the expansion of Business Services. Both of these acquisitions will accelerate our efforts and provide us with operational and technical expertise. However, our primary focus is to continue to grow this business organically. In addition in 2010, we expect most of our M&A energies to be spent on planning the NBC Universal transition.
Reflecting our strong commitment to returning capital directly to shareholders, we repurchased 19.2 million of our common shares for $300 million in the first quarter. As of March 31, we had approximately $3 billion of availability in the remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And as we have previously indicated, we intend to complete this repurchase subject to marketing conditions by the end of 2012.
Also, during the quarter, we paid a cash dividend totaling $268 million. And today, we paid our second quarterly dividend totaling $267 million. The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in the total payout ratio of approximately 50% of our last 12 months free cash flow. And based on our current stock price, this combined return of capital represents in excess of a 4% yield.
Okay, let me turn it now to Steve."

As you just heard, we're pleased with our first quarter performance. We're executing well effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we increased top and bottom line growth compared to the second half of last year. And",1175,"Thanks, Mike. As you just heard, we're pleased with our first quarter performance. We're executing well effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we increased top and bottom line growth compared to the second half of last year. And on the unit side, we saw strong results across the board, particularly impressive considering that last year's first quarter included some activity related to the country's digital transition. 
Beginning with High-Speed Data, we had another very strong quarter. Our net adds of 399,000 marked a second consecutive quarter of the year-on-year unit growth for this service, which is tremendous given the fact that this service is over 10 years old.
We think there are several factors behind our success. First, we've largely completed our DOCSIS 3.0, or Wideband roll out, which enabled us to increase speeds. We have real product superiority over DSL in most of the country and believe this is translating into significant share gains. 
Second, as we gain new customers, we're also seeing fewer disconnects with our existing customers and not just in our data service. We think our product and customer service investments are resulting in improved customer loyalty. We also continue to see more of our customers sign up with higher-speed offerings. Currently, over 20% of our customers subscribe to higher-speed tiers at 16 meg and above. We're excited about -- given the incremental revenue potential and the distinct competitive advantage we have at these higher speeds.
And even as we complete DOCSIS 3.0, we're committed to delivering more exciting value-added products and services for our customers in the future. We've now launched wireless 2go in five markets: Chicago, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia and Atlanta, and we'll be adding two more major markets during the second quarter in Boston and Houston.
Turning our attention to Video. Our All-Digital effort is now 43% complete and we're currently active in about 78% of our footprint. Our roll out pace is right on plan and as we said before, we expect 80% of our systems to have made the conversion to All-Digital by the end of this year.
Our All-Digital conversion is a major initiative for the company. In addition to the product enhancements, including more standard-def and high-def channels, we're already starting to see real operational benefits. After going All-Digital, markets can automate many connects and disconnects that previously required manual intervention. Importantly, Seattle and San Francisco, all markets that completed their conversions during 2009, were already realizing significant savings. These markets, we've eliminated about 25% of truck rolls associated with connect and disconnect activity. While not all markets are equal, we estimate these early markets will generate up to one incremental point of operating cash flow growth over time, just based on these financial savings.
I've mentioned before that about 80% of customers self-installed the digital adapters used in our All-Digital efforts. There are significant opportunities to drive down costs as we offer customers more opportunities to help themselves. We continue to focus on enabling customers to do self-installs, and we're driving more self-installations across the board in other products as well. 
We're also seeing some early signs of revenue lift in markets that have converted to All-Digital. For example, we're seeing an increase in pay-per-view revenue because when people convert to All-Digital and we complete our market conversions, all customers, except for lifeline basic customers, will have a digital set-top box in their primary outlet, enabling them to access or guide, watch VOD [video-on-demand] and order pay-per-view movies. We're also seeing early signs reduced theft above service, particularly customers who previously were paying only for lifeline basic but accessing higher-priced offerings.
In addition to where All-Digital efforts, our focus on the Triple Play is working. And we actually have the highest Triple Play sell in, in the last 12 months during the month of March. As mentioned previously, our disconnect activity has improved with churn better across all products this quarter. 
While it's early, this trend is very encouraging, given the economics of retaining customers versus going out and getting new customers. We attribute this reduced churn to three major factors. First, there's no doubt in our minds that our products and services are better today than they were a year ago. Product enhancements, improved reliability and a better customer experience is resonating with our customers. And as we roll out our XFINITY media campaign, customer awareness is growing.
Second, based on improvements in credit screening and qualification and with better economic conditions, we're realizing fewer non-disconnects. Third, while the marketplace remains highly competitive, the pace of the RBOC overbilled expansion has begun to moderate. 
Moving on to Business Services. We continue to have strong momentum in this business. We're now generating over $1 billion in annual run rate revenue, and we continue to drive strong growth rates in the 40% to 50% range. 
At the same time, we're growing our cell backhaul business and are putting the building blocks in place for the medium-sized business market. We're hiring additional sales and support staff this year. And we're in the early stages of an exciting opportunity in medium-sized business, just as we were several years ago in the small end of the business market.
Lastly, moving to advertising, you may recall from the last call that we mentioned some early signs of strength in our Advertising business as we ended 2009. The good news is that advertising has continued to strengthen into 2010. The 23% growth in ad revenue for the first quarter that we achieved was our first quarterly growth since the first quarter of 2008. And the turnaround in this business has been dramatic, particularly compared to last year's first quarter when advertising went backwards to 23%. Pacings continue to improve and we're consciously optimistic as we head into the rest of 2010. 
As Mike mentioned, the strength in ad sales has been fairly broadly based and we're seeing improvement across many areas, including local, regional and national. And while we're seeing a pickup in automotive advertising, we're also seeing it in many other categories, such as restaurants and retail, [indiscernible] posted double-digit increases. 
We're also seeing advertising strength in our Programming businesses. Ad revenue was up 6% this quarter compared to an 8% decline in the first quarter last year, driven by real rating strength at our entertainment networks, but also fundamental strength in the advertising market. 
In the first quarter, E! and G4, both had there highest quarterly ratings in their history and Style had its strongest-ever first quarter total viewership. The scatter market is very strong and we're optimistic about continued strengths for the rest of the year.
In conclusion, we had a solid first quarter and in good shape for the rest of 2010. We think we've struck the right balance between unit and financial growth.

Before we take your questions, I'm pleased to formally introduced on this call, Neil Smit, who is President of our Cable division. As we've mentioned previously, one of the most important things that I think have happened in the company's last 90 days would be the recruitment by Steve and myself of Neil to Comcast, to complement the fabulous team we have in the Cable division, also then freeing up a lot of Steve's time to help with the integration of NBC Universal. 
So on Monday morning, the day Neil started about four weeks ago, Steve and I, both showed up in Neil's office to see how he was doing. On his first day of work, his family isn't quite moved to Philly yet, will move in a few months. Asked Neil, what's going on, what you do yesterday when you got here? He said I came to the office and I listen to customer phone calls, which somehow he had arranged to be able to do, and I said to myself, I think we got our guy. Neil?"

Second, Steve and the senior team have worked hard to put growth platforms in place that will enable strong future growth. We've rolled out over nine million DTAs, launched DOCSIS 3.0 to over 80% of our footprint, build a thriving Business Services enterprise and challenged 2010, has streamlined processes, which speeds up our time to market. I think that my job is now to leverage these platforms and processes to drive profitable revenue growth and to really focus intently on transforming the end-to-end customer experience.
I came to Comcast because I think the company is well-positioned to define the future of the industry. And I'm looking forward to working with Brian, Steve and the rest of the senior management team to accomplish just this. Marlene, back to you for Q&A."

So that's probably four questions, let me see if I can answer a couple of them. Canoe is actually progressing quite well. We're really concentrating on interactivity that will drive off the EBIF [Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format] interactive platform that the industry is rolling out. And actually, I think in June, we're going to have about a seven million subscriber footprint throughout the industry and that ramps up to $20 million or $30 million pretty quickly. So we're pleased and really focused with that in terms of Canoe. On the medium-sized business front, the medium-sized business overall size is about the same as the small business overall size. So it's a very substantial opportunity and we've spent a lot of money on staffing [ph] up, which is embedded in the numbers. Starting to spend real money in terms of capital, so it's sort of equip ourselves for that business.

I think over subscribed and a very successful offering. On the timing, we're still hopeful later this year. We've put it in our public interest filing at the FCC. We have completed or we've had four congressional hearings. We've had the beginning of the documentation phase with the Department of Justice, and things are on track there. I think as business opportunities go, the only real comment I think we could make specifically about NBC is that it appears the advertising market has really turned around. It's not just one segment, clearly automotive is very robust. The overall health of advertising appears to be very pent-up demand. And I think bodes well for the timing of the transaction for Comcast in terms of when we chose to make the investment. I also think without getting into it in great specificity, we've all read and seen a lot of transactions involving retransmission consent in the last six months. And there's a real, I think, understanding that there is cash being paid and value being created, and we hope to play a constructive role in finding a way that, that can happen over the industry and over, at least, our share of Comcast and not be super disruptive.

They reach a maturity level, and your net adds slow down. And that's was what was happening with the High-Speed Data business until about a year ago. And then we and other cable companies, frankly, have started to re-accelerate our net adds. And I think in each of the last two quarters, our net adds for Comcast alone were as much as the entire big RBOC footprint combined. And we ask ourselves, what's going on there? I think there's a bunch of different things. The most important one for me is that the need for very, very large broadband capacity, which is partly related to video consumption on the Internet but also related to gaming and other things seems to continue to grow steadily. And we make our investment in DOCSIS 3.0 and really making sure that in the majority of the country, something like 75% of the country, our speed is just so significantly superior to DSL that, that really shifts the competitive balance. And I think there are a bunch of different factors that measure into our 399,000 subscriber High-Speed Data net adds for the quarter, but I think there's something going on because we've noticed in previous quarters that the other cable companies are seeing similar results. And I think once these trends start to happen, they tend to continue for a while. And hopefully, they will in this case."

We're not economists. But we certainly don't see that picking up. It's not getting worse. And when you're doing comparative analysis, first quarter '10 versus first quarter '09, it's not getting worse. And maybe it's slightly better in some markets. But we don't think that's a material impact. We do think there is a modest impact on Advanced Services, pay-per-view, high-def take-up. People appear to be a little bit more willing. That's not a dramatic thing. The only dramatic thing that we're seeing is advertising, and I'll just give you our slice of it here at local, national and regional Cable ad sales, not the content businesses like VERSUS and E!. We were significantly negative a year ago. We were down 23% the first quarter of '09. That situation was so [ph] negative in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, although it improved slightly during the year. And to be positive 23% in the first quarter of 2010, I think is a big, big move, a big shift. And the good news is, it's very broad. It's local, regional, national. It's almost every category that's big that we track. And it appears to be continuing. And it's a little scary when you're down 20%, you wonder whether this business is ever going to come back. Has it gone to the Internet? Is it a new low watermark that's going to stay forever? And the good news is, the majority of it appears to be coming back, a lot of breadth and depth to it. And it looks like it's going to continue. And as we've mentioned, this is an even numbered year [ph] with political on the back end. So once you get into the third and fourth quarter, not only do you have these positive trends, hopefully, they're going to continue through the year, but then you layer in political. So that, I think, is a very striking indication that maybe companies are feeling better about their prospects and prepared to spend. So I think in general, whereas six months ago, we weren't really seeing many signs of economic activity, we're seeing modest positives. And then when you get to advertising, a real positive."

I think there's a couple things going on. One, for the first time in a decade, our contact rates and truck rolls and calls into our call centers are starting to decline despite the fact that we have more customers. And there's a whole variety of reasons for that, and a lot of it is we spent a lot a money making sure our plant is more reliable. We spent obviously a lot of time and effort in the all-digital markets, which are starting to have reduced truck rolls, and that sort of all of the activity levels are declining. And that's a very material change to a cable company, and that historically, we were always hoping that would happen in some year. But every year, we were launching new products, and there was always a new reason for people to pick up a phone and call and new issues that we were dealing with in terms of reliability. So that is a major positive. And that's happening throughout many, many markets. Throughout all three products, contact rates are on a downward trajectory, so that's a very positive thing. The second thing is you're seeing the message from a program that we call challenge 2010, which we put in place about a year ago, coming up only a year ago, which was a sort of systematic way of trying to look at ways to make our business more efficient, to be able to move more quickly and also as a side benefit to financially have the business operate in a better manner. And many of those things, you're seeing in our P&L as well. Neil, Dave Watson, Dave Scott, our entire management team are working on making sure that we continue that process. You're right. When you put that all together on a very large cost base, if you take out Programming and even more so if you take out marketing and some of the new initiatives, the overall cost base is not increasing.

And these new devices are allowing it to be made available. I think so far, it's proving to sell more broadband for us. It's proving not to take away from television.

Today, we are pleased to report a solid start to 2010. We achieved healthy financial and operating results in the first quarter driven by stronger customer growth, a rebound in advertising, continuing momentum in Business Services and a steady focus on expense and capital management.
This quarter, we added 590,000 Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers, a 7 1/2% increase over last year's first quarter. And we added more than $1 million RGUs, as we continue to deploy All-Digital and also, more customers upgraded or added higher levels of digital service. The first quarter marked a real turnaround in advertising, which helped our results in both Cable and Programming.
While it's not clear whether we're entirely out of the woods on the economy, we are cautious and optimistic and are clearly executing better in this environment and against the competition. We achieved growth in revenues, operating cash flow and strong free cash flow of $1.9 billion, a growth of 38% even as we reinvest to build a better, stronger company. 
Our results include ongoing investments in our products, in marketing and customer service and in new high-growth businesses like Comcast Business Services. We also continue to make significant progress deploying All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0. We reached nearly 80% of our footprint with DOCSIS 3.0, reinforcing our leadership position in broadband. As we deploy this capability, we are doubling the speed to our existing customers and introducing new higher-speed services in these markets.
Today, we offer 50 megabits speed service to 40 million homes where it's available and we'll soon begin to roll out a 100 megabit service. We are now actively deploying All-Digital in many of our markets, recapturing and more efficiently using our bandwidth. This project has dramatically increased our product offerings, particularly in HD television and foreign-language programming. We now offer a 100 or more high-def channels and we have doubled the amount of foreign-language programming available to between 50 and 70 channels in each of these XFINITY markets. 
As the year progresses, we will also significantly increased the amount of content available on demand to nearly 20,000 choices with 3,000 HD options available to our digital customers each month.  These strategic initiatives together with our focus on the customer experience beginning to bear fruit, as we see lower volumes of calls into our systems, improved customer satisfaction and retention. So across the board, I believe we're in solid position as we begin 2010.
Let me spend just one moment on NBC Universal. We're four and a half months into and approximate nine- to 12-month regulatory process. We are well underway in the planning and once the transaction closes, we believe we'll be ready to execute. We remain very excited about the prospects of this combination and the opportunity to deliver the best entertainment experiences to our consumers and to drive value creation for our shareholders. So let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in greater detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting solid execution as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth",1736,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting solid execution as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth, remain very focused on expense and capital management.
First quarter consolidated revenue increased 3.8% to $9.2 billion and operating cash flow grew 3.5% to $3.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.7%. This quarter's operating cash flow results include approximately $14 million of operating expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction, which is included in our Corporate and Other segment. Excluding these costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 3.9% and our operating cash flow margin increased to 38.9% from 38.8% in 2009. 
As I have mentioned previously, in addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we are also very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share, as important metric in evaluating the strength of our consolidated businesses. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the first quarter was very strong.
We generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, an increase of 38.1% versus the first quarter of 2009, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow into climbing capital intensity. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, free cash flow per share of $0.67 increased 42.6%, and EPS increased 14.8% to $0.31 per share. Excluding total NBC-related costs of $29 million this quarter and tax benefits in last year's first quarter, EPS would have grow 24% to $0.31 per share from $0.25 per share in 2009. With this review, our Cable division's first quarter results in more detail, please refer to Slide 5. 
First quarter Cable revenue increased 3 1/2% to $8.7 billion, reflecting continued growth in High-Speed Internet, Voice and Business Services, as well as a significant improvement in Cable advertising, partially offset by a decline in Video revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 6.3% to $123 per month in the first quarter, and reflects the increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the first quarter, 29% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 25% at the end of last year's first quarter.
We had stronger customer growth in the first quarter with 590,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customer additions, a 7 1/2% increase from last year's first quarter. This quarter's customer metrics were healthy across every product category. 
In Video, we lost 82,000 customers similar to last year's first quarter losses, even though the RBOCs added five million more homes to their footprint. And last year's first quarter included a benefit from the broadcast digital transition. 
In High-Speed Internet, net additions increased 21% to 399,000; and in Voice, net additions were solid at 273,000 indexing at 92% of last year. Overall, we are pleased with our customer additions in the first quarter, but please remember, we are also heading into a seasonally slow second quarter.
For the first quarter of 2010, total Video revenue decreased 1.8%, reflecting the impact of fewer rate increases in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Importantly, Video revenue did improve sequentially by 1.1%, as we saw an increasing number of our customers add or upgrade to higher level of the digital services, as we had continued growth in Advanced Services, adding 353,000 Advanced Service customers, which now represent over 50% of our digital customer base. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased 8 1/2% during the quarter, reflecting strong net additions and a slight increase in ARPU to almost $43, reflecting the impact of rate adjustments. Our HSI customer mix also remains strong, as we continue to add more than 2.5x as many higher-tier customers, than those on the economy level service. Our overall HSI penetration is now 32%.
Voice revenue increased 12.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in the customer base and a 3.6% decline in ARPU to $38 per month. We now have almost 7.9 million Voice customers with penetration now over 16%. 
As I mentioned, Cable advertising experienced a notable improvement in the first quarter of 2010, up 23 1/2%, as compared to the 15% decline experienced for the full year of 2009. While the improvement was led by the return of the automotive category, we saw a solid recovery in almost every category. Steve will review this in more detail in a few minutes. 
In addition, we continue to have real success in the small end of the business market with Business Services revenue increasing 49.1% to $263 million for the first quarter. We expect the momentum in a small end of the business market to continue, and we are also enthusiastic about the opportunity to develop our cell backhaul business and our capabilities to serving the mid-sized businesses. Please refer to Slide 6, to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results.
First quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 4.1% to $3.5 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin remain relatively stable at 40.8%, a 20 basis point improvement compared to last year's first quarter. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 3.1%, reflecting higher programming and marketing expenses.
Programming expenses increased 5% this quarter, reflecting the addition of new program, contract resets and the higher level of rate increases during last year's first quarter. We expect Programming expenses to increase at a higher rate in subsequent quarters, though we continue to expect full year Programming costs to grow at a slower rate than a 9% reported in 2009. 
Marketing expenses increased 16% this quarter, reflecting the upfront costs associated with the launch of our new XFINITY branding campaign, and a continued investment in direct sales and the retail channel. We will continue to invest in marketing, though we expect the rate of increase to be more moderate for the remainder of the year.
We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. And as a result, we continue to extract, scale benefits in our Voice and High-Speed Internet businesses. Compared to last year's first quarter, our direct cost for Voice declined 8.7% and High-Speed Internet cost reduced by 1.2%. Customer service expense declined 5.2% and technical labor expense declined 4.3% in the first quarter, as we benefited from lower activity levels, higher call automation in customer self-service, as well as other efficiencies related to what challenged 2010 initiative. These benefits were achieved even as we continue to expand the roll out of All-Digital and Wideband for a majority of our markets. 
Given the economic backdrop, we also have been very focused on delinquencies and bad debt expense and are now seeing bad debt expense decline for three consecutive quarters. Please refer to Slide 7, so we can review our capital expenditures for the quarter.
In the first quarter of 2010, capital expenditures decreased to 20% to $925 million, represented 10.1% of total revenue. The level of CapEx in this quarter benefited from timing as we accelerated some equipment purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment related to the economic stimulus and also attractive vendor discounts. 
In addition, the decline in first quarter CapEx was a result of improved efficiencies, lower spend in new construction and scalable infrastructure and continued reductions in equipment purchasing. Over the past three months, we deployed 3.2 million digital set tops and adapters, including almost 2.6 million digital adapters in support of the All-Digital roll out. We have now deployed approximately nine million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project. 
This quarter, we also deployed almost 600,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set tops, as we added 353,000 Advanced Service customers in the first quarter. We now have more than 9.5 million HD and/or DVR customers, equal to 50.5% of our digital customer base and 41% of all Video customers. 
Looking ahead, we expect CapEx will increase from first quarter levels, as we continue to invest to sustain momentum in Business Services and develop its efforts from mid-sized business and cell backhaul. With approximately 80% of our footprint now Wideband enabled, we have substantially completed our Wideband project. But we will continue our roll out of All-Digital and expect to substantially complete this project by year end. For the full year, we continue to expect our capital expenditures will be both lower in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when compared to 2009.
Please refer to Slide 8. Our priority for allocating capital remains the same, to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses that provide attractive incremental returns, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth. Our discipline and returns focused approach capital expenditures has helped drive significant free cash flow generation. And as I mentioned, previously, this quarter's free cash flow increased 38.1% to $1.9 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 42.6% to $0.67.
When we consider potential acquisitions or any external investments, we remain extremely disciplined and execution oriented, focused on the opportunities that extend our services or add features that allow us to build complementary revenue streams. 
During the first quarter, we closed two small transactions, Simcoe and NBT to help support the expansion of Business Services. Both of these acquisitions will accelerate our efforts and provide us with operational and technical expertise. However, our primary focus is to continue to grow this business organically. In addition in 2010, we expect most of our M&A energies to be spent on planning the NBC Universal transition.
Reflecting our strong commitment to returning capital directly to shareholders, we repurchased 19.2 million of our common shares for $300 million in the first quarter. As of March 31, we had approximately $3 billion of availability in the remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And as we have previously indicated, we intend to complete this repurchase subject to marketing conditions by the end of 2012.
Also, during the quarter, we paid a cash dividend totaling $268 million. And today, we paid our second quarterly dividend totaling $267 million. The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in the total payout ratio of approximately 50% of our last 12 months free cash flow. And based on our current stock price, this combined return of capital represents in excess of a 4% yield.
Okay, let me turn it now to Steve."

As you just heard, we're pleased with our first quarter performance. We're executing well effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we increased top and bottom line growth compared to the second half of last year. And",1180,"Thanks, Mike. As you just heard, we're pleased with our first quarter performance. We're executing well effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we increased top and bottom line growth compared to the second half of last year. And on the unit side, we saw strong results across the board, particularly impressive considering that last year's first quarter included some activity related to the country's digital transition. 
Beginning with High-Speed Data, we had another very strong quarter. Our net adds of 399,000 marked a second consecutive quarter of the year-on-year unit growth for this service, which is tremendous given the fact that this service is over 10 years old.
We think there are several factors behind our success. First, we've largely completed our DOCSIS 3.0, or Wideband roll out, which enabled us to increase speeds. We have real product superiority over DSL in most of the country and believe this is translating into significant share gains. 
Second, as we gain new customers, we're also seeing fewer disconnects with our existing customers and not just in our data service. We think our product and customer service investments are resulting in improved customer loyalty. We also continue to see more of our customers sign up with higher-speed offerings. Currently, over 20% of our customers subscribe to higher-speed tiers at 16 meg and above. We're excited about -- given the incremental revenue potential and the distinct competitive advantage we have at these higher speeds.
And even as we complete DOCSIS 3.0, we're committed to delivering more exciting value-added products and services for our customers in the future. We've now launched wireless 2go in five markets: Chicago, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia and Atlanta, and we'll be adding two more major markets during the second quarter in Boston and Houston.
Turning our attention to Video. Our All-Digital effort is now 43% complete and we're currently active in about 78% of our footprint. Our roll out pace is right on plan and as we said before, we expect 80% of our systems to have made the conversion to All-Digital by the end of this year.
Our All-Digital conversion is a major initiative for the company. In addition to the product enhancements, including more standard-def and high-def channels, we're already starting to see real operational benefits. After going All-Digital, markets can automate many connects and disconnects that previously required manual intervention. In Portland, Seattle and San Francisco, all markets that completed their conversions during 2009, were already realizing significant savings. And in these markets, we've eliminated about 25% of truck rolls associated with connect and disconnect activity. While not all markets are equal, we estimate these early markets will generate up to one incremental point of operating cash flow growth over time, just based on these financial savings.
I've mentioned before that about 80% of customers self-installed the digital adapters used in our All-Digital efforts. There are significant opportunities to drive down costs as we offer customers more opportunities to help themselves. We continue to focus on enabling customers to do self-installs, and we're driving more self-installations across the board in other products as well. 
We're also seeing some early signs of revenue lift in markets that have converted to All-Digital. For example, we're seeing an increase in pay-per-view revenue because when people convert to All-Digital and we complete our market conversions, all customers, except for lifeline basic customers, will have a digital set-top box in their primary outlet, enabling them to access or guide, watch VOD [video-on-demand] and order pay-per-view movies. We're also seeing early signs of reduced theft above service, particularly customers who previously were paying only for lifeline basic but accessing higher-priced offerings.
In addition to our All-Digital efforts, our focus on the Triple Play is working. And we actually have the highest Triple Play sell in, in the last 12 months during the month of March. As mentioned previously, our disconnect activity has improved with churn better across all products this quarter. 
While it's early, this trend is very encouraging, given the economics of retaining customers versus going out and getting new customers. We attribute this reduced churn to three major factors. First, there's no doubt in our minds that our products and services are better today than they were a year ago. Product enhancements, improved reliability and a better customer experience is resonating with our customers. And as we roll out our XFINITY media campaign, customer awareness is growing.
Second, based on improvements in credit screening and qualification and with better economic conditions, we're realizing fewer non-disconnects. Third, while the marketplace remains highly competitive, the pace of the RBOC overbilled expansion has begun to moderate. 
Moving on to Business Services. We continue to have strong momentum in this business. We're now generating over $1 billion in annual run rate revenue, and we continue to drive strong growth rates in the 40% to 50% range. 
At the same time, we're growing our cell backhaul business and are putting the building blocks in place for the medium-sized business market. We're hiring additional sales and support staff this year. And we're in the early stages of an exciting opportunity in medium-sized business, just as we were several years ago in the small end of the business market.
Lastly, moving to advertising, you may recall from the last call that we mentioned some early signs of strength in our Advertising business as we ended 2009. The good news is that advertising has continued to strengthen into 2010. The 23% growth in ad revenue for the first quarter that we achieved was our first quarterly growth since the first quarter of 2008. And the turnaround in this business has been dramatic, particularly compared to last year's first quarter when advertising went backwards to 23%. Pacings continue to improve and we're consciously optimistic as we head into the rest of 2010. 
As Mike mentioned, the strength in ad sales has been fairly broadly based and we're seeing improvement across many areas, including local, regional and national. And while we're seeing a pickup in automotive advertising, we're also seeing it in many other categories, such as restaurants and retail, which also posted double-digit increases. 
We're also seeing advertising strength in our Programming businesses. Ad revenue was up 6% this quarter compared to an 8% decline in the first quarter last year, driven by real rating strength at our entertainment networks, but also fundamental strength in the advertising market. 
In the first quarter, E! and G4, both had their highest quarterly ratings in their history and Style had its strongest-ever first quarter total viewership. The scatter market is very strong and we're optimistic about continued strengths for the rest of the year.
In conclusion, we had a solid first quarter and in good shape for the rest of 2010. We think we've struck the right balance between unit and financial growth. At the same time, we continue to make good progress on our strategic investments, such as All-Digital, XFINITY and Business Services and are already seeing signs that these investments are paying off. 
Now let me pass it back to Brian."

We have completed or we've had four congressional hearings. We've had the beginning of the documentation phase with the Department of Justice, and things are on track there. I think as business opportunities go, the only real comment I think we could make specifically about NBC is that it appears the advertising market has really turned around. It's not just one segment, clearly automotive is very robust. The overall health of advertising appears to be very pent-up demand. And I think bodes well for the timing of the transaction for Comcast in terms of when we chose to make the investment. I also think without getting into it in great specificity, we've all read and seen a lot of transactions involving retransmission consent in the last six months. And there's a real, I think, understanding that there is cash being paid and value being created, and we hope to play a constructive role in finding a way that, that can happen over the industry and over, at least, our share of Comcast and not be super disruptive.

They reach a maturity level, and your net adds slow down. And that's was what was happening with the High-Speed Data business until about a year ago. And then we and other cable companies, frankly, have started to re-accelerate our net adds. And I think in each of the last two quarters, our net adds for Comcast alone were as much as the entire big RBOC footprint combined. And we ask ourselves, what's going on there? I think there's a bunch of different things. The most important one for me is that the need for very, very large broadband capacity, which is partly related to video consumption on the Internet but also related to gaming and other things seems to continue to grow steadily. And we make our investment in DOCSIS 3.0 and really making sure that in the majority of the country, something like 75% of the country, our speed is just so significantly superior to DSL that, that really shifts the competitive balance. And I think there are a bunch of different factors that measure into our 399,000 subscriber High-Speed Data net adds for the quarter, but I think there's something going on because we've noticed in previous quarters that the other cable companies are seeing similar results. And I think once these trends start to happen, they tend to continue for a while. And hopefully, they will in this case."

That's not a dramatic thing. The only dramatic thing that we're seeing is advertising, and I'll just give you our slice of it here at local, national and regional Cable ad sales, not the content businesses like VERSUS and E!. We were significantly negative a year ago. We were down 23% the first quarter of '09. That situation was so [ph] negative in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, although it improved slightly during the year. And to be positive 23% in the first quarter of 2010, I think is a big, big move, a big shift. And the good news is, it's very broad. It's local, regional, national. It's almost every category that's big that we track. And it appears to be continuing. And it's a little scary when you're down 20%, you wonder whether this business is ever going to come back. Has it gone to the Internet? Is it a new low watermark that's going to stay forever? And the good news is, the majority of it appears to be coming back, a lot of breadth and depth to it. And it looks like it's going to continue. And as we've mentioned, this is an even numbered year with political on the back end.

So that, I think, is a very striking indication that maybe companies are feeling better about their prospects and prepared to spend.

And the time watching television continues to be steady or go up. So I don't see any statistics that would suggest any real major change or maybe some stratification going on. But net-net for Comcast, we grew our revenue per customer 6%. That's a pretty great number."

But you've obviously done a good job on the rest of the expense base. I mean x those two buckets, you're flat year-on-year. So could you help us think about the rest of the year on the fixed cost side? Are you seeing real sort of secular changes in what it costs to run the Cable business because of the digital transition or your All-Digital projects? Are you reducing truck rolls? That's sort of a permanent step function lower. And then Brian, you mentioned the iPad. And if you look at the apps that are popular -- I think in the top 10, you've got Netflix and ABC. Just in case anyone needed any evidence the video was a popular thing to do on the iPad. TV Everywhere was definitely talked about on this call. But it looks like we could go in totally different directions. One is sort of every content company has their own app and interface à la ABC or the Netflix approach of aggregation, I mean at least to me, in my humble opinion, is the better solution for the industry and for the consumer. Where do you think we are on that debate? Do you think the content industry is trying to push the model towards the ABC or everyone has there own application? Is that the right strategy or how do you see that playing out?"

I think there's a couple things going on. One, for the first time in a decade, our contact rates and truck rolls and calls into our call centers are starting to decline despite the fact that we have more customers. And there's a whole variety of reasons for that, and a lot of it is we spent a lot a money making sure our plant is more reliable. We spent obviously a lot of time and effort in the all-digital markets, which are starting to have reduced truck rolls, and that sort of all of the activity levels are declining. And that's a very material change to a cable company, and that historically, we were always hoping that would happen in some year. But every year, we were launching new products, and there was always a new reason for people to pick up a phone and call and new issues that we were dealing with in terms of reliability. So that is a major positive. And that's happening throughout many, many markets. Throughout all three products, contact rates are on a downward trajectory, so that's a very positive thing. The second thing is you're seeing the message from a program that we call challenge 2010, which we put in place about a year ago, coming up only a year ago, which was a sort of systematic way of trying to look at ways to make our business more efficient, to be able to move more quickly and also as a side benefit to financially have the business operate in a better manner. And many of those things, you're seeing in our P&L as well. Neil, Dave Watson, Dave Scott, our entire management team are working on making sure that we continue that process. You're right. When you put that all together on a very large cost base, if you take out Programming and even more so if you take out marketing and some of the new initiatives, the overall cost base is not increasing. And that is helping us maintain margin."

I think that there's a lot of experimentation. There's not going to be a ""one size fits all"" solution to how different companies take on new technology as people change their strategies as they go. The fact is we're proceeding, trying to find ways to get as much content available, as many devices as possible for our customers and do it in a way that is seamless and easy to authenticate and easy to take advantage of the service as others are pursuing different strategies. I do think there's a general recognition that we're in the early stages, that it's a nascent business. I think professional content legally procured by the consumer is a small percentage of YouTube and other services that are different, but it's growing. And these new devices are allowing it to be made available. I think so far, it's proving to sell more broadband for us. It's proving not to take away from television. The idea of [ph] just going back to the Consumer Electronics Show at year end, the buzz on the floor where there's 150-inch 3D TV and a really small cell phone, which is a smartphone.

If you look at what's happened in the movie theater, in movie business, they've been able to get a premium experience and a premium revenue for that experience. And maybe there are business opportunities for us to deliver events in 3D, which had a very successful experience with the Masters in 3D. We demoed it all over the country. And I think it happened both on TVs and over the PCs. And one of the things -- I think we were the first with the Masters to ever do a 3D live broadcast over the Internet. And a number of people commented to me how great that experience is. And you can imagine 3D gaming over the Internet where these PCs are already 3D-enabled if you have the right graphics card. So again, it's early. I wouldn't put anything in numbers for a little while here. But as the technology goes, this appears to be something that will put us in a great position to offer that to consumers. And over time, many of these events come out like a wow.

Today, we are pleased to report a solid start to 2010. We achieved healthy financial and operating results in the first quarter driven by stronger customer growth, a rebound in advertising, continuing momentum",501,"Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are pleased to report a solid start to 2010. We achieved healthy financial and operating results in the first quarter driven by stronger customer growth, a rebound in advertising, continuing momentum in Business Services and a steady focus on expense and capital management.
This quarter, we added 590,000 Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers, a 7.5% increase over last year's first quarter, and we added more than 1 million RGUs, as we continue to deploy All-Digital and also, more customers upgraded or added higher levels of digital service. The first quarter marked a real turnaround in advertising, which helped our results in both Cable and Programming.
While it's not clear whether we're entirely out of the woods on the economy, we are cautious and optimistic and are clearly executing better in this environment and against the competition. We achieved growth in revenues, operating cash flow and strong free cash flow of $1.9 billion, a growth of 38% even as we reinvest to build a better and stronger company. 
Our results include ongoing investments in our products, in marketing and customer service and in new high-growth businesses like Comcast Business Services. We also continue to make significant progress deploying All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0. We reached nearly 80% of our footprint with DOCSIS 3.0, reinforcing our leadership position in broadband. As we deploy this capability, we are doubling the speeds to our existing customers and introducing new higher-speed services in these markets.
Today, we offer 50-megabits speed service to 40 million homes where it's available and we'll soon begin to roll out a 100-megabit service. We are now actively deploying All-Digital in many of our markets, recapturing and more efficiently using our bandwidth. This project has dramatically increased our product offerings, particularly in HD television and foreign-language programming. We now offer a 100 or more high-def channels and we have doubled the amount of foreign-language programming available to between 50 and 70 channels in each of these XFINITY markets. 
As the year progresses, we will also significantly increase the amount of content available on demand to nearly 20,000 choices with 3,000 HD options available to our digital customers each month.  These strategic initiatives, together with our focus on the customer experience, are beginning to bear fruit as we see lower volumes of calls into our systems, improved customer satisfaction and retention. So across the board, I believe we're in a solid position as we begin 2010.
Let me spend just one moment on NBC Universal. We're four and a half months into an approximate nine- to 12-month regulatory process. We are well under way in the planning, and once the transaction closes, we believe we'll be ready to execute. We remain very excited about the prospects of this combination and the opportunity to deliver the best entertainment experiences to our consumers and to drive value creation for our shareholders. So let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in greater detail."

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting solid execution as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth",1727,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting solid execution as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth, remain very focused on expense and capital management.
First quarter consolidated revenue increased 3.8% to $9.2 billion and operating cash flow grew 3.5% to $3.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 38.7%. This quarter's operating cash flow results include approximately $14 million of operating expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction, which is included in our Corporate and Other segment. Excluding these costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 3.9% and our operating cash flow margin increased to 38.9% from 38.8% in 2009. 
As I've mentioned previously, in addition to revenue and operating cash flow, we are also very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of our consolidated businesses. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the first quarter was very strong.
We generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, an increase of 38.1% versus the first quarter of 2009, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow and declining capital intensity. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, free cash flow per share of $0.67 increased 42.6%, and EPS increased 14.8% to $0.31 per share. Excluding total NBC-related costs of $29 million this quarter and tax benefits in last year's first quarter, EPS would have grown 24% to $0.31 per share from $0.25 per share in 2009. 
Let us review, our Cable division's first quarter results in more detail, please refer to Slide 5. First quarter Cable revenue increased 3.5% to $8.7 billion, reflecting continued growth in High-Speed Internet, Voice and Business Services, as well as a significant improvement in Cable advertising, partially offset by a decline in Video revenue. Total revenue per Video customer increased 6.3% to $123 per month in the first quarter and reflects the increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the first quarter, 29% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 25% at the end of last year's first quarter.
We had stronger customer growth in the first  quarter with 590,000 total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customer additions, a 7.5% increase from last year's first quarter. This quarter's customer metrics were healthy across every product category. 
In Video, we lost 82,000 customers, similar to last year's first quarter losses, even though the RBOCs added five million more homes to their footprint, and last year's first quarter included a benefit from the broadcast digital transition. 
In High-Speed Internet, net additions increased 21% to 399,000, and in Voice, net additions were solid at 273,000 indexing at 92% of last year. Overall, we are pleased with our customer additions in the first quarter, but please remember, we are also heading into a seasonally slow second quarter.
For the first quarter of 2010, total Video revenue decreased 1.8%, reflecting the impact of fewer rate increases in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Importantly, Video revenue did improve sequentially by 1.1%, as we saw an increasing number of our customers add or upgrade to higher levels of our digital services, as we had continued growth in Advanced Services, adding 353,000 Advanced Service customers, which now represent over 50% of our digital customer base. 
High-Speed Internet revenue increased 8.5% during the quarter, reflecting strong unit additions and a slight increase in ARPU to almost $43, reflecting impact of rate adjustments. Our HSI customer mix also remains strong as we continue to add more than 2.5x as many higher-tier customers than those on the economy level service. Our overall HSI penetration is now 32%.
Voice revenue increased 12.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our customer base and a 3.6% decline in ARPU to $38 per month. We now have almost 7.9 million Voice customers with penetration now over 16%. 
As I mentioned, Cable advertising experienced a notable improvement in the first quarter of 2010, up 23.5% as compared to the 15% decline experienced for the full year of 2009. While the improvement was led by the return of the automotive category, we saw a solid recovery in almost every category. Steve will review this in more detail in a few minutes. 
In addition, we continue to have real success in the small end of the business market, with Business Services revenue increasing 49.1% to $263 million for the first quarter. We expect the momentum in a small end of the business market to continue and we are also enthusiastic about the opportunity to develop our Cell Backhaul business and our capabilities to serving the mid-sized businesses. 
Please refer to Slide 6, to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. First quarter Cable operating cash flow increased 4.1% to $3.5 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin remain relatively stable at 40.8%, a 20 basis point improvement compared to last year's first quarter. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 3.1%, reflecting higher programming and marketing expenses.
Programming expenses increased 5% this quarter, reflecting the addition of new programming, contract resets and a higher level of rate increases during last year's first quarter. We expect Programming expenses to increase at a higher rate in subsequent quarters, though we continue to expect full year Programming costs to grow at a slower rate than a 9% reported in 2009. 
Marketing expenses increased 16% this quarter, reflecting the upfront costs associated with the launch of our new XFINITY branding campaign, and a continued investment in direct sales and the retail channel. We will continue to invest in marketing, though we expect the rate of increase to be more moderate for the remainder of the year.
We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. And as a result, we continue to extract scale benefits in our Voice and High-Speed Internet businesses. Compared to last year's first quarter, our direct costs for Voice declined 8.7% and our High-Speed Internet costs were reduced by 1.2%. Customer service expense declined 5.2% and technical labor expense declined 4.3% in the first quarter, as we benefited from lower activity levels, higher call automation in customer self service, as well as other efficiencies related to what challenged 2010 initiative. These benefits were achieved even as we continue to expand the roll out of All-Digital and wideband to a majority of our markets. 
Given the economic backdrop, we have also been very focused on delinquencies and bad debt expense and are now seeing bad debt expense decline for three consecutive quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 7 so we can review our capital expenditures for the quarter. In the first quarter of 2010, capital expenditures decreased to 20% to $925 million, representing 10.1% of total revenue. The level of CapEx spend this quarter benefited from timing as we accelerated some equipment purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 to take advantage of favorable tax treatment related to the economic stimulus and also attractive vendor discounts. 
In addition, the decline in first quarter CapEx was a result of improved efficiencies, lower spend in new construction and scalable infrastructure and continued reductions in equipment pricing. Over the past three months, we deployed 3.2 million digital set-tops and adapters, including almost 2.6 million digital adapters in support of the All-Digital rollout. We have now deployed approximately nine million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project. 
This quarter, we also deployed almost 600,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-tops, as we added 353,000 Advanced Service customers in the first quarter. We now have more than 9.5 million HD and/or DVR customers equal to 50.5% of our Digital customer base and 41% of all Video customers. 
Looking ahead, we expect CapEx will increase from first quarter levels, as we continue to invest to sustain momentum in Business Services and develop its efforts from mid-sized business and cell backhaul. With approximately 80% of our footprint now Wideband enabled, we have substantially completed our Wideband project, but we will continue our rollout of All-Digital and expect to substantially complete this project by year end. For the full year, we continue to expect our capital expenditures will be both lower in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when compared to 2009.
Please refer to Slide 8. Our priority for allocating capital remains the same; to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses that provide attractive incremental returns, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth. Our discipline and returns-focused approach to capital expenditures has helped drive significant free cash flow generation. And as I mentioned previously, this quarter's free cash flow increased 38.1% to $1.9 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 42.6% to $0.67.
When we consider potential acquisitions or any external investments, we remain extremely disciplined and execution oriented, focused on the opportunities that extend our services or add features that allow us to build complementary revenue streams. 
During the first quarter, we closed two small transactions, CIMCO and NGT to help support the expansion of Business Services. Both of these acquisitions will accelerate our efforts and provide us with operational and technical expertise. However, our primary focus is to continue to grow this business organically. In addition in 2010, we expect most of our M&A energies to be spent on planning the NBC Universal transition.
Reflecting our strong commitment to returning capital directly to shareholders, we repurchased 19.2 million of our common shares for $300 million in the first quarter. As of March 31, we had approximately $3 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And as we have previously indicated, we intend to complete this repurchase subject to marketing conditions by the end of 2012.
Also, during the quarter, we paid a cash dividend totaling $268 million. And today, we paid our second quarterly dividend totaling $267 million. The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in the total payout ratio of approximately 50% of our last 12 months free cash flow. And based on our current stock price, this combined return of capital represents in excess of a 4% yield. Okay, let me turn it now to Steve."

We're executing well effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we increased top and bottom line growth compared to the second half of last year. And on the unit side, we saw strong results across the board particularly impressive, considering that last year's first quarter included some activity related to the country's digital transition. 
Beginning with High-Speed Data, we had another very strong quarter. Our net adds of 399,000 marked the second consecutive quarter of the year-on-year unit growth for this service, which is tremendous, given the fact that this service is over 10 years old.
We think there are several factors behind our success. First, we've largely completed our DOCSIS 3.0, or Wideband rollout, which enabled us to increase speeds. We have real product superiority over DSL in most of the country and believe this is translating into significant share gains. 
Second, as we gain new customers, we're also seeing fewer disconnects with our existing customers and not just in our data service. We think our product and customer service investments are resulting in improved customer loyalty. We also continue to see more of our customers sign up for higher-speed offerings. Currently, over 20% of our customers subscribe to higher-speed tiers at 16 meg and above. We're excited about this given the incremental revenue potential and the distinct competitive advantage we have at these higher speeds.
And even as we complete DOCSIS 3.0, we're committed to delivering more exciting value-added products and services for our customers in the future. We've now launched wireless 2go in five markets, Chicago, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia and Atlanta, and we'll be adding two more major markets during the second quarter in Boston and Houston.
Turning our attention to Video. Our All-Digital effort is now 43% complete and we're currently active in about 70% of our footprint. Our rollout pace is right on plan, and as we said before, we expect 80% of our systems to have made the conversion to All-Digital by the end of this year.
Our All-Digital conversion is a major initiative for the company. In addition to the product enhancements, including more standard-def and high-def channels, we are already starting to see real operational benefits. After going All-Digital, markets can automate many connects and disconnects that previously required manual intervention. In Portland, Seattle and San Francisco, all markets that completed their conversions during 2009, were already realizing significant savings. And in these markets, we've eliminated about 25% of truck rolls associated with connect and disconnect activity. While not all markets are equal, we estimate these early markets will generate up to one incremental point of operating cash flow growth over time just based on these financial savings.
I've mentioned before that about 80% of customers self-installed the digital adapters used in our All-Digital efforts. There are significant opportunities to drive down costs as we offer customers more opportunities to help themselves. We continue to focus on enabling customers to do self-installs, and we're driving more self-installations across the board in other products as well. 
We're also seeing some early signs of revenue lift in markets that have converted to All-Digital. For example, we're seeing an increase in pay-per-view revenue because when people convert to All-Digital and we complete our market conversions, all customers, except for our lifeline basic customers, will have a digital set-top box in their primary outlet, enabling them to access our guide, watch VOD [video-on-demand] and order pay-per-view movies. We're also seeing early signs of reduced theft of service, particularly customers who previously were paying only for lifeline basic but accessing higher-priced offerings.
In addition to our All-Digital efforts, our focus on the Triple Play is working. And we actually have the highest Triple Play sell-in, in the last 12 months during the month of March. As mentioned previously, our disconnect activity has improved with churn better across all products this quarter. 
While it's early, this trend is very encouraging, given the economics of retaining customers versus going out and getting new customers. We attribute this reduced churn to three major factors. First, there's no doubt on our minds that our products and services are better today than they were a year ago. Product enhancements, improved reliability and a better customer experience is resonating with our customers. And as we roll out our XFINITY media campaign, customer awareness is growing. Second, based on improvements in credit screening and qualification and with better economic conditions, we're realizing fewer non-pay disconnects. Third, while the marketplace remains highly competitive, the pace of the RBOC overbilled expansion has begun to moderate. 
Moving on to Business Services. We continue to have strong momentum in this business. We're now generating over $1 billion in annual run rate revenue, and we continue to drive strong growth rates in the 40% to 50% range. 
At the same time, we're growing our Cell Backhaul business and are putting the building blocks in place for the medium-sized business market. We're hiring additional sales and support staff this year, and we're in the early stages of an exciting opportunity in medium-sized business, just as we were several years ago in the small end of the business market.
Lastly, moving to Advertising, you may recall from the last call that we mentioned some early signs of strength in our Advertising business as we ended 2009. The good news is that advertising has continued to strengthen into 2010. The 23% growth in Ad revenue for the first quarter that we achieved was our first quarterly growth since the first quarter of 2008. And the turnaround in this business has been dramatic, particularly compared to last year's first quarter when advertising went backwards 23%. Pacings continue to improve and we're cautiously optimistic as we head into the rest of 2010. 
As Mike mentioned, the strength in ad sales has been fairly broadly based and we're seeing improvement across many areas, including local, regional and national. And while we're seeing a pickup in automotive advertising, we're also seeing it in many other categories such as restaurants and retail, which also posted double-digit increases. 
We're also seeing advertising strength in our Programming businesses. Ad revenue was up 6% this quarter compared to an 8% decline in the first quarter last year, driven by real rating strength at our entertainment networks but also fundamental strength in the advertising market. 
In the first quarter, E! and G4 both had their highest quarterly ratings in their history and Style had its strongest-ever first quarter total viewership. The scatter market is very strong and we're optimistic about continued strength for the rest of the year.
In conclusion, we had a solid first quarter and are in good shape for the rest of 2010. We think we've struck the right balance between unit and financial growth. At the same time, we continue to make good progress on our strategic investments, such as All-Digital, XFINITY and Business Services and are already seeing signs that these investments are paying off. Now let me pass back to Brian."

Before we take your questions, I'm pleased to formally introduce on this call, Neil Smit, who is President of our Cable division. As we mentioned previously, one of the most important things that I think have happened in the company's last 90 days would be the recruitment by Steve and myself of Neil to Comcast to complement the fabulous team we have in the Cable division, also then freeing up a lot of Steve's time to help with the integration of NBC Universal. 
So on Monday morning, the day Neil started about four weeks ago, Steve and I both showed up in Neil's office, see how he was doing. On his first day of work, his family hasn't quite moved to Philly yet, will move in a few months. Asked Neil, what's going on, what you do yesterday when you got here? He said, ""I came to the office and I listened to customer phone calls."" Which somehow he had arranged to be able to do. And I said to myself, ""I think we got our guy."" Neil?"

So that's probably four questions, let me see if I can answer a couple of them. Canoe is actually progressing quite well. We're really concentrating on interactivity that will drive off the EBIF [Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format] interactive platform that the industry is rolling out. And actually, I think in June, we're going to have about a seven million subscriber footprint throughout the industry and that ramps up to $20 million or $30 million pretty quickly. So we're pleased and really focused with that in terms of Canoe. On the medium-sized business front, the medium-sized business overall size is about the same as the small business overall size. So it's a very substantial opportunity and we've spent a lot of money on staffing up, which is embedded in the numbers. Starting to spend real money in terms of capital, so it's sort of equip ourselves for that business.

I think over subscribed and a very successful offering. On the timing, we're still hopeful later this year. We've put it in our public interest filing at the FCC. We have completed or we've had four congressional hearings. We've had the beginning of the documentation phase with the Department of Justice, and things are on track there. I think as business opportunities go, the only real comment I think we could make specifically about NBC is that it appears the advertising market has really turned around. It's not just one segment, clearly automotive is very robust. The overall health of advertising appears to be very pent-up demand. And I think bodes well for the timing of the transaction for Comcast in terms of when we chose to make the investment. I also think without getting into it in great specificity, we've all read and seen a lot of transactions involving retransmission consent in the last six months. And there's a real, I think, understanding that there is cash being paid and value being created, and we hope to play a constructive role in finding a way that, that can happen over the industry and over, at least, our share of Comcast and not be super disruptive. So again, I think nothing but good developments and we're in the middle of the process."

They reach a maturity level, and your net adds slow down. And that's was what was happening with the High-Speed Data business until about a year ago. And then we and other cable companies, frankly, have started to re-accelerate our net adds. And I think in each of the last two quarters, our net adds for Comcast alone were as much as the entire big RBOC footprint combined. And we ask ourselves, what's going on there? I think there's a bunch of different things. The most important one for me is that the need for very, very large broadband capacity, which is partly related to video consumption on the Internet but also related to gaming and other things seems to continue to grow steadily. And we make our investment in DOCSIS 3.0 and really making sure that in the majority of the country, something like 75% of the country, our speed is just so significantly superior to DSL that, that really shifts the competitive balance. And I think there are a bunch of different factors that measure into our 399,000 subscriber High-Speed Data net adds for the quarter, but I think there's something going on because we've noticed in previous quarters that the other cable companies are seeing similar results. And I think once these trends start to happen, they tend to continue for a while. And hopefully, they will in this case."

I think whether it's on the phone or an install or a service call, I think if we can get our reps focused on getting it right the first time, that's a real opportunity. And then finally, having been out to the field, I've been out to all the divisions in most of the regions, and I think there are just some great things going on there. I think truck rolls are down and repeat trouble calls are down. And our Think Customer First scores are up. So there's a lot of great work going on throughout the business. And I think there's an opportunity to share those best practices that are happening. And I've been really impressed with the focus that we do have on customer service. I mean it is part of the bonus metrics for a lot of people. And I think Steve's made a lot of progress on that front. And it's my job to leverage those things and even increase the focus more."

This was a very specific question about really due process, in our opinion and whether there were any rules and what they were and whether we had been given any opportunity to talk about it. We've changed that practice long before there were any FCC rulings whatsoever, and we haven't had any recurrences. So regarding future regulatory actions, we continue to want to have a constructive dialogue with all of our regulators and FCC in particular to try to find ways to have customers comfortable and knowing that investment is going to continue to flow and at the same time that they are going to continue to enjoy the great Internet experience that they have that's really powered all the innovation that's happening in the last 10, 15 years."

We're not economists, but we certainly don't see that picking up. It's not getting worse. And when you're doing comparative analysis, first quarter '10 versus first quarter '09, it's not getting worse and maybe it's slightly better in some markets, but we don't think that's a material impact. We do think there is a modest impact on Advanced Services, pay-per-view, high-def take-up. People appear to be a little bit more willing, but it's not a dramatic thing. The only dramatic thing that we're seeing is advertising, and I'll just give you our slice of it here in local Cable ads at local, national and regional Cable ad sales, not the content business is like versus in E!. We were significantly negative a year ago. We were down 23% the first quarter of '09. That situation was still negative in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, although it improved slightly during the year. And to be positive 23% in the first quarter of 2010, I think is a big, big move, a big shift. And the good news is, it's very broad. It's local, regional, national. It's almost every category that's big that we track. And it appears to be continuing. And it's a little scary when you're down 20%, you wonder whether this business is ever going to come back. Has it gone to the Internet? Is it a new low watermark that's going to stay forever? And the good news is, the majority of it appears to be coming back, a lot of breadth and depth to it, and it looks like it's going to continue. And as we've mentioned, this is an even-numbered year with political on the back end. So once you get into the third and fourth quarter, not only do you have these positive trends, hopefully, they're going to continue through the year, but then you layer in political. So that, I think, is a very striking indication that maybe companies are feeling better about their prospects and prepared to spend. So I think in general, whereas six months ago, we weren't really seeing many signs of economic activity, we're seeing modest positives. And then when you get to advertising, a real positive."

One, for the first time in a decade, our contact rates and truck rolls and calls into our call centers are starting to decline despite the fact that we have more customers. And there's a whole variety of reasons for that, and a lot of it is we spent a lot a money making sure our plant is more reliable. We spent obviously a lot of time and effort in the all-digital markets, which are starting to have reduced truck rolls, and that sort of all of the activity levels are declining. And that's a very material change to a cable company, and that historically, we were always hoping that would happen in some year. But every year, we were launching new products, and there was always a new reason for people to pick up a phone and call and new issues that we were dealing with in terms of reliability. So that is a major positive. And that's happening throughout many, many markets. Throughout all three products, contact rates are on a downward trajectory, so that's a very positive thing. The second thing is you're seeing the message from a program that we call challenge 2010, which we put in place about a year ago, coming up only a year ago, which was a sort of systematic way of trying to look at ways to make our business more efficient, to be able to move more quickly and also as a side benefit to financially have the business operate in a better manner. And many of those things, you're seeing in our P&L as well. Neil, Dave Watson, Dave Scott, our entire management team are working on making sure that we continue that process. You're right.

Today, we are pleased to report strong financial results for the second quarter and the first half as we continue to focus on profitable growth. In the second quarter, revenue and operating cash flow growth accelerated to 6%, and we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 16%. These results reflect improved Video revenue, double-digit growth in High-Speed Internet and Voice revenues and strong momentum in our Business Services group. 
In addition, a stronger advertising market helped us achieve advertising revenue growth of 20% or more in both our Cable and Programming businesses. These healthy financial results also take into account the typical seasonality in our Cable markets in the second quarter and other promotional activities last year including the country's digital transition. I believe our strong results demonstrate that we are striking a good balance between revenue, cash flow and customer growth, and that we remain disciplined in managing operating expenses and capital.
It's still difficult to see perfectly the direction and strength of the economy, so we remain cautious but optimistic about our ability to continue to execute in this environment. Under the new leadership of Neil Smit, who is off to a fantastic start internally, we are continuing to make steady progress deploying All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, strategic initiatives that dramatically improve our product offerings to consumers and strengthen our competitive position now and in the future. 
We have now deployed All-Digital in about 60% of our markets, and we are currently active in 80% of our footprint, allowing us to significantly increase our product offering in HD television, foreign-language programming and On Demand. We're also building a leadership position in 3D with movies, events and sports.
We now reach more than 80% of our footprint with DOCSIS 3.0, which reinforces our product superiority as we double the speed to our existing customers and introduce new higher-speed services like 50 megabits to more than 40 million homes available. We're also delivering accelerating growth in revenues and operating cash flow and strong growth in free cash flow, while we invest to improve the customer experience and to support new growth opportunities that position the company for future success.
Another opportunity for Comcast is NBC Universal, where Steve Burke has turned much of his focus to planning on a successful integration. We're eight months into the regulatory approval process, and we're on track to close this transaction, we hope, by year end. As Steve will discuss, we are well underway in our planning, and we're more excited about the prospects of this combination now than when we first announced the transaction last December. It provides a real opportunity to deliver the best entertainment experience to consumers and to drive value creation for our shareholders. So let me now pass to Michael Angelakis to cover the second quarter results in more detail. Mike?"

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results, reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth and remain very focused on expense and capital management. 
Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $9.5 billion, and operating cash flow grew 5.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 39.2%. This quarter's operating cash flow results include approximately $22 million of operating expense related to the NBC Universal transaction, which is included in our Corporate and Other segment. Excluding these costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 6.3%, and our operating cash flow margin increased to 39.5% from 39.4% in 2009. We are also very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the enterprise. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis were strong and reflected continued progress and growth.
During the second quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.4 billion, an increase of 15.8% versus the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased 27.8% to $3.2 billion from $2.5 billion in 2009. In addition, free cash flow per share increased 20% in the quarter to $0.48 per share and year-to-date, free cash flow per share has increased 31% to $1.15 per share compared to the same period in 2009. 
In the second quarter, excluding total NBCU-related costs of $59 million and tax benefits in last year's second quarter, earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.33 per share from $0.29 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, again, excluding NBCU-related costs of $88 million in the first half of this year and tax benefits during the first half of 2009, EPS grew 18.5% over the comparable period in 2009. 
Please refer to Slide 5 to review the Cable division's second quarter results. Second quarter Cable revenue increased 5.1% to $8.9 billion, reflecting accelerating organic growth in each of our businesses including Video, High-Speed Internet, Voice and Business Services, as well as a continued improvement in Cable advertising. Customer growth was relatively strong in the first five months of the year. But in June, customer additions were softer than expected, and this has continued into July. We believe this reflects a continuing soft economy and competition, as well as a natural rolloff of single-product video customers we had gained from the 12-month promotions related to the broadcast digital transition.
For the second quarter, total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers grew to 47.8 million, an increase of 3.4% or 1.6 million new customer additions over the last 12 months. Despite the seasonally affected customer growth, total revenue per Video customer increased 8% to $128 per month in the second quarter and reflects rate increases in Video and High-Speed Data, a higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and the increasing number of customers taking multiple products.
At the end of the second quarter, 31% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 26% at the end of last year's second quarter. For the second quarter of 2010, total Video revenue has started to accelerate and increased 0.7%, reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher level of our digital services and improved pay-per-view performance, driven by day-and-date movies and events. We now have 23.2 million Video customers.
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 10.3% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments and more customers taking higher-speed services. We now have 16.4 million High-Speed Internet customers with penetration of 32.2%.
Voice revenue also posted a strong growth by increasing 14.3% for the quarter as we continue to grow our customer base. We now have over 8 million Voice customers with penetration of 16.5%. We continue to have real success in the small end of the business market, with Business Services revenue increasing 54.4% to $306 million for the second quarter. Excluding the contribution from our CIMCO and NGT acquisitions completed in the first quarter, revenue increased 45%. We expect the momentum in the small end of the business market to continue, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand our Cell Backhaul business and our capabilities to serve mid-sized business. As I mentioned, Cable advertising continue to rebound as revenue in the second quarter increased 22.6%. This improvement was led by a continued strength in automotive, as well as a solid recovery in almost every category.
Please refer to Slide 6 to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 5.7% to $3.7 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin remain relatively stable at 41.3%, a 20 basis point improvement compared to last year's second quarter. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 4.6%, reflecting higher Programming and marketing expenses. Programming expenses increased 6.4% this quarter, reflecting the addition of new programming, contract resets and higher pay-per-view expenses. As I mentioned last quarter, we do expect Programming expenses to increase at a higher rate in the subsequent quarters.
Marketing expenses increased 12.3% this quarter, reflecting a continued investment in direct sales, our retail channel, as well as costs associated with the ongoing rollout of our new XFINITY branding campaign, which will be in 80% of our markets by year end. We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. In the second quarter, customer service expense declined 2.4%, and technical labor expense declined 7.6% as we benefited from a number of efficiency initiatives, which resulted in lower activity levels, higher call automation and customer self-service.
Given the economic backdrop, we have also been very focused on delinquencies and our bad debt expense and now have seen bad debt expense decline for four consecutive quarters. Please refer to Slide 7 to review our capital expenditures for this quarter.
In the second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures increased 1.5% to $1.1 billion, representing 11.9% of total revenue. The modest uptick in the level of CapEx spend this quarter reflects an increased investment to support the growth and expansion in Business Services and product enhancement initiatives in the areas of Converged Products, IT technology and switched digital video. These items, together with the timing of CPE purchases, contributed to the sequential increase in CapEx from the first to the second quarter.
During the second quarter, we deployed 4.6 million digital set-tops and adapters including 4 million digital adapters in support of the All-Digital rollout. We have now deployed almost 13 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project. This quarter, we also deployed almost 500,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-tops as we added 154,000 Advanced Service customers in the second quarter. We now have 9.7 million high-def and/or DVR customers equal to 50% of our Digital customer base and 42% of all Video customers.
Year-to-date, capital expenditures increased 9.6% to $2.1 billion or 11% of revenue. However, looking ahead, we do expect CapEx will modestly increase in the second half of 2010 as we continue to invest to sustain momentum in Business Services and expand our efforts for the mid-sized businesses and Cell Backhaul. With over 80% of our footprint now wideband-enabled, we have substantially completed our wideband project. But we will continue our rollout of All-Digital and expect to be substantially complete with this project by year end. Even with all the product and business-oriented growth investments, we expect our 2010 capital expenditures will be lower in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when compared with last year. 
Please refer to Slide 8. Our priority for allocating capital has been consistent to be returns-oriented and to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses that provide attractive incremental returns, enhance our competitive position and deliver a sustainable organic growth. Our discipline and returns-focused approach to CapEx has helped drive significant growth and free cash flow generation. And as I mentioned previously, this quarter's free cash flow increased 15.8% to $1.4 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 20% to $0.48 per share. Year-to-date, free cash flow increased 27.8% to $3.2 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 30.7% to $1.15 per share.
Reflecting our strong commitment to return capital directly to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased 17.3 million of our common shares worth $300 million, and year-to-date, we have repurchased 36.4 million shares for $600 million. As of June 30, we have approximately $2.7 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and as we have previously indicated, we intend to complete this repurchase, subject to market conditions, by the end of 2012. Also during the quarter, we paid a cash dividend totaling $267 million. Today, we paid our third quarterly dividend totaling $265 million, for a total of $800 million year-to-date.
The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in a total payout ratio of approximately 44% of our last 12 months' free cash flow. Based on our current stock price, this combined return of capital now represents an excess of a 4% yield. Now let me turn it over to Steve."

As you just heard, we're pleased with our second quarter results as we are effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we saw good acceleration in both revenue and operating cash flow and believe our product and efficiency initiatives like All-Digital, DOCSIS 3.0 and Challenge 2010 are beginning to have a real positive impact on our results. 
On the unit side, the second quarter is seasonally slow for us in both Video and High-Speed Data due to the number of customers in college and vacation towns. In fact, for High-Speed Data, the more successful we are at adding these customers in the third quarter, the more pronounced this second quarter seasonality becomes the following year. However, I think it's important to note that in the first half of 2010, we've added 517,000 new High-Speed Data customers. That's an increase of 31% over the first half of 2009. In addition to seasonality, last year's second quarter included a significant amount of promotional activity related to the national digital transition. As these deeply discounted promotions are rolling off, we are being disciplined in the offers we're providing these customers. However, these are price-sensitive high-churn customers, and we elected not to chase them. 
When you look at the quarter overall, we effectively managed the business for profitable growth. In the second quarter, we reported improved Video revenue, double-digit growth in High-Speed Internet and Voice revenue. Also, the momentum in Business Service continues. We're firing on all cylinders in this business and as Mike mentioned, we're maintaining our 40% to 50% growth rate even as our base gets bigger.
In addition, advertising continued to really turn around. Also, our financials showed that we've been very effective in driving average revenue per unit or ARPU growth. Over the last three quarters, Video ARPU has increased 5%, and High-Speed Data ARPU has increased over 4%. As a result, both revenue and operating cash flow growth in the second quarter accelerated. We expect the momentum to continue in the second half of this year as we continue to focus on targeted retention and acquisition offers in an effort to get the right balance and the right products to the right customer.
Moving on to advertising. In the first half of 2010, Cable advertising increased 23%. The turnaround in the Advertising business has been dramatic, particularly compared to the first half of 2009 when Advertising declined 21%. As Mike mentioned earlier, this growth was led by the auto sector, but we're seeing real improvements across many categories, including retail, food and beverage, healthcare and education, which all posted double-digit increases. Importantly, political advertising is starting to ramp for November 2010, and we should see this gain momentum in the second half of 2010 as political campaigns heat up around the country. This rebound in advertising is occurring across all areas including local, regional and national. 
We're also seeing advertising strength in our Programming business. Ad revenue was up 21% in the second quarter for the Programming group compared to a 7% decline in the second quarter of last year, driven by a strong advertising performance across all our networks and real rating strength at E!, VERSUS and G4. Both E! and G4 had their most-watched and highest-rated second quarters in their history, and VERSUS had its most-watched second quarter prime driven by the NHL playoffs. The scatter market continues to be very strong and we're optimistic about the momentum in advertising in our Programming business. When you look at Advertising for Comcast, combining the Programming business and Cable, Advertising is about $2.5 billion a year, a large number, but not all that significant compared to $35 billion in total revenues. With a combined NBC Universal and Comcast, advertising revenue will approach at very meaningful $10 billion. Having the advertising market rebound is a very good thing for the combined company.
Moving on to NBC Universal. We, as all of you know, have done a number of successful acquisitions over the years. But in every deal, it seems like from the time you announce to the time you close, a number of things inevitably go wrong. What's been really exciting about NBC Universal is that since we announced the deal in December, there had been mainly positive turnarounds, most notably, the Advertising business, which is very important, but also, our ability to put in place some financing, given market conditions that is very attractive and a number of creative improvements. At NBC, at the strong Cable channels and also at Universal Studios, with the recent hit at the box office of the new movie, Despicable Me, which could turn into a real successful franchise. On our end, currently, we're highly focused on the planning as to how we will execute once we close this transition. We're careful about the rules and regulations regarding this, where we're planning both administratively and strategically for the business post close. We're meeting weekly to identify growth opportunities in order to hit the ground running when the deal closes. At this point, we remain even more excited than we were when we announced the transaction in December and look forward to close by the end of this year.

We signed the deal last December, most companies that were advertising-based were going backwards. Today, eight months later, to be going up 15%, 20%, 25% is a big deal for a company that's going to have $10 billion worth of advertising. Secondly, a lot of the financing that we're putting in place, because the market is more favorable than we assumed it would be is coming in, has come in at very attractive rates. Third, I think really, in a number of the businesses, they've had a number of wins, and that stretches from NBC to the Cable channels to Universal Studios. The entry into the Animation business with Despicable Me is a big deal in our opinion. And then finally, we spent a lot of time doing post-merger planning and have been through a lot of the businesses. The NBC executives have looked at our Cable businesses, and we keep identifying more and more opportunities to do things together that can enhance value. So if you look at some of our other deals, when we did the AT&T broadband deal that was right before Enron, right before the world fell apart, the stock market went down, interest rates started to gyrate, so we've been there before when it feels like everything is going against you.

We've actually seen it grow a little bit, both on a Cable side and on the consolidated side and that includes absorbing a lot of initiatives that we've been pursuing as well as the NBCU costs. So I think the team has done a terrific job of really managing a margin over several years. If you look at one of the slides that I had, you can see that the margins are remarkably stable over a long period of time, and that, again, involves absorbing meaningful costs. With regards to ARPU, you're seeing a couple of things. One, we have done rate adjustments, which I mentioned on both Video and High-Speed. And also, we are selling more three-product and double-product bundles. Really, now about almost one out of three of our customers take three services. So that has helped a lot as well.

Today we are pleased to report strong financial results for the second quarter and the first half as we continue to focus on profitable growth. In the second quarter, revenue and operating cash flow growth accelerated to 6%, and we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 16%.
These results reflect improved video revenue, double-digit growth and high speed internet and voice revenues and strong momentum in our business services group. In addition, a stronger advertising market helped us achieve advertising revenue of 20% or more in both our cable and programming businesses. These healthy financial results also take into account the typical seasonality in our cable markets in the second quarter and other promotional activities last year including the country's digital transition. 
I believe our strong results demonstrate that we are striking a good balance between revenue, cash flow and customer growth. And we remain disciplined in managing operating expenses and capital. It's still difficult to see perfectly the direction and strength of the economy. So, we remain cautious but optimistic about our ability to continue to execute in this environment. 
Under the new leadership of Neil Smit, who is of to a fantastic start internally, we are continuing to make steady progress deploying all digital and DOCSIS 3.0 strategic initiatives that dramatically improve our product offerings to consumers and strengthen our competitive positive now and in the future. 
We have now deployed all digital and about 60% of our markets, and we're currently active in 80% of our footprint allowing us to significantly increase our product offering in HD television, foreign language programming and on-demand. We're also building a leadership position in 3D with movies, events and sports. 
We now reach more than 80% of our footprint with DOCSIS 3.0, which reinforces our product superiority as we double the speed to our existing customers, and introduce new higher speed services like 50 megabits to more than 40 million homes available. We're also delivering accelerating growth in revenues and operating cash and strong growth in free cash flow while we invest to improve the customers experience and to support new growth opportunities that position the company for future success. 
Another opportunity for Comcast is NBC Universal, which Steve Burke has turned much of his focus to planning on a successful integration. We're eight months into the regulatory approval process, and we're on track to close this transaction we hope by year-end. As Steve will discuss, we are well underway in our planning, and we are more excited about the prospects of this combination now than we first announced the transaction last December. 
It provides the real opportunities to deliver the best entertainment experience to consumers, and to drive value creation for our shareholders. Let me now pass to Michael Angelakis to cover the second quarter results in more detail. Mike?

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on slide four. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth as we continue to balance revenue operating cash flow and customer growth and remain very focused on expense and capital management.
Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to 9.5 billion, and operating cash flow grew 5.7% to 3.7 billion resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 39.2%. This quarters operating cash flow results include approximately 22 million of operating expense related to the NBC Universal transaction which is included in our corporate and other segments.
Excluding these costs consolidated operating cash flow grew 6.3% and our operating cash flow margin increased at 39.5% from 39.4% in 2009. We are also very focused on free cash flow and free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metric in evaluating the strength of the enterprise.
In each of this key metric our performance during the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis were strong and reflected continued progress and growth. During the second quarter we generated consolidated free cash flow of 1.4 billion an increase of 15.8% versus the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased 27.8% to 3.2 billion from 2.5 billion in 2009.
In addition, free cash flow per share increased 20% in the quarter to $0.48 per share and year-to-date free cash flow per share has increased 31% to a $1.15 per share compared to the same period in 2009.
In the second quarter, excluding total NBCU related costs of 59 million and tax benefits in last years second quarter earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.33 per share from $0.29 per share last year.
On a year-to-date basis again, excluding NBC related cost of 88 million in the first half of this year and tax benefits during the first half of 2009 EPS grew 18.5% over the comparable period in 2009.
Please refer to slide five to review the cable division's second quarter results. Second quarter cable revenue increased 5.1% to 8.9 billion reflecting accelerating organic growth in each of our businesses including video, high speed internet, voice and business services as well as a continued improvement in cable advertising.
Customer growth was relatively strong in the first five months of the year but in June customer additions were softer than expected and this is continued into July. We believe this reflects a continuing soft economy and competition as well as a natural roll off of single product video customers we had gained from the 12 month promotions related to the broadcast visual transition.
For the second quarter, total video, high speed internet and voice customers grew to 47.8 million an increase of 3.4% or 1.6 million new customer additions over the last 12 months. Despite the seasonally affected customer growth total revenue per video customer increased 8% to a $128 per month in the second quarter and reflects rate increases in video and high speed data, a higher contribution from Comcast business services and the increasing number of customers taking multiple products.
At the end of the second quarter, 31% of our video customers took all three services compared to 26% at the end of last year's second quarter. For the second quarter of 2010 total video revenue has started to accelerate and increased 0.7% reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher level of our digital services and improved pay-per-view performance driven by day-and-date movies and events.
We now have 23.2 million video customers. High speed internet revenue increased a healthy 10.3% during the quarter reflecting rate adjustments and more customers taking higher speed services. We now have 16.4 million high speed internet customers with penetration of 32.2%. Voice revenue also posted a strong growth by increasing 14.3% for the quarter as we continue to grow our customer base. We now have over 8 million voice customers with penetration of 16.5%.
We continue to have real success in the small end of the business market with business services revenue increasing 54.4% to 306 million for the second quarter. Excluding the contribution from our CIMCO and NGT acquisitions completed in the first quarter, revenue increased 45%. We expect the momentum in the small end of the business market to continue and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand our sell backhaul business and our capabilities to serve mid sized businesses.
As I mentioned cable advertising continue to rebound as revenue in the second quarter increased 22.6%. This improvement was led by a continued strength in automotive as well as a solid recovery in almost every category. Please refer to slide 6 to review our cable division's operating cash flow results.
Second quarter operating cash flow increased 5.7% to 3.7 billion. Our cable operating cash flow margin remained relatively stable at 41.3%, a 20 basis point improvement compared to last year's second quarter. Total expenses in our cable segment increased 4.6%, reflecting higher programming and marketing expenses.
Programming expenses increased 6.4% this quarter reflecting the addition of new programming, contract resets and higher pay per view expenses. As I mentioned last quarter we do expect programming expenses to increase at a higher rate in the subsequent quarters.
Marketing expenses increased 12.3% this quarter reflecting a continued investment in direct sales, our retail channel as well as cost associated with the ongoing roll out of our new XFINITY branding campaign which will be in 80% of our markets by year end.
We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. In the second quarter customer service expense declined 2.4% and technical labor expense declined 7.6% as we benefitted of efficiency initiatives which resulted in lower activity levels, higher coal automation and customer self service. Given the economic backdrop, we have also been very focused on delinquencies and our bad debt expense and now have seen bad debt expense decline for four consecutive quarters.
Please refer to slide 7 to review our capital expenditures for this quarter. In the second quarter of 2010 capital expenditures increased 1.5% to 1.1 billion representing 11.9% of total revenue. The modest uptick in the level of CapEx spend this quarter reflects an increased investment to support the growth and expansion in business services and product enhancement initiatives in the areas of converged products, IP technology and switch digital video. These items together with the timing of CPE purchases contributed to the sequential increase in CapEx from the first to the second quarter.
During the second quarter we deployed 4.6 billion digital set tops and adaptors including 4 million digital adaptors in support of the all digital roll out. We have now deployed almost 13 million digital adaptors since the exception of the all digital project.
This quarter we also deployed almost 500,000 advanced HD and or DVR Set-tops as we added 154,000 advanced service customers in the second quarter. We now have 9.7 million HiDef and or DRV customers equal to 50% of our digital customer base and 42% of all video customers. Year-to-date capital expenditure decreased 9.6% to 2.1 billion or 11% of revenue. However looking ahead, we do expect CapEx will modestly increase in the second half of 2010 as we continue to invest a sustained momentum in business services and expand our efforts for the mid-sized businesses and sell backhaul.
With over 80% of our footprint now wideband enabled, we have substantially completed our wideband project, but we will continue our rollout of all digital and expect to be substantially complete with this project by year-end. Even with all the product and business oriented growth investments, we expect our 2010 capital expenditures will be lower and both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when compared with last year.
Please refer to slide eight. Our priority for allocating capital has been consistent, to be return oriented and to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses that provide attractive incremental returns, enhanced our competitive position and delivers sustainable organic growth.
Our discipline and return focus approach to CapEx has help drive significant growth in free cash flow generation and as I mentioned previously, this quarter's free cash flow increased 15.8% to 1.4 billion and free cash flow per share increased to 20% to $0.48 per share.
Year-to-date, free cash flow increased 27.8% to 3.2 billion and free cash flow per share increased 30.7% with $1.15 per share. Reflecting our strong commitment to return capital directly to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased 17.3 million of our common shares with 300 million and year-to-date we have repurchased 36.4 million shares for $600 million.
As of June 30th, we have approximately 2.7 billion availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization, as we have previously indicated we intend to complete this repurchase subject to market conditions by the end of 2012.
Also during the quarter, we paid a cash dividend totaling 267 million. Today, we paid our third quarterly dividend totaling 265 million for total of 800 million year-to-date. The combination of dividends and stock buyback resulted in a total payout ratio approximately 44% of our last 12 months free cash flow. Based on our current stock price, this combined return of capital now represent in excess of a 4% yield. Now, let me turn it over to Steve.

As you just heard, we're pleased with our second quarter results as we are effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we saw a good acceleration in both revenue and operating cash flow and believe our product and efficiency initiatives like all digital, DOCSIS 3.0 and challenged 2010, a beginning to have a real positive impact on our results.
On the unit side, the second quarter is seasonally slow for us in both video and high-speed data due to the numbers of customers and college-in-vacation towns. In fact, for high-speed data, the more successfully we are at adding these customers in the third quarter, the more pronounced this second quarter seasonality becomes the following year. However, I think it's important to note that in the first half of 2010, we've added 517,000 new high-speed data customers, that's an increase of 31%over the first half of 2009. In addition to seasonality, last years second quarter included a significant amount of promotional activity related to the National Digital Transition. As these deeply discounted promotions are rolling off we are being disciplined in the offers we are providing these customers. However, these are price sensitive, high churn customers and we elected not to chase them.
When you look at the quarter overall, we effectively manage the business for profitable growth. In the second quarter, we reported improved video revenue, double digit growth in high speed internet and voice revenue. Also the momentum in business service continues, we are firing in all cylinders in this business and as Mike mentioned, we are maintaining our 40% to 50% growth rate even as our base gets bigger.
In addition, advertising continued to really turn around. Also our financials show that we've been very effective in driving average revenue per unit or ARPU growth. Over the last three quarters video ARPU has increased 5% and high speed data ARPU has increased over 4%, as a result both revenue and operating cash flow growth in the second quarter accelerated. We expect the momentum to continue in the second half of this year as we continue to focus on targeted retention and acquisition offers in an effort to get the right balance and the right products to the right customer.
Moving on to advertising, in the first half of 2010, cable advertising increased 23%, the turn around in the advertising business has been dramatic. Particularly compared to the first half of 2009, when advertising declined 21%. As Mike mentioned earlier this growth was lead by the auto sector, but we are seeing real improvements across many categories, including retail, food and beverage, healthcare and education, which all posted double digit increases.
Importantly political advertising is starting to ramp from November 2010. We should see this gain momentum in the second half of 2010 as political campaigns heat up around the country. This rebound in advertising is occurring across all areas including local, regional and national. We're also seeing advertising strength in our programming business; ad revenue is up 21% in the second quarter for the programming group compared to a 7% decline in the second quarter of last year. Driven by a strong advertising performance across all our networks and real rating strength at E!, VERSUS and G4.
Both E! And G4 had there most watched and highest rated second quarters in there history and VERSUS had its most watched second quarter prime driven by the NHL playoffs. The scatter market continues to be very strong and we are optimistic about the momentum in advertising in our programming business.
When you look at advertising for Comcast, combining the programming business and cable, advertising is about $2.5 billion a year, a large number but not all the significant compared to 35 billion in total revenues. With a combined NBC Universal and Comcast, advertising revenue will approach a very meaningful $10 billion. Having the advertising market rebound is a very good thing for the combined company.
Moving on the NBC Universal, we as all of you know have done a number of successful acquisitions over the years, but in every deal it's seems like from the time you announce to the time you close, a number of things inevitably go wrong. What's been really exiting about NBC Universal is that since we announced the deal in December, there had been mainly positive turnarounds. Most notably the advertising business which is very important, but also our ability to put in place some financing given market conditions that is very attractive and a number of creative improvements. At NBC, at the strong cable channels and also at Universal Studios with the recent hit at the box office of the new movie ""Despicable Me"" which could turn into a real successful franchise.
On our end, currently we're highly focused on the planning as to how we will execute once we close this transition. We are careful about the rules and regulations regarding this, or planning both administratively and strategically for the business post close. We're meeting weekly to identify growth opportunities in order to hit the ground running when the deal closes. At this point, we remain even more excited than we were -- when we announced the transaction in December, and look forward to close by the end of this year. 
Now let me turn it back to Marlene for Q&A.

Today eight months later, to be going pick up 15, 20, 25% is a big deal for the company that's going to have $10 billion of advertising.
Secondly, a lot of the financing that we are putting in place because the market is favorable than we assumed it would be is coming in, has come in at very attractive rates. Third, I think really in a number of the businesses, they had a number of wins, and that stretches from NBC to the cable channels to Universal Studios. The entry to the animation business with ""Despicable Me"" is a big deal in our opinion.
And then finally, we spent a lot of time doing post-merger planning and has been through a lot of the businesses, the NBC executives have looked at our cable businesses and we keep identifying more and more opportunities to do things together that can enhance value.
So, if you look at some of our deals when we do the AT&T broadband deal it was right before Enron, right before the world fell up on the stock market went down, interest rates started to gyrate. So, we have been there before when it feels like everything is going against you in this instance it certainly feels like everything that we can see that's major is going our way.

So I think the team has done a terrific job of really managing a margin over several years. If you look at one of the slides that I had, you can see that the margins are remarkably stable over a long period of time and that again involves absorbing meaningful costs.
With regards to ARPU you're seeing a couple of things. One, we have done rate adjustments which I mentioned on both video and high speed. And also we are selling more three product and double product bundles. It's really now about, almost one out of three of our customers take three services.

Just curious or maybe if Steve if you could talk about how much the shifting window on VOD is helping that business and obviously with Universal coming down the pipe, you're going to have more opportunities to look at how you maximize the VOD platform.
I think this is a business that probably has a lot of up sides, I'm curious if you could talk about that and then second maybe for Neil, I don't think anybody mentioned the Clearwire High-Speed 2go product, just curious how that roll out is going and if your putting a lot of marketing muscle behind that, how do you think the customer reception and price points are working so far?

And I think that's really critical as we go forward.

Today, we are pleased to report strong financial results for the second quarter and the first half as we continue to focus on profitable growth. In the second quarter, revenue and operating cash flow growth accelerated to 6%, and we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 16%. These results reflect improved Video revenue, double-digit growth in High-Speed Internet and Voice revenues and strong momentum in our Business Services group. 
In addition, a stronger advertising market helped us achieve advertising revenue growth of 20% or more in both our Cable and Programming businesses. These healthy financial results also take into account the typical seasonality in our Cable markets in the second quarter and other promotional activities last year including the country's digital transition. I believe our strong results demonstrate that we are striking a good balance between revenue, cash flow and customer growth, and that we remain disciplined in managing operating expenses and capital.
It's still difficult to see perfectly the direction and strength of the economy, so we remain cautious but optimistic about our ability to continue to execute in this environment. Under the new leadership of Neil Smit, who is off to a fantastic start internally, we are continuing to make steady progress deploying All-Digital and DOCSIS 3.0, strategic initiatives that dramatically improve our product offerings to consumers and strengthen our competitive position now and in the future. 
We have now deployed All-Digital in about 60% of our markets, and we are currently active in 80% of our footprint, allowing us to significantly increase our product offering in HD television, foreign-language programming and On Demand. We're also building a leadership position in 3D with movies, events and sports.
We now reach more than 80% of our footprint with DOCSIS 3.0, which reinforces our product superiority as we double the speed to our existing customers and introduce new higher-speed services like 50 megabits to more than 40 million homes available. We're also delivering accelerating growth in revenues and operating cash flow and strong growth in free cash flow, while we invest to improve the customer experience and to support new growth opportunities that position the company for future success.
Another opportunity for Comcast is NBC Universal, where Steve Burke has turned much of his focus to planning on a successful integration. We're eight months into the regulatory approval process, and we're on track to close this transaction, we hope, by year end. As Steve will discuss, we are well underway in our planning, and we're more excited about the prospects of this combination now than when we first announced the transaction last December. It provides a real opportunity to deliver the best entertainment experience to consumers and to drive value creation for our shareholders. So let me now pass to Michael Angelakis to cover the second quarter results in more detail. Mike?"

Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results, reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth as we continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth and remain very focused on expense and capital management. 
Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $9.5 billion, and operating cash flow grew 5.7% to $3.7 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 39.2%. This quarter's operating cash flow results include approximately $22 million of operating expense related to the NBC Universal transaction, which is included in our Corporate and Other segment. Excluding these costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 6.3%, and our operating cash flow margin increased to 39.5% from 39.4% in 2009. We are also very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the enterprise. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis were strong and reflected continued progress and growth.
During the second quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.4 billion, an increase of 15.8% versus the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased 27.8% to $3.2 billion from $2.5 billion in 2009. In addition, free cash flow per share increased 20% in the quarter to $0.48 per share and year-to-date, free cash flow per share has increased 31% to $1.15 per share compared to the same period in 2009. 
In the second quarter, excluding total NBCU-related costs of $59 million and tax benefits in last year's second quarter, earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.33 per share from $0.29 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, again, excluding NBCU-related costs of $88 million in the first half of this year and tax benefits during the first half of 2009, EPS grew 18.5% over the comparable period in 2009. 
Please refer to Slide 5 to review the Cable division's second quarter results. Second quarter Cable revenue increased 5.1% to $8.9 billion, reflecting accelerating organic growth in each of our businesses including Video, High-Speed Internet, Voice and Business Services, as well as a continued improvement in Cable advertising. Customer growth was relatively strong in the first five months of the year. But in June, customer additions were softer than expected, and this has continued into July. We believe this reflects a continuing soft economy and competition, as well as a natural rolloff of single-product video customers we had gained from the 12-month promotions related to the broadcast digital transition.
For the second quarter, total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers grew to 47.8 million, an increase of 3.4% or 1.6 million new customer additions over the last 12 months. Despite the seasonally affected customer growth, total revenue per Video customer increased 8% to $128 per month in the second quarter and reflects rate increases in Video and High-Speed Data, a higher contribution from Comcast Business Services and the increasing number of customers taking multiple products.
At the end of the second quarter, 31% of our Video customers took all three services compared to 26% at the end of last year's second quarter. For the second quarter of 2010, total Video revenue has started to accelerate and increased 0.7%, reflecting rate adjustments and increasing number of our customers taking higher level of our digital services and improved pay-per-view performance, driven by day-and-date movies and events. We now have 23.2 million Video customers.
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 10.3% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments and more customers taking higher-speed services. We now have 16.4 million High-Speed Internet customers with penetration of 32.2%.
Voice revenue also posted a strong growth by increasing 14.3% for the quarter as we continue to grow our customer base. We now have over 8 million Voice customers with penetration of 16.5%. We continue to have real success in the small end of the business market, with Business Services revenue increasing 54.4% to $306 million for the second quarter. Excluding the contribution from our CIMCO and NGT acquisitions completed in the first quarter, revenue increased 45%. We expect the momentum in the small end of the business market to continue, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to expand our Cell Backhaul business and our capabilities to serve mid-sized business. As I mentioned, Cable advertising continue to rebound as revenue in the second quarter increased 22.6%. This improvement was led by a continued strength in automotive, as well as a solid recovery in almost every category.
Please refer to Slide 6 to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 5.7% to $3.7 billion. Our Cable operating cash flow margin remained relatively stable at 41.3%, a 20-basis-point improvement compared to last year's second quarter. 
Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 4.6%, reflecting higher Programming and marketing expenses. Programming expenses increased 6.4% this quarter, reflecting the addition of new programming, contract resets and higher pay-per-view expenses. As I mentioned last quarter, we do expect Programming expenses to increase at a higher rate in the subsequent quarters. Marketing expenses increased 12.3% this quarter, reflecting a continued investment in direct sales, our retail channel, as well as costs associated with the ongoing rollout of our new XFINITY branding campaign, which will be in 80% of our markets by year end. 
We are constantly evaluating our cost structure to gain more efficiencies. And in the second quarter, customer service expense declined 2.4%, and technical labor expense declined 7.6% as we benefited from a number of efficiency initiatives, which resulted in lower activity levels, higher call automation and customer self-service. Given the economic backdrop, we have also been very focused on delinquencies and our bad debt expense, and now have seen bad debt expense decline for four consecutive quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 7 to review our capital expenditures for this quarter. In the second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures increased 1.5% to $1.1 billion, representing 11.9% of total revenue. The modest uptick in the level of CapEx spend this quarter reflects an increased investment to support the growth and expansion in Business Services and product-enhancement initiatives in the areas of converged products, IP technology and switched digital video. These items, together with the timing of CPE purchases, contributed to the sequential increase in CapEx from the first to the second quarter.
During the second quarter, we deployed 4.6 million digital set-tops and adapters, including 4 million digital adapters in support of the All-Digital rollout. We have now deployed almost 13 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project. This quarter, we also deployed almost 500,000 advanced HD and/or DVR set-tops as we added 154,000 Advanced Service customers in the second quarter. We now have 9.7 million high-def and/or DVR customers equal to 50% of our Digital customer base and 42% of all Video customers.
Year-to-date, capital expenditures decreased 9.6% to $2.1 billion or 11% of revenue. However, looking ahead, we do expect CapEx will modestly increase in the second half of 2010 as we continue to invest to sustain momentum in Business Services and expand our efforts for the midsized businesses and cell backhaul. 
With over 80% of our footprint now wideband enabled, we have substantially completed our wideband project. But we will continue our rollout of All-Digital and expect to be substantially complete with this project by year end. Even with all the product and business-oriented growth investments, we expect our 2010 capital expenditures will be lower in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when compared with last year. 
Please refer to Slide 8. Our priority for allocating capital has been consistent, to be returns oriented and to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our business. We will continue to deploy capital to our businesses that provide attractive incremental returns, enhance our competitive position and deliver a sustainable organic growth. Our discipline and returns-focused approach to CapEx has helped drive significant growth and free cash flow generation. 
And as I mentioned previously, this quarter's free cash flow increased 15.8% to $1.4 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 20% to $0.48 per share. Year-to-date, free cash flow increased 27.8% to $3.2 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 30.7% to $1.15 per share.
Reflecting our strong commitment to return capital directly to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased 17.3 million of our common shares worth $300 million, and year-to-date, we have repurchased 36.4 million shares for $600 million. As of June 30, we have approximately $2.7 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and as we have previously indicated, we intend to complete this repurchase, subject to market conditions, by the end of 2012. Also during the quarter, we paid a cash dividend totaling $267 million. Today, we paid our third quarterly dividend totaling $265 million, for a total of $800 million year-to-date.
The combination of dividends and stock buybacks results in a total payout ratio of approximately 44% of our last 12 months' free cash flow. Based on our current stock price, this combined return of capital now represents an excess of a 4% yield. Now let me turn it over to Steve."

As you just heard, we're pleased with our second quarter results as we are effectively balancing financial and customer growth. Financially, we saw good acceleration in both revenue and operating cash flow and believe our product and efficiency initiatives like All-Digital, DOCSIS 3.0 and Challenge 2010 are beginning to have a real positive impact on our results. 
On the unit side, the second quarter is seasonally slow for us in both Video and High-Speed Data due to the number of customers in college and vacation towns. In fact, for High-Speed Data, the more successful we are at adding these customers in the third quarter, the more pronounced this second quarter seasonality becomes the following year. However, I think it's important to note that in the first half of 2010, we've added 517,000 new High-Speed Data customers. That's an increase of 31% over the first half of 2009. In addition to seasonality, last year's second quarter included a significant amount of promotional activity related to the national digital transition. As these deeply discounted promotions are rolling off, we are being disciplined in the offers we're providing these customers. However, these are price-sensitive high-churn customers, and we elected not to chase them. 
When you look at the quarter overall, we effectively managed the business for profitable growth. In the second quarter, we reported improved Video revenue, double-digit growth in High-Speed Internet and Voice revenue. Also, the momentum in Business Service continues. We're firing on all cylinders in this business and as Mike mentioned, we're maintaining our 40% to 50% growth rate even as our base gets bigger.
In addition, advertising continued to really turn around. Also, our financials showed that we've been very effective in driving average revenue per unit or ARPU growth. Over the last three quarters, Video ARPU has increased 5%, and High-Speed Data ARPU has increased over 4%. As a result, both revenue and operating cash flow growth in the second quarter accelerated. We expect the momentum to continue in the second half of this year as we continue to focus on targeted retention and acquisition offers in an effort to get the right balance and the right products to the right customer.
Moving on to advertising. In the first half of 2010, Cable advertising increased 23%. The turnaround in the Advertising business has been dramatic, particularly compared to the first half of 2009 when Advertising declined 21%. As Mike mentioned earlier, this growth was led by the auto sector, but we're seeing real improvements across many categories, including retail, food and beverage, healthcare and education, which all posted double-digit increases. Importantly, political advertising is starting to ramp for November 2010, and we should see this gain momentum in the second half of 2010 as political campaigns heat up around the country. This rebound in advertising is occurring across all areas including local, regional and national. 
We're also seeing advertising strength in our Programming business. Ad revenue was up 21% in the second quarter for the Programming group compared to a 7% decline in the second quarter of last year, driven by a strong advertising performance across all our networks and real rating strength at E!, VERSUS and G4. Both E! and G4 had their most-watched and highest-rated second quarters in their history, and VERSUS had its most-watched second quarter prime driven by the NHL playoffs. The scatter market continues to be very strong and we're optimistic about the momentum in advertising in our Programming business. When you look at Advertising for Comcast, combining the Programming business and Cable, Advertising is about $2.5 billion a year, a large number, but not all that significant compared to $35 billion in total revenues. With a combined NBC Universal and Comcast, advertising revenue will approach at very meaningful $10 billion. Having the advertising market rebound is a very good thing for the combined company.
Moving on to NBC Universal. We, as all of you know, have done a number of successful acquisitions over the years. But in every deal, it seems like from the time you announce to the time you close, a number of things inevitably go wrong. What's been really exciting about NBC Universal is that since we announced the deal in December, there had been mainly positive turnarounds, most notably, the Advertising business, which is very important, but also, our ability to put in place some financing, given market conditions that is very attractive, and a number of creative improvements at NBC, at the strong Cable channels and also at Universal Studios, with the recent hit at the box office of the new movie, Despicable Me, which could turn into a real successful franchise. 
On our end, currently, we're highly focused on the planning as to how we will execute once we close this transition. We're careful about the rules and regulations regarding this, where we're planning both administratively and strategically for the business post close. We're meeting weekly to identify growth opportunities in order to hit the ground running when the deal closes. At this point, we remain even more excited than we were when we announced the transaction in December and look forward to close by the end of this year.
Now let me turn it back to Marlene for Q&A."

Today, eight months later, to be going up 15%, 20%, 25% is a big deal for a company that's going to have $10 billion worth of advertising. Secondly, a lot of the financing that we're putting in place, because the market is more favorable than we assumed it would be, is coming in, has come in at very attractive rates. Third, I think really, in a number of the businesses, they've had a number of wins, and that stretches from NBC to the cable channels to Universal Studios. The entry into the Animation business with Despicable Me is a big deal in our opinion. And then finally, we spent a lot of time doing post-merger planning and have been through a lot of the businesses. The NBC executives have looked at our Cable businesses, and we keep identifying more and more opportunities to do things together that can enhance value. So if you look at some of our other deals, when we did the AT&T broadband deal that was right before Enron, right before the world fell apart, the stock market went down, interest rates started to gyrate, so we've been there before when it feels like everything is going against you.

And so as the Chairman has talked about a third-way proposal and that's one possibility. It seems like the extreme scenarios are off the table from our perspective. But we're hopeful that there is a constructive process underway to try to find regulatory solutions that can allow the businesses to go forward with some certainty to be pro-investment and pro-innovation, and at the same time, establish some ground rules that everyone can find constructive. So we're working on that. And when there's something definitive, we'll be able to report it, but I'm still hopeful."

We've actually seen it grow a little bit, both on a Cable side and on the consolidated side and that includes absorbing a lot of initiatives that we've been pursuing as well as the NBCU costs. So I think the team has done a terrific job of really managing a margin over several years. If you look at one of the slides that I had, you can see that the margins are remarkably stable over a long period of time, and that, again, involves absorbing meaningful costs. With regards to ARPU, you're seeing a couple of things. One, we have done rate adjustments, which I mentioned on both Video and High-Speed. And also, we are selling more three-product and double-product bundles. Really, now about almost one out of three of our customers take three services. So that has helped a lot as well.

Please join me on slide three; today we are pleased to report strong financial results. This marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in revenue which increased 7% operating cash flow which increased 8%.
We generated free cash flow of $1 billion this quarter and almost $4.3 billion year-to-date an increase of 17% compared to the first nine months of last year. These results reflect our continued focus on profitable growth a very resilient residential business, a robust advertising market and a continued focus and strength on business services.
We obviously still have a tough economy which combined with the anniversary of the broadcast digital transition continued to impact video units. However, as Michael will discuss in a few minutes. We started to see some real year-over-year improvement toward the end of the third quarter and for October.
Overall, we are executing well delivering strong financial results as we focus on high value video customers on growing our relationships and broadband and phone and expanding business services.
We are also continuing to invest a foster growth and to further strengthen our competitive position with all digital now about 65% of our markets and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 80% of our footprint. As we near completion of these important projects we are starting to see the fruits of those investments.
In video, we have tripled the number of high def channels and have doubled the amount of foreign language programming. In HSD we are reinforcing our product superiority as we double the speeds to our existing customers and introduce new higher speed services with 50 megabits currently available to more than 40 million homes and a 105 megabits to more than 25 million homes.
Our On-Demand service is also expanding. With our new library server infrastructure which takes advantage of our scale, we called the Comcast content delivering network or CCDN. We now have the capacity to offer $70,000 of content. As a result, Comcast customers in more than 20% of our footprint now have access to over 25,000 On Demand choices including 11,000 movies.
By the end of this year a majority of our markets will have this level of choice and with CCDN we have the ability to continue to expand the On Demand choices we offer our customers. As we do this, we are rolling out enhanced guides with better linier and On Demand search, improved DVR functionality and more interactivity include a unique new feature that automatically informs you if the content is available in high definition and just with the click of one extra button immediately takes you to the HD version which our customers really love.
Our new guide has already been rolled out to three quarters of our markets and will be in all our markets in the next six months. We are also deploying remove DVR and multi room DVR and they are available in a majority of our markets today.
Please turn to slide four. This week we re launched Xfinity TV, our authenticated On Demand online service with a new and I think great marketing campaign. Xfinity TV gives customers online access to 150,000 entertainment choices including movies, TV shows, premium and HD content with a compelling search and discovery platform.
All of our digital video customers will receive a customer ID to access Xfinity TV for no extra cost. It's a tremendous value added service. And before the end of this year we will launching the Xfinity TV remote app which will work on all the iPhones and iPads and eventually, right after they come out on the Android based tablets.
This is an entirely new form factor and device for consumers of these tablets which I think makes the search and discovery and the enjoyment of television that much greater because we've all been looking for how to navigate these 150,000 choices or whatever the consumer actually has. And this, with the touch of a finger allows you to change channels as well as do search and discovery. I think you'll like it when you get one.
So as you can see, we have an exiting roadmap for new product introductions and we're delivering more and faster innovation to our customers. All of these enhancements and new features really are starting to bring to life our XFINITY brand and your going to continue to see and hear many new products from Comcast in the months and years ahead.
In order to deliver the best customer experience, you have to marry great products with consistently good customer service. We've worked hard to improve our service but the leadership of Neil Smit, who has now been with Comcast for seven months. I have never seen the organization this focused on the customer experience and making it better all the time. Neil's commitment to take service and also this rapid product innovation and getting it completed and to the next level while at the same time keeping us focused on strong operating performance like you're seeing this quarter makes me really exited about where our cable business is going.
Finally, on NBC Universal, the regulatory reviews are continuing and we believe they are on track to enable us to close by the end of this year. The integration of NBC Universal is huge task and I'm delighted that Steve Burke will become the new CEO of NBC Universal upon closing.
Over the past 11 months Steve has been spending a lot of time planning so we can hit the ground running when the year closes. I believe we are in a strong position to deliver a great entertainment experience to consumers and to really drive new value creation for our shareholders.
Before I pass the call over to Michael I want to mention that we are following a new format for today's call shortening the prepared remarks for Michael and me and allowing more time for your questions for not only Mike and myself but also for Steve and Neil.
So, Michael with that please cover the results of the third quarter in more detail.

We are executing well and continue to balance revenue,",1905,"Thank you Brian, let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on slide five, we are pleased with our third quarter results which reflect a consistent focus on profitable growth. We are executing well and continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth as well as remain very focused on expense and capital management.
For the third quarter consolidated revenue increased 7.3% to 9.5 billion and operating cash flow grew 7.6% to 3.6 billion resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 37.7%.
Cable was the largest driver of these results but our programming businesses also performed well with revenue growth of 9% and operating cash flow growth of 26%. These results reflect the impact of a strong advertising market across all of our networks and rating strength E! which had record viewer ship in the third quarter.
These quarters consolidated operating cash flow results also include approximately $21 million of expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction which is included in corporate and other. Excluding these transaction related costs consolidated operating cash flow grew 8.2% and our operating cash flow margin increased to 37.9% from 37.6% in 2009.
We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metric in evaluating the strength of the company.
And each of these key metrics our performance here on the third quarter and on the year-to-date basis was strong and reflect solid progress and growth. During the third quarter we generated consolidated free cash flow of a $1 billion and modest decline compared to last year primarily the result of higher cash income taxes and a slight increase in capital expenditures.
However, we prefer to evaluate free cash flow on an LTM or year-to-date basis and year-to-date free cash flow has increased 17% to 4.3 billion from 3.6 billion in 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow per share increased 19.8% to a $1.51 per share.
Earnings per share in the third quarter grew 14.3% to $0.32 per share from $0.28 per share last year when you exclude NBC Universal related costs of $66 million and tax benefits and a one time financing expense in 2009.
On a year-to-date basis EPS grew 17.1% over the comparable period in 2009 again excluding NBC Universal costs of a 154 million and last years tax benefits and one time finance expense.
Please refer to table four in the press release for more detail on these items. Please refer to slide six, to review our cable division's third quarter results. Third quarter cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9 billion reflecting accelerating growth in our residential business and continued strength in business services and cable advertising.
Total video, high speed internet and voice customers grew 202,000 for the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis we have added 875,000 customers compared to 1.2 million in the first three quarters of last year.
As discussed on the second quarter earnings call, in our recent investor conferences, customer addition trends were soft in July and August reflecting a continuing weak continuing weak economy; the impact of last years broadcast digital transition, the roll off of customers on discounted promotions and continued competitive pressures. However year-over-year customer trends improved in September and now that the impact from the broadcast digital transition is substantially behind us, we have experienced steady improvement in October.
This quarter's loss of 275,000 video customers was impacted by the factors I just mentioned and we are very focused on improving our retention efforts. Year-to-date we have lost 622,000 video customers, compared to 424,000 in 2009 where we benefited from the broadcast digital transition.
Over 40% of this year's video losses are in our lower end basic video package and the impact from these customer losses is more muted on the financial side as the average ARPU is less than half of our normalized video ARPU.
With regards to the economy, we remain cautiously optimistic about its overall direction and strength. However the housing market is still weak and unemployment remains high, which we believe continues to impact many consumers.
Even with these macro economic challenges, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to execute. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth and we've been effective in driving organic revenue.
Total revenue per video customer increased 10% to almost $130 per month in the third quarter reflecting strong ARPU management and increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the third quarter, 32% of our video customers took all three services compared to 27% at the end of last year's third quarter.
For the third quarter, total video revenue continued to accelerate and increased 2.2% reflecting rate adjustments and an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital and advanced services.
This quarter we deployed over 500,000 advanced Hi Def and/or DVR set tops and we added 228,000 advanced service customers. We now have 9.9 million advanced service customers, equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 43% of all video customers.
High speed internet revenue increased a health 12.2% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments and continued growth in our customer base. We added 249,000 high speed internet customers in the third quarter and year-to-date we have added 766,000 high speed internet customers, slightly above the 755,000 we added in the first three quarters of last year.
Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%. In addition we continue to see more customers take our high speed services compared to our economy service. Today 22% of our residential high speed internet customers take our Blast! Or above levels of service.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth increasing 12.6% for the quarter reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base as well as a growing contribution from business services. We added 228,000 voice customers in the third quarter and year-to-date we have added 731,000 voice customers compared to 906,000 in the first three quarters of last year.
Compared to the third quarter of last year, our penetration has increased 150 basis points and is now at 17%. We also had a strong quarter for business services with revenue increasing 54.5% to $333 million.
Excluding the contribution from Cimco and NGT which were acquisitions that were completed in the first quarter. Revenue increase 44%, we expect a momentum in the small end of the business market to continue. We remain very enthusiastic about our opportunity to serve mid-sized businesses and to expand our sell backhaul efforts.
Our cable advertising business continues to perform well as third quarter revenue increased 27.2%. This improvement was again led by strength in automotive as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political core cable advertising revenue increased 19% this quarter. We expect advertising growth to remain strong in the fourth quarter particularly given all the political activity.
Please refer to slide seven to review our cable divisions operating cash flow results. Third quarter cable operating cash flow increased 7.1% to 3.5 billion. Our cable operating cash flow margin remained relatively stable at the 39.5% a 10 basis point improvement compared to last years third quarter.
Total expenses in our cable segment increased 6.8% primarily reflecting higher programming and marketing expenses as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities and business services.
Programming expenses increase increased 4.9% this quarter reflecting a real focus on controlling costs offset by an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of a digital services the additional new programming and contract resets.
In addition, we are receiving more value in our programming contracts particularly with more on-demand programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms.
Marketing expenses increased 17.3% this quarter as a result of higher overall advertising and media spend including XFINITY branding as well as continued investment and direct sales in our retail channels.
Customer service expense declined 2.7% in the third quarter as we benefit from a number of efficiencies initiatives such as higher call automation and better call center optimization.
Please refer to slide eight to review our capital expenditures for the quarter. In the third quarter capital expenditures increased a 139 million to 1.4 billion representing 14.4% of total revenue.
The level of CapEx spend this quarter principally reflects the timing of CTE purchases primarily advanced set top and DTAs offset by more favorable equipment pricing. We have now deployed over 15 million digital adapters since the inception of the all digital project including 2.2 million during the third quarter.
We have also continued to increase our investment to support growth and expansion in business services. We view our capital expenditure program on an LTM or a year-to-date basis and year-to-date capital expenditures have decreased 2.2% to 3.4 billion equal to 12.2% of revenue.
In addition, consistent with prior years our growth oriented capital expenditures represents approximately 72% of our year-to-date total spend. With regards to the fourth quarter we expect CapEx increase sequentially as we continue to invest and sustain our moment in business services, expand our efforts for the mid-sized businesses and sell backhaul and complete our roll out of all digital.
However, we still expect our full year capital expenditures to be below in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when we compare it to 2009.
Please refer to slide nine, our priorities allocating capital has been consistent to profitably investment in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses, deploy capital to areas that provide attractive incremental returns and enhance our competitors position and deliver sustainable organic growth.
This disciplined and returns focused approach to CapEx has helped drive significant growth in free cash flow generation and as I mentioned previously, year-to-date free cash flow increased 17% to $4.3 billion and free cash flow per share increased 19.8% to $1.51 per share.
With the recent extend of bonus appreciation for 2010; we anticipate the company will realize a benefit by paying lower income taxes in the fourth quarter. As we've done in the past we'll continue to report comparable results that both include and exclude cash impact on free cash flow from the economic stimulus packages.
Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 40% of our free cash flow to shareholders or $1.7 billion, including three dividend payments totaling 800,000 million and 300 million per quarter of share repurchases totaling 900 million.
The remainder of our free cash flow, which is currently reflected in our cash balance, will be used to fund a portion of the NBC Universal transaction which will be approximately $6.5 billion. We are pleased that over the past six months NBC Universal has successfully raised $9.1 million in the public debt markets.
This permanent financing for NBCU is now complete and was accomplished with a weighted average cost of debt of approximately 4.5% and an average duration of 13.3 years. When we close the NBC Universal transaction, we expect our consolidated leverage will be approximately 2.5 times and as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with the debt to OCF leverage target of between two and 2.5 times.
Last December we articulated a three year capital allocation strategy for 2010 and we've executed well on that plan. Once the NBC Universal transaction is completed we will revaluate and communicate a new financial strategy for 2011.
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A.

We're seeing fewer occupied housing units and the unemployment is still a factor. The second is the digital transition and the promotional roll off. 42% of the customers we lost were basic customers.
The digital transitions, the peers could be mostly behind us. And the third reason is the rate increases we took. So this year we took rate increases over the last six months. So Q2 and Q3 and about our 75% of our footprint versus about 3% last year. From a over the top impact we've -- now all our active surveys have seen almost no impact.
We have seen the customers who are disconnecting and not going to a competitor that small number of customers appear to be going over the air much more than any over the top impact. The competitive situation really hasn't changed much.
We have seen year-over-year a build out of the our box so AT&T about 2.2 million home build out. We haven't seen a significant increase in that competitive factor. The DSL players appear to be playing more on rate but we are very pleased with our HSD numbers. We once again gain shares as we put on more HSD subs and Verizon and AT&T combined.
We are pleased with that number; our HSD ARPU is up 4.9% we are pleased with that number. I think there is some real positive news in the quarter. If you look at year-over-year customer trending so net adds per month, every month of the quarter improved.
So August was better and July, September was better and August and we are seeing that positive trend continue into October. The other piece of positive news is we are really pleased with our advance services.
So we sold about 228 more advance service customers about 500k more HD and HD DVR, cut the boxes. Our revenue for advance services was up 11%, so we are seeing some positive trends. I think net, we are to keep focusing on the quality of our customers as I said on last call we are not going to chase volume. We're going to keep looking at customer service and focusing on the customer experience and improving the value of our service.

Its I think exactly right for both corporations. So I don't anticipate any change. I just want to talk to one of the things that Neil said to just make sure everybody understood some of the step up lingo. 12 months ago, during the digital transition, we gave a lot of customers a 12 month offer.
Many of those customers were for the first time coming on the multi-channel television. At the end of the 12 months, they went to normalized rates and that step up -- and that happened sometimes in promotions but there was an awful lot of that happening in the second and the beginning of the third quarter.

Obviously the NBC network still has it challenges but if you look at advertising, the business is significantly better than we thought. Universal Studios invested in an animation company its first release a film called Despicable Me that was a tremendous success and obviously the animation business is one of the best part if not the best part of the film business.
Universal Studios opened Harry Potter down in Florida which has been a sort of standing from only success and then really the cable channels that we will have when we get this company put together offered. I think real opportunity is to sort of cross promote, provide new programming. Just bring everything to a different level. So I think we have done a lot of deals over the last number of years and I think sometimes everything happens to the negative between signing and closing and this time it seems like that's the majority things are very positive.
In terms of Canoe we now have Canoe now has 10 million homes right now today where you can buy interactive advertising on style network and AMC has also launched a number of other networks. So, Canoe is now live it's outselling and sort of starting to do what we have wanted the interactives, advertising business to do for a long-long time and that 10 million number is going to grow very dramatically because it's based on the roll out of EBIS which does who follow the industry knows now sort of the industry standard for interactive television. So, we are very pleased with the progress of Canoe and optimist that finally after years of putting together the infrastructure and the partnership and everything else. Interactive advertising is going to deliver real results.

We can hopefully play a constructive role and any new thinking that has to take place around this space and so this doesn't really change anything because I think the anticipation of these disputes we are having same one in the market place today but at this point by being a cable operator and a broadcaster perhaps we can foster ideas that will not have the consumer to be taught in the middle there. So, we will just have to take one step at a time but we think there is an opportunity to play a constructive role.

Good morning, just a follow up on the cost side for Neil and then I have a question for Brian. Two of the expense buckets you guys break out technical labor and administrative and other which were both down in the first half of the year or were up quite a bit in Q3 which surprised me a little bit just because you are moving through I think towards the end of the our digital roll out where I think you are going to see some pretty nice savings in terms of truck rolls and sort of overall activity level. So, I don't, Neil if there is any comment you want to make there to help us think about going forward or what the drivers where and then for Brian, everyone is starting focused on Xfinity TV or TV everywhere how you want to describe, or let me one of the most focused on initiatives in the industry in many years.
Now that it's launched can you sort of talk about your vision for the product. Particularly given that you have done deal now with CBS ten year deal which I think contemplates a lot of what you are trying to do here. How do we think about the number of screens you can push this product to devices, mobile broadband, internet connected TVs, how do you think about windowing. Are you going to get, so you are looking to have in-season access to all these shows on multiple windows or prior seasons.
No one is really in the position that Comcast is into sort of drive this product and I am curious what your vision is for this service?

We are doing much more testing of the CPE across various facets and it provides a temporary OpEx hit but we think it's the right thing to do for the customer in the long term and long term it will take the boxes out of the system that are prone to problems and we think it's the right thing to do for the customer.

Ultimately, when we lay down our initial vision, which we called project Infinity a couple of years ago at CES, as a technical matter where you would like to get to is have a architecture and a capability that any piece of content could be accessed by the consumer on any device at any time and then its up to the content rights holder to determine whether they want to sell it at all, at that moment, in different windows.
All the things you said -- they get advertising support and have an additional charge for it were any other model and that the technology that our industry can bring or Comcast can perhaps lead with is things like the CCDN and with the architecture of our VOD infrastructure coupled with the WiFi in the home initially focused very much in the home and now new devices like the tablets which I think we're just seeing the very beginning of, the number of people who are going to make tablets and the rapid nature by which the price is going to decline in my opinion will accelerate this architecture to be taken well and used by the consumer. We're just starting. Ultimately it would be wonderful if there was an expectation by the consumers, they would now where the shows are and in what windows.
Today you know when a movie comes out you to the theater and so many months later you can buy a DVD and you see it on paid television and etcetera and then On Demand. Its all over the place right now and people are experimenting with different windows and different models and old episodes, new episodes, future episodes and I think until there is enough content that there is an understanding by the consumer, it will be adopted by some but not by all and our job is try to make it simple, ubiquitous and have the technical platform handle the volumes that we hope will ultimately come.

So ass Brian mentioned, we rolled out 50 Meg servers to about 40 million homes and 105 Meg to about 25 million homes.
So we are continuing to offer higher speed to customers and that is really what's driving the ARPU. So, over 20% of our customer subscribed to the higher speed tiers that are black level which is 8 Meg and above.
So that's what's driving the speeds. Rate adjustments were a factor, but I would say that will continue to monitor and the rate and volume and manage that as the economy evolves. I think you are right in terms of the potential opportunity as if over the top and there comes to into been and there is more consumption of online video, we feel very good about our capacity that's one of the reasons we have invested so heavily in DOCSIS 3.0.
We feel that big pipe into the house is important and we will continue to investment in speed increases like that, like DOCSIS 3.0. We think it's an important component and the consumers continue to consume more bandwidth.

So it's in everyone's interest to come up with authenticated and authentic copies of the content to into the consumer so I think we are very pleased with the announcement this week Xfinity TV has I don't know something like a 150,000 different choices and you are now on devices that have wonderful navigation and search capabilities and these are all very important steps as we now have more devices allow users to play those contents not just at a fixed PC.
On wireless my sense is the steps we have taken are couple of different areas, the one that's most intriguing to me at the moment is sort of the last foot.
The last foot may want to have some display on a wireless device using WiFi in the home. As you get these tablets, that's what make some things and our ability combined with the EBIS that Neil was just talking about really it gives some unique capabilities to interact from the wireless device right to your set-top for those of you that have a Crestron type remote in your home. High-end consumers have wanted this. Now we are going to be able to bring this to everyone who has a few hundred dollars in a tablet.
So, otherwise we continue to monitor the wireless business but I think we are very pleased the way we deal all data businesses and that's really how we looked at wireless.

173341,113376098,82198,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone.

Please join me on Slide 3. Today, we are pleased to report strong financial results. This marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in revenue which increased 7%, and an operating cash flow which increased 8%. We generated free cash flow of $1 billion this quarter and almost $4.3 billion year-to-date, an increase of 17% compared to the first nine months of last year.
These results reflect our continued focus on profitable growth, a very resilient residential business, a robust advertising market and a continued focus and strength on Business Services. 
We obviously still have a tough economy, which combined with the anniversary of the broadcast digital transition, continue to impact video units. However, as Michael will discuss in a few minutes, we started to see some real year-over-year improvement toward the end of the third quarter and for October.
Overall, we are executing well, delivering strong financial results as we focus on high-value video customers on growing our relationships in broadband and phone and expanding Business Services. We're also continuing to invest to foster growth and to further strengthen our competitive position with All-Digital, now in about 65% of our markets, and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 80% of our footprint.
As we near completion of these important projects, we're starting to see the fruits of those investments. In Video, we've tripled the number of high-def channels and have doubled the amount of foreign language programming. In HSD, we are reinforcing our product superiority, as we double the speeds to our existing customers and introduce new higher speed services with 50 megabits currently available to more than 40 million homes and 105 megabits to more than 25 million homes. 
Our OnDemand services is also expanding. With our new library server infrastructure, which takes advantage of our scale, we call the Comcast Content Delivery Network or CCDN. We now have the capacity to offer 70,000 hours of content.
As a result, Comcast customers in more than 20% of our footprint now have access to over 25,000 OnDemand choices including 11,000 movies.
By the end of this year, a majority of our markets will have this level of choice. And with CCDN, we have the ability to continue to expand the OnDemand choices we offer our customers.
As we do this, we are rolling out enhanced guides with better linear and OnDemand search, improved DVR functionality and more interactivity, including a unique new feature that automatically informs you if the content is available in high definition. And just with the click of one extra button immediately takes you to the HD version which our customers really love.
Our new guide has already been rolled out to three quarters of our markets and will be in all our markets in the next six months. We're also deploying remote DVR and multiroom DVR, and they are available in a majority of our markets today.
Please turn to Slide 4. This week, we relaunched XFINITY TV, our authenticated on-demand online service with a new and, I think, great marketing campaign. XFINITY TV gives customers online access to 150,000 entertainment choices, including movies, TV shows, premium and HD content with a compelling search and discovery platform. All of our digital video customers will receive a customer ID to access XFINITY TV for no extra cost. It's a tremendous value-added service.
And before the end of this year, we will be launching the XFINITY TV remote app, which will work on all the iPhones and iPads and eventually right after it will come out on the Android-based tablets. This is an entirely new form factor and device for consumers to these tablets, which I think makes the search and discovery and the enjoyment of television that much greater because we've all been looking for how to navigate these 150,000 choices or whatever the consumer actually has.
And this, with a touch of a finger, allows you to change channels as well as do search and discovery. I think you'll like it when you get one.
So as you can see, we have an exciting roadmap for new product introductions, and we're delivering more and faster innovation to our customers. All of these enhancements and new features really are starting to bring to life our XFINITY brand. And you're going to continue to see and hear many new products from Comcast in the months and years ahead.
In order to deliver the best customer experience, you have to marry great products with consistently good customer service. We've worked hard to improve our service. But under the leadership of Neil Smit, who's now been with Comcast for seven months, I have never seen the organization as focused on the customer experience and making it better all the time. Neil's commitment to take service and also this rapid product innovation in getting it completed into the next level, while at the same time keeping us focused on strong operating performance like you've seen this quarter, makes me really excited about where our Cable business is going.
Finally, on NBC Universal. The regulatory reviews are continuing, and we believe they're on track to enable us to close by the end of this year. The integration of NBC Universal is a huge task, and I'm delighted that Steve Burke will become the new CEO of NBC Universal upon closing.
Over the past 11 months, Steve has been spending a lot of time planning, so we can hit the ground running when the deal closes. I believe we're in a strong position to deliver a great entertainment experience to consumers and to really drive new value creation for our shareholders.
Before I pass the call over to Michael, I want to mention that we're following a new format for today's call, shortening the prepared remarks for Michael and me and allowing more time for your questions, for not only Mike and myself but also for Steve and Neil. So Michael, with that, please cover the results of the third quarter in more detail."
173341,113376098,82198,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian.

We are pleased with our third quarter results which reflected consistent focus on profitable growth. We are executing well and continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth, as well as remain very focused on expense and capital management.
For the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7.3% to $9.5 billion, and operating cash flow grew 7.6% to $3.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 37.7%. Cable was the largest driver of these results. But our Programming businesses also performed well, with revenue growth of 9% and operating cash flow growth of 26%.
These results reflect the impact of a strong advertising market across all of our networks and rating strength at E!, which had record viewership in the third quarter.
This quarter's consolidated operating cash flow results also include approximately $21 million of expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction, which is included in corporate and other. Excluding these transaction-related costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 8.2%, and our operating cash flow margin increased to 37.9% from 37.6% in 2009.
We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis was strong and reflects solid progress and growth.
During the third quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1 billion, a modest decline compared to last year, primarily the result of higher cash income taxes and a slight increase in capital expenditures. However, we prefer to evaluate free cash flow on an LTM or year-to-date basis. And year-to-date, free cash flow has increased 17% to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion in 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow per share increased 19.8% to $1.51 per share.
Earnings per share in the third quarter grew 14.3% to $0.32 per share from $0.28 per share last year, when you exclude NBC Universal-related costs of $66 million and tax benefits and a onetime financing expense in 2009.
On a year-to-date basis, EPS grew 17.1% over the comparable period in 2009, again, excluding NBC Universal-related costs of $154 million and last year's tax benefits and onetime finance expenses.  Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items. 
Please refer to Slide 6 to review our Cable division's third quarter results. Third quarter Cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9 billion, reflecting accelerating growth in our Residential business and continued strength in Business Services and Cable Advertising. Total video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers grew 202,000 for the third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we have added 875,000 customers compared to 1.2 million in the first three quarters of last year. 
As discussed on the second quarter earnings call and at recent investor conferences, customer addition trends were soft in July and August, reflecting a continuing weak economy, the impact of last year's broadcast digital transition, the roll-off of customers on discounted promotions and continued competitive pressures. However, year-over-year, customer trends improved in September. And now that the impact from the broadcast digital transition is substantially behind us, we have experienced steady improvement in October.
This quarter's loss of 275,000 video customers was impacted by the factors I just mentioned, and we are very focused on improving our retention efforts. Year-to-date, we have lost 622,000 video customers compared to 424,000 in 2009, where we benefited from the broadcast digital transition.
Over 40% of this year's video losses are in our lower-end basic video package. And the impact from these customer losses is more muted on the financial side, as their average ARPU is less than half of our normalized video ARPU. With regards to the economy, we remain cautiously optimistic about its overall direction and strength. However, the housing market is still weak, and unemployment remains high which we believe continues to impact many consumers.
Even with these macro economic challenges, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to execute. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, and we've been effective in driving organic revenue.
Total revenue per video customer increased 10% to almost $130 per month in the third quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management and increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the third quarter, 32% of our video customers took all three services compared to 27% at the end of last year's third quarter. 
For the third quarter, total video revenue continued to accelerate and increase to 2.2%, reflecting rate adjustments and an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our Digital and Advanced Services.
This quarter, we deployed over 500,000 advanced hi-def and/or DVR set-tops, and we added 228,000 Advanced Services customers. We now have 9.9 million Advance Services customers equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 43% of all video customers.
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 12.2% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments and continued growth in our customer base. We added 249,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the third quarter. And year-to-date, we have added 766,000 High-Speed Internet customers, slightly above the 755,000 we added in the first three quarters of last year.
Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%. In addition, we continue to see more customers take our high-speed services compared to our economy service. Today, 22% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take our blast or above levels of service.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth, increasing 12.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base, as well as a growing contribution from Business Services. We added 228,000 voice customers in the third quarter. And year-to-date, we have added 731,000 voice customers compared to 906,000 in the first three quarters of last year. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our penetration has increased 150 basis points and is now at 17%.
We also had a strong quarter for Business Services, with revenue increasing 54.5% to $333 million. Excluding the contribution from CIMCO and NGT, which were acquisitions that were completed in the first quarter, revenue increased 44%. We expect the momentum in the small end of the business market to continue. And we remain very enthusiastic about our opportunity to serve midsize businesses and to expand our cell backhaul efforts.
Our Cable Advertising business continues to perform well, as third quarter revenue increased 27.2%. This improvement was again led by strength in automotive, as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political, core cable advertising revenue increased 19% this quarter. We expect advertising growth to remain strong in the fourth quarter, particularly given all the political activity.
Please refer to Slide 7 to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Third quarter cable operating cash flow increased 7.1% to $3.5 billion. Our cable operating cash flow margin remained relatively stable at 39.5%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to last year's third quarter. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 6.8%, primarily reflecting higher programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities in Business Services.
Program expenses increased 4.9% this quarter, reflecting a real focus on controlling costs, offset by an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital services, the addition of new programming and contract resets. In addition, we are receiving more value in our programming contracts, particularly with more OnDemand programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms.
Marketing expenses increased 17.3% this quarter, as a result of higher overall advertising and media spend including XFINITY branding, as well as a continued investment in direct sales in our retail channels. Customer service expense declined 2.7% in the third quarter, as we benefit from a number of efficiency initiatives such as higher call automation and better call center optimization.
Please refer to Slide 8 to review our capital expenditures for the quarter. In the third quarter, capital expenditures increased $139 million to $1.4 billion, representing 14.4% of total revenue. The level of CapEx spend this quarter principally reflects the timing of CPE purchases, primarily advanced set-top in DTAs, offset by more favorable equipment pricing. We have now deployed over 15 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, including 2.2 million during the third quarter.
We've also continued to increase our investment to support growth and expansion in Business Services. We view our capital expenditure program on an LTM or year-to-date basis. And year-to-date, capital expenditures have decreased 2.2% to $3.4 billion, equal to 12.2% of revenue. In addition, consistent with prior years, our growth-oriented capital expenditures represent approximately 72% of our year-to-date total spend.
With regards to the fourth quarter, we expect CapEx to increase sequentially as we continue to invest to sustain our momentum in Business Services, expand our efforts for the midsize businesses and cell backhaul and complete our rollout of All-Digital. However, we still expect our full year capital expenditures to be lower in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when we compare it to 2009.
Please refer to Slide 9. Our priority for allocating capital has been consistent to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses, deploy capital to areas that provide attractive incremental returns and enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth. This disciplined and returned focus to CapEx has helped drive significant growth in free cash flow generation. And as I mentioned previously, year-to-date free cash flow increased 17% to $4.3 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 19.8% to $1.51 per share. 
With the recent extension of bonus depreciation for 2010, we anticipate the company will realize a benefit by paying lower income taxes in the fourth quarter. As we've done in the past, we'll continue to report comparable results that both include and exclude cash impact on free cash flow from the economic stimulus packages.
Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 40% of our free cash flow to shareholders or $1.7 billion, including three dividend payments totaling $800 million and $300 million per quarter of share repurchases totaling $900 million.
The remainder of free cash flow, which is currently reflected in our cash balance, will be used to fund a portion of the NBC Universal transaction which will be approximately $6.5 billion. We are pleased that over the past six months, NBC Universal has successfully raised $9.1 billion in the public debt markets. This permanent financing for NBCU is now complete and was accomplished with the weighted average cost of debt of approximately 4.5% and an average duration of 13.3 years.
When we close the NBC Universal transaction, we expect our consolidated leverage will be approximately 2.5x. And as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with a debt to OCF leverage target of between 2x and 2.5x. 
Last December, we articulated a clear capital allocation strategy for 2010, and we have executed well on that plan. Once the NBC Universal transaction is completed, we'll re-evaluate and communicate a new financial strategy for 2011. 
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

We're seeing fewer occupied housing units, and the unemployment is still a factor. The second is the digital transition and the promotional rolloff. 42% of the customers we lost were basic customers. The digital transition appears to be mostly behind us. I think the third reason is the rate increases we took. So this year, we took rate increases over the last six months. So Q2 and Q3 at about 75% of our footprint versus about 3% last year. 
From an over-the-top impact, all our exit surveys have seen almost no impact. We have seen customers who are disconnecting and not going to a competitor. That small number of customers -- it appeared to be going over the air, much more than any over-the-top impact. The competitive situation really hasn't changed much. We've seen, year-over-year, a buildout the RBOCs -- so AT&T, about 2.2 million home buildout. We haven't seen a significant increase of that competitive factor. The DSL players appear to be playing more in rate. But we're very pleased with the our HSD numbers. We once again gained share as we put on more HSD subs than Verizon and AT&T combined. We're pleased with that number. Our HSD ARPU is up 4.9%. We're pleased with that number. I think there are some really positive news in the quarter. If you look at the year-over-year customer trending, so net adds per month, every month of the quarter improved. So August was better than July. September was better than August. And we're seeing that positive trend continuing till October. 
The other piece of positive news is we're really pleased with our Advanced Services. So we sold about 228 more advanced service customers, about 500k more HD and HD DVR boxes. Our revenue for Advanced Services was up 11%. So we are seeing some positive trends. I think net, we're going to keep focusing on the quality of our customers. As I've said on the last call, we're not going to chase volume. We're going to keep looking at customer service and focusing on the customer experience and improving the value of our service."

I just want to touch on one other thing that Neil said to just make sure everybody understood some of the step-up lingo. 12 months ago, during the digital transition, we gave a lot of customers a 12-month offer. Many of those customers were, for the first time, coming on to multi-channel television. At the end of the 12 months, they then went to kind of quote normalized rates, and at step-up. And that happens sometimes in promotions but there was an awful lot of that happening in the second and the beginning of the third quarter. Marlene?"

We'll continue to monitor that. We feel good about where we are as the All-Digital initiative we have frees up more bandwidth. We're looking at, I should say, recapturing even more bandwidth as we go to B1 or basic digitization in some of our market. So we feel very good about our bandwidth situation. We'll continue to monitor it. We do have meters in place, so consumers can see how much they're consumer consuming.

Obviously, the NBC network still has its challenges. But if you look at advertising, the business is significantly better than we thought. Universal Studios invested in an animation company, that's first release was a film called Despicable Me, that was a tremendous success. And obviously, the Animation business is one of the best part, if not the best part, of the Film business. Universal Studios opened Harry Potter down in Florida which has been sort of standing-room only success. And then really, the cable channels that we will have when we get this company put together offer, I think, real opportunity, opportunities to sort of cross promote, provide new programming, just bring everything to a different level. So I think we've done a lot of deals over the last number of years. And I think, sometimes, everything happens to the negative between signing and closing. And this time, it seems like the vast majority of things are very positive. 
In terms of Canoe, Canoe now has 10 million homes right now today where you can buy interactive advertising on the Style Network. And AMC has also launched in a number of other networks. So Canoe is now light. It's outselling and out sort of starting to do what we've wanted the interactive Advertising business to do for a long, long time. And that 10 million number is going to grow very dramatically because it's based on the roll-out of EBIS, which those of you who followed the industry now is now sort of the industry's standard for interactive television. So we're very pleased with the progress of Canoe and optimistic that finally after years of putting together the infrastructure and the partnership and everything else, interactive advertising is going to deliver real results."

I think even Netflix on their own call felt that they were more complementary than anything else to the existing marketplace.

That is now, as could see in articles today in the paper, something a lot of people are working on. 
As new devices come out, we're very excited about, for instance, as I mentioned earlier, the iPad. It gives us a chance to now start from scratch with the user interface that is using web technology, not cable box technology. We also have better and newer boxes coming out, and we have new guides to replace old guides. So there's an awful lot happening. But I think with a new series of devices that allow people to consume more, you're seeing actual usage go up. And you're seeing more people in the space, and that's just the reality. And part of that's great for our Broadband business, part of it increases our innovation speed, and part of it establishes relationships that are new for the consumer, like the Netflix, and all that is in the market.

Ultimately, when we laid out our initial vision, which we call Project Infinity, a couple of years ago at CES, as a technical matter, where you would like to get to is have it architecture and a capability that any piece of content could be accessed by the consumer on any device at any time. And then it's up to the content rights holder to determine whether they want to sell it at all at that moment in different windows. All the things you said, they get advertising supported, have an additional charge for or any other model. And the technology that our industry can bring or Comcast can perhaps lead with things like the CCDN and with the architecture of our VOD infrastructure, coupled with the Wi-Fi in the home, initially focused very much in the home, and now new devices like the tablets, which I think we're just seeing the very beginning of, the number of people who are going to make tablets and the rapid nature by which the price is going to decline, in my opinion, will accelerate this architecture to be taken well and used by the consumer. We're just starting. 
Ultimately, it would be wonderful if there was an expectation by the consumers that they would know where the shows are and what windows. Today, you know, when a movie comes out, you go to the theater and so many months later, you can buy a DVD. And then, you see it on paid television and et cetera, and on OnDemand. It's all over the place right now, and people are experimenting with different windows in different models and old episodes, new episodes, future episodes. And I think until there's enough content that there is an understanding by the consumer, it will be adapted by some but not by all.

So whether it's Cablevision and Fox or other companies in their negotiations, those negotiations are going to have a free market and set a model. Clearly, the broadcasters would like to as many eyeballs as possible to their shows. And since they're broadcasting into the air, it makes a lot of sense to put a lot of shows on the Internet. What exactly the show and exactly what window is up to each content company. And again, I do believe we can try to help the balance that is going on as the technology enables consumers to do more, and content and distribution companies are trying to enable all that to happen in a way that is good for their stakeholders. I think we have an ability to be a constructive force and ultimately give consumers more access in more windows on more devices. And that's the strategy we're trying to pursue."

These platforms are getting enabled, and we're just starting to look at each new device in new window, and in the home and potentially out of the home. And you're right, it's complicated. But I think everybody is trying to pull in the same direction because of piracy. You got a looming issue that if you don't, there are other ways consumers can get this content. So it's in everyone's interest to come up with authenticated and authentic copies of the content into the consumer. So I think we're very pleased with the announcement this week. XFINITY TV has, I don't know, something like 150,000 different choices, and you're now on devices that have a wonderful navigation and search capabilities. And these are all very important steps as we now have more devices that allow you to display those contents, not just add a fixed PC. 
On wireless. My sense is the steps we've taken are a couple different areas. The one that's most intriguing to me at the moment is sort of the last foot. The last foot may want to have some display  on a wireless device using Wi-Fi in the home. As you get these tablets, that's what makes them sync. And our ability to combine with the EBIS, that Neil was just talking about, really gives us some unique capabilities to interact from the wireless device right to your set-top. For those of you that have a Crest-run-type remote in your home, high-end consumers have wanted to this. Now we are going to be able to bring this to everyone who has a few $100 in the tablet. So otherwise, we'll continue to monitor the Wireless business. But I think we're very pleased with where the overall date of business is, and that's really how we've looked at Wireless."

Please join me on Slide 3. Today, we are pleased to report strong financial results.

Please join me on Slide 3. Today, we are pleased to report strong financial results. This marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in revenue which increased 7%, and in operating cash flow which increased 8%. We generated free cash flow of $1 billion this quarter and almost $4.3 billion year-to-date, an increase of 17% compared to the first nine months of last year.
These results reflect our continued focus on profitable growth, a very resilient residential business, a robust advertising market and a continued focus and strength on Business Services. 
We obviously still have a tough economy, which combined with the anniversary of the broadcast digital transition, continue to impact video units. However, as Michael will discuss in a few minutes, we started to see some real year-over-year improvement toward the end of the third quarter and for October.
Overall, we are executing well, delivering strong financial results as we focus on high-value video customers on growing our relationships in broadband and phone and expanding Business Services. We're also continuing to invest to foster growth and to further strengthen our competitive position with All-Digital, now in about 65% of our markets, and DOCSIS 3.0 deployed in more than 80% of our footprint.
As we near completion of these important projects, we're starting to see the fruits of those investments. In Video, we've tripled the number of high-def channels and have doubled the amount of foreign language programming. In HSD, we are reinforcing our product superiority, as we double the speeds to our existing customers and introduce new higher speed services with 50 megabits currently available to more than 40 million homes and 105 megabits to more than 25 million homes. 
Our OnDemand service is also expanding. With our new library server infrastructure, which takes advantage of our scale, we call the Comcast Content Delivery Network or CCDN. We now have the capacity to offer 70,000 hours of content.
As a result, Comcast customers in more than 20% of our footprint now have access to over 25,000 OnDemand choices including 11,000 movies.
By the end of this year, a majority of our markets will have this level of choice. And with CCDN, we have the ability to continue to expand the OnDemand choices we offer our customers.
As we do this, we are rolling out enhanced guides with better linear and OnDemand search, improved DVR functionality and more interactivity, including a unique new feature that automatically informs you if the content is available in high definition. And just with the click of one extra button immediately takes you to the HD version which our customers really love.
Our new guide has already been rolled out to three quarters of our markets and will be in all our markets in the next six months. We're also deploying remote DVR and multi-room DVR, and they are available in a majority of our markets today.
Please turn to Slide 4. This week, we relaunched XFINITY TV, our authenticated on-demand online service with a new and, I think, great marketing campaign. XFINITY TV gives customers online access to 150,000 entertainment choices, including movies, TV shows, premium and HD content with a compelling search and discovery platform. All of our digital video customers will receive a customer ID to access XFINITY TV for no extra cost. It's a tremendous value-added service.
And before the end of this year, we will be launching the XFINITY TV remote app, which will work on all the iPhones and iPads and eventually right after it will come out on the Android-based tablets. This is an entirely new form factor and device for consumers to these tablets, which I think makes the search and discovery and the enjoyment of television that much greater because we've all been looking for how to navigate these 150,000 choices or whatever the consumer actually has.
And this, with a touch of a finger, allows you to change channels as well as do search and discovery. I think you'll like it when you get one.
So as you can see, we have an exciting roadmap for new product introductions, and we're delivering more and faster innovation to our customers. All of these enhancements and new features really are starting to bring to life our XFINITY brand. And you're going to continue to see and hear many new products from Comcast in the months and years ahead.
In order to deliver the best customer experience, you have to marry great products with consistently good customer service. We've worked hard to improve our service. But under the leadership of Neil Smit, who's now been with Comcast for seven months, I have never seen the organization as focused on the customer experience and making it better all the time. Neil's commitment to take service and also this rapid product innovation and getting it completed into the next level, while at the same time keeping us focused on strong operating performance like you're seeing this quarter, makes me really excited about where our Cable business is going.
Finally, on NBC Universal. The regulatory reviews are continuing, and we believe they're on track to enable us to close by the end of this year. The integration of NBC Universal is a huge task, and I'm delighted that Steve Burke will become the new CEO of NBC Universal upon closing.
Over the past 11 months, Steve has been spending a lot of time planning, so we can hit the ground running when the deal closes. I believe we're in a strong position to deliver a great entertainment experience to consumers and to really drive new value creation for our shareholders.
Before I pass the call over to Michael, I want to mention that we're following a new format for today's call, shortening the prepared remarks for Michael and me and allowing more time for your questions, for not only Mike and myself but also for Steve and Neil. So Michael, with that, please cover the results of the third quarter in more detail."
173341,113376098,82269,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 5. We are pleased with our third quarter results which reflected consistent focus on profitable growth. We are executing well and continue to balance revenue, o",1874,"Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated results starting on Slide 5. We are pleased with our third quarter results which reflected consistent focus on profitable growth. We are executing well and continue to balance revenue, operating cash flow and customer growth, as well as remain very focused on expense and capital management.
For the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7.3% to $9.5 billion, and operating cash flow grew 7.6% to $3.6 billion, resulting in a consolidated operating cash flow margin of 37.7%. Cable was the largest driver of these results. But our Programming businesses also performed well, with revenue growth of 9% and operating cash flow growth of 26%.
These results reflect the impact of a strong advertising market across all of our networks and rating strength at E!, which had record viewership in the third quarter.
This quarter's consolidated operating cash flow results also include approximately $21 million of expenses related to the NBC Universal transaction, which is included in corporate and other. Excluding these transaction-related costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 8.2%, and our operating cash flow margin increased to 37.9% from 37.6% in 2009.
We also remain very focused on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and earnings per share as important metrics in evaluating the strength of the company. In each of these key metrics, our performance during the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis was strong and reflects solid progress and growth.
During the third quarter, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1 billion, a modest decline compared to last year, primarily the result of higher cash income taxes and a slight increase in capital expenditures. However, we prefer to evaluate free cash flow on an LTM or year-to-date basis. And year-to-date, free cash flow has increased 17% to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion in 2009. Year-to-date free cash flow per share increased 19.8% to $1.51 per share.
Earnings per share in the third quarter grew 14.3% to $0.32 per share from $0.28 per share last year, when you exclude NBC Universal-related costs of $66 million and tax benefits and a onetime financing expense in 2009.
On a year-to-date basis, EPS grew 17.1% over the comparable period in 2009, again, excluding NBC Universal-related costs of $154 million and last year's tax benefits and onetime finance expenses.  Please refer to Table 4 in the press release for more detail on these items. 
Please refer to Slide 6 to review our Cable division's third quarter results. Third quarter Cable revenue increased 6.9% to $9 billion, reflecting accelerating growth in our Residential business and continued strength in Business Services and Cable Advertising. Total video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers grew 202,000 for the third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we have added 875,000 customers compared to 1.2 million in the first three quarters of last year. 
As discussed on the second quarter earnings call and at recent investor conferences, customer addition trends were soft in July and August, reflecting a continuing weak economy, the impact of last year's broadcast digital transition, the roll-off of customers on discounted promotions and continued competitive pressures. However, year-over-year, customer trends improved in September. And now that the impact from the broadcast digital transition is substantially behind us, we have experienced steady improvement in October.
This quarter's loss of 275,000 video customers was impacted by the factors I just mentioned, and we are very focused on improving our retention efforts. Year-to-date, we have lost 622,000 video customers compared to 424,000 in 2009, where we benefited from the broadcast digital transition.
Over 40% of this year's video losses are in our lower-end basic video package. And the impact from these customer losses is more muted on the financial side, as their average ARPU is less than half of our normalized video ARPU. With regards to the economy, we remain cautiously optimistic about its overall direction and strength. However, the housing market is still weak, and unemployment remains high which we believe continues to impact many consumers.
Even with these macroeconomic challenges, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to execute. We continue to manage the business for profitable growth, and we've been effective in driving organic revenue.
Total revenue per video customer increased 10% to almost $130 per month in the third quarter, reflecting strong ARPU management and increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the third quarter, 32% of our video customers took all three services compared to 27% at the end of last year's third quarter. 
For the third quarter, total video revenue continued to accelerate and increase to 2.2%, reflecting rate adjustments and an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our Digital and Advanced Services.
This quarter, we deployed over 500,000 advanced hi-def and/or DVR set-tops, and we added 228,000 Advanced Services customers. We now have 9.9 million Advance Services customers equal to 51% of our digital customer base and 43% of all video customers.
High-Speed Internet revenue increased a healthy 12.2% during the quarter, reflecting rate adjustments and continued growth in our customer base. We added 249,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the third quarter. And year-to-date, we have added 766,000 High-Speed Internet customers, slightly above the 755,000 we added in the first three quarters of last year.
Our penetration continues to trend upward and is now at 33%. In addition, we continue to see more customers take our high-speed services compared to our economy service. Today, 22% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take our blast or above levels of service.
Voice revenue also posted strong growth, increasing 12.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our residential customer base, as well as a growing contribution from Business Services. We added 228,000 voice customers in the third quarter. And year-to-date, we have added 731,000 voice customers compared to 906,000 in the first three quarters of last year. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our penetration has increased 150 basis points and is now at 17%.
We also had a strong quarter for Business Services, with revenue increasing 54.5% to $333 million. Excluding the contribution from CIMCO and NGT, which were acquisitions that were completed in the first quarter, revenue increased 44%. We expect the momentum in the small end of the business market to continue. And we remain very enthusiastic about our opportunity to serve midsize businesses and to expand our cell backhaul efforts.
Our Cable Advertising business continues to perform well, as third quarter revenue increased 27.2%. This improvement was again led by strength in automotive, as well as higher political revenue. Excluding the impact of political, core cable advertising revenue increased 19% this quarter. We expect advertising growth to remain strong in the fourth quarter, particularly given all the political activity.
Please refer to Slide 7 to review our Cable division's operating cash flow results. Third quarter cable operating cash flow increased 7.1% to $3.5 billion. Our cable operating cash flow margin remained relatively stable at 39.5%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to last year's third quarter. Total expenses in our Cable segment increased 6.8%, primarily reflecting higher programming and marketing expenses, as well as continued investment to expand our capabilities in Business Services.
Program expenses increased 4.9% this quarter, reflecting a real focus on controlling costs, offset by an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of our digital services, the addition of new programming and contract resets. In addition, we are receiving more value in our programming contracts, particularly with more OnDemand programming and increasing availability of content across multiple platforms.
Marketing expenses increased 17.3% this quarter, as a result of higher overall advertising and media spend including XFINITY branding, as well as a continued investment in direct sales in our retail channels. Customer service expense declined 2.7% in the third quarter, as we benefit from a number of efficiency initiatives such as higher call automation and better call center optimization.
Please refer to Slide 8 to review our capital expenditures for the quarter. In the third quarter, capital expenditures increased $139 million to $1.4 billion, representing 14.4% of total revenue. The level of CapEx spend this quarter principally reflects the timing of CPE purchases, primarily advanced set-top in DTAs, offset by more favorable equipment pricing. We have now deployed over 15 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, including 2.2 million during the third quarter.
We've also continued to increase our investment to support growth and expansion in Business Services. We view our capital expenditure program on an LTM or year-to-date basis. And year-to-date, capital expenditures have decreased 2.2% to $3.4 billion, equal to 12.2% of revenue. In addition, consistent with prior years, our growth-oriented capital expenditures represent approximately 72% of our year-to-date total spend.
With regards to the fourth quarter, we expect CapEx to increase sequentially as we continue to invest to sustain our momentum in Business Services, expand our efforts for the midsize businesses and cell backhaul and complete our rollout of All-Digital. However, we still expect our full year capital expenditures to be lower in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue when we compare it to 2009.
Please refer to Slide 9. Our priority for allocating capital has been consistent to profitably invest in the operating and strategic needs of our businesses, deploy capital to areas that provide attractive incremental returns and enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable organic growth. This disciplined and returned focus to CapEx has helped drive significant growth in free cash flow generation. And as I mentioned previously, year-to-date free cash flow increased 17% to $4.3 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 19.8% to $1.51 per share. 
With the recent extension of bonus depreciation for 2010, we anticipate the company will realize a benefit by paying lower income taxes in the fourth quarter. As we've done in the past, we'll continue to report comparable results that both include and exclude cash impact on free cash flow from the economic stimulus packages.
Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 40% of our free cash flow to shareholders or $1.7 billion, including three dividend payments totaling $800 million and $300 million per quarter of share repurchases totaling $900 million.
The remainder of free cash flow, which is currently reflected in our cash balance, will be used to fund a portion of the NBC Universal transaction which will be approximately $6.5 billion. We are pleased that over the past six months, NBC Universal has successfully raised $9.1 billion in the public debt markets. This permanent financing for NBCU is now complete and was accomplished with the weighted average cost of debt of approximately 4.5% and an average duration of 13.3 years.
When we close the NBC Universal transaction, we expect our consolidated leverage will be approximately 2.5x. And as we have said in the past, we remain comfortable with a debt to OCF leverage target of between 2x and 2.5x. 
Last December, we articulated a clear capital allocation strategy for 2010, and we have executed well on that plan. Once the NBC Universal transaction is completed, we'll re-evaluate and communicate a new financial strategy for 2011. 
Now let me turn it over to Marlene for Q&A."

We're seeing fewer occupied housing units, and the unemployment is still a factor. The second is the digital transition and the promotional roll-off. 42% of the customers we lost were basic customers. The digital transition appears to be mostly behind us. I think the third reason is the rate increases we took. So this year, we took rate increases over the last six months. So Q2 and Q3 at about 75% of our footprint versus about 3% last year. 
From an over-the-top impact, all our exit surveys have seen almost no impact. We have seen customers who are disconnecting and not going to a competitor. That small number of customers -- it appeared to be going over the air, much more than any over-the-top impact. The competitive situation really hasn't changed much. We've seen, year-over-year, a buildout the RBOCs -- so AT&T, about 2.2 million home buildout. We haven't seen a significant increase of that competitive factor. The DSL players appear to be playing more in rate. But we're very pleased with our HSD numbers. We once again gained share as we put on more HSD subs than Verizon and AT&T combined. We're pleased with that number. Our HSD ARPU is up 4.9%. We're pleased with that number. I think there are some really positive news in the quarter. If you look at the year-over-year customer trending, so net adds per month, every month of the quarter improved. So August was better than July. September was better than August. And we're seeing that positive trend continuing into October. 
The other piece of positive news is we're really pleased with our Advanced Services. So we sold about 228 more advanced service customers, about 500k more HD and HD DVR boxes. Our revenue for Advanced Services was up 11%. So we are seeing some positive trends. I think net, we're going to keep focusing on the quality of our customers.

Many of those customers were, for the first time, coming on to multi-channel television. At the end of the 12 months, they then went to kind of quote normalized rates, and at step-up.

Obviously, the NBC network still has its challenges. But if you look at advertising, the business is significantly better than we thought. Universal Studios invested in an animation company, that's first release was a film called Despicable Me, that was a tremendous success. And obviously, the Animation business is one of the best parts, if not the best part, of the Film business. Universal Studios opened Harry Potter down in Florida which has been sort of standing-room only success. And then really, the cable channels that we will have when we get this company put together offer, I think, real opportunity, opportunities to sort of cross promote, provide new programming, just bring everything to a different level. So I think we've done a lot of deals over the last number of years. And I think, sometimes, everything happens to the negative between signing and closing. And this time, it seems like the vast majority of things are very positive. 
In terms of Canoe, Canoe now has 10 million homes right now today where you can buy interactive advertising on the Style Network. And AMC has also launched in a number of other networks. So Canoe is now live. It's outselling and out sort of starting to do what we've wanted the interactive Advertising business to do for a long, long time. And that 10 million number is going to grow very dramatically because it's based on the roll-out of EBIS, which those of you who followed the industry now is now sort of the industry's standard for interactive television. So we're very pleased with the progress of Canoe and optimistic that finally after years of putting together the infrastructure and the partnership and everything else, interactive advertising is going to deliver real results."

Ultimately, when we laid out our initial vision, which we call Project Infinity, a couple of years ago at CES, as a technical matter, where you would like to get to is have it architecture and a capability that any piece of content could be accessed by the consumer on any device at any time. And then it's up to the content rights holder to determine whether they want to sell it at all at that moment in different windows. All the things you said, they get advertising supported, have an additional charge for or any other model. And the technology that our industry can bring or Comcast can perhaps lead with things like the CCDN and with the architecture of our VOD infrastructure, coupled with the Wi-Fi in the home, initially focused very much in the home, and now new devices like the tablets, which I think we're just seeing the very beginning of, the number of people who are going to make tablets and the rapid nature by which the price is going to decline, in my opinion, will accelerate this architecture to be taken well and used by the consumer. We're just starting. 
Ultimately, it would be wonderful if there was an expectation by the consumers that they would know where the shows are and what windows. Today, you know, when a movie comes out, you go to the theater and so many months later, you can buy a DVD. And then, you see it on paid television and et cetera, and on OnDemand. It's all over the place right now, and people are experimenting with different windows in different models and old episodes, new episodes, future episodes. And I think until there's enough content that there is an understanding by the consumer, it will be adopted by some but not by all. And our job is to try to make it simple, ubiquitous and have the technical platform to handle the volumes that we hope will ultimately come."

Can you sort of break down how much was high-speed plans being taken, price increase as well as the commercial mix? And I really have sort of an observation I want to get your reaction to it is, there's been a lot of talk about over-the-top impact to multi-town [ph]video. But if you sort of look at the pricing that most operators have for the fastest speed tiers of broadband, if there is over-the-top discount or cost-cutting. Are cable operators actually on the margin or a little better or even neutral, given the margin of the two businesses?"

One is, our HSD ARPU, we were pleased with that most of that was due to customers taking higher speeds. So as Brian mentioned, we've rolled out 50 meg servers to about 40 million homes, 105 meg to about 25 million homes. So we are continuing to offer higher speeds to the customers. And that is really what's driving the ARPU. Over 20% of our customers subscribed to the higher speed tiers that are black level, which is 8 meg and above. So that's what's driving the speeds. 
Rate adjustments were a factor. But I would say that, that will continue to monitor and rate and volume and manage that as the economy evolves. I think you're right in terms of the potential opportunity if over-the-top, and it comes into being, and there is more consumption of online video. We feel very good about our capacity. That's one of the reasons we've invested so heavily in DOCSIS 3.0. We feel that, that big pipe into the house is important. And we will continue to invest in speed increases like that, like DOCSIS 3.0. We think it's an important component, and the customers continue to consume more bandwidth."

The world is changing and evolving very rapidly, and we want to serve all spaces. That said, the most exciting projects we're working on that allow you to have tremendous functionality right on the TV to have set-top boxes involved with them. And some customers will not want all that and will want a different model. And so we're working on all across the Labscape. Also as more and more moves into the cloud and into a different architecture, we have to handle that as well. So it's an interesting time, technically.

So we can work more on the user interface and accept access to that content, and we can work more across platforms, as Steve referred to, whether it's the television, the DVR, VOD, we can have a consistent user interface. And I think that's a really important development in the overall customer experience. Net-net, we're probably more excited about our roadmap of innovation because of the trends that's occurring.

So whether it's Cablevision and Fox or other companies in their negotiations, those negotiations are going to have a free market and set a model. Clearly, the broadcasters would like as many eyeballs as possible to their shows. And since they're broadcasting into the air, it makes a lot of sense to put a lot of shows on the Internet. What exactly to show and exactly what window is up to each content company. And again, I do believe we can try to help the balance that is going on as the technology enables consumers to do more, and content and distribution companies are trying to enable all that to happen in a way that is good for their stakeholders.

These platforms are getting enabled, and we're just starting to look at each new device in new window, and in the home and potentially out of the home. And you're right, it's complicated. But I think everybody is trying to pull in the same direction because of piracy. You got a looming issue that if you don't, there are other ways consumers can get this content. So it's in everyone's interest to come up with authenticated and authentic copies of the content into the consumer. So I think we're very pleased with the announcement this week. XFINITY TV has, I don't know, something like 150,000 different choices, and you're now on devices that have a wonderful navigation and search capabilities. And these are all very important steps as we now have more devices that allow you to display those contents, not just add a fixed PC. 
On wireless. My sense is the steps we've taken are a couple different areas. The one that's most intriguing to me at the moment is sort of the last foot. The last foot may want to have some display on a wireless device using Wi-Fi in the home. As you get these tablets, that's what makes them sync. And our ability to combine with the EBIS, that Neil was just talking about, really gives us some unique capabilities to interact from the wireless device right to your set-top. For those of you that have a Crest-run-type remote in your home, high-end consumers have wanted to this. Now we are going to be able to bring this to everyone who has a few $100 in the tablet. So otherwise, we'll continue to monitor the Wireless business. But I think we're very pleased with where the overall data business is, and that's really how we've looked at Wireless."
