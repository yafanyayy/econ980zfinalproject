Here with me today is Fred Sutherland, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Fred and I will present an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date results and business operations. After which, there will be an opportunity for phone-in participants to ask questions. I'd like to remind you that any recording or other use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of ARAMARK. 
As we discussed the results, you may want to refer to the Form 10-Q we filed this morning, which contains our second quarter results for fiscal 2010. This Form 10-Q can be found on our website at www.aramark.com. 
In today's discussion of results, we'll mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website prior to this call, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules. 
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going private transaction, the impact of stock option expense, as well as the $34 million charge we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reposition our Uniform and Career Apparel segment. All of these items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before the call. 
Various remarks that we may make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q filed earlier today. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise. I'd now like to turn the program over to Fred."
1004106,104870522,61103,"ARAMARK Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, May-12-2010",2010-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2010 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance in the quarter and in the half. Overall, we",1533,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2010 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance in the quarter and in the half. 
Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal 2010 in light of a still-challenging operating environment. Our less economically sensitive businesses delivered solid overall performance in the first half, while our more cyclical businesses in general continued to stabilize, with each sectors showing sequential improvement in organic sales growth in the second quarter compared to Q1. 
We're also pleased with our cash flow performance, having delivered solid improvements so far this year compared to both last year and our expectations. Our first half client retention rates and levels of annualized new business improved over last year and our pipeline of new business opportunities remained solid. 
Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We achieved sales of $3.1 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. Organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions, was negative 1% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $143.9 million, down 4% from the prior-year level, including a three percentage point positive impact from currency translation. 
Profit results in the quarter in part reflect the seasonal portfolio mix, with a more economically challenged business sector in Uniform business having greater relative weight than higher education when compared to the first quarter. 
Results in the quarter also reflect lower levels of activity in our Remote Camps business in Canada, some softness in Healthcare base business profitability as we adjust our service models to support the changing needs of our clients and the impact of the earthquake in Chile on our operations there. 
For the first half of fiscal 2010, sales were $6.3 billion, up 1% over the prior year and down 2% on an organic growth basis. Adjusted operating income of $330.4 million was flat to the prior year, with currency translation contributing about three points of the growth for the half. 
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales were up 2% to $2.1 billion, with solid growth in Higher Education and Healthcare, largely offsetting declines in the Business & Industry sector. Organic sales growth for this segment was flat in the quarter. For the first half, reported sales were up 1% to $4.3 billion. Organic growth was also flat, with the overall performance again being led by solid growth in Higher Education and Healthcare. 
Turning to the sectors within the North American business, in general, the as-reported sales growth rates I'm about to describe reflect a positive one to two percentage point impact from the stronger Canadian dollar. Our Business & Industry sector had a low-single-digit sales decline for the quarter and mid-single-digit sales decline for the half, primarily reflecting the lower employee population levels in many of our client locations compared to the same period last year, as well as reduced activity in our Remote Camps business in Canada, resulting from lower drilling and exploration activity. 
During the second quarter, we did see continued stabilization in discretionary spending and employee population levels in many of our business food service accounts. As a result, the year-over-year decline in the second quarter reflected a modest sequential improvement over this year's first fiscal quarter. While we are still awaiting signs of any material and sustainable improvement in employment levels, we do expect this sector to generate positive growth as we move through the rest of the year. 
The Education sector had mid-single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the first half, with solid base business growth in our Higher Education and Food business, offset somewhat by the negative impact of inclement weather and some prior-year lost business in K-12. We have generated strong new business so far this year in both Food and Facility Services, and we are continuing to invest appropriately in pursuit of this growth opportunity. 
In our Healthcare sector, we realized mid-single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the first half, driven by solid base and net new business growth in both Food and Facility Services. Across our service portfolio, we continue to see attractive base and new business growth opportunities, and our current new business pipeline is robust. Our Sports & Entertainment sector had low-single-digit sales growth in the quarter and for the first half, reflecting stabilizing trends in both our Convention Centers and Parks businesses. 
In our stadium and arenas operations during the first half, we generally saw a somewhat lower attendance levels year-over-year, offset by somewhat higher per capita spending. These trends are generally consistent with what we are seeing so far with Major League Baseball, improved per caps and somewhat lower attendance, which as always is further influenced by team performance. 
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment fell 2% in the quarter to $107.7 million, with solid year-over-year performance in Education and Sports & Entertainment, offset by declines in our Business & Industry and Healthcare sectors. 
Currency translation contributed approximately three percentage points of the growth for the quarter. 
For the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew 3% to $244.9 million led by strong profit growth in Education and good cost control in Sports & Entertainment, offset by demand-driven profit declines in Business & Industry and some softness in Healthcare base business profitability, as we adjust our service models to support the changing needs of our clients. A stronger Canadian dollar contributed three percentage points to the profit growth in the half. 
Turning to our International Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales of $634 million were up 13% from the prior-year period, with organic sales up 1%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by continued solid performance in Chile, Germany, China and Argentina, offset by organic sales declines in the U.K., Ireland, Korea and Spain, primarily reflecting the particularly challenging economic environments in those countries. 
For the first half, reported sales were up 10% to $1.3 billion, with negative organic growth of about 1% but primarily by growth in Chile, Argentina and Germany offsetting organic declines in the U.K., Ireland, Korea and Spain. Second quarter adjusted operating income was $18.7 million, down from $21.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Profit results in the quarter primarily reflect the weakness in the U.K., as well as an approximately $2 million negative profit impact in the quarter due to the earthquake in Chile. 
Currency translation contributed about three percentage points of the growth in the quarter. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $42.7 million, flat compared with the prior year due to the positive impact from currency translation, which added about eight percentage points of growth. Excluding the currency impact, the lower first half results were primarily driven by profit declines in the U.K. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $360 million were down 10% from the year-ago quarter from both on as-reported and on organic basis, with our Uniform Rental business declining somewhat less than the segment overall, as a direct marketing business declined as planned due to the WearGuard restructuring. For the second consecutive quarter, the segment did show ongoing modest sequential improvement, though the market environment remains extremely price competitive. For the first half, segment sales of $741 million were down 11% from the prior year on both on a reported and organic basis, with our Uniform Rental business down in the high-single digits. 
As with our Business & Industry sector clients in Food and Support Services, we have seen signs of stabilization among our Uniform client base, and our year-over-year performance should continue to improve as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. However, our segment outlook remains cautious, as price competition remains fierce and we have yet to see signs of meaningful and sustained jobs growth. 
The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income of $25.5 million, down 9% compared to last year on a 10% decline in sales. So we were able to hold our margins roughly constant. These results, in part, reflect our ability to mitigate the profit impact of the sales decline through our cost reduction efforts and the repositioning and integration of our WearGuard direct marketing business within the Rental business, which we successfully completed this past quarter. As a result, we now have a more focused direct sale business, which is more tightly coupled with our much larger Rental business. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $57.9 million, down 11% compared to last year on an 11% decline in sales, again, reflecting the benefits of our cost reduction and mitigation efforts across the segment. 
Corporate expenses, which exclude the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $8 million in the quarter compared to $9.2 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting reduced staff and administrative spending. For the first half, expenses were $15.1 million compared to $17.8 million in the prior quarter. Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow.

I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 2 was $1.048 billion, down slightly from $1.058 billion at January 1, 2010 and up from $1.035 billion at October 2, 2009. 
Interest and other financing costs were $117.8 million for the second quarter compared to $119.2 million in the prior year. The current quarter's total includes approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March. 
We are very appreciative of the broad support that the amendment and extension receives from our investors. We believe that the success of the extension further enhances our financial and capital structure flexibility, and we'd like to thank all of those that provided their consent and participated in the extension. 
Turning back to interest expense, for the first half, interest and other financing costs were $227 million compared to $244.4 million in the prior year. Approximately 76% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.3%. 
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.751 billion, down from $5.853 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.951 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.590 billion and a revolver balance of $65 million, which has since been reduced. 
Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $244 million utilized at quarter end. We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end had approximately $520 million of available borrowing capacity under our $600 million revolving credit facility and $252 million of reported cash, including approximately $175 million of non-operating invested cash. 
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.70x as of April 2 compared to 3.70x as of January 1 of 2010 and 3.72x as of October 2, 2009. Net capital expenditures for the quarter was $49 million compared to $75 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year to date, net capital expenditures totaled $107 million compared to $150 million last year. 
While we anticipate a higher level of spending in the second half of the year as compared to the first half, for the full year, we do expect our net expenditures to remain somewhat below the prior-year level as we continue to be disciplined in managing our use of capital. As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first half of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance was comparable to last year's very strong performance, and we have nicely exceeded the expectations we had coming into the year. 
Overall, our teams are continuing to do an excellent job in managing our receivables and our days sales outstanding are improved again this quarter as compared to last year. While some reinvestment in working capital will be required when sales begin to grow, we are continuing to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2010. 
For the year to date, we spent a total of $81 million on acquisitions compared to $49 million in the prior-year period. This year's spending relates primarily to the acquisition of an Irish facilities management company, which we closed in the first fiscal quarter and funded out of our cash resources at that time. We do continue to seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we'll be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn it back to Fred."

Summing up our performance so far this fiscal year, our Food and Support Services business has improved to deliver flat organic growth and comparable levels of profitability. Our Uniform Rental business is performing relatively well in today's high unemployment environment, and we have moved decisively in recent quarters to reduce our direct sales cost structure and better integrate our rental and direct sales capabilities, an effort that we are please to say is now largely complete. 
We're also pleased with our overall cash flow performance so far this year, which has improved compared to last year's strong results and is ahead of our own expectations. And we are remaining disciplined in our use of capital, both for investment and in working capital management. 
While we expect improving growth trends, as we look forward, the economic environment will continue to challenge certain sectors and countries more than others. And until we see sustained levels of employment growth, it will be difficult for a more cyclical sectors to drive significantly better performance. Fortunately, our portfolio, sectors, geographies and clients continue to provide us with a good balance overall, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our businesses. We will continue to invest in and pursue these many opportunities as we move through the balance of 2010, while still managing our cost structure and cash flow appropriately.

And as you may know, there have been several consolidations within the Financial Services sector in the U.K. on the back of some of the government-related bailout activity. And so through both lost business through some of those consolidations, where we were on the losing end of some of the consolidations, and then fairly significant reductions in populations at the sites, as well as dramatic declines in discretionary spending, we're feeling and seeing an impact in the U.K. Again, that's disproportionate compared to other countries where we just never had the same Financial Services sector concentration.

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance in the quarter and in the half. Overall, we",1532,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2010 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then have Chris cover a few additional details on our performance in the quarter and in the half. 
Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal 2010 in light of a still-challenging operating environment. Our less economically sensitive businesses delivered solid overall performance in the first half, while our more cyclical businesses in general continued to stabilize, with each sector showing sequential improvement in organic sales growth in the second quarter compared to Q1. 
We're also pleased with our cash flow performance, having delivered solid improvements so far this year compared to both last year and our expectations. Our first-half client retention rates and levels of annualized new business improved over last year, and our pipeline of new business opportunities remained solid. 
Now turning to our overall results for the second quarter. We achieved sales of $3.1 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. Organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of currency translation and acquisitions, was negative 1% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $143.9 million, down 4% from the prior-year level, including a three-percentage point positive impact from currency translation. 
Profit results in the quarter in part reflect the seasonal portfolio mix, with the more economically challenged business sector in Uniform business having greater relative weight than higher education when compared to the first quarter. Results in the quarter also reflect lower levels of activity in our Remote Camps business in Canada, some softness in Healthcare base business profitability as we adjust our service models to support the changing needs of our clients and the impact of the earthquake in Chile on our operations there. 
For the first half of fiscal 2010, sales were $6.3 billion, up 1% over the prior year and down 2% on an organic growth basis. Adjusted operating income of $330.4 million was flat to the prior year, with currency translation contributing about three points of the growth for the half. 
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Second quarter reported sales were up 2% to $2.1 billion, with solid growth in Higher Education and Healthcare, largely offsetting declines in the Business & Industry sector. Organic sales growth for the segment was flat in the quarter. For the first half, reported sales were up 1% to $4.3 billion. Organic growth was also flat, with the overall performance again being led by solid growth in Higher Education and Healthcare. 
Turning to the sectors within the North American business. In general, the as-reported sales growth rates I'm about to describe reflect a positive one to two percentage point impact from the stronger Canadian dollar. 
Our Business & Industry sector had a low-single-digit sales decline for the quarter and a mid-single-digit sales decline for the half, primarily reflecting the lower employed population levels at many of our client locations compared to the same period last year, as well as reduced activity in our Remote Camps business in Canada, resulting from lower drilling and exploration activity. 
During the second quarter, we did see continued stabilization in discretionary spending and employee population levels in many of our business food service accounts. As a result, the year-over-year decline in the second quarter reflected a modest sequential improvement over this year's first fiscal quarter. While we are still awaiting signs of any material and sustainable improvement in employment levels, we do expect this sector to generate positive growth as we move through the rest of the year. 
The Education sector had mid-single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the first half, with solid base business growth in our Higher Education and Food business, offset somewhat by the negative impact of inclement weather and some prior-year lost business in K-12. We have generated strong new business so far this year in both Food and Facility Services, and we are continuing to invest appropriately in pursuit of this growth opportunity. 
In our Healthcare sector, we realized mid-single-digit sales growth for the quarter and for the first half, driven by solid base and net new business growth in both Food and Facility Services. Across our service portfolio, we continue to see attractive base and new business growth opportunities, and our current new business pipeline is robust. Our Sports & Entertainment sector had low-single-digit sales growth in the quarter and for the first half, reflecting stabilizing trends in both our Convention Centers and Parks businesses. 
In our stadium and arenas operations during the first half, we generally saw a somewhat lower attendance levels year-over-year, offset by somewhat higher per capita spending. These trends are generally consistent with what we are seeing so far with Major League Baseball, improved per caps and somewhat lower attendance, which as always is further influenced by team performance. 
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment fell 2% in the quarter to $107.7 million, with solid year-over-year performance in Education and Sports & Entertainment, offset by declines in our Business & Industry and Healthcare sectors. Currency translation contributed approximately three percentage points of the growth for the quarter. 
For the first half, segment adjusted operating income grew 3% to $244.9 million led by strong profit growth in Education and good cost control in Sports & Entertainment, offset by demand-driven profit declines in Business & Industry and some softness in Healthcare base business profitability, as we adjust our service models to support the changing needs of our clients. A stronger Canadian dollar contributed three percentage points to the profit growth in the half. 
Turning to our International Food and Support Services segment, second quarter reported sales of $634 million were up 13% from the prior-year period, with organic sales up 1%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by continued solid performance in Chile, Germany, China and Argentina, offset by organic sales declines in the U.K., Ireland, Korea and Spain, primarily reflecting the particularly challenging economic environments in those countries. 
For the first half, reported sales were up 10% to $1.3 billion, with negative organic growth of about 1% but primarily by growth in Chile, Argentina and Germany offsetting organic declines in the U.K., Ireland, Korea and Spain. Second quarter adjusted operating income was $18.7 million, down from $21.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Profit results in the quarter primarily reflect the weakness in the U.K., as well as an approximately $2 million negative profit impact in the quarter due to the earthquake in Chile. 
Currency translation contributed about three percentage points of the growth in the quarter. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $42.7 million, flat compared with the prior year due to the positive impact from currency translation, which added about eight percentage points of growth. Excluding the currency impact, the lower first half results were primarily driven by profit declines in the U.K. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, second quarter sales of $360 million were down 10% from the year-ago quarter from both on as-reported and on organic basis, with our Uniform Rental business declining somewhat less than the segment overall, as a direct marketing business declined as planned due to the WearGuard restructuring. For the second consecutive quarter, the segment did show ongoing modest sequential improvement, though the market environment remains extremely price competitive. For the first half, segment sales of $741 million were down 11% from the prior year on both on a reported and organic basis, with our Uniform Rental business down in the high-single digits. 
As with our Business & Industry sector clients in Food and Support Services, we have seen signs of stabilization among our Uniform client base, and our year-over-year performance should continue to improve as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. However, our segment outlook remains cautious, as price competition remains fierce and we have yet to see signs of meaningful and sustained jobs growth. 
The segment's second quarter adjusted operating income of $25.5 million, down 9% compared to last year on a 10% decline in sales. So we were able to hold our margins roughly constant. These results, in part, reflect our ability to mitigate the profit impact of the sales decline through our cost reduction efforts and the repositioning and integration of our WearGuard direct marketing business within the Rental business, which we successfully completed this past quarter. As a result, we now have a more focused direct sale business, which is more tightly coupled with our much larger Rental business. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $57.9 million, down 11% compared to last year on an 11% decline in sales, again, reflecting the benefits of our cost reduction and mitigation efforts across the segment. 
Corporate expenses, which exclude the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $8 million in the quarter compared to $9.2 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting reduced staff and administrative spending. For the first half, expenses were $15.1 million compared to $17.8 million in the prior quarter. 
Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the half."

Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 2 was $1.048 billion, down slightly from $1.058 billion at January 1, 2010, and up from $1.035 billion at Octo",622,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing, capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending April 2 was $1.048 billion, down slightly from $1.058 billion at January 1, 2010, and up from $1.035 billion at October 2, 2009. 
Interest and other financing costs were $117.8 million for the second quarter compared to $119.2 million in the prior year. The current quarter's total includes approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March. 
We are very appreciative of the broad support that the amendment and extension receives from our investors. We believe that the success of the extension further enhances our financial and capital structure flexibility, and we'd like to thank all of those that provided their consent and participated in the extension. 
Turning back to interest expense. For the first half, interest and other financing costs were $227 million compared to $244.4 million in the prior year. Approximately 76% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.3%. 
Total reported debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.751 billion, down from $5.853 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.951 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.590 billion and a revolver balance of $65 million which has since been reduced. Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $244 million utilized at quarter end. 
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end had approximately $520 million of available borrowing capacity under our $600 million revolving credit facility and $252 million of reported cash, including approximately $175 million of nonoperating invested cash. 
Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA, our secured debt ratio was 3.70x as of April 2 compared to 3.70x as of January 1 of 2010 and 3.72x as of October 2, 2009. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $49 million compared to $75 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year to date, net capital expenditures totaled $107 million compared to $150 million last year. 
While we anticipate a higher level of spending in the second half of the year as compared to the first half, for the full year we do expect our net expenditures to remain somewhat below the prior-year level as we continue to be disciplined in managing our use of capital. 
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first half of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance was comparable to last year's very strong performance, and we have nicely exceeded the expectations we had coming into the year. 
Overall, our teams are continuing to do an excellent job in managing our receivables and our days sales outstanding are improved again this quarter as compared to last year. While some reinvestment in working capital will be required when sales begin to grow, we are continuing to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the balance of fiscal 2010. 
For the year to date, we spent a total of $81 million on acquisitions compared to $49 million in the prior-year period. This year's spending relates primarily to the acquisition of an Irish facilities management company, which we closed in the first fiscal quarter and funded out of our cash resources at that time. We do continue to seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we'll be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. 
Now let me turn it back to Fred."

Summing up our performance so far this fiscal year, our Food and Support Services business has improved to deliver flat organic growth and comparable levels of profitability. Our Uniform Rental business is performing relatively well in today's high unemployment environment, and we have moved decisively in recent quarters to reduce our direct sales cost structure and better integrate our rental and direct sales capabilities, an effort that we are pleased to say is now largely complete. 
We are also pleased with our overall cash flow performance so far this year, which has improved compared to last year's strong results and is ahead of our own expectations. And we are remaining disciplined in our use of capital, both for investment and in working capital management. 
While we expect improving growth trends, as we look forward, the economic environment will continue to challenge certain sectors and countries more than others. And until we see sustained levels of employment growth, it will be difficult for a more cyclical sectors to drive significantly better performance. Fortunately, our portfolio, sectors, geographies and clients continue to provide us with a good balance overall, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities we see as we look across our businesses. We will continue to invest in and pursue these many opportunities as we move through the balance of 2010, while still managing our cost structure and cash flow appropriately. 
Thanks again for your time this morning and for your support of ARAMARK. We would now be happy to take questions."

Our discussion of operating income during today's call will in each instance exclude the incremental and tangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going-private transaction, the impact of stock option expense, as well as the $34 million charge we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reposition our Uniform and Career Apparel segment.

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. In light of a still-challenging op",1529,"Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2010 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. 
In light of a still-challenging operating environment, we are pleased with our overall performance for the first nine months of fiscal 2010. In general, our less economically sensitive businesses have delivered solid overall sales performance so far this year, while our more cyclical businesses have stabilized. We continue to be very pleased with our cash flow performance, which has exceeded our expectations so far this year. And as a result, we chose, as you may know, to make a $150 million optional term loan payment in June. 
Our year-to-date levels of annualized new business and our client retention rates have both shown solid improvement compared to last year, and our pipeline of new business opportunities is quite strong across a number of our sectors. We have also continued to invest this year in order to drive future growth, having spent additional P&L dollars to expand our sales resources in several of those sectors which have particularly attractive longer-term growth opportunities. 
Now turning to our overall results for the third quarter. We achieved sales of $3.1 billion, up 3% from the prior-year quarter and up 2% organically, representing a return to positive organic sales growth for the first time since the end of 2008. Adjusted operating income was $131.2 million, down 4% from the prior-year level. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, sales were $9.4 billion, up 2% over the prior-year period and essentially flat on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $461.5 million was down 1% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing about two percentage points of growth for the nine months. 
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Third quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.1 billion, led primarily by growth in the Education, Business and Industry and Healthcare sectors, which offset a modest sales decline in Sports and Entertainment. Organic sales growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter. For the nine months, reported sales were up 2% to $6.4 billion with organic growth of 1%. Year-to-date performance was led by solid growth in Higher Education and in Healthcare. 
Turning to the sectors within the North American business. In general, the as-reported sales growth ranges I'm about to describe reflect an approximate positive one percentage point impact from a stronger Canadian dollar. Our Business and Industry sector had a high-single digit sales increase for the quarter and a low-single digit sales decline for the nine months. The sector's quarterly results benefited significantly from our contract to provide support services, including temporary accommodations and feeding for the vast Canadian security detail that served the GA and G20 meetings in June, North of Toronto. Excluding this single-event contract, sector growth in the quarter would have been slightly positive. 
During the quarter, we did see some improvement in discretionary spending on the part of corporate clients, but have yet to see an increase in employee population levels at most of our business Food Service accounts. The Education sector had high-single digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single digit growth for the nine months, led by solid base business growth in our Higher Education Food business. We generated strong retention rates and new business in both Higher Ed and K-12 this year, positioning the overall sector well as we look towards 2011. We have also been reinvesting in our sales and retention resources to support our future growth objectives in this very attractive sector. 
In our Healthcare sector, we realized mid-single digit sales growth for the quarter and for the nine months as well, driven primarily by solid new business growth in both Food and Facility services. Across our Service portfolio, we continued to see numerous new and base business growth opportunities, and our current new business pipeline is strong. 
In the current economic environment, we have experienced some pressure on base business as existing Healthcare clients attempt to address their own budgetary challenges and pressures. The Sports and Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and flat growth for the nine months, reflecting stabilization of Stadiums, Arenas and Convention Centers, as well as the positive impact of new sales on our Parks and Destinations business. 
Consistent with Major League Baseball's results overall, our Stadium operations, which are obviously important in the summer, continue to see slightly lower attendance levels in total, partly offset by higher per capita spending in comparison to the prior year. These results are, of course, as always, further influenced by individual team performance. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment declined 4% in the quarter to $83.7 million with strong profit growth in Education and Sports and Entertainment, offset by declines in our Business and Industry and Healthcare sectors, reflecting the challenging budget situations faced by many of our clients. 
For the nine months, segment adjusted operating income grew 1% to $329 million, led by solid profit growth in Education and good cost control in Sports and Entertainment, offset by demand-driven profit declines in Business and Industry and softness, as I mentioned, in Healthcare base business profitability. The stronger Canadian dollar contributed about two percentage points of profit growth in the quarter and in the nine months. 
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Third quarter reported sales of $603.1 million were up 3% from the prior-year period with organic sales up 2%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by continued solid performance in Chile, Argentina, China and Germany, offset by organic sales declines in the U.K., Ireland and Spain, primarily reflecting the continued difficult economic environments in those countries. 
For the nine months, reported sales were up 8% to $1.9 billion with flat organic growth, again led primarily by growth in Chile, Argentina, China and Germany, offsetting organic declines in the U.K., Ireland, Korea and Spain. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $21.2 million, down from $25.7 million in the prior year, with currency translation contributing about $1 million of the decline. Profit results in the quarter primarily reflect weakness in the U.K., as well as the negative impact of Germany's results due to the timing of the soccer World Cup, which significantly reduced the number of soccer games in our German stadiums as compared to the prior year.
For the nine months, adjusted operating income was $63.9 million, down from $68.5 million in the prior year, driven by profit declines in the U.K. reflecting the continuing weak economic environment in that country as well as the impact of lost business earlier in the year. And the nine months’ results also reflect an approximately $2 million negative profit impact from the earthquake in Chile. Our currency translation contributed approximately $2 million of growth for the nine months in comparison to last year. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $368 million were down 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and an organic basis. Results would have been slightly better if we had adjusted for the impact of lost sales associated with certain exiting customer segments as a part of the WearGuard repositioning, which we've talked about before and which we successfully completed earlier this year. For the third consecutive quarter, the segment did show sequential improvement, although the market environment remains extremely price competitive. For the nine months, segment sales of $1.1 billion were down 8% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. So as you can see, we have shown sequential improvement. As with our Business and Industry sector, clients in the Food and Support Services group, we've seen some stabilization among our Uniform client base, and our year-over-year performance should continue to improve as we move forward. However, our outlook remains cautious as price competition remains very challenging, and we have yet to see signs of meaningful jobs growth among our client set. 
Segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $33.9 million, up 7% compared to last year as we were able to improve our margins on a somewhat lower sales base. These results, in part, reflect our ability to mitigate the profit impact of a sales decline through our aggressive cost-reduction efforts across the segment, as well as the significant repositioning and integration of the WearGuard Direct Marketing business within the Rental business, as well as lower energy costs compared to last year. 
For the nine months, adjusted operating income was $91.8 million, down 5% compared to last year on an 8% decline on sales, again reflecting the benefits of our cost-reduction and mitigation efforts across the segment. Our corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.7 million in the quarter compared to $7.4 million in the year ago quarter, and for the nine months, expenses were $22.8 million compared to $25.1 million in the prior year. 
At this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and the year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 2 was $1.040 billion, down from $1.048 billion at April 2, 2010 and up from $1.035 billion at October 2, 2009. Interest and other financing costs were $108.8 million for the third quarter compared with $119.4 million in the prior year. For the nine months, interest and other financing costs were $335.8 million compared to $363.8 million in the prior year, with this year's number including approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March. 
Approximately 80% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.50%. Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.521 billion, down from $5.885 billion at the end of last year's third quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.726 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.429 billion and a revolver balance of zero at quarter end. 
Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $247 million utilized at quarter end. And during the quarter, as Fred mentioned, we made an optional principal repayment of $150 million on our unextended U.S. dollar term loan balance, reflecting our solid cash flow year-to-date and our confidence in our performance for the balance of the fiscal year. 
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, our $600 million revolving credit facility was undrawn. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA and our reduced debt levels, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.51x as of July 2 compared to 3.70x as of April 2 this year and 3.72x as of October 2, 2009. 
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million compared to $97 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $152 million compared to $247 million last year. While we do anticipate a higher level of spending in the fourth quarter compared to last year, for the full year we expect our net expenditures to remain somewhat below the prior year's level as we continue to be disciplined in managing our use of capital. 
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first nine months of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance has exceeded our expectations coming into this year. Overall, our teams are continuing to do a good job in managing our receivables and our days sales outstanding are in line with last year's improved levels. 
While some reinvestment in working capital is required as sales have been slow, we are continuing to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For the year-to-date, we've spent a total of $84 million on acquisitions compared to $135 million in the prior-year period. This year’s spending relates primarily to the acquisition of an Irish facilities management company, which we closed in the first fiscal quarter and funded out of our cash resources at that time. We continue to seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but will continue to be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn it back to Fred."

Summing up our performance so far this fiscal year, our Food and Support Services businesses improved to deliver positive organic growth and comparable levels of profitability. We’re particularly proud of our teams at the G8 and the G20 that carried off that very complex and intensive operation without a hitch. 
Our Uniform Rental business is performing relatively well and is still challenging pricing in an unemployment environment. We’re also quite pleased with our cash flow performance so far this year, which has exceeded our expectations. As a result of our solid cash flow and outlook for the rest of the year, as Chris just mentioned, we made an optional principal repayment on our term loan in June and we are continuing to be disciplined in our use of capital, both for investment and in working capital management. 
As we look forward, while we continue to expect improving growth rates, the economic environment will continue to challenge certain sectors and countries more than others. Although we do anticipate an improving profit trend into Q4 as we complete 2010 and look towards next year. Our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients continues to provide us with good balance overall, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities and relatively strong pipeline as we look across our businesses.

In today's discussion of results, we mention certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Form 10-Q, as well as schedules we posted to our website prior to this call, include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures as required by SEC rules. 
Our discussion of operating income during today's call will in each instance exclude the incremental and tangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going-private transaction, the impact of stock option expense, as well as the $34 million charge we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reposition our Uniform and Career Apparel segment. All of these items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before this call. 
Various remarks that we may make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements.

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance.

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. 
In light of a still-challenging operating environment, we are pleased with our overall performance for the first nine months of fiscal 2010. In general, our less economically sensitive businesses have delivered solid overall sales performance so far this year, while our more cyclical businesses have stabilized. We continue to be very pleased with our cash flow performance, which has exceeded our expectations so far this year. And as a result, we chose, as you may know, to make a $150 million optional term loan payment in June. 
Our year-to-date levels of annualized new business and our client retention rates have both shown solid improvement compared to last year, and our pipeline of new business opportunities is quite strong across a number of our sectors. We have also continued to invest this year in order to drive future growth, having spent additional P&L dollars to expand our sales resources in several of those sectors which have particularly attractive longer-term growth opportunities. 
Now turning to our overall results for the third quarter. We achieved sales of $3.1 billion, up 3% from the prior-year quarter and up 2% organically, representing a return to positive organic sales growth for the first time since the end of 2008. Adjusted operating income was $131.2 million, down 4% from the prior-year level. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, sales were $9.4 billion, up 2% over the prior-year period and essentially flat on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $461.5 million was down 1% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing about two percentage points of growth for the nine months. 
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Third quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.1 billion, led primarily by growth in the Education, Business and Industry and Healthcare sectors, which offset a modest sales decline in Sports and Entertainment. Organic sales growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter. For the nine months, reported sales were up 2% to $6.4 billion with organic growth of 1%. Year-to-date performance was led by solid growth in Higher Education and in Healthcare. 
Turning to the sectors within the North American business. In general, the as-reported sales growth ranges I'm about to describe reflect an approximate positive one percentage point impact from a stronger Canadian dollar. Our Business and Industry sector had a high-single digit sales increase for the quarter and a low-single digit sales decline for the nine months. The sector's quarterly results benefited significantly from our contract to provide support services, including temporary accommodations and feeding for the vast Canadian security detail that served the GA and G20 meetings in June, north of Toronto. Excluding this single-event contract, sector growth in the quarter would have been slightly positive. 
During the quarter, we did see some improvement in discretionary spending on the part of corporate clients, but have yet to see an increase in employee population levels at most of our business Food Service accounts. The Education sector had high-single digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single digit growth for the nine months, led by solid base business growth in our Higher Education Food business. We generated strong retention rates and new business in both Higher Ed and K-12 this year, positioning the overall sector well as we look towards 2011. We have also been reinvesting in our sales and retention resources to support our future growth objectives in this very attractive sector. 
In our Healthcare sector, we realized mid-single digit sales growth for the quarter and for the nine months as well, driven primarily by solid new business growth in both Food and Facility services. Across our Service portfolio, we continued to see numerous new and base business growth opportunities, and our current new business pipeline is strong. 
In the current economic environment, we have experienced some pressure on base business as existing Healthcare clients attempt to address their own budgetary challenges and pressures. The Sports and Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and flat growth for the nine months, reflecting stabilization of Stadiums, Arenas and Convention Centers, as well as the positive impact of new sales on our Parks and Destinations business. 
Consistent with Major League Baseball's results overall, our Stadium operations, which are obviously important in the summer, continue to see slightly lower attendance levels in total, partly offset by higher per capita spending in comparison to the prior year. These results are, of course, as always, further influenced by individual team performance. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment declined 4% in the quarter to $83.7 million with strong profit growth in Education and Sports and Entertainment, offset by declines in our Business and Industry and Healthcare sectors, reflecting the challenging budget situations faced by many of our clients. 
For the nine months, segment adjusted operating income grew 1% to $329 million, led by solid profit growth in Education and good cost control in Sports and Entertainment, offset by demand-driven profit declines in Business and Industry and softness, as I mentioned, in Healthcare base business profitability. The stronger Canadian dollar contributed about two percentage points of profit growth in the quarter and in the nine months. 
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Third quarter reported sales of $603.1 million were up 3% from the prior-year period with organic sales up 2%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by continued solid performance in Chile, Argentina, China and Germany, offset by organic sales declines in the U.K., Ireland and Spain, primarily reflecting the continued difficult economic environments in those countries. 
For the nine months, reported sales were up 8% to $1.9 billion with flat organic growth, again led primarily by growth in Chile, Argentina, China and Germany, offsetting organic declines in the U.K., Ireland, Korea and Spain. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $21.2 million, down from $25.7 million in the prior year, with currency translation contributing about $1 million of the decline. Profit results in the quarter primarily reflect weakness in the U.K., as well as the negative impact of Germany's results due to the timing of the soccer World Cup, which significantly reduced the number of soccer games in our German stadiums as compared to the prior year.
For the nine months, adjusted operating income was $63.9 million, down from $68.5 million in the prior year, driven by profit declines in the U.K. reflecting the continuing weak economic environment in that country as well as the impact of lost business earlier in the year. And the nine months’ results also reflect an approximately $2 million negative profit impact from the earthquake in Chile. Our currency translation contributed approximately $2 million of growth for the nine months in comparison to last year. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $368 million were down 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and an organic basis. Results would have been slightly better if we had adjusted for the impact of lost sales associated with certain exiting customer segments as a part of the WearGuard repositioning, which we've talked about before and which we successfully completed earlier this year. For the third consecutive quarter, the segment did show sequential improvement, although the market environment remains extremely price competitive. For the nine months, segment sales of $1.1 billion were down 8% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. So as you can see, we have shown sequential improvement. As with our Business and Industry sector, clients in the Food and Support Services group, we've seen some stabilization among our Uniform client base, and our year-over-year performance should continue to improve as we move forward. However, our outlook remains cautious as price competition remains very challenging, and we have yet to see signs of meaningful jobs growth among our client set. 
Segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $33.9 million, up 7% compared to last year as we were able to improve our margins on a somewhat lower sales base. These results, in part, reflect our ability to mitigate the profit impact of a sales decline through our aggressive cost-reduction efforts across the segment, as well as the significant repositioning and integration of the WearGuard Direct Marketing business within the Rental business, as well as lower energy costs compared to last year. 
For the nine months, adjusted operating income was $91.8 million, down 5% compared to last year on an 8% decline on sales, again reflecting the benefits of our cost-reduction and mitigation efforts across the segment. Our corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.7 million in the quarter compared to $7.4 million in the year ago quarter, and for the nine months, expenses were $22.8 million compared to $25.1 million in the prior year. 
At this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and the year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 2 was $1.040 billion, down from $1.048 billion at April 2, 2010 and up from $1.035 billion at October 2, 2009. I",570,"Thanks, Fred. I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 2 was $1.040 billion, down from $1.048 billion at April 2, 2010 and up from $1.035 billion at October 2, 2009. Interest and other financing costs were $108.8 million for the third quarter compared with $119.4 million in the prior year. For the nine months, interest and other financing costs were $335.8 million compared to $363.8 million in the prior year, with this year's number including approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March. 
Approximately 80% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.50%. Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.521 billion, down from $5.885 billion at the end of last year's third quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.726 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.429 billion and a revolver balance of zero at quarter end. 
Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $247 million utilized at quarter end. And during the quarter, as Fred mentioned, we made an optional principal repayment of $150 million on our unextended U.S. dollar term loan balance, reflecting our solid cash flow year-to-date and our confidence in our performance for the balance of the fiscal year. 
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, our $600 million revolving credit facility was undrawn. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA and our reduced debt levels, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.51x as of July 2 compared to 3.70x as of April 2 this year and 3.72x as of October 2, 2009. 
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million compared to $97 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $152 million compared to $247 million last year. While we do anticipate a higher level of spending in the fourth quarter compared to last year, for the full year we expect our net expenditures to remain somewhat below the prior year's level as we continue to be disciplined in managing our use of capital. 
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first nine months of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance has exceeded our expectations coming into this year. Overall, our teams are continuing to do a good job in managing our receivables and our days sales outstanding are in line with last year's improved levels. 
While some reinvestment in working capital is required as sales have been slow, we are continuing to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For the year-to-date, we've spent a total of $84 million on acquisitions compared to $135 million in the prior-year period. This year’s spending relates primarily to the acquisition of an Irish facilities management company, which we closed in the first fiscal quarter and funded out of our cash resources at that time. We continue to seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but will continue to be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn it back to Fred."

Summing up our performance so far this fiscal year, our Food and Support Services businesses improved to deliver positive organic growth and comparable levels of profitability. We’re particularly proud of our teams at the G8 and the G20, who carried off their very complex and intensive operation without a hitch. 
Our Uniform Rental business is performing relatively well in a still-challenging pricing and unemployment environment. We’re also quite pleased with our cash flow performance so far this year, which has exceeded our expectations. As a result of our solid cash flow and outlook for the rest of the year, as Chris just mentioned, we made an optional principal repayment on our term loan in June and we are continuing to be disciplined in our use of capital, both for investment and in working capital management. 
As we look forward, while we continue to expect improving growth rates, the economic environment will continue to challenge certain sectors and countries more than others, although we do anticipate an improving profit trend into Q4 as we complete 2010 and look towards next year. Our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients continues to provide us with good balance overall, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities and relatively strong pipeline as we look across our businesses. We will continue to invest in and pursue these many opportunities in the months and years ahead, while still managing our cost structure and cash flow appropriately.

Our discussion of operating income during today's call will in each instance exclude the incremental and tangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going-private transaction, the impact of stock option expense, as well as the $34 million charge we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reposition our Uniform and Career Apparel segment.

I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. In light of a still-challenging op",1529,"Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2010 results call. I'd like to review our business and operating results and then Chris will cover a few additional details on our performance. 
In light of a still-challenging operating environment, we are pleased with our overall performance for the first nine months of fiscal 2010. In general, our less economically sensitive businesses have delivered solid overall sales performance so far this year, while our more cyclical businesses have stabilized. We continue to be very pleased with our cash flow performance, which has exceeded our expectations so far this year. And as a result, we chose, as you may know, to make a $150 million optional term loan payment in June. 
Our year-to-date levels of annualized new business and our client retention rates have both shown solid improvement compared to last year, and our pipeline of new business opportunities is quite strong across a number of our sectors. We have also continued to invest this year in order to drive future growth, having spent additional P&L dollars to expand our sales resources in several of those sectors which have particularly attractive longer-term growth opportunities. 
Now turning to our overall results for the third quarter. We achieved sales of $3.1 billion, up 3% from the prior-year quarter and up 2% organically, representing a return to positive organic sales growth for the first time since the end of 2008. Adjusted operating income was $131.2 million, down 4% from the prior-year level. For the nine months of fiscal 2010, sales were $9.4 billion, up 2% over the prior-year period and essentially flat on an organic growth basis. Our adjusted operating income of $461.5 million was down 1% from the prior year, with currency translation contributing about two percentage points of growth for the nine months. 
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Third quarter reported sales were up 4% to $2.1 billion, led primarily by growth in the Education, Business and Industry and Healthcare sectors, which offset a modest sales decline in Sports and Entertainment. Organic sales growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter. For the nine months, reported sales were up 2% to $6.4 billion with organic growth of 1%. Year-to-date performance was led by solid growth in Higher Education and in Healthcare. 
Turning to the sectors within the North American business. In general, the as-reported sales growth ranges I'm about to describe reflect an approximate positive one percentage point impact from a stronger Canadian dollar. Our Business and Industry sector had a high-single digit sales increase for the quarter and a low-single digit sales decline for the nine months. The sector's quarterly results benefited significantly from our contract to provide support services, including temporary accommodations and feeding for the vast Canadian security detail that served the GA and G20 meetings in June, north of Toronto. Excluding this single-event contract, sector growth in the quarter would have been slightly positive. 
During the quarter, we did see some improvement in discretionary spending on the part of corporate clients, but have yet to see an increase in employee population levels at most of our business Food Service accounts. The Education sector had high-single digit sales growth for the quarter and mid-single digit growth for the nine months, led by solid base business growth in our Higher Education Food business. We generated strong retention rates and new business in both Higher Ed and K-12 this year, positioning the overall sector well as we look towards 2011. We have also been reinvesting in our sales and retention resources to support our future growth objectives in this very attractive sector. 
In our Healthcare sector, we realized mid-single digit sales growth for the quarter and for the nine months as well, driven primarily by solid new business growth in both Food and Facility services. Across our Service portfolio, we continued to see numerous new and base business growth opportunities, and our current new business pipeline is strong. 
In the current economic environment, we have experienced some pressure on base business as existing Healthcare clients attempt to address their own budgetary challenges and pressures. The Sports and Entertainment sector had low single-digit sales decline for the quarter and flat growth for the nine months, reflecting stabilization of Stadiums, Arenas and Convention Centers, as well as the positive impact of new sales on our Parks and Destinations business. 
Consistent with Major League Baseball's results overall, our Stadium operations, which are obviously important in the summer, continue to see slightly lower attendance levels in total, partly offset by higher per capita spending in comparison to the prior year. These results are, of course, as always, further influenced by individual team performance. Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment declined 4% in the quarter to $83.7 million with strong profit growth in Education and Sports and Entertainment, offset by declines in our Business and Industry and Healthcare sectors, reflecting the challenging budget situations faced by many of our clients. 
For the nine months, segment adjusted operating income grew 1% to $329 million, led by solid profit growth in Education and good cost control in Sports and Entertainment, offset by demand-driven profit declines in Business and Industry and softness, as I mentioned, in Healthcare base business profitability. The stronger Canadian dollar contributed about two percentage points of profit growth in the quarter and in the nine months. 
Turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Third quarter reported sales of $603.1 million were up 3% from the prior-year period with organic sales up 2%. Organic growth in the quarter was led by continued solid performance in Chile, Argentina, China and Germany, offset by organic sales declines in the U.K., Ireland and Spain, primarily reflecting the continued difficult economic environments in those countries. 
For the nine months, reported sales were up 8% to $1.9 billion with flat organic growth, again led primarily by growth in Chile, Argentina, China and Germany, offsetting organic declines in the U.K., Ireland, Korea and Spain. Third quarter adjusted operating income was $21.2 million, down from $25.7 million in the prior year, with currency translation contributing about $1 million of the decline. Profit results in the quarter primarily reflect weakness in the U.K., as well as the negative impact of Germany's results due to the timing of the soccer World Cup, which significantly reduced the number of soccer games in our German stadiums as compared to the prior year.
For the nine months, adjusted operating income was $63.9 million, down from $68.5 million in the prior year, driven by profit declines in the U.K. reflecting the continuing weak economic environment in that country as well as the impact of lost business earlier in the year. And the nine months’ results also reflect an approximately $2 million negative profit impact from the earthquake in Chile. Our currency translation contributed approximately $2 million of growth for the nine months in comparison to last year. 
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, third quarter sales of $368 million were down 3% from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and an organic basis. Results would have been slightly better if we had adjusted for the impact of lost sales associated with certain exiting customer segments as a part of the WearGuard repositioning, which we've talked about before and which we successfully completed earlier this year. For the third consecutive quarter, the segment did show sequential improvement, although the market environment remains extremely price competitive. For the nine months, segment sales of $1.1 billion were down 8% from the prior year on both a reported and organic basis. So as you can see, we have shown sequential improvement. As with our Business and Industry sector, clients in the Food and Support Services group, we've seen some stabilization among our Uniform client base, and our year-over-year performance should continue to improve as we move forward. However, our outlook remains cautious as price competition remains very challenging, and we have yet to see signs of meaningful jobs growth among our client set. 
Segment's third quarter adjusted operating income was $33.9 million, up 7% compared to last year as we were able to improve our margins on a somewhat lower sales base. These results, in part, reflect our ability to mitigate the profit impact of a sales decline through our aggressive cost-reduction efforts across the segment, as well as the significant repositioning and integration of the WearGuard Direct Marketing business within the Rental business, as well as lower energy costs compared to last year. 
For the nine months, adjusted operating income was $91.8 million, down 5% compared to last year on an 8% decline on sales, again reflecting the benefits of our cost-reduction and mitigation efforts across the segment. Our corporate expenses, excluding the items that Chris mentioned earlier, were $7.7 million in the quarter compared to $7.4 million in the year ago quarter, and for the nine months, expenses were $22.8 million compared to $25.1 million in the prior year. 
At this point, let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and the year-to-date performance."

I'd like to comment on our financing capital structure and cash flow. Our adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ending July 2 was $1.040 billion, down from $1.048 billion at April 2, 2010 and up from $1.035 billion at October 2, 2009. Interest and other financing costs were $108.8 million for the third quarter compared with $119.4 million in the prior year. For the nine months, interest and other financing costs were $335.8 million compared to $363.8 million in the prior year, with this year's number including approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March. 
Approximately 80% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.50%. Total reported debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.521 billion, down from $5.885 billion at the end of last year's third quarter. Our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.726 billion, including a term loan balance of $3.429 billion and a revolver balance of zero at quarter end. 
Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $247 million utilized at quarter end. And during the quarter, as Fred mentioned, we made an optional principal repayment of $150 million on our unextended U.S. dollar term loan balance, reflecting our solid cash flow year-to-date and our confidence in our performance for the balance of the fiscal year. 
We continue to enjoy a strong liquidity position overall and at quarter end, our $600 million revolving credit facility was undrawn. Based on our trailing adjusted EBITDA and our reduced debt levels, our secured debt ratio improved to 3.51x as of July 2 compared to 3.70x as of April 2 this year and 3.72x as of October 2, 2009. 
Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million compared to $97 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year-to-date, net capital expenditures total $152 million compared to $247 million last year. While we do anticipate a higher level of spending in the fourth quarter compared to last year, for the full year we expect our net expenditures to remain somewhat below the prior year's level as we continue to be disciplined in managing our use of capital. 
As expected and consistent with historical patterns, working capital was a use of cash for us during the first nine months of our fiscal year. However, we are pleased that our year-to-date working capital performance has exceeded our expectations coming into this year. Overall, our teams are continuing to do a good job in managing our receivables and our days sales outstanding are in line with last year's improved levels. 
While some reinvestment in working capital is required as sales have been slow, we are continuing to maintain a sharp focus on working capital management as we move through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For the year-to-date, we've spent a total of $84 million on acquisitions compared to $135 million in the prior-year period. This year’s spending relates primarily to the acquisition of an Irish facilities management company, which we closed in the first fiscal quarter and funded out of our cash resources at that time. We continue to seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but will continue to be prudent and disciplined in the pursuit of these opportunities. Now let me turn it back to Fred."

Summing up our performance so far this fiscal year, our Food and Support Services businesses improved to deliver positive organic growth and comparable levels of profitability. We’re particularly proud of our teams at the G8 and the G20, who carried off their very complex and intensive operation without a hitch. 
Our Uniform Rental business is performing relatively well in a still-challenging pricing and unemployment environment. We’re also quite pleased with our cash flow performance so far this year, which has exceeded our expectations. As a result of our solid cash flow and outlook for the rest of the year, as Chris just mentioned, we made an optional principal repayment on our term loan in June and we are continuing to be disciplined in our use of capital, both for investment and in working capital management. 
As we look forward, while we continue to expect improving growth rates, the economic environment will continue to challenge certain sectors and countries more than others, although we do anticipate an improving profit trend into Q4 as we complete 2010 and look towards next year. Our portfolio of sectors, geographies and clients continues to provide us with good balance overall, and we remain excited about the growth opportunities and relatively strong pipeline as we look across our businesses.

In today's discussions of results, we mentioned certain non-GAAP financial measures. And as required by SEC rules, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.
Our discussion of adjusted operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going-private transaction, the impact of stock option expense as well as the $34.2 million charge we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reposition our Uniform and Career Apparel segment.

Let me begin by broadly discussing 2010 performance and financial position, then I'll turn the call over to Fred and Chris to detail our operating financial results for the quarter and year end.
I'm pleased to report that during fiscal 2010 we delivered solid results in sales and profits and another year of strong cash flow even within a weak and uncertain economic environment. We also improved our levels of new business and delivered solid client retention. 
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we achieved our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year organic growth rate reversing several quarters of organic declines. While unemployment levels and other factors continue to constrain consumer discretionary spending, in a population-driven growth in sectors, such as business and industry in uniforms, we are beginning to see stability and some pockets of improvements in these businesses. 
We're particularly encouraged by our achievement in new sales and client retention, which we believe present opportunities for additional growth and improvement in the years to come. In 2010, ARAMARK exceeded $1 billion in annualized new sales for the first time in our history, representing a solid increase over 2009 period.
Now turning to client retention. Our overall retention rate of 94% was consistent with our 2009 performance despite challenging retention years in several of our International operations. In fact, our key North American Food and Support Services business delivered solid improvement in retention in 2010 as with our Uniform and Career Apparel segment. So the improvement in new sales level and retention rates achieved in 2010 provide a solid base for us to build upon as we move into 2011, and we'll continue to invest significant resources to strengthen our teams.
Now a few comments on our 2010 financial results. For the full year, sales were $12.6 billion, up 2% from 2009 with flat organic growth for the year, but positive organic growth in both the third and the fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating income for the year was $637 million, flat with 2009, with profit growth in the fourth quarter. 
I'm particularly pleased with our strong cash flow performance in 2010. We generated $370 million of free cash flow before acquisitions, which was well above our internal plan and nearly matched the very strong results we delivered in 2009. I believe that our cash flow performance during the economic challenges of the past two years has demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our financial and business model and the dedication commitment of our owner and managers. 
Our financial performance has allowed us to consistently reduce debt, improve our credit statistics and enable us to reinvest into our businesses in pursuit of growth opportunities. So as we move into 2011, we enjoy a strong and stable capital structure with significant amount of committed liquidity, and we'll continue to manage our capital and liquidity positions in a prudent and thoughtful manner. 
Let me now turn over the call to Fred."

I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance, and then I'll discuss our business segments. As Joe mentioned, we reported fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $3.2 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter and up",1546,"Thanks, Joe. I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance, and then I'll discuss our business segments. 
As Joe mentioned, we reported fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $3.2 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter and up 2% on an organic basis. Our adjusted operating income for the quarter was $176 million, up 4% compared to the year-ago period with no material impact from currency translation on the quarter. For the full year fiscal 2010, we reported sales of $12.6 billion, up 2% over the prior year and flat on an organic basis. Our adjusted operating income for the year was $637 million, flat with 2009, with currency translation adding about one percentage points of profit growth for the year. 
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales were up 3% on both a reported and on an organic growth basis to $2.2 billion. Growth was led by education, business and industry and healthcare sectors, which more than offset a decline in sports and entertainment. For the full year, segment sales were up 3% to $8.6 billion with organic growth of 1%. Full year sales results were led by the performance of our Higher Education and Healthcare businesses.
I'd now like to make a few comments about the major sectors within the North American business. Our business and industry sector had mid single-digit sales increase for the quarter and was flat for the full year. Similar to the third quarter, the sector's results in the fourth quarter benefited somewhat from sales relating to our contract to provide support services for the security detail that served the G-8 and the G-20 meetings in June in North of Toronto. Excluding the impact from this single-event contract, sector growth in the quarter would have been in the low single digits. During the quarter, we did see some improvement in discretionary spending on the part of corporate clients, but we have yet to see an increase in employee population levels at most of our business food service and refreshment services accounts. 
The education sector had a high single-digit growth rate for the quarter and mid single-digit growth rate for the year, with solid base and new business growth in our Higher Education, Food and Facilities business in both periods and with strong new business growth in K-12 food in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with our performance and position in higher education and our team's ability to add value for our clients and customers by delivering our broad product offering of food and facility services. We're also encouraged by the performance of our K-12 business during this past year as it delivered strong new business results and solid retention rates, which positioned us very well going into 2011. Going forward, the education sector overall will remain a key priority for us from a resource and an investment perspective. 
In our healthcare sector, we realized low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid single-digit sales growth for the full year, led by solid new business growth in our clinical Technology Services business as well as base and new business growth in healthcare food. Across our healthcare service portfolio, we continue to see numerous new and base business growth opportunities, and our current new business pipeline is strong. However, in the current economic environment, we have experienced some pressure on Base business as existing healthcare clients attempt to address their own budgetary issues and pressures. 
Our sports and entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales decline, both for the quarter and for the full year, primarily reflecting lower average attendance levels at Major League Baseball games, a lower number of games in the quarter compared to last year and the impact of prior year lost business in the NFL. It is likely that improved consumer confidence in discretionary spending trends will be necessary to drive stronger performance in this sector in 2011 compared to current levels.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was $125 million in the fourth quarter, up 1% from the prior year period. Solid profit growth in business and industry was offset by: a profit decline in sports and entertainment reflecting lower overall attendance, as I mentioned, and consumer spending in stadiums and arenas; base business softness in healthcare and lower education profits, partly due to substantially higher new business startup expenses because of the much higher level of new business signed this year versus last year; and incremental investments in sales resources.
For the full year, segment adjusted operating income was $454 million, up 1% from the prior year, led by solid profit growth at education and good cost control in sports and entertainment, offset by profit declines in business and industry and softness in healthcare profitability. A stronger Canadian dollar contributed about one percentage point of profit growth for the quarter and two points for the full year. In addition, we recognized some severance expense in last year's fourth quarter related to cost reductions within the North American business. As we move to 2011 to support and improved the operating performance, we will continue to take a disciplined look at our cost structure and seek to achieve additional efficiencies and savings when and where we can identify them. 
Now turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $602 million were up 4% on a reported basis. Organic growth was 3% in the quarter, led by Chile and China, offset by weakness in the U.K., Ireland and Korea. For the full year, segment reported sales were up 7% to $2.5 billion. Organic growth was flat, led by strong growth in Chile and China offsetting organic declines in the UK, Ireland and Korea.
Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $20 million, down from $22 million in the prior year quarter, with currency translation accounting for about half of the decline. For the full year, segment adjusted operating income was down 7% to $84 million with currency translation accounting for two points of growth. The decline in operating income for both the quarter and the year was driven primarily by weakness in the U.K. and Ireland. It was only partly offset by solid profit growth in Chile and Japan. 
While the overall economic environment in the U.K. and Ireland will likely remain quite challenging for some time to come, we do anticipate improved financial performance from these countries in fiscal 2011 as we focus on our cost structure and the efficiency of our operations. We have taken some additional actions in our first quarter of fiscal 2011 to further reduce our above unit cost, which will have a negative impact on Q1 but would definitely be positive for the full year.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $371 million were flat from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the segment did show sequential improvement, but the market environment remains extremely price competitive. For the full year, our segment sales of $1.5 billion were down 6% from the prior year on both a reported and on an organic basis. 
As with our business and industry sector clients in Food and Support Services, we have seen stabilization among our Uniform client base. Price competition remains challenging, although we expect to continue to follow a disciplined approach to pricing in order to assure that we continue to sign and retain profitable business. As we move into 2011, our outlook remains cautious, and we await signs of meaningful employment growth among our client base. 
Uniform segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter was $38 million compared to $29 million in the prior year quarter. Strong year-over-year profit performance in the quarter primarily reflects the successful repositioning and integration of the WearGuard Direct Marketing business into the Rental business, which we completed earlier this year, as well as improved performance in our Galls Direct Marketing business and continued solid cost control in our base rental business. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 3% to $130 million, reflecting our cost-reduction efforts across the segment, the end-year benefits from the WearGuard repositioning and integration, lower energy costs and significantly improved year-over-year performance at Galls.
Excluding the items Chris mentioned earlier, corporate expenses were $7 million in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to $6.6 million in the-year ago quarter. For the full fiscal year of 2010, corporate expenses were $29.8 million compared to $31.7 million in the prior year. The full year decrease primarily reflects reduced staff spending. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, we had a very good new sales year and a solid retention year as well. We exceeded $1 billion in annualized new sales and reached our targeted client retention range for the year with a retention rate of 94% across the portfolio of Food, Facilities and Uniform. Given the environment, we were pleased with the levels of base business growth we generated in certain sectors during the year, most notably in our Higher Education business. 
Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the year."

I'd like to now comment on our capital structure and cash flow.

I'd like to now comment on our capital structure and cash flow. For the trailing 12 months ending October 1, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA was $1.036 billion compared to $1.035 billion on October 2, 2009. Interest and other financing costs were $108.7 million for the quarter compared to $108.5 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, interest and other financing costs were $444.5 million compared to $472.3 million in the year ago. 
This year's total includes approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March. Approximately 80% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.6%.  
Total reported debt at the end of the year was $5.402 billion, down from $5.722 billion at the year-end 2009. As of October 1, 2010, our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.569 billion, including an outstanding term loan balance of $3.302 billion. Reflecting our strong free cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, we made an additional $150 million optional term loan principal repayment in September 2010, which brought our total term loan repayments for fiscal of 2010 to $315 million. 
Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $221 million utilized at fiscal year end. We also finished the fiscal year having the full $600 million capacity of our revolving credit facility available to us, in addition to having approximately $70 million in excess cash on hand. As you know, we are in our seasonal working capital of cash use period, so we are utilizing the excess cash in the ordinary course to fund business operations. We are pleased that we reduced our secured debt ratio as of October 1 to 3.37x, down from 3.72x a year ago and down from an initial level of approximately 4.5x when we went private in 2007. 
Net capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2010 were $264 million, down from $330 million in fiscal 2009 as we continue to demonstrate discipline in our deployment of capital. We intend to maintain this disciplined approach during 2011 as we evaluate investment opportunities across our portfolio of businesses, but we do anticipate somewhat of an increase in capital expenditures during the coming fiscal year. 
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter, allowing us to finish the year with strong overall working capital performance. During the year, our teams did an excellent job in managing our receivables, and our days sales outstanding were comparable to the very strong levels achieved in the prior year. Working capital management will continue to be a key focus and priority for us. However, as we look forward, we do anticipate that our working capital performance in 2011 would be more typical of previous years in which working capital is generally a modest use of cash for us during the full year.
As Joe mentioned, free cash flow before acquisitions was very strong as we generated $370 million in free cash flow this year, reflecting in part the results of our CapEx and working capital discipline and performance. This is nearly in line with our very strong results last year, and we are pleased we could deliver this level of performance in the face of a still somewhat challenging overall environment. 
For the full year, we spent a total of $86 million on acquisitions compared to $138 million in the prior year. This year's spending relates primarily to the acquisition of an Irish facilities management company that we closed in the first fiscal quarter and we funded out of our cash resources at that time. We continue to seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we'll be prudent and disciplined in pursuit of those opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call back to Joe."

The Uniform rental business, while challenged by high unemployment, is performing relatively well with improved profit performance from the Uniform segment compared to last year. Importantly, our level of overall new sales has improved, and we delivered solid retention rates across the portfolio. We ended the year with stable capital structure and improving credit profile and plenty of liquidity. 
Today's macro economic environment continues to be somewhat challenging, but we have seen a number of months now of stability in our more cyclical businesses. And we continue to be positive by the overall business mix and our ability to achieve continued growth in sales, in profits and cash flow. 
So 2011, we'll continue to systematically streamline our operations and improve our efficiency through increased standard processes. And more than ever, we are focused on pursuing the many attractive opportunities we see in our less cyclical sectors of education and healthcare as well as growing our existing client service portfolios across all of our businesses and geographies. With the talent and dedication of our teams, the scope and breadth of our services and the fundamental opportunities existing across our portfolio of sectors, we believe that we're well positioned for growth and success in 2011 and beyond.
Let me just conclude by thanking our management teams and our 254,000 employees around the world for their continued commitment to our clients and customers, to our communities and our shareholders. ARAMARK this year will celebrate its 75th anniversary. And the fundamental principles that we were founded on, that is dedication, passion, and commitment to deliver high-quality service and solutions to our clients and always do it with integrity, continue to be the principles which guide us today and underpin our success. I'm proud of the accomplishment of our many people over these 75 years and remain quite optimistic about our future and the many opportunities that lie ahead for us in the future years. 
Thank you, again, for your time this afternoon, your continued support, and we'd be happy to take questions."

Look, I think that with the uncertainty about healthcare reform coming down the road here and the squeeze that's being put on healthcare providers, particularly hospitals, they're trying to reduce their operating costs. And that is both a threat and opportunity for us because obviously, as Chris just mentioned, outsourcing, you really got to look at it by sector. And in the healthcare, I think it's an opportunity for us. In terms of new people, new organizations who are looking to outsource, on the other hand, the ones where we are, they're trying to become more efficient. And more efficient means new processes and reduction in overall cost structures, so that's where we feel the pressure. So I think net-net, we got to adjust, which we are doing at the moment and I think will be a plus for us, but we're going through a transition, which might last another couple of quarters."

I'd like to remind you that any recording or other use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of ARAMARK. 
As we discuss the results, you may want to refer to the Form 8-K we filed earlier today, which contains our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2010 and can be found on our website at www.aramark.com. In today's discussions of results, we mentioned certain non-GAAP financial measures. And as required by SEC rules, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.
Our discussion of adjusted operating income during today's call will, in each instance, exclude the incremental intangibles amortization and property and equipment depreciation expense resulting from the going-private transaction, the impact of stock option expense as well as the $34.2 million charge we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to reposition our Uniform and Career Apparel segment. All of these items are detailed in the schedules posted to our website before this call.
Various remarks that we may make in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts, including remarks about future expectations, anticipation, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements.

Let me begin by broadly discussing 2010 performance and financial position, then I'll turn the call over to Fred and Chris to detail our operat",509,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us as we review our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full year results. Let me begin by broadly discussing 2010 performance and financial position, then I'll turn the call over to Fred and Chris to detail our operating financial results for the quarter and year end.
I'm pleased to report that during fiscal 2010 we delivered solid results in sales and profits and another year of strong cash flow even within a weak and uncertain economic environment. We also improved our levels of new business and delivered solid client retention. 
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we achieved our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year organic growth rate reversing several quarters of organic declines. While unemployment levels and other factors continue to constrain consumer discretionary spending, in a population-driven growth in sectors, such as business and industry in uniforms, we are beginning to see stability and some pockets of improvements in these businesses. 
We're particularly encouraged by our achievement in new sales and client retention, which we believe present opportunities for additional growth and improvement in the years to come. In 2010, ARAMARK exceeded $1 billion in annualized new sales for the first time in our history, representing a solid increase over 2009 period.
Now turning to client retention. Our overall retention rate of 94% was consistent with our 2009 performance despite challenging retention years in several of our International operations. In fact, our key North American Food and Support Services business delivered solid improvement in retention in 2010 as with our Uniform and Career Apparel segment. So the improvement in new sales level and retention rates achieved in 2010 provide a solid base for us to build upon as we move into 2011, and we'll continue to invest significant resources to strengthen our teams.
Now a few comments on our 2010 financial results. For the full year, sales were $12.6 billion, up 2% from 2009 with flat organic growth for the year, but positive organic growth in both the third and the fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating income for the year was $637 million, flat with 2009, with profit growth in the fourth quarter. 
I'm particularly pleased with our strong cash flow performance in 2010. We generated $370 million of free cash flow before acquisitions, which was well above our internal plan and nearly matched the very strong results we delivered in 2009. I believe that our cash flow performance during the economic challenges of the past two years has demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our financial and business model and the dedication commitment of our owner and managers. 
Our financial performance has allowed us to consistently reduce debt, improve our credit statistics and enable us to reinvest into our businesses in pursuit of growth opportunities. So as we move into 2011, we enjoy a strong and stable capital structure with significant amount of committed liquidity, and we'll continue to manage our capital and liquidity positions in a prudent and thoughtful manner. 
Let me now turn over the call to Fred."

I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance, and then I'll discuss our business segments. As Joe mentioned, we reported fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $3.2 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter and up",1546,"Thanks, Joe. I'd like to first take you through our consolidated financial performance, and then I'll discuss our business segments. 
As Joe mentioned, we reported fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $3.2 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter and up 2% on an organic basis. Our adjusted operating income for the quarter was $176 million, up 4% compared to the year-ago period with no material impact from currency translation on the quarter. For the full year fiscal 2010, we reported sales of $12.6 billion, up 2% over the prior year and flat on an organic basis. Our adjusted operating income for the year was $637 million, flat with 2009, with currency translation adding about one percentage points of profit growth for the year. 
Now turning to our North American Food and Support Services segment. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales were up 3% on both a reported and on an organic growth basis to $2.2 billion. Growth was led by education, business and industry and healthcare sectors, which more than offset a decline in sports and entertainment. For the full year, segment sales were up 3% to $8.6 billion with organic growth of 1%. Full year sales results were led by the performance of our Higher Education and Healthcare businesses.
I'd now like to make a few comments about the major sectors within the North American business. Our business and industry sector had mid single-digit sales increase for the quarter and was flat for the full year. Similar to the third quarter, the sector's results in the fourth quarter benefited somewhat from sales relating to our contract to provide support services for the security detail that served the G-8 and the G-20 meetings in June in North of Toronto. Excluding the impact from this single-event contract, sector growth in the quarter would have been in the low single digits. During the quarter, we did see some improvement in discretionary spending on the part of corporate clients, but we have yet to see an increase in employee population levels at most of our business food service and refreshment services accounts. 
The education sector had a high single-digit growth rate for the quarter and mid single-digit growth rate for the year, with solid base and new business growth in our Higher Education, Food and Facilities business in both periods and with strong new business growth in K-12 food in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with our performance and position in higher education and our team's ability to add value for our clients and customers by delivering our broad product offering of food and facility services. We're also encouraged by the performance of our K-12 business during this past year as it delivered strong new business results and solid retention rates, which positioned us very well going into 2011. Going forward, the education sector overall will remain a key priority for us from a resource and an investment perspective. 
In our healthcare sector, we realized low single-digit sales growth for the quarter and mid single-digit sales growth for the full year, led by solid new business growth in our clinical Technology Services business as well as base and new business growth in healthcare food. Across our healthcare service portfolio, we continue to see numerous new and base business growth opportunities, and our current new business pipeline is strong. However, in the current economic environment, we have experienced some pressure on Base business as existing healthcare clients attempt to address their own budgetary issues and pressures. 
Our sports and entertainment sector had a low single-digit sales decline, both for the quarter and for the full year, primarily reflecting lower average attendance levels at Major League Baseball games, a lower number of games in the quarter compared to last year and the impact of prior year lost business in the NFL. It is likely that improved consumer confidence in discretionary spending trends will be necessary to drive stronger performance in this sector in 2011 compared to current levels.
Adjusted operating income in the North American Food and Support Services segment was $125 million in the fourth quarter, up 1% from the prior year period. Solid profit growth in business and industry was offset by: a profit decline in sports and entertainment reflecting lower overall attendance, as I mentioned, and consumer spending in stadiums and arenas; base business softness in healthcare and lower education profits, partly due to substantially higher new business startup expenses because of the much higher level of new business signed this year versus last year; and incremental investments in sales resources.
For the full year, segment adjusted operating income was $454 million, up 1% from the prior year, led by solid profit growth at education and good cost control in sports and entertainment, offset by profit declines in business and industry and softness in healthcare profitability. A stronger Canadian dollar contributed about one percentage point of profit growth for the quarter and two points for the full year. In addition, we recognized some severance expense in last year's fourth quarter related to cost reductions within the North American business. As we move to 2011 to support and improve the operating performance, we will continue to take a disciplined look at our cost structure and seek to achieve additional efficiencies and savings when and where we can identify them. 
Now turning to the International Food and Support Services segment. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $602 million were up 4% on a reported basis. Organic growth was 3% in the quarter, led by Chile and China, offset by weakness in the U.K., Ireland and Korea. For the full year, segment reported sales were up 7% to $2.5 million. Organic growth was flat, led by strong growth in Chile and China offsetting organic declines in the UK, Ireland and Korea.
Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $20 million, down from $22 million in the prior year quarter, with currency translation accounting for about half of the decline. For the full year, segment adjusted operating income was down 7% to $84 million with currency translation accounting for two points of growth. The decline in operating income for both the quarter and the year was driven primarily by weakness in the U.K. and Ireland. It was only partly offset by solid profit growth in Chile and Japan. 
While the overall economic environment in the U.K. and Ireland will likely remain quite challenging for some time to come, we do anticipate improved financial performance from these countries in fiscal 2011 as we focus on our cost structure and the efficiency of our operations. We have taken some additional actions in our first quarter of fiscal 2011 to further reduce our above unit cost, which will have a negative impact on Q1 but would definitely be positive for the full year.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, fiscal 2010 fourth quarter sales of $371 million were flat from the year-ago quarter on both a reported and organic basis. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the segment did show sequential improvement, but the market environment remains extremely price competitive. For the full year, our segment sales of $1.5 billion were down 6% from the prior year on both a reported and on an organic basis. 
As with our business and industry sector clients in Food and Support Services, we have seen stabilization among our Uniform client base. Price competition remains challenging, although we expect to continue to follow a disciplined approach to pricing in order to assure that we continue to sign and retain profitable business. As we move into 2011, our outlook remains cautious, and we await signs of meaningful employment growth among our client base. 
Uniform segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter was $38 million compared to $29 million in the prior year quarter. Strong year-over-year profit performance in the quarter primarily reflects the successful repositioning and integration of the WearGuard Direct Marketing business into the Rental business, which we completed earlier this year, as well as improved performance in our Galls Direct Marketing business and continued solid cost control in our base rental business. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 3% to $130 million, reflecting our cost-reduction efforts across the segment, the end-year benefits from the WearGuard repositioning and integration, lower energy costs and significantly improved year-over-year performance at Galls.
Excluding the items Chris mentioned earlier, corporate expenses were $7 million in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to $6.6 million in the-year ago quarter. For the full fiscal year of 2010, corporate expenses were $29.8 million compared to $31.7 million in the prior year. The full year decrease primarily reflects reduced staff spending. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, we had a very good new sales year and a solid retention year as well. We exceeded $1 billion in annualized new sales and reached our targeted client retention range for the year with a retention rate of 94% across the portfolio of Food, Facilities and Uniform. Given the environment, we were pleased with the levels of base business growth we generated in certain sectors during the year, most notably in our Higher Education business. 
Now let me turn it back to Chris for some additional details on the quarter and on the year."

I'd like to now comment on our capital structure and cash flow.

I'd like to now comment on our capital structure and cash flow. For the trailing 12 months ending October 1, 2010, our adjusted EBITDA was $1.036 billion compared to $1.035 billion on October 2, 2009. Interest and other financing costs were $108.7 million for the quarter compared to $108.5 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, interest and other financing costs were $444.5 million compared to $472.3 million in the year ago. 
This year's total includes approximately $8 million of expenses related to the credit agreement amendment and term loan extension we completed in March. Approximately 80% of our total debt portfolio is at fixed interest rates, and our overall weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6.6%.  
Total reported debt at the end of the year was $5.402 billion, down from $5.722 billion at the year-end 2009. As of October 1, 2010, our secured debt, as defined in our credit agreement, totaled $3.569 billion, including an outstanding term loan balance of $3.302 billion. Reflecting our strong free cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, we made an additional $150 million optional term loan principal repayment in September 2010, which brought our total term loan repayments for fiscal of 2010 to $315 million. 
Our accounts receivable securitization facility had $221 million utilized at fiscal year end. We also finished the fiscal year having the full $600 million capacity of our revolving credit facility available to us, in addition to having approximately $70 million in excess cash on hand. As you know, we are in our seasonal working capital of cash use period, so we are utilizing the excess cash in the ordinary course to fund business operations. We are pleased that we reduced our secured debt ratio as of October 1 to 3.37x, down from 3.72x a year ago and down from an initial level of approximately 4.5x when we went private in 2007. 
Net capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2010 were $264 million, down from $330 million in fiscal 2009 as we continue to demonstrate discipline in our deployment of capital. We intend to maintain this disciplined approach during 2011 as we evaluate investment opportunities across our portfolio of businesses, but we do anticipate somewhat of an increase in capital expenditures during the coming fiscal year. 
Consistent with our expectations and historical patterns, working capital was a significant source of cash for us during the fourth quarter, allowing us to finish the year with strong overall working capital performance. During the year, our teams did an excellent job in managing our receivables, and our days sales outstanding were comparable to the very strong levels achieved in the prior year. Working capital management will continue to be a key focus and priority for us. However, as we look forward, we do anticipate that our working capital performance in 2011 would be more typical of previous years in which working capital is generally a modest use of cash for us during the full year.
As Joe mentioned, free cash flow before acquisitions was very strong as we generated $370 million in free cash flow this year, reflecting in part the results of our CapEx and working capital discipline and performance. This is nearly in line with our very strong results last year, and we are pleased we could deliver this level of performance in the face of a still somewhat challenging overall environment. 
For the full year, we spent a total of $86 million on acquisitions compared to $138 million in the prior year. This year's spending relates primarily to the acquisition of an Irish facilities management company that we closed in the first fiscal quarter and we funded out of our cash resources at that time. We continue to seek to make strategic investments in certain sectors and geographies, but we'll be prudent and disciplined in pursuit of those opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call back to Joe."

The Uniform rental business, while challenged by high unemployment, is performing relatively well with improved profit performance from the Uniform segment compared to last year. Importantly, our level of overall new sales has improved, and we delivered solid retention rates across the portfolio. We ended the year with stable capital structure and improving credit profile and plenty of liquidity. 
Today's macroeconomic environment continues to be somewhat challenging, but we have seen a number of months now of stability in our more cyclical businesses. And we continue to be positive by the overall business mix and our ability to achieve continued growth in sales, in profits and cash flow. 
So 2011, we'll continue to systematically streamline our operations and improve our efficiency through increased standard processes. And more than ever, we are focused on pursuing the many attractive opportunities we see in our less cyclical sectors of education and healthcare as well as growing our existing client service portfolios across all of our businesses and geographies. With the talent and dedication of our teams, the scope and breadth of our services and the fundamental opportunities existing across our portfolio of sectors, we believe that we're well positioned for growth and success in 2011 and beyond.
Let me just conclude by thanking our management teams and our 254,000 employees around the world for their continued commitment to our clients and customers, to our communities and our shareholders. ARAMARK this year will celebrate its 75th anniversary. And the fundamental principles that we were founded on, that is dedication, passion, and commitment to deliver high-quality service and solutions to our clients and always do it with integrity, continue to be the principles which guide us today and underpin our success.

So as those institutions are increasingly stressed in this environment, they are increasingly, at least, contemplating and looking at outsourcing as an opportunity for them to become more efficient."

In terms of new people, new organizations who are looking to outsource, on the other hand, the ones where we are, they're trying to become more efficient.
