Welcome to our discussion of Fortune Brands' fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. Please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including thos",2092,"Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our discussion of Fortune Brands' fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. Please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those listed in the cautionary language at the end of our news release. Our actual results could differ materially from those targeted. This presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measures in our news release or on our website in the supplemental information link to the webcast page.Fortune Brands is emerging from the recession in a strong position, and we closed 2009 with our best quarter of the year. Total sales turned positive in the quarter. Each of our businesses performed above our fourth quarter profit expectations, and we delivered results above the top-end of our full year target ranges for EPS and free cash flow. While consumers remain cautious, particularly when it comes to big-ticket discretionary purchases. We've continued to see stabilization in the home products market. That, combined with the success of our strategic initiatives, helped drive these results.In the quarter, we continue to benefit from our foundation of enduring and trusted brands, combined with our brand-building and new-product initiatives. We're on offense in all of our businesses. We're sharply focusing on outperforming our categories, investing to grow profitable market share and leveraging our lower cost structures.Let me give you a few highlights across the businesses. Total Spirits sales were higher in the quarter. Despite challenges in select international markets, sales benefited from gains for Jim Beam and Maker's Mark in the United States and the weaker U.S. dollar. Our Home and Security business delivered its best performance in eight quarters. Led by a high single-digit sales increased for Moen, and strong double-digit gains for Simonton Windows. Notably, our Home and Security business delivered operating income growth in the fourth quarter.Our Golf business faced the annual impact of lower operating leverage in its seasonally smallest quarter. Even so, double-digit sales increases for Titleist golf balls and FootJoy shoes, along with strong growth in Asia, helped our golf brands outperform the market.Each of our businesses also demonstrated impressive management of cash and working capital. Cash management helped Fortune Brands generate $572 million of free cash in 2008. That's after dividends and capital expenditures. More on our cash story from Craig in a bit.Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the quarter and the year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $11.5 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Results reflected the impact from intangible write-downs and restructured-related charges. Craig will discuss these in a moment. Excluding charges and gains, diluted earnings per shares was $0.66. I'm particularly pleased to report that's up 3% from $0.64 in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported EPS from continuing operations was $1.60, up 55% from a year ago. EPS before charges and gains for 2009 came in at $2.43 versus $3.75 in 2008. On the strength of our fourth quarter, our 2009 results were above the top of our target range of $2.10 to $2.30. Net sales were $1.8 billion, that's up 1%. On a comparable basis, sales for the quarter were off 3%.Comparable is defined as excluding excise taxes, foreign exchange, acquisitions and the impact of required accounting related to the Spirits route-to-market initiatives. Comparable net sales were down 4% in Spirits, up 2% in Golf and down 4% in Home and Security. Full year net sales were $6.69 billion, 12% below a year ago. Sales were also off 12% on a comparable basis. Reported operating income came in at $47 million. On a before charges or gains basis, operating income was $182 million for the quarter. That's down 8%, largely due to lower income in Golf, as well as year-over-year differences in incentive accruals across all of our businesses. Full year operating income was $505 million. OI [operating income] before charges and gains came in at $719 million for 2009.Reviewing our assets-investment returns measures, after-tax returns on net tangible assets before charges and gains was 15%. Working capital efficiency came in at 38%. Asset -- maturing inventories for Spirits WC [working capital] was 20%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 7%, and return on invested capital before charges and gains was 5%.Clearly, 2009 presented us with a very difficult economy. However, I believe our 2009 results demonstrate how the people of Fortune Brands rose to the challenge. First, we've successfully adjusted to the evolving consumer, and competed effectively in the marketplace. Second, we reduced our cost structures, improves productivity and enhanced our supply-chain flexibility. And third, as discussed earlier, we effectively managed our cash, picking the right investments where we needed to, while focusing sharply on our use of working capital and free cash. Together, these strategies have enabled Fortune Brands to emerge from the downturn in a strong position. The success of these initiatives also demonstrates how we're determined to play offense, not defense. Let me dive a little deeper into the initiatives that helped us deliver our results in 2009. As we've indicated before, consumers are very cautious in 2009. Due to safety of [ph] consumers, we saw it is important to invest in brands and products that consumers trust. Develop innovations that deliver tangible benefits and provide choices across various price points. In the spirits industries, consumers shifted more to their purchases from restaurants and bars to retail outlets. In this environment, we focused more of our brand building and promotional investment on initiatives that directly connect with consumers. And that contributed to the long-term equity of our brands. While we held back on brand spend in the first half of the year as we transition our global routes to markets, we boosted brand investments by double digit during the fourth quarter holiday-selling season in the U.S. These investments included a significant focus on the bourbon category, such as television advertising for Jim Beam, which we had not done in previous holiday seasons. Maker's Mark invested in unique holiday-themed sales advertising and high-profile advertising for the new nine-year age supply of Knob Creek bourbon that came online in the fourth quarter. We brought excitement to the market place in 2009 with Spirit [ph] innovations as well. First, the introduction of Red Stag by Jim Beam attracted new consumers to the Bourbon category. Boosted by its unique-flavor profile and the Brands partnership with Kid Rock, Red Stag blew away our forecast and became one of the hottest new Spirits introduction in years. This bourbon-infused with natural black cherry was a winner from the start. We shipped more than 100,000 cases after Red Stag's introduction in May, triple our initial projections. Sauza Margarita-in-a-Box also significantly, outperformed our expectations. Supporting the trend of at-home entertaining, we've extended our line of Cocktail Cubes to include Sauza Strawberry Margaritas and now Cruzan Mojito versions. And we brought innovations to international markets as well with Larios 12 [ph] gin and DYC single malt in Spain, and new RTD [ready-to-drink] products in Australia or Canadian Club RTDs are making impressive strides.Our Spirits business also included a number of steps that brings us closer to customers and consumers. Simplifying our organization, enhancing how we position, activate and sell our brands. We launched our new international route-to-market structure in April when we transition to our new alliance in 24 markets with the Edrington Group. Combined with establishments of our dedicated sales organizations in the U.S., we now directly control 75% of our Spirits sales, up from just 8% in 2008. Our new international alliance also enabled us to bring Teacher's, Laphroaig and Courvoisier brands into the combined distribution portfolio. Internationally, we were also simplified our structure, reducing our number of international business units from four to three by merging two units in one European business unit. In the U.S., we entered into new performance-based contracts with our largest distributors, and we aligned our sales organization by distributor rather than region. And we recently aligned our U.S. businesses into fully-integrated category business teams, each with it's own P&L responsibility. With these initiatives in place, we see excellent prospects elevate our performance in the Spirits market place. In our Home and Security business, we remain proactive in the market place and outperformed the category in 2009. We gained share with successful initiatives, including expanding the customer relations in major home centers, delivering innovations with new coverage [ph] reliance to fill price points, advanced faucet designs made possible by the new compact Moen Duralast cartridge and introduced great securities design like the Master Lock Speed Dial and innovative garage organization products. We're also proud to be industry leader in promoting energy efficiency and green products. Moen offers the most extensive line of eco-friendly faucets and showerheads, carrying the EPA's [Environmental Protection Agency] WaterSense designation. At Simonton Windows brands, in particular, has benefited from the government's consumer-tax credit for purchases of energy-efficiency home products. We have also contributed to the success of the tax credit. In fact, President Obama has personally sought the council, the leader of Simonton business, promoting energy-efficiency, and we are working with the administration and other industry leaders on how to advance conservation and related job creation.We continue to outperform the golf market on the success of our investments into key areas: innovation and international growth. On the innovation front, new product introductions are helping us gain share at the high-end of the market. Pro V1 continues to grow share, as golfers have been unwilling to trade down from urethane cover technology. We'll soon launch the next-generation versions of Titleist NXT, NXT Tour and DT SoLo golf balls. Also to help golfers lower their scores, we'll be conducting the industry's most extensive golfball fitting program in 2010.Titleist clubs continue to gain share and command pricing premium. Sales of Titleist clubs were higher for the year on robust demand for the 909 series drivers, AP1 and AP2 irons, Vokey wedges and Scotty Cameron putters. The new Cobra ZL driver is creating a lot of buzz. The ZL and the Cobra S2 driver that begin shipping this week, both earned Gold Awards on the Golf Digest Hot List for 2010. You'll see an advertising focus on Cobra's real technology on real performance brand promise in 2010. And FootJoy continues to reinforce its industry leadership with innovative products, such as the new ICON and sports shoe line.Internationally, our investments to fuel our growth are paying off. With a strong foundation that includes teaching and educational infrastructure, create offers to very attractive growth prospects in Gulf. Korea consumers are embracing the performance and quality offered by our brands. And we built the markets finest team in the golf industry to drive sustained growth. As a result, we outperformed the market in Korea with sales that grew more than 30% in constant currency in 2009. We're also growing nicely in China off a small base. And at level FX, total sales across Asia and Australia were up at a double-digit rate for the year. To support these growth opportunities, we're currently constructing a new ball plant in Thailand.To help all of our businesses deliver operating margins at the forefront of their categories, we also worked hard in 2009 to improve operations, reduce cost structures and enhance our efficiency and supply chains. In Home and Security, we aggressively have taken cost out of the business. These moves create competitive cost structures. We'll also retain flexibility in our supply chains, so we can ramp up when demand returns. Over the course of the downturn, we reduced the number of positions and facilities in Home and Security by 40%, including seven announced plant closures in 2009. Beam Global has implemented initiatives to enhance organizational efficiency and supply chains, and unlock substantial resources to reinvest in brand growth. This includes a previously announced plan to consolidate U.S. balling [ph] operations, which will result in a closure of a plant next year. In our industry-leading Golf business has also aggressively manage costs, including the closure in 2009 via shoe manufacturing plant, and an overall 13% reduction in total workforce since mid-2008.As we enter 2010, assuming the year unfolds as expected, we expect to ratchet up strategic investments to seize the competitive advantage. The strength and profitability of our brand give us an excellent opportunity to stay on offense in the market place, and invest to build profitable market share. Now here's Craig with a closer look at our markets and the fourth quarter performance for each of our segments."

Starting with Spirits, the Spirits market demonstrated its recession-resistance in 2009 and performed in line with our expectations. We estimate industry volumes and value in the U.S., were each in the range of flat to up 1% for the year, reflecting some degree of trading down and price-promotion activity. Markets outside the U.S. were mixed. Economic weakness continued to create soft-industry conditions in Western Europe, Mexico and global travel retail. Australia, our largest international market, demonstrated low single-digit growth and collectively, the brick markets grew as well. Now let's look at the fourth quarter sales. Spirit sales came in at $746 million, and that's up 3%. Sales were down 4% on a comparable basis and again as always, that excludes the impact of foreign exchange, excise taxes, acquisition divestitures and the impact of required accounting for our route-to-market initiatives. Geographically, comparable net sales were up 4% in the U.S. and down 9%, internationally. Our U.S. results benefited from higher sales of Jim Beam, Maker's Mark and Canadian Club. Outside the U.S., sales declined sharply in Mexico and were lower in Germany and the duty-free channel. Revenues were flat in Spain, the U.K. and Canada and sales were up in constant currency in markets including Australia, India and select Asian markets.At the operating income line, OID [original issue discount] before charges increased 2% to $186 million for the quarter. Turning to the full year, Spirits sales were $2.5 billion, up 1%, and OID before charges was $607 million, down 4%. On a comparable basis, full year sales and OI were off 3% and 4%, respectively. FX adversely impacted OI by $8 million somewhat less than we anticipated, while OI benefited from lower year-over-year brand spend. I would highlight here that brand spend was lower not only for us, but across the industry as well. Consistent with our goal, operating income for the year was relatively flat on an underlying basis.Turning to depletions. Here in the U.S., depletion case volumes were down 2% for the year. Reflecting higher pricing for certain brands, depletion revenues were flat. In markets outside the U.S., full year depletion revenues were off at a high single-digit rate. Our international performance was consistent with the market-specific dynamics we've discussed in prior quarters. Full year volumes were higher in our largest international market, Australia, as well as India and select European markets. Our volumes were flat in Brazil, off slightly in Spain and Canada, lower in Germany and down at a double-digit rate in the U.K., Mexico and duty-free.Looking at full-year performance for our key brands, and as usual, this is on a constant-currency basis and excludes excise taxes. Our industry-leading bourbon portfolio continued to deliver strong results. Global depletion revenues for Jim Beam were up at a low single-digit rate, as the brand benefited from strong pricing in the U.S. where depletion revenues grew 7%. That U.S. performance also reflects favorable mix, driven by Red Stag and growth for Jim Beam Rye.In Australia, volumes for full-strength Jim Beam were up low-single digits, and ready-to-drink products trended favorably toward the end of the year following annualization of the tax increase on RTD Spirits products. In Germany, the number three bourbon market, Jim Beam gained market share for the year. Maker's Mark continued its strong performance in 2009 with double-digit depletion revenue growth in the U.S. and in targeted international markets led by Australia. In tequila, volumes for Sauza were off at a low double-digit rate, due principally to a factor we've discussed before. And that's the high-trade inventories we had in Mexico earlier in the year, as well as the challenging Mexican economy. I'm happy to say that the inventory issue is now behind us and as such, we're targeting improved results in Mexico here in 2010.In the U.S., depletion revenues for Sauza were off at a mid single-digit rate with Hornitos and 3G's relatively flat at the high-end of the category. While Sauza Gold and Blanco were lower, we're encouraged by favorable market share trends for the Gold and Blanco in the fourth quarter. In rum, volumes for Cruzan grew at a double-digit rate on expansion in the duty-free channel. In cordials, continued growth for sours in Europe, partly offset lower volumes for DeKuyper here in the U.S. In the soft Cognac segment, case volumes for Courvoisier were down at a double-digit rate. Even so, depletion revenues were off single digits in the key U.S. and U.K. markets. In the U.K. in particular, where Courvoisier leads the category, the brand increased market share and grew volumes of VSOP to a new high. Canadian whiskey. While case volumes for Canadian Club, were off at a low single-digit rate, depletion revenues were higher in the U.S. and Canada, the brand's two largest markets. Depletion revenues were up at a mid single-digit rate for Canadian Windsor or from Windsor Canadian, which sells nearly a million cases in the U.S. In Scotch, the softness in the U.K. drag results for Teacher's and Laphroaig lower. Laphroaig grew nicely in the U.S. and Teacher's continued its strong growth in India.As we look to 2010 in Spirits, we expect relatively stable market conditions with overall global growth, flat to up 1%. Here in the U.S., we currently believe industry revenues will be similarly flat to up 1%. Internationally, we anticipate continued growth in Australia, as well as growth in the emerging brick markets. At the same time, Europe is likely to be flat to off at a low- to mid single-digit rate, and Canada and Mexico will likely be soft. Against this backdrop, we entered 2010 with a sharply-focused Spirits organization determined to play offense by building our biggest brands, leveraging our routes to market and capitalizing on the best market opportunities.We see excellent opportunities to build on the progress we've made in key areas over the course of 2009. As Bruce mentioned earlier, we believe the front end of a recovery is an excellent time to invest in our brands, and we intend to use cost savings to boost brand investments in Spirits close to a double-digit rate here in 2010. That includes a significant year-over-year increase in the first half. As discussed during the year, we pulled back on Spirits brands spend in the first half of last year, as we completed our international route-to-market transition. As such, given our higher year-over-year brand spend in the first half, along with annualization of our higher route-to-market cost, our year-over-year OI performance will clearly be more challenged in Q1 and Q2. With regard to Spirits operating margins in 2010, we're targeting margins before charges to continue to run in the range of 24%, as we fuel brand investment with cost savings.Now turning to Home and Security. As Bruce said, it was clearly a challenging year for the home products industry, and we estimate home products industry sales decline 20% or so in 2009. That said, we continue to see signs of stabilization. Construction of new homes is starting to bounce back, particularly at the entry level. Inventories are down year-over-year, and housings starts to turn positive in the fourth quarter. Sales of existing homes, which influenced replacement and remodeled projects, have also turned higher year-over-year. Inventory of unsold homes are declining, though foreclosure sales remain a significant piece of housing activity. And lastly, on the R&R front, we estimate R&R spending remain down in the quarter, but it was better than we anticipated.On the downside, the industry is still experiencing the impact of trading down and lower discretionary spending for big-ticket products that particularly impacts cabinetry, which continues to lag the broader market, as many consumers prefer large-scale remodeling projects or pursue more modest kitchen renovations.Turning to our performance, our fourth quarter results reflect not only firmer market conditions, but share gains across our business. Looking back over the year, results for our Home business improved as the year progressed. The business closed the year with its smallest sales decline in the past eight quarters, as Moen and Simonton actually returned to sales growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter sales came in at $824 million off just 3%, as we gain market share in several key categories.  I'm particularly pleased to report that operating income before charges in Home and Security grew in the quarter, up 5% to $43.5 million. OI benefited significantly from our cost reduction and supply-chain improvement initiatives. Drilling down, Moen returned to growth with broad-based sales gains. The number one faucet brand in North America delivered double-digit gains at home centers on the success of new products and expanded offerings across price points. Moen also posted modest gains in the wholesale channel, while delivering robust growth in both China and Canada.  While cabinetry sales were off in the range of 10%, our cabinetry market share trended very favorably in the quarter. Sales growth at home centers and with large builders, partly offset lower sales to kitchen and bath dealers, and wholesalers who serve smaller builders. Simonton Windows continue to drive substantial share gains. Simonton sales were up in the range of 20% on favorable product mix and strong demand for new energy-efficient products, driven to a large degree by the U.S. consumer tax credit. At ThermaTru, sales were off at a low single-digit rate, as home center gains partly offset lower sales in the wholesale channel. Sales of security and storage products were off at a low double-digit rate, reflecting a soft commercial market for security products and weakness at Sears. Even so, Master Lock and Waterloo are both benefiting from new products and expansion into adjacent segments. For the full year, home security sales were $3 billion, down 20% and down 19% on a comparable basis.On a before-charges basis, OI came in at $139 million, that's compared to $348 million in 2008. As we look to 2010, several factors will influence the U.S. home products market. First, replace and remodel is likely to be adversely impacted by continued consumer caution when it comes to big-ticket remodeling projects again, particularly those involving high-end cabinetry. We currently estimate consumer spending on replace, remodel, which we expect will account for about 75% of the market in 2010, will be down in the low to mid single-digit range. Second, we expect new construction, which this year should make up about 25% of the market, will continue to grow in 2010.However that said, much of this growth will involve smaller, value-oriented homes featuring fewer faucets and windows, as well smaller kitchens. As a result, while new home starts may arise in the range of 25%, our current assumption is that spending on home products related to new construction will be up in the range of 20%. Rounding things out, we expect the cabinetry market will be down at a low to mid single-digit rate. While there's a wide range of views, our current assumption is that the home products market, in aggregate, will be flat to up modestly. I would highlight that is up from our estimate of three months ago.Bottom line here, we feel well positioned to continue to outperform the market and gain share. Over the course of the year, we'll benefit from our cost and productivity initiatives, which will help to offset higher commodity costs and strategic investments. Given our market assumption, we currently anticipate full year margins will be flat to up modestly. Here in the first quarter, which as you all know is our seasonally-smallest sales quarter, OI before charges in Home and Security may be negative, but we expect better than last year. Longer-term, we remain confident that this is a business that can get back to margins approaching 15%. Now Golf, where we outperformed a very challenging market in 2009. While participation in golf remain solid in the U.S. over the course of the year, golfers did reduced their overall golf-related spending beyond green fees, the halfway house or discretionary purchases such as game improvement clubs. As we've discussed before, corporate spending on golf declined sharply, adversely impacting our market-leading corporate custom Golfball business. Markets outside the U.S. continue to present our best growth opportunity in golf. While European markets have been relatively stable and we continue to perform well there, we're seizing sustained growth opportunities in Asia, and we're seeing our investments pay off in strong market share gains. All told, we estimate 2009 worldwide golf-equipment spending declined in the range 12% to 15% versus 2008. Our fourth quarter golf sales came in at $227 million, up 7% and up 2% in constant currency. Fourth quarter sales benefited from double-digit gains, increases for golf balls, shoes and gloves. Geographically, constant currency sales increased at a low single-digit rate in the U.S., as well as in international markets. Our international sales benefited from another strong double-digit increase in Korea. While sales were up $15 million over last year, operating income before charges for the fourth quarter was down $8 million from last year's $18 million loss. Two points here. First, the fourth quarter is our seasonally smallest in Golf, and we normally record a loss. Second, with respect to the increased loss, it was a function of negative year-over-year FX hedge gains, our mix of product launches and differences in year-over-year incentive accruals.For the full year, our golf sales were off 11%, and down 7% in constant currency, better than the industry-wide decline. While sales were off in the U.S. more than 10%, our golf sales increased outside the U.S. at a low single-digit rate in constant currency. Our percentage of golf sales from markets outside the U.S. reached 44% here in 2009. Golfball sales were down at a double-digit rate for the year. Excluding the hard-hit corporate customs segment of the ball market, our golfball sales were off single digits.Our Titleist golfball franchise held its own in this environment, performing strongest at the high-end. The market leading Pro V1 gained share in the U.S. in 2009, as consumers remained committed to the Pro V1's urethane cover technology. In club, the Titleist brand modestly increased sales on the benefit of new products, and U.S. share gains in metals, wedges and putters. In fact, our Vokey-design wedge share at on- and off-course U.S. golf shops increased more than 10 points in value in 2009. Sales at Cobra were off at a double-digit rate, as the Game Improvement segment felt the impact of reduced discretionary spend. Sales of FootJoy shoes were off at a single-digit rate for the year. The brand gained momentum as the year progressed, and we believe is well positioned going into 2010. Sales of gloves and accessories were off at a single-digit rate.Moving onto OI, full year operating income before charges in Golf came in at $60 million versus $125 million in 2008, reflecting the impact of the adverse operating leverage of the current tough environment. FX adversely impacted OI by $21 million, and that was in line with our expectations. Looking to 2010, we expect that worldwide spending on golf equipment will be up at a low single-digit rate. Additionally, we entered the year with inventories that are in great shape, both on- and off-course. As the golf industry leader, we'll continue to focus on outperforming the category with trusted brands and powerful innovations, and accelerating our growth initiatives in attractive international markets, particularly in Asia. With regard to margins, our long-term goal for golf continues to be to achieving operating margins in the high single-digit to 10% range. Now before turning things back to Bruce, a few additional items.First, with regard to our positive results and upside to our EPS target, we benefited primarily from four factors in the fourth quarter: one, we gained share on top of a home products market that performed better than expected, Spirits benefited from more favorable FX, our Golf business outperformed in the market and we also benefited modestly from our year-end true-up of effective tax rate. Reviewing charges for the quarter. As we've discussed before, GAAP requires us to annually evaluate goodwill and certain intangibles on a current fair-value basis. During the quarter, we recorded a non-cash after-tax intangible write-down of $67 million, primarily reflecting a mid single-digit industry growth expectation going forward for the Tequila category. We also recorded after-tax restructuring and restructuring-related charges in the quarter of $22 million. These related to cost reductions and supply chain initiatives across all three of our businesses. For the full year, net after-tax restructuring-related charges totaled $72 million, $2 million below the prior year. At the present time, we expect only modest charges in 2010, and they're related to carryover impact of initiatives launched in 2009. With regard to our tax rate, our full year effective rate before charges gains came in at 23%. For 2010, we're still finalizing our numbers. But at the moment, we're looking at a rate in the range of 26% to 27%, largely reflecting the absence of tax-advantage transactions that benefited us in 2009.Turning to cash flow, as Bruce indicated, we generated $572 million in free cash flow in 2009 and that's after CapEx and dividends. Our company-wide cash-management initiatives, as well as the reduction in the dividend, contributed to our strong free cash flow. I would highlight that the $572 million is about $150 million above the target we gave you in October. The improvements came on multiple fronts. First, net income was better than expected. Second, CapEx came in $40 million lower than targeted, and that was due to the timing of payments and select projects that are getting shifted into 2010. Third, our receivable collections were stronger in our new Spirits international route-to-market configuration. And lastly, second-half working capital initiatives came to fruition faster than expected.Going forward, to be consistent with how the majority of the market thinks of free cash flow, we'll present free cash flow as cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures. We will no longer deduct dividends. On that basis, our target for 2010 is $375 million to $475 million, representing an earnings to pre-cash conversion rate of more than 100%. Looking at our balance sheet and financial flexibility and while our focus continues to be on debt paydown, we closed the year in a very strong position. As we've discussed, we generated strong free cash flow. We had two very successful bond issues in June and November. We're in an undrawn  position on our revolver and we continue to be investment-grade rated. We're currently coming down the home stretch regarding renewal of our revolving credit arrangement and we expect to finalize next week. Our new revolver will be $750 million with a three-year term.Lastly, we'll be contributing approximately 1.6 million shares of treasury stock to our defined benefit pension plans next week. We clearly see this as an excellent value for the pension plans. I would highlight that it's also EPS-neutral and will eliminate the need for any further significant funding this year. Now back to Bruce with some final comments."

Our goal in the year ahead are to return to growth in earnings per share before charges and gains, outperform our market and growth in returns and generate strong free cash flow. We've been proactive in the marketplace and also on the cost side throughout the downturn, and we see the front end of the recovery as an excellent time to invest, to fuel further momentum and gain long-term competitive advantage across our businesses. We intend to boost brand building events into 2010 with a level dependent on the extent of the consumer recovery and our earnings growth as the year unfolds.While we are encouraged by the macroeconomic improvement in the fourth quarter, we believe consumers will remain cautious while employment, credit markets, home values and consumer confidence continue to mend. Accordingly, we're currently targeting to deliver EPS before charges and gains for 2010 in the range of $2.30 to $2.80. We begin 2010 with the assumption that the markets for each of our three brand groups will be flat to up at the low single-digit rate. We also expect the higher cost for energy and raw materials will likely offset the expected benefit of foreign exchange.Looking at the first quarter, earnings could be lower year-over-year, reflecting the impact of substantially higher brand investment in Spirits versus the lower level in the quarter of 2009, as well as the final quarter of incremental current costs associated with our international route-to-market transition. Over the longer term, we're strongly positioned to accelerate growth. As we benefit from our attractive consumer categories, powerful brand positions, flexible supply chains and the leverage of our lower cost basis as consumer demand builds. Thank you again for joining us. Now Craig and I will be happy take your questions."

Our actual results could differ materially from those targeted. This presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measures in our news release or on our website in the supplemental information linked to the webcast page.
With strong double-digit growth in sales, operating income and earnings per share Fortune Brands is off to an excellent start in 2010. Our strong first quarter results were driven by the powerful combination of higher volumes and lower costs, as each of our three brand groups outperformed our expectations.
Our sales reflected strong sales gains for spirits and home products brands. These results reflects market share gains, improved consumer markets, rebuilding of inventory by channel partners in certain home products categories, foreign exchange and favorable year-over-year comparisons.
Over the course of the downturn, we focused sharply in positioning Fortune Brands with strong growth, when the economy recovers and those initiatives are clearly paying off. Our innovations and strategic brand investments are helping to fuel top line growth and we’re driving even stronger growth at the bottom line as we leverage our lower cost structures. We’re also pleased that the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter continued to build as we began 2010. 
In the marketplace we’re seeing consumers getting more active, which reinforces our confidence that this is an excellent time to invest in brand growth, and go on offense. Our strategic investments in spirits help drive growth for our brand portfolio in all global regions, including share gains in key markets for brands such as Jim Beam, Maker’s Mark and Sauza.
In home products, better-than-expected remodeling activity, share gains at homecenters, rebuilding of inventories by customers in faucets and doors, and favorable comparisons help drive double-digit sales gains for our cabinetry brands as well as Moen kitchen and bath products, Therma-Tru doors and Simonton windows. In golf, successful new products help drive higher sales for Titleist golf clubs and FootJoy shoes.
Now let’s take a closer look at the numbers for the first quarter. Net income was $72 million or $0.47 per diluted share. We recorded charges in the quarter amounted to $0.02 per share Craig will tough on these little later. Excluding charges and gains diluted earnings per share was $0.49 that does 63% from $0.30 a year ago period.
Net sales were $1.63 billion that’s up 13%, on a comparable basis sales for the quarter were up 7%. Comparable measures exclude excise tax, foreign-exchange acquisitions divestitures and the impact of required accounting for new international spirits distribution structure.
Comparable net sales are up 7% in spirits, up 13% in the Home & Security and off 3% in golf. Reported operating income came in at $156 million. On the before charges and gain basis, operating income was $161 million for the quarter, that’s up 33% largely reflecting strong year-over-year growth on operating income in home and security.
Review our assets in investment return measures, after-tax return our net tangible assets before charges and gains was 15%. Working capital efficiency came in at 37%, asset maturing inventory to spirit, WCE was 20%. Return on equity before charges and gain was 8% and return of invested capital before our charges and gains to 6%.
I mentioned earlier, we’re benefiting from the work we’ve done over the course of the downturn. Let me discuss what I mean. First, during the downturn, we continued to make sensible investments and our trusted brands keep consumers excited. These investments include brand building programs, sustain new product innovation and expanded offering across price points.
We also continued support expansion to adjacent product categories and promising international markets. [During] this quarter success of these initiatives, in 2009 25% of our sales came from parts introduced in just the past three years. The percentage of our sales from markets outside the US continues to grow reaching 33% in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2010, we continued to outperform our markets in Home & Golf, so we begin to see the benefits of our strategy investments in our spirits business.
Combined with our aggressive initiative to reduce cost structures, enhanced supply chain flexibility and manage our cash, these initiatives help Fortune Brands and merge from the recession in a strong position. It positioned us well to drive strong growth as the economy comes back. As we said before, we believe the front-end of our recoveries is a great time to invest in gaining competitive advantage and that’s our approach here in 2010.
We’re planning higher strategic investment of brand building programs, new product innovation in international expansion initiatives in promising markets. Given the signs of increased consumer activity, as well as greater our competency returning to EPS growth in 2010, we are further boosting our strategic investments as we previously indicated we would. When it comes to our source spirits business, we’re increasing strategic brand investment by double-digits in 2010 and that begin in the first quarter.
We are deploying these investments primarily behind our core categories, our biggest brands, new products, and our biggest market opportunities. As part of that, we’re reaching consumers in new ways, in fact 35% of our media spend this year in spirits will be for digital media, up from less than 20% in 2009. That includes our new multimedia partnership with our flagship Jim Beam Brand and ESPN.
This created program is led by The Next Round Served Up by Jim Beam, a First-of-its-Kind Web Series that premiered earlier this month on ESPN.com, SportsCenter and ESPN Radio. It also includes in innovative partnership program launched yesterday with Kid Rock and Atlantic Records, featuring exclusive digital downloads in Kid Rock Music and limited-edition bottles of Jim Beam and Red Stag.
Jim Beam is the first spirits brand to partner with a major record label in this kind of music distribution program and there’s a lot more. This week we launched the First-Ever TV Advertising news for Hornitos Tequila. We’re also recently launched new brand building program behind brand such as the EFFEN Vodka, Cruzan Rum and Canadian Club RTD’s in Australia. Our innovations in spirits are focused around four areas, flavor, convenience, premeditation and value and here some of our innovations.
First, let’s start by Jim Beam, which tripled our expectations in 2009, continues to grow and capture market share. Second, where we launched double aged Jim Beam Black with great new packaging, this is followed up by the soon to be launch Maker’s 46, a much anticipated new expression for Maker’s Mark.
At the value end, we just launched Old Crow Reserve Bourbon and to continue to adjust at out-of-home consumption trend with expanded our successful Cocktail Cube line to improve Cruzan and Margarita, and Strawberry, and Sauza Strawberry Margaritas and finally we’re brining innovations to international markets as well, with new RTD products in Australia and Teacher’s Origin in India. We have a great line of innovations in 2010.
To build wining positions in key markets, we’re leveraging our new sales and distributional organization that we’ve build over to past two years. Let me highlight that the increased cost for our international throughout the market initiatives analyze at the end of the first quarter. Further more, we believe we’re elevating our performance enhancing our prospectus with a more efficient and effective organization.
That includes aligning of our US sales organization by distributor rather than region. Implementation of six focused units, three in the US and three international, and enhancement of our team with the best talent from both inside and outside of the industry. In addition cost savings, and operating efficiencies also helping our growth initiatives are helping few our growth initiatives in spirits.
In home and security products, I’m pleased to say that we haven’t spent the housing recession in hunkered down. We’ve improved in navigating the downturn and aggressive in the positioning ourselves for competitive advantage when conditions improve. We began to see the result of this approach in the fourth quarter of ‘09 and our initiatives delivered again in the first quarter of 2010.
As we’ve discussed before, we’ve been very proactive and taking cost out of our home and security business. By reducing the number of facilities and headcounts by 40% during the downturn and pursuing continues improvement. Today we have a lean cost structure and also a very flexible supply chain.
These moves are clearly paying off in positive operating leverage as volume returns and underscoring our supply chain flexibility, we were pleased lastly week to announce the additional more that 300 jobs over the next three years for the cabinetry plant in North Carolina, due to an upcoming piece of new business.
On the growth side, we’re essentially investing a profitable share gain initiatives, new product innovations and expansion into adjacent international markets. We’re also leveraging our broad product offerings, industry leading lead times and after sales service to expand relationships with key customers and gain profitable market share.
Moen, our largest single brand continues to rollout new products and designs with advance functionality, innovation and eco-performance benefits. New product to helping Moen gain shelf space at home centers and it’s been also return to television advertising in the quarter to reinforce its position as a number one faucet brand in North America.
Internationally, Moen continues to expand in China and lay the foundation for growth in India. Last year alone, Moen opened and renovated more than a 155 showrooms in China and opened its first 40 showrooms in India were also established a new assembly facility. Our cabinetry brands are gaining substantial market shares home centers, where consumers are increasingly making cabinetry purchases.
We’re expanding with these customers by offering new product lines of fill price gaps, valued-added design features and added tools to help kitchen designers of our brands. Meanwhile, we’re seeing aggressive in the dealer channel were we historically have been very strong. Simonton and Therma-Tru are leveraging a vast material in state-of-the-art features to deliver products that combine aesthetic beauty with energy efficiency. 
Simonton in particular has generated strong growth and new job on the back of the U.S tax credit for consumer purchases of energy efficiency home products. Master Lock continues to deliver evolutionary and revolutionary new products, while expanded effectively in adjacent security categories such as electronic security and international markets like Europe, Canada, and Latin America.
In golf, we have the games most trusted brands and we remain focused an outperforming the market thorough innovation and international expansion. We continue to sell at the high end of the market with the success of the industry leading Titleist Pro V1 golf ball and advance performance Titleist golf clubs.
In clubs, demand for the next generation Titleist AP1 and AP2 Irons continues to grow. Our Vokey Design wedges have been significant year-over-year market share and with new advanced performance models like the new California series, Scotty Cameron by Titleist putters are growing share.
In the quarter, we also launched a new Titleist drive in Japan, designed specifically for a Japanese market, which is also a very strong start. On the PGA Tour so far this year Titleist has been the most played in balls, irons, wedges and putter categories and number two brand in drivers. Our golf ball innovations extend across price points and we’ve introduced next generation Titleist NXT, NXT Tour golf balls, as well as the new Titleist DT Solo.
In shoes, the new flagship FootJoy icon is off to an excellent start and new FootJoy sports is bringing excitement to the category. The golf industry is best growth opportunities are in international markets and we’ve been investing successfully to capitalize in these markets. These investments include developing industry leading sales organizations in key market across the Pacific Rim, and the construction with new ball plant to serve these markets. This plan will begin production here in the second quarter.
Our investments have helped to drive our percentage of golf sales from international markets to 47%. One final note in golf, earlier this month we completed the sale of Cobra ball brand to Puma. Divesting the Cobra brand enables us to concentrate our golf investments entirely behind our industry leading Titleist and FootJoy brands. These are trusted brands were encourages the powerful innovation and strong brand equity. We believe Titleist and FootJoy representing our highest return growth opportunities in golf.
To further underscore the strength of the Titleist brand in 2009, Titleist golf clubs sales grew in a global golf market that declined in mid-teen rate. We use the process to pay down debt, which remains a priority for us, naturally that enhances our financial flexibility.
Now here is Craig, with a closer at our market in the first quarter performance for each of our segments.

We entered 2010 with an expectation that the global sprits market would be relatively stable with over all growth in the range of flat to up 1%. We’re happy to say, we’re encouraged by what we saw across our markets in the first quarter. Here in the US, we’re seeing stabilization on premise and favorable consumption trend. We’re also seeing encouraging signs and select international markets including Australia our second largest spirits market.
Now, let’s look at our numbers for the quarter. Spirits sales for the quarter came in at $573 million, up 18%; sales were up 7% on comparable basis and that excludes the impact of foreign exchange, excise taxes, acquisition divestures and the impact of required accounting for our new International Distribution Alliance.
Case volume shipments increased slightly faster than revenues. Also of note various one off benefits including favorable comparison in markets such as Mexico, the U.K. and duty-free and the timing of bulk sales accounted for about half of that 7%. Geographically, comparable net sales for our brands were up 2% in the US and up 15% internationally.
Outside the US, we benefited from strong sales gains in Australia and double-digit increases in markets including the U.K., Canada, Mexico and the collective brick markets. At the operating income line, OI before charges came in at $119 million, down 9%. Lower year-over-year OI margin was a function of several factors.
The impact of the significant double-digit increase in strategic brand investment that we discussed three months ago, our previously announced incremental without the market cost that annualized in the quarter along with related international duties that we now record in sales and adverse foreign exchange as well as some degree of price mix. As a reminder here, we held back on brand spend in the first half of 2009. So our stepped up investment was magnified here in the first quarter, it will also impact Q2.
Looking at the year-to-date performance of our key brands, net sales in constant currency and excluding excise taxes were higher for each of three spirits consumer category that’s up mid-single digit rate for our industry leading Bourbon portfolio, up mid-single digits for mixable, which includes to keel up rum, vodka, gin and Cruzan, and up double-digits for classics which includes our Cognac Canadian from Scotch whisky.
In Bourbon, our flagship Jim Beam brand grew worldwide sales on strong performance in the US including the success of Red Stag in Jim Beam (Inaudible) make us not continued to make strong gains in international markets, including Australia the brand’s largest export market.
Now, Craig post a double-digit gains against a year ago quarter when supply was running short. In our mixable category, Sauza Tequila sales were up at a double-digit rate on a big bounce back in Mexico against any easy comparison, plus growth for Sauza Gold and Blanco in the US.
While our Courvoisier brands sales of Decipher were up modestly in the US while (inaudible) grew at a double-digit rate in Europe and increase in the warm gain share on the US. In the Classics category, sales of Courvoisier were up at a strong double-digit rate on strong growth in Europe, Asia and Global Duty Free. Canadian Club sales were up slightly, Laphroaig Scotch grew sales at a double-digit rate and Teacher’s was higher on strong sales in India and Brazil.
Looking to the rest of the year in spirits, it now appears to global spirits market in 2010, maybe up a point or so better than our earlier expectation of flat to up a percent. As we’ve already shared with you, we believe investing in our brands in 2010, is an excellent opportunity to help drive sustainable profitable long-term growth and the progress we’re making an encouraging market dynamics have reinforced that decision.
Our current outlook is that, brand and strategic investments will be top at a mid-teens rate year-over-year versus the approximately 10% estimate we talked about in January. The incremental spend will go against our digital media efforts, recent innovations that have momentum, and our smaller brands with significant growth potential. That increase level of investment coupled with our current outlook will likely result in margins for 2010 in the range of 23%. I will highlight that that continues to be among the best in the industry that were already getting traction in the marketplace from our initiative’s investments and that we are expecting further returns going forward.
Turning to home and security, we entered the year with an assumption, that the overall home products market would be flat to up modestly, included in that estimate was an assumption that’s pending on replacement model would be down in the low to mid single digit range that spending on new construction would be up about 20% and that’s spending in the cabinet’s market as a big tick at discretionary purchase would lag the market and be down at a low to mid single digit rate.
Although the home product market still faces headwinds, we’re seeing continued signs of stabilization. Spending on replace for model, new construction and cabinetry were all better than we expected in the first quarter. As a result, our current target is based on an assumption that the overall home product market will be up low single digits in 2010 better than we anticipated three months ago. That estimate assumes new construction spending will be up in the range of 15% to 20%, overall replace remodel spending flat to up low single-digits, and as spending for cabinetry will be up low single-digits.
Turning to the numbers, first quarter sales came in at $698 million, up 15% reflecting double-digit increases for cabinetry, office, windows, and doors. The top nine benefited from broad-based share gains, inventory rebuilding by channel partners and faucets and doors and favorable comparison to the results of the year ago quarter.
Operating income before charges grew from negative $23 million a year ago to positive $24 million in the current quarter, that’s the second consecutive quarterly increase in home and security. Our strong OI growth in home and security reflects favorable operating leverage that resulted from higher volumes on top of our significantly lower cost structures.
While we’re obviously pleased that OI leveraged at 50% in the first quarter, that rate reflects cost benefits that are annualizing as the year progresses and flat year-over-year raw material cost. As we highlighted in the press release, raw materials will be a headwind in the coming quarters. Bottom line, the underlying run rate was in the range of 30% inline with our full-year expectation.
Trailing down, sales for Moen increased more than 20% on strong gains for new products at home centers, inventory rebuilding in the wholesale channel and very strong growth in China and Canada. Sales for our cabinetry brands were up at high-teens rate driven by very strong growth from share gains for our differentiated offerings at home centers, strong gains with builders and dealers and the benefit of favorable comparisons.
Sales of windows and doors also increased in the high-teens. Simonton windows continued to benefit from share gains and the federal tax credit for energy-efficient for home purchases. Results for Therma-Tru doors benefited from favorable product mix as demand grew for higher end fiberglass entry doors.
Sales in security and storage products were slightly higher as growth from Master Lock more than offset lower sales by Waterloo organization products. As we look to the balance of the year in home and security despite the stabilization we’ve seen, the home products market still face a headwinds. 
While big ticket remodeling has improved somewhat, we still expect consumers to remain cautious. The new home has being built generally smaller, entry level home, which was fewer faucets and windows and it remains to be seen how foreclosures as well as the expiration of the home buyer tax credit here in the second quarter will impact the market. That said, we were able to out perform the market and gain share in the first quarter and we feel well position to continue our performance. 
Our cost and productivity initiatives are helping us at the bottom line, even as we do strategic investments and face increased cost for commodities such as copper, zinc, steel and transportation. Of note, since our January call each of these commodities is up double-digits. All in, we now anticipate full-year ‘08 margins will be up versus our prior estimate of flat to up modestly.
Moving onto golf, we expect the industry to return to growth in 2010 after a double-digit decline in spending in golf in 2009. Despite, we saw first quarter industry conditions, partially due to lower round of play cause by adverse weather in US warm weather locations. We’re seeing golf consumers responding favorably to new product innovations in advance of the prime playing months as well as growth in key international markets. 
We continue to expect that worldwide spending on golf equipment will be up at a low single-digit rate of the year. Our first quarter Golf sales were $354 million, that’s up 2%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 3% from the year ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of the new Pro V1. Geographically, sales were lower in the US. In the international markets, sales and constant currency were lower in Europe and Japan, but up strongly in Korea the Pac Basin in Latin America.
Operating income in Golf was $44 million, up 27% before charges reflecting the benefit of foreign exchange and successful productivity initiatives. On a product line basis, sales of golf balls were modestly lower due to challenging comparisons to the launch of new Pro V1 models in the year ago quarter as well as again the impact of poor weather on rounds of play.
Worth noting is that while the early months of the year are relatively small, rounds of play in the US were down more than 20% year-to-date through February due to the unusually bad weather. Sales of Titleist golf clubs were up at a mid-single digit rate reflecting strong demand for new Titleist iron models as well as Scotty Cameron putters and the introduction in March of a driver designed specially for the Japanese market.
Sales of FootJoy shoes rose at a double-digit rate on shipments of new icon, sport and eComfort models. FootJoy has gained significant share in the US on and off for our shoe market year-over-year and those gains accelerated in the first quarter. The success of icon and sport is helping drive favorable mix shift.
 
Sales of gloves and accessories also increased at double-digit rate. Looking to 2010, we are very well positioned to reinforce our industry leadership, but a sharp focus on outperforming the industry we’ll continue to invest in our trusted brands, new product innovation and growth initiatives in attractive international markets.
Now before turning things back to Bruce, just a few additional items. Reviewing charges for the quarter, we’ve recorded after-tax restructuring related charges of $3 million or $0.02 per share as it related to previously announced projects in both spirits and home. With regard to our tax rate, our rate came in at $28.3 for the quarter, but approximately two points were attributable to the true up of differ tax related to the recently enacted healthcare bill. We continue to target that our full-year rate will be in a 26% to 27% range.
Turning to cash flow, our target for 2010 remains the $375 million to $475 million and as a remainder, that cash flow from operations let less net capital expenditures. It also excludes the proceeds from the sale of the Cobra golf assets. The target represents and earnings to free cash flow conversion rate of more than a 100%, we’re particularly pleased about that.
Now back to Bruce for some final comments on our 2010 outlook.

They have a still demand in value, and where and how we’re positioned with our brands really placed to that.
I mean we have very trusted brands that basically are a price and price value equation is very competitive and we continued to invest behind these brands and innovation behind them. So we try to keep the consumers in the market very excited. So when you say that, okay, what’s really going to fuel this thing and the downstairs, I think in the US it’s going to be jobs, and people feeling more confident about what’s in their wallet and spend a little bit more aggressively on their home.
There is obviously a pent up demand not only in what they want to do in their home, but also when you just look at the basic math of house information versus housing starts over last couple of years. Is just I believe that people have to feel more comfortable with what’s going to happen in the general economy.
I would also say that, we are growing in the Home business and the Golf business. We’re going into fairly big quarters here the second quarter is the spring selling season for Home as up to start of golf season here. So until we see the second quarter and really see how that plays out, I think that will really solidify more of our components for the year.

I think the raw material piece is a piece that in the first quarter, we really didn’t have much impact it just building over the year. But end demand right now is probably the one that we would like to see a little bit more solidification. Two quarters really now for us hasn’t positive, where we just needed to see more.
Commodities were basically flat for us year-over-year in the first quarter, but looking out to the full-year, our expectation is that raw material costs along with say ocean freight and transportation we’re looking at something that’s going to be in the range of make incrementally say, $50 million or so year-over-year, so that’s to come. When you look at FX the benefit that we derived in the first quarter really represents at current exchange rates about two-thirds of what we are expecting would be the benefit fro the full-year.
So when you look at the numbers for the first quarter, I mean, we’re really, really pleased and I think an evidence is that, we’ve done the right thing to position in the marketplace for growth, we’ve done the right things on a cost structure, but it’s also a quarter where the stars really aligned so I mean back to Bruce’s point, when you look at the spirits market somewhat better than we expected Golf, still expecting up kind of low single digits are so, the really driver here is, what’s going to happen with the consumer in home in terms of purchasing new homes and where they stand with repairing remodeling.

I think everyone, last year in the spirits industry and it’s a generalization obviously, pull back on brand expenses somewhat just to see where the consumers going to be and what was happening. We might have pull back a little bit more mostly because we were going through the international after market change in the first half of the year.
As we even starting to see the stabilization in the market, I’m talking about us now, and to see some of our innovations really start to take hold and some momentum in some particular market. We decided to fuel those. We want to see for example, the Red Stag, it had phenomenal start and can this become a million case brand. Well, let’s go see and let’s funded. So we have energy behind things, we want to puts and continued put money behind and to see how far we can take that and I think that part, what you’re seeing here in the spirits business. We have created some momentums in areas that we want to see how far we can take that.
Regarding the overall margin, again the 23% is higher once in the industry. We are spending against brands that we think growth from market and from a growth and return situation or good return on investment proposition that this meant every brand going to get funded, but once that we think have to most potential to grow in the best returns of the once we’re going to hit on harder.

Obviously that they moved to 23% or 1% or so, it’s a function of the higher brand spend, it’s a function of where we think we are right now in terms of foreign currency benefits.
Then lastly, it turns out that our international duties from the new international structure are coming in and going to be -- it looks like right now higher than we were contemplating and those obviously are in sales, they come out of cost of sales. So there’s no impact that the OI line, but just from the math standpoint it impacts the ROS that we have and so for the foreseeable future given where we are in terms of what we think our opportunities really for reinforcing the longer term sustainable growth.
I would say that margins in the 23% to 24% rate is really will be our run rate, obviously as this thing kind of plains out of the water and we’re moving forward the way we expect to, then we would expect through price mix as well as on leveraging the cost structure to have a further opportunities.

It’s not as robust as maybe it was in ‘07 or ‘06, but it is on the plus and the volumes are very strong too, so the market although it’s only one quarter and you don’t want to get away ahead of ourselves, but the US has responded well.

But just to give you a sense just year-over-year, if you are looking at 20.7 this year against 27, so we got basically six points of spread, which on the face and you should say, my god, what’s going on. But when you start to work your way down FX accounts were probably about 1.5% or so of that, route to market cost along with -- now we’ve got the international duties sort of flowing through sales, but don’t comedown to the OI line, the combination of those two is three points, the brand spend, which for competitive reasons we don’t breakout specifically, but that’s a big part of it.
And then obviously in the quarter we had some degree kind of price mix decline, I mean as you are well aware, last year was a big year for us, in terms of what we were able to do with the price mix, in fact, I think we were ahead of lot of the competition. As we kind of came into the tail end of the year, as Bruce outlined, I mean we had competitors that were taking more aggressive actions, and so in select markets on select products we’ve sharpened our pricing to be sure that where we need to be. So, that’s something that also was a factor here in the first quarter. But, it’s small and as we are outlining, as we look for the full year, our expectation is that the combination of price and mix, and I would say to you that from now, price will be somewhat negative, but that mix will be positive and net of that will be positive for us. So we are not losing lot of sleep over the first quarter at this point, it largely is tracking where we expected to be and as we look to the full year, we are targeting that with the things we’ve just outlined, that we will be in that 23-ish percent range versus the 24% that we outlined in January.

So where then does Cobra fit, then with the success we’ve had in the clubs with Titleist, they reinforced us that may be this asset will probably fit better with someone else. Simultaneously, Puma was looking to get more involved in the Golf business and as you’ve seen them through some of the brand investments there and some of the signage they gone to a little bit in the shoe side, but they had a thirst to get into that space and Puma is a great grand with a very edgy profile and Cobra has got that same type of profile, so it seem to the work from a marriage standpoint.
So that’s basically how it came together, we weren’t necessarily looking to sell it and I think they were looking to get into the space when we sort of assessed everything and it came together.

Please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those listed in the cautionary language at the end of our news release. The actual results could differ materially from those targeted. 
The terms of this presentation also include certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measures in our news release or on our website in the Supplemental Information link to the Webcast pages.
With strong double-digit growth in sales, operating income and earnings per share, Fortune Brands is off to an excellent start in 2010. Our strong first quarter results were driven by the powerful combination of higher volumes and lower costs, as each of our three brand groups outperformed our expectations.
Our sales reflected strong sales gains for our Spirits and Home Products brands. These results reflect market share gains, improved consumer markets, rebuilding of inventory by channel partners in certain Home Products categories, foreign exchange and favorable year-over-year comparisons.
Over the course of the downturn, we focused sharply in positioning Fortune Brands for strong growth when the economy recovers. And those initiatives are clearly paying off. Our innovations and strategic brand investments are helping fuel top line growth. And we're driving even stronger growth at the bottom line as we leverage our lower cost structures. We're also pleased that the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter continued to build as we began 2010.
In the marketplace, we've seen consumers getting more active, which reinforces our confidence that this is an excellent time to invest in brand growth and go on offense. Our strategic investments in Spirits help drive growth for our brand portfolio in all global regions, including share gains in key markets for brands such as Jim Beam, Maker's Mark and Sauza. In Home Products, better-than-expected remodeling activity, shared gains at home centers, rebuilding of inventory by customers in faucets and doors and favorable comparisons helped drive double-digit sales gains for our cabinetry brands as well as Moen kitchen and bath products, ThermaTru doors and Simonton windows. In Golf, successful new products helped drive higher sales for Titleist golf clubs and FootJoy shoes. 
Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the first quarter. Net income was $72 million or $0.47 per diluted share. We recorded charges in the quarter amounting to $0.02 cents per share. Craig will touch on these a little later. Excluding charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.49. That's up 63% from $0.30 in the year-ago period.
Net sales were $1.63 billion; that's up 13%. On a comparable basis, sales from the quarter were up 7%, but the comparable measures exclude excise tax, foreign exchange, acquisition and divestitures, and the impact of required accounting for our new international Spirits distribution structure, comparable net sales were up 7% in Spirits, up 13% in Home and Security and off 3% in Golf. Reported operating income came in at $156 million. On the before-charges-and-gain basis, operating income was $161 million for the quarter. That's up 33%, largely reflecting strong year-over-year growth and operating income in Home and Security.
Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax return on net tangible assets before charges and gains was 15%. Working capital efficiency came in at 37%. Asset-maturing inventories for Spirits WC [working capital] was 20%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%. And return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%.
I mentioned earlier we're benefiting from the work we've done over the course of the downturn. Let me discuss what I mean. First, during the downturn, we continued to make sensible investments, and our trusted brands keep consumers excited. These investments include brand-friendly programs, sustaining new product innovation and expanded offering across price points. We also continue to support expansion to adjacent product categories in promising international markets.
To underscore the success of these initiatives, in 2009, 25% of our sales came from products introduced in just the past three years. The percentage of our sales for markets outside the U.S. continues to grow, reaching 33% in the first quarter. And in the first quarter 2010, we continue to outperform our markets in Home and Golf. And we began to see the benefits of our strategy investments in our Spirits business.
Combined with our aggressive initiative to reduce cost structures, enhance supply chain flexibility and manage our cash, these initiatives helped Fortune Brands emerge from the recession in a strong position. And it positions us well to drive strong growth as the economy comes back.  As we said before, we believe the front end of a recovery is a great time to invest to gain competitive advantage, and that's our approach here in 2010. We're planning higher strategic investment in brand building programs, new product innovation and international expansion initiatives in promising markets.
Given the signs of increased consumer activity as well as greater confidence in returning to EPS growth in 2010, we are further boosting our strategic investments as we previously indicated we would. When it comes to our Spirits business, we're increasing strategic brand investments by double digits in 2010. And that began in the first quarter. We are deploying these investments primarily behind our core categories, our biggest brands, new products and our biggest market opportunities. As part of that, we're reaching consumers in new ways. In fact, 35% of our media spend this year in Spirits will be for digital media, up from less than 20% in 2009. That includes our new multimedia partnership with our flagship Jim Beam brand and ESPN. This creative program is led by, ""The next round -- served up Jim Beam,"" a first-of-its kind web series that premiered earlier this month on ESPN.com, SportsCenter and ESPN Radio.
It also includes an innovative partnership program launched yesterday with Kid Rock and Atlantic Records, featuring exclusive digital downloads of Kid Rock music on limited-edition bottles of Jim Beam and Red Stag. Jim Beam is the first spirits brand to partner with a major record label in this kind of music distribution program. 
And there's a lot more. This week, we launched the first ever key advertising in the U.S. for Hornitos tequila. We also recently launched new brand-building programs behind brands such as EFFEN vodka, Cruzan rum and Canadian Club RTDs [ready-to-drink] in Australia.
Our innovations in Spirits are focused around four areas: flavor, convenience, premiumization and value. And here are some of our innovations: First, Red Stag by Jim Beam, which tripled our expectations in 2009 continues to grow in [Audio Gap]. Second, we relaunched double-aged Jim Beam Black with great new packaging. This is followed up by the soon-to-be-launched Maker's 46, a much-anticipated new expression from Maker's Mark. At the value end, we just launched Old Crow Reserve bourbon. 
And to continue to adjust to the at-home consumption trend, we've expanded our successful Cocktail Cube line to include Cruzan Mojitos and Sauza Strawberry Margaritas. And finally, we're bringing innovation to international markets as well, with new RTD [ready-to-drink] products in Australia and Teacher's Origin in India. We have a great lineup of innovations in 2010.
To build positions in key markets, we're leveraging our new sales and distribution organization that we've built over the past two years. Let me highlight that the increased costs for our international marketing initiatives annualized at the end of the first quarter. Furthermore, we believe we're elevating our performance, enhancing our prospects with a more efficient and effective organization. That includes a winding of our U.S. sales organization by distributor rather than region; implementation of six focused units, three in the U.S. and three international; and enhancement of our team with the best talent from both inside and outside the industry. In addition, cost savings and operating efficiencies are helping fuel our growth initiatives in Spirits. 
In Home and Security products, I'm pleased to say that we haven't spent through the housing recession hunker down. We've been prudent in navigating the downturn and aggressively positioning ourselves for competitive advantage when conditions improve. We began to see the results of this approach in the fourth quarter of '09, and our initiatives delivered again in the first quarter of 2010. As we've discussed before, we've been very proactive in taking costs out our Home and Security business. By reducing the number of facilities and head counts by 40% during the downturn and pursuing continuous improvement, today we have a lean cost structure, but also very flexible supply chain. These moves are clearly paying off in positive operating leverage as volume returns. And underscoring our supply chain flexibility, we were pleased last week to announce the addition of more than 300 jobs over the next three years in our cabinetry plant in North Carolina due to an upcoming piece of new business.
On the growth side, we're essentially investing in profitable share gain initiatives, new product innovations and expansion into adjacent and international markets. We're also leveraging our broad product offerings, industry-leading lead times and after-sales service to expand relationships with key customers and gain profitable market share. 
Moen, our largest single brand, continues to roll out new products and designs with advanced functionality, innovation and eco-performance benefits. New products are helping Moen gain shelf space at home centers. And the brand also returned to television advertising in the quarter to reinforce its position as the number one faucet brand in North America. Internationally, Moen continues to expand in China and lay the foundation for growth in India. Last year alone, Moen opened and renovated more than 165 showrooms in China and opened its first 40 showrooms in India, where it also established a new assembly facility.
Our cabinetry brands are gaining substantial market share at home centers, where consumers are increasingly making cabinetry purchases. We're expanding with these customers by offering new product lines to fill price gaps, value-added design features and added tools to help kitchen designers sell our brands. Meanwhile, we're staying aggressive in the dealer channel, where we historically have been very strong.
Simonton and ThermaTru are leveraging advanced materials and state-of-the-art features to deliver products that combine aesthetic beauty with energy efficiency. Simonton, in particular, has generated strong growth and new jobs on the back of the U.S. tax credit for consumers' purchases of efficiency home products.
Master Lock continues to deliver evolutionary and revolutionary new products, while expanding effectively in adjacent security categories such as electronic security in international markets like Europe, Canada and Latin America.
In Golf, we have the game's most trusted brands, and we remain focused on outperforming the market through innovation and international expansion. We continue to excel at the high end of the market, with the success of the industry-leading Titleist Pro V1 golf ball and advanced performance Titleist golf clubs. In clubs, demand for the next generation Titleist AP1 and AP2 irons continues to grow. Our Vokey design wedges has gained significant year-over-year market share. And with new advanced performance models like the new California series, Scotty Cameron by Titleist putters is growing share. 
In the quarter, we also launched a new Titleist driver in Japan designed specifically for the Japanese market, which is off to a very strong start. On the PGA Tour so far this year, Titleist has been the most played in balls, irons, wedges and putter categories and the number two brand in drivers. Our Golf innovations extend across price points. And we've introduced the next-generation Titleist NXT, NXT Tour golf balls as well as the new Titleist DT SoLo. In shoes, the new flagship FootJoy ICON is off to an excellent start. And the new FootJoy Sport is bringing excitement to the category.
The Golf industry's best growth opportunities are in international markets. And we've been investing successfully to capitalize in these markets. These investments include developing industry-leading sales organizations in key markets across the Pacific Rim and the construction of a new golf plant to serve these markets. This new plant will begin production here in the second quarter. Our investments have helped drive our percentage of golf sales from international markets to 47%. 
One final note in Golf, earlier this month, we completed the sale of Cobra golf brand to Puma. Divesting the Cobra brand enables us to concentrate our golf investments entirely behind our industry-leading Titleist and FootJoy brands. These are trusted brands with heritages of powerful innovation and strong brand equity. We believe Titleist and FootJoy represent our highest return growth opportunities in golf. To further underscore the strength of the Titleist brand in 2009, Titleist golf clubs' sales grew in a golf market that declined at a mid-teen rate.
We used the proceeds to pay down debt, which remained a priority for us. Naturally, it enhances our financial flexibility. Now, here's Craig with a closer look at our market and the first quarter performance for each of our segments."

We're happy to say we're encouraged by what we saw across our marke",1946,"Thanks, Bruce. We'll start with Spirits. We entered 2010 with an expectation that the global spirits markets would be relatively stable, with overall growth in the range of flat to up 1%. We're happy to say we're encouraged by what we saw across our markets in the first quarter. Here in the U.S., we're seeing stabilization on premise and favorable consumption trends. We're also seeing encouraging signs in select international markets, including Australia, our second-largest Spirits market. 
Now, let's look at our numbers for the quarter. Spirit sales for the quarter came in at $573 million, up 18%. Sales were up 7% on a comparable basis. And that excludes the impact of foreign exchange, excise taxes, acquisition/divestitures and the impact of required accounting for our new international distribution alliance. Case volume shipments increased slightly faster than revenues. 
Also of note, various one-off benefits including favorable comparison in markets such as Mexico, the U.K. and duty-free. And the timing of bulk sales accounted for about half of that 7%. Geographically, comparable net sales for our brands were up 2% in the U.S. and up 15% internationally. Outside the U.S., we benefited from strong sales gains in Australia and double-digit increases in markets including the U.K., Canada, Mexico and the collective BRIC markets. 
At the operating income line, OI before charges came in at $119 million, down 9%. Lower year-over-year OI margin was a function of several factors. The impact of the significant double-digit increase in strategic brand investments that we discussed three months ago, our previously announced incremental Route-to-market costs that annualized during the quarter, along with related international duties that we now record in sales and adverse foreign exchange as well as some degree of price mix.
As a reminder here, we held back on brand spend in the first half of 2009. So our stepped-up investment was magnified here in the first quarter. It will also impact Q2. Looking at the year-to-date performance of our key brands, net sales in constant currency and excluding excise taxes were higher for each of our three Spirits' consumer categories. That's up mid-single-digit rate for our industry-leading Bourbon portfolio; up mid-single digits for mixables, which includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordial; and up double digits for classics, which is our cognac, Canadian and Scotch Whiskey. 
In Bourbon, our flagship Jim Beam brand grew worldwide sales on strong performance in the U.S., including the success of Red Stag and Jim Beam Rye. Maker's Mark continued to make strong gains in international markets including Australia, the brand's largest export market. And Knob Creek posted double-digit gains against the year-ago quarter when supply was running short. 
In our Mixable category, Sauza tequila sales were up at a double-digit rate on a big bounce back in Mexico against an easy comparison, plus growth for Sauza Gold and Blanco in the U.S.
For our cordial brands, sales of DeKuyper were up modestly in the U.S., while Sourz grew at a double-digit rate in Europe. And Cruzan rum gained share in the U.S. 
In the Classics category, sales for Courvoisier were up at a strong double-digit rate on strong growth in Europe, Asia and global duty-free. Canadian Club sales were up slightly. Laphroaig Scotch grew sales at a double-digit rate. And Teacher's was higher on strong sales in India and Brazil.
Looking to the rest of the year in Spirits. It now appears the global spirits market in 2010 may be up a point or so better than our earlier expectations of flat to up a percent. As we've already shared with you, we believe investing in our brands in 2010 is an excellent opportunity to help drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth. And the progress we're making and encouraging market dynamics have reinforced that decision.
Our current outlook is that brand and strategic investments will pick up at a mid-teens rate year-over-year versus the approximately 10% estimate we talked about in January. The incremental spend will go against our digital media efforts, recent innovations that have momentum and our smaller brands with significant growth potential. That increased level of investment, coupled with our current outlook, will likely result in margins for 2010 in the range of 23%. I would highlight that, that continues to be among the best in the industry, that we're already getting traction in the marketplace from our initiatives investments, and that we are expecting further returns going forward.
Turning to Home and Security. We entered the year with an assumption that the overall home products market would be flat to up modestly. Included in that estimate was an assumption that spending on replace/remodel would be down in the low to mid-single-digit range, but spending on new construction would be up about 20% and that spending in the cabinets' market, as a big-ticket discretionary purchase, would lag the market and be down at a low to mid-single-digit rate.
Although the home products market still faces headwinds, we are seeing continued signs of stabilization. Spending on replace/remodel, new construction and cabinetry were all better than we expected in the first quarter. As a result, our current target is based on an assumption that the overall home product market will be up low-single digits in 2010, better than we anticipated three months ago. That estimate assumes new construction spending will be up in the range of 15% to 20%, overall replace/remodel spending flat to up to low-single digits and that spending for cabinetry will be off low-single digits.
Turning to the numbers. First quarter sales came in at $698 million, up 15%, reflecting double-digit increases for cabinetry, faucets, windows and doors. The top line benefited from broad-based share gains, inventory rebuilding by channel partners in faucets and doors and favorable comparison to the results of the year-ago quarter. Operating income before charges grew from negative $23 million a year ago to positive $24 million in the current quarter. That's the second consecutive quarterly increase in Home and Security.
Our strong OI growth in Home and Security reflects favorable operating leverage that resulted from higher volumes on top of our significantly lower cost structures. While we're obviously pleased that OI leveraged at 50% in the first quarter, that rate reflects cost benefits that are annualizing as the year progresses and flat year-over-year raw material costs. As we highlighted in the press release, raw materials will be a headwind in the coming quarters.
Bottom line, the underlying run rate was in the range of 30%, in line with our full-year expectations. Drilling down, sales from Moen increased more than 20% on strong gains for new products at home centers, inventory rebuilding in the wholesale channel and very strong growth in China and Canada.
Sales for our cabinetry brands were up at a high-teens rate, driven by very strong growth from share gains for our differentiated offerings at home centers, strong gains with builders and dealers and the benefit of favorable comparison.
Sales of windows and doors also increased in the high teens. Simonton windows continue to benefit from share gains and the federal tax credit for energy-efficient home purchases. Results for ThermaTru doors benefited from favorable product mix, as demand grew for higher-end fiberglass entry doors.
Sales on security and storage products were slightly higher, as growth for Master Lock more than offset lower sales for Waterloo organization products. 
As we look to the balance of the year in Home and Security, despite the stabilization we've seen, the Home Products market still faces headwinds. While big-ticket remodeling has improved somewhat, we still expect consumers to remain cautious. The new homes being built are generally smaller, entry-level homes with fewer faucets and windows. And it remains to be seen how foreclosures, as well as the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit here in the second quarter, will impact the market.
That said, we were able to outperform the market and gain share in the first quarter. And we feel well-positioned to continue outperforming. Our cost and productivity initiatives are helping us at the bottom line, even as we boost strategic investments and face increased cost for commodities such as copper, zinc, steel and transportation. Of note since our January call, each of these commodities is up double digits. All in, we now anticipate full year OI margins will be up a point or so versus our prior estimate of flat to up modestly.
Moving on to Golf. We expect the industry to return to growth in 2010, after a double-digit decline in spending on golf in 2009. Despite soft first quarter industry conditions, partly due to lower rounds of play caused by adverse weather in U.S. warm weather locations, we're seeing golf consumers responding favorably to new product innovations in advance of the prime playing months as well as growth in the international market. 
We continue to expect that worldwide spending on golf equipment will be up at a low single-digit rate for the year. Our first quarter golf sales were $354 million, that's up 2%. On a constant-currency basis, sales were up 3% from the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of the new Pro V1. Geographically, sales were lower in the U.S. In international markets, sales in constant currency were lower in Europe and Japan, but up strongly in Korea, the PAC Basin and Latin America. Operating income in golf was $44 million, up 27% before charges, reflecting the benefit of foreign exchange and successful productivity initiatives.
On a product-line basis, sales of golf balls were modestly lower due to challenging comparisons to the launch of new Pro V1 models in the year-ago quarter; as well as, again, the impact of poor weather on rounds of play. Worth noting is that while the early months of the year are relatively small, rounds of play in the U.S. were down more than 20% year-to-date through February due to the unusually bad weather.
Sales of Titleist golf clubs were up at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting small demand for new Titleist iron models, as well as Scotty Cameron putters and the introduction in March of a driver designed specifically for the Japanese market.
Sales of FootJoy shoes rose at a double-digit rate on shipments of new ICON, Sport and eComfort models. FootJoy has gained significant share in the U.S. on- and off-course shoe market year-over-year, and those gains accelerated in the first quarter. The success of ICON and Sport is helping drive favorable mix shift.
Sale of gloves and accessories also increased at a double-digit rate. Looking to 2010, we are very well-positioned to reinforce our industry leadership. With a sharp focus on outperforming the industry, we'll continue to invest in our trusted brands, new product innovations and growth initiatives in attractive international market.
Now before turning things back to Bruce, just a few additional items. Reviewing charges for the quarter, we recorded after-tax restructuring-related charges of $3 million, or $0.02 per share. That's related to previously announced projects in both Spirits and Home. 
With regard to our tax rate, our rate came in at 28.3% for the quarter, but approximately two points were attributable to the true-up of deferred taxes related to the recently enacted healthcare bill. We continue to target that our full-year rate will be in the 26% to 27% range.
Turning to cash flow. Our target for 2010 remains $375 million to $475 million. And as a reminder, that's cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures. It also excludes the proceeds from the sale of the Cobra golf assets. That target represents an earnings to free cash flow conversion rate of more than 100%. We're particularly pleased about that.
Now back to Bruce for some final comments on our 2010 outlook."

And our first quarter results enhance our confidence in achieving that goal. Earlier this week as a result of our strong first quarter, we raised the bottom end of our earnings target range. We now are targeting to deliver EPS before charges and gains for 2010 in the range of $2.50 to $2.80. That's versus our prior target of $2.30 to $2.80.
As we indicated on Tuesday, we're holding the high end of our range, because there is still uncertainty in global economies, and it remains to be seen how the expiration of the U.S. government's stimulus program will impact home products demand. In addition, raw material costs have increased. The U.S. dollar has strengthened, and as previously indicated, we are increasing high-return strategic investments in our brands to capitalize on the improved consumer environment.
All that said, we feel very well-positioned to deliver improved results. We expect the markets for each of our brand groups will be up at a low single-digit rate for the year.

I mean, we have very trusted brands that basically, the price-value equation is very competitive. And we continue to invest behind these brands and the innovation addition behind. So we try to keep the consumers in the market very excited. So when you say that, you guys say, ""Okay, what's really going to fuel this thing?""

There's obviously a pent-up demand, not only in what they want to do in their home, but also  when you just look at the basic math of housing formations versus housing starts over the last couple of years. It's just, I believe, that people have to feel more comfortable with what's going to happen in the general economy. I would also say that we are going in the Home business and the Golf business, we're going into fairly big quarters here. The second quarter is the spring selling season for home.

So back to Bruce's point, when you look at the Spirits market, somewhat better than we expected; Golf, still expecting up kind of low-single digits or so.

I think everyone last year in the Spirits industry -- and this is a generalization, obviously -- pulled back on brand expense somewhat, just to see where the consumer is going to be and what was happening. We might have pulled back a little bit more, mostly because we were going through the international route, the market change in the first half of the year. And as we then started to see the stabilization of the market -- I'm talking about us now -- and to see some of our innovations really start to take hold and some momentum in some particular markets, we decided to fuel those. We want to see, for example, Red Stag, it had a phenomenal start, and can this become a million-case brand. Well, let's go see and let's fund it. So when we have energy behind things, we want to put and continue to put money behind that to see how far we can take that. And I think that's part of what you're seeing here in the Spirits business. We have created some momentums in areas, and we want to see how far we can take that. Regarding the overall margin, again, the 23% is one of the higher ones in the industry. We are spending against brands that we think, both from a market and from a growth and return situation, are good return on investment propositions. That doesn't mean every brand is going to get funded. But the ones that we think have the most potential to grow and the best returns are the ones we're going to hit on harder."

Obviously, the move to 23%, the 1% or so is a function of the higher brand spend. It's a function of where we think we are right now in terms of foreign currency benefit. And then, lastly, it turns out that our international duties from the new international structure, are coming in and going to be, it looks like right now, higher than we were contemplating. And those obviously are in sales. They come out of cost of sales. So there's no impact at the OI line, but just from the math standpoint, it impacts the ROS that we have. And so, for the foreseeable future, given where we are in terms of what we think are our opportunities really for reinforcing the longer-term sustainable growth, I would say that margins in the 23% to 24% rate is really, will be our run rate.

And the volumes are very strong too. So the market -- although it's only one quarter and we don't want to get way ahead of ourselves -- but the U.S. has responded well.

First of all, I mean, looking at margins in the first quarter of last year of 27%. I mean, that obviously was aberrational, and in part was a function of just the fact that we had held back brand spend. But just to give you a sense just year-over-year, if you're looking at 20.7% this year against 27%, so we got basically six points of spread, which on the face of it, you'd say, ""My God, what's going on?"" But when you start to work your way down, FX accounts for probably about 1.5% or so of that. Route-to-market costs, along with the -- now we've got the international duties that are flowing through sales but don't come down to the OI line, the combination of those two is three points. The brand spend, which for competitive reasons we don't break out specifically nups [ph], that's a big part of it. And then obviously in the quarter, we had some degree of kind of price mix decline. I mean, as you're well aware, last year was a big year for us in terms of what we were able to do with price mix. In fact, I think we were ahead of a lot of the competition. As we kind of came into the tail end of the year, as Bruce outlined, I mean, we had competitors that were taking more aggressive actions. And so in select markets on select products, we've sharpened our pricing to be sure that we're where we need to be. So that's something that also was a factor here in the first quarter. But you know, it's small. And as we're outlining, as we look for the full year, our expectation is that the combination of price and mix -- and I would say to you that for now, price will be somewhat negative, but that mix will be positive. And the net of that will be positive for us. So we're not losing a lot of sleep over the first quarter at this point. It largely is tracking where we expect it to be. And as we look to the full year, we are targeting that with the things we've just outlined, that we will be in that 23-ish % range versus the 24% that we outlined in January."

And it's in the gain-improvement side of the golf business. So a very, very competitive piece of business. When we look at basically, strategically, what we wanted to do with the Golf business and see that the international growth was really the heart of the business, along with the demographics that were happening here in the United States, and you look where the international growth was, predominantly in Asia, where Cobra really has no position. Cobra is strong here in the U.S. and in Europe, but very little position. And the investors we need to really get ahead of that market, we said, ""Can we really build three brands?"" We have two great brands with FootJoy and Titleist. Let's put all our resources behind that. Those have better returns and a better return proposition in those markets. So where then does Cobra fit? Then with the success we've had in the clubs with Titleist, it reinforced that maybe this asset would probably fit better with someone else. Simultaneously, Puma was looking to get more involvement in the golf business. And as I think you've seen them, through some of their just brand investments there and some of the signage, they've gone to a little bit in the shoe side. But they already had a thirst to get into that space. And Puma is a great brand with a very edgy profile. And Cobra's got that same type of profile, so it seemed to work from a marriage standpoint. So that's basically how it came together. We weren't necessarily looking to sell it, and I think they were looking to get into the space. Then we sort of assessed everything and it came together."

With strong double-digit growth in sales, operating income and earnings per share, Fortune Brands is off to an excellent start in 2010. Our strong first quarter results were driven by the powerful combination of higher volumes and lower costs, as each of our three brand groups outperformed our expectations.
Our sales reflected strong sales gains for our Spirits and Home Products brands. These results reflect market share gains, improved consumer markets, rebuilding of inventory by channel partners in certain Home Products categories, foreign exchange and favorable year-over-year comparisons.
Over the course of the downturn, we focused sharply in positioning Fortune Brands for strong growth when the economy recovers. And those initiatives are clearly paying off. Our innovations and strategic brand investments are helping fuel top line growth. And we're driving even stronger growth at the bottom line as we leverage our lower cost structures. We're also pleased that the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter continued to build as we began 2010.
In the marketplace, we've seen consumers getting more active, which reinforces our confidence that this is an excellent time to invest in brand growth and go on offense. Our strategic investments in Spirits help drive growth for our brand portfolio in all global regions, including share gains in key markets for brands such as Jim Beam, Maker's Mark and Sauza. In Home Products, better-than-expected remodeling activity, shared gains at home centers, rebuilding of inventory by customers in faucets and doors and favorable comparisons helped drive double-digit sales gains for our cabinetry brands as well as Moen kitchen and bath products, Therma-Tru doors and Simonton windows. In Golf, successful new products helped drive higher sales for Titleist golf clubs and FootJoy shoes. 
Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the first quarter. Net income was $72 million or $0.47 per diluted share. We recorded charges in the quarter amounting to $0.02 cents per share. Craig will touch on these a little later. Excluding charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.49. That's up 63% from $0.30 in the year-ago period.
Net sales were $1.63 billion; that's up 13%. On a comparable basis, sales from the quarter were up 7%, but the comparable measures exclude excise tax, foreign exchange, acquisition and divestitures, and the impact of required accounting for our new international Spirits distribution structure, comparable net sales were up 7% in Spirits, up 13% in Home and Security and off 3% in Golf. Reported operating income came in at $156 million. On the before-charges-and-gain basis, operating income was $161 million for the quarter. That's up 33%, largely reflecting strong year-over-year growth and operating income in Home and Security.
Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax return on net tangible assets before charges and gains was 15%. Working capital efficiency came in at 37%. Asset-maturing inventories for Spirits WC [working capital] was 20%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%. And return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%.
I mentioned earlier we're benefiting from the work we've done over the course of the downturn. Let me discuss what I mean. First, during the downturn, we continued to make sensible investments, and our trusted brands keep consumers excited. These investments include brand-friendly programs, sustaining new product innovation and expanded offering across price points. We also continue to support expansion to adjacent product categories in promising international markets.
To underscore the success of these initiatives, in 2009, 25% of our sales came from products introduced in just the past three years. The percentage of our sales for markets outside the U.S. continues to grow, reaching 33% in the first quarter. And in the first quarter 2010, we continue to outperform our markets in Home and Golf. And we began to see the benefits of our strategy investments in our Spirits business.
Combined with our aggressive initiative to reduce cost structures, enhance supply chain flexibility and manage our cash, these initiatives helped Fortune Brands emerge from the recession in a strong position. And it positions us well to drive strong growth as the economy comes back.  As we said before, we believe the front end of a recovery is a great time to invest to gain competitive advantage, and that's our approach here in 2010. We're planning higher strategic investment in brand building programs, new product innovation and international expansion initiatives in promising markets.
Given the signs of increased consumer activity as well as greater confidence in returning to EPS growth in 2010, we are further boosting our strategic investments as we previously indicated we would. When it comes to our Spirits business, we're increasing strategic brand investments by double digits in 2010. And that began in the first quarter. We are deploying these investments primarily behind our core categories, our biggest brands, new products and our biggest market opportunities. As part of that, we're reaching consumers in new ways. In fact, 35% of our media spend this year in Spirits will be for digital media, up from less than 20% in 2009. That includes our new multimedia partnership with our flagship Jim Beam brand and ESPN. This creative program is led by, ""The next round -- served up Jim Beam,"" a first-of-its kind web series that premiered earlier this month on ESPN.com, SportsCenter and ESPN Radio.
It also includes an innovative partnership program launched yesterday with Kid Rock and Atlantic Records, featuring exclusive digital downloads of Kid Rock music on limited-edition bottles of Jim Beam and Red Stag. Jim Beam is the first spirits brand to partner with a major record label in this kind of music distribution program. 
And there's a lot more. This week, we launched the first ever key advertising in the U.S. for Hornitos Tequila. We also recently launched new brand-building programs behind brands such as EFFEN vodka, Cruzan rum and Canadian Club RTDs [ready-to-drink] in Australia.
Our innovations in Spirits are focused around four areas: flavor, convenience, premiumization and value. And here are some of our innovations: First, Red Stag by Jim Beam, which tripled our expectations in 2009 continues to grow in [Audio Gap]. Second, we relaunched double-aged Jim Beam Black with great new packaging. This is followed up by the soon-to-be-launched Maker's 46, a much-anticipated new expression from Maker's Mark. At the value end, we just launched Old Crow Reserve bourbon. 
And to continue to adjust to the at-home consumption trend, we've expanded our successful Cocktail Cube line to include Cruzan Mojitos and Sauza Strawberry Margaritas. And finally, we're bringing innovation to international markets as well, with new RTD [ready-to-drink] products in Australia and Teacher's Origin in India. We have a great lineup of innovations in 2010.
To build positions in key markets, we're leveraging our new sales and distribution organization that we've built over the past two years. Let me highlight that the increased costs for our international marketing initiatives annualized at the end of the first quarter. Furthermore, we believe we're elevating our performance, enhancing our prospects with a more efficient and effective organization. That includes a winding of our U.S. sales organization by distributor rather than region; implementation of six focused units, three in the U.S. and three international; and enhancement of our team with the best talent from both inside and outside the industry. In addition, cost savings and operating efficiencies are helping fuel our growth initiatives in Spirits. 
In Home and Security products, I'm pleased to say that we haven't spent through the housing recession hunker down. We've been prudent in navigating the downturn and aggressively positioning ourselves for competitive advantage when conditions improve. We began to see the results of this approach in the fourth quarter of '09, and our initiatives delivered again in the first quarter of 2010. As we've discussed before, we've been very proactive in taking costs out our Home and Security business. By reducing the number of facilities and head counts by 40% during the downturn and pursuing continuous improvement, today we have a lean cost structure, but also very flexible supply chain. These moves are clearly paying off in positive operating leverage as volume returns. And underscoring our supply chain flexibility, we were pleased last week to announce the addition of more than 300 jobs over the next three years in our cabinetry plant in North Carolina due to an upcoming piece of new business.
On the growth side, we're essentially investing in profitable share gain initiatives, new product innovations and expansion into adjacent and international markets. We're also leveraging our broad product offerings, industry-leading lead times and after-sales service to expand relationships with key customers and gain profitable market share. 
Moen, our largest single brand, continues to roll out new products and designs with advanced functionality, innovation and eco-performance benefits. New products are helping Moen gain shelf space at home centers. And the brand also returned to television advertising in the quarter to reinforce its position as the number one faucet brand in North America. Internationally, Moen continues to expand in China and lay the foundation for growth in India. Last year alone, Moen opened and renovated more than 165 showrooms in China and opened its first 40 showrooms in India, where it also established a new assembly facility.
Our cabinetry brands are gaining substantial market share at home centers, where consumers are increasingly making cabinetry purchases. We're expanding with these customers by offering new product lines to fill price gaps, value-added design features and added tools to help kitchen designers sell our brands. Meanwhile, we're staying aggressive in the dealer channel, where we historically have been very strong.
Simonton and Therma-Tru are leveraging advanced materials and state-of-the-art features to deliver products that combine aesthetic beauty with energy efficiency. Simonton, in particular, has generated strong growth and new jobs on the back of the U.S. tax credit for consumers' purchases of efficiency home products.
Master Lock continues to deliver evolutionary and revolutionary new products, while expanding effectively in adjacent security categories such as electronic security in international markets like Europe, Canada and Latin America.
In Golf, we have the game's most trusted brands, and we remain focused on outperforming the market through innovation and international expansion. We continue to excel at the high end of the market, with the success of the industry-leading Titleist Pro V1 golf ball and advanced performance Titleist golf clubs. In clubs, demand for the next generation Titleist AP1 and AP2 irons continues to grow. Our Vokey design wedges has gained significant year-over-year market share. And with new advanced performance models like the new California series, Scotty Cameron by Titleist putters is growing share. 
In the quarter, we also launched a new Titleist driver in Japan designed specifically for the Japanese market, which is off to a very strong start. On the PGA Tour so far this year, Titleist has been the most played in balls, irons, wedges and putter categories and the number two brand in drivers. Our Golf innovations extend across price points. And we've introduced the next-generation Titleist NXT, NXT Tour golf balls as well as the new Titleist DT SoLo. In shoes, the new flagship FootJoy ICON is off to an excellent start. And the new FootJoy Sport is bringing excitement to the category.
The Golf industry's best growth opportunities are in international markets. And we've been investing successfully to capitalize in these markets. These investments include developing industry-leading sales organizations in key markets across the Pacific Rim and the construction of a new golf plant to serve these markets. This new plant will begin production here in the second quarter. Our investments have helped drive our percentage of golf sales from international markets to 47%. 
One final note in Golf, earlier this month, we completed the sale of Cobra golf brand to PUMA. Divesting the Cobra brand enables us to concentrate our golf investments entirely behind our industry-leading Titleist and FootJoy brands. These are trusted brands with heritages of powerful innovation and strong brand equity. We believe Titleist and FootJoy represent our highest return growth opportunities in golf. To further underscore the strength of the Titleist brand in 2009, Titleist golf clubs' sales grew in a golf market that declined at a mid-teen rate.
We used the proceeds to pay down debt, which remained a priority for us. Naturally, it enhances our financial flexibility. Now, here's Craig with a closer look at our market and the first quarter performance for each of our segments."

We entered 2010 with an expectation that the global spirits markets would be relatively stable, with overall growth in the range of flat to up 1%. We're happy to say we're encouraged by what we saw across our markets in the first quarter. Here in the U.S., we're seeing stabilization on premise and favorable consumption trends. We're also seeing encouraging signs in select international markets, including Australia, our second-largest Spirits market. 
Now, let's look at our numbers for the quarter. Spirit sales for the quarter came in at $573 million, up 18%. Sales were up 7% on a comparable basis. And that excludes the impact of foreign exchange, excise taxes, acquisition/divestitures and the impact of required accounting for our new international distribution alliance. Case volume shipments increased slightly faster than revenues. 
Also of note, various one-off benefits including favorable comparison in markets such as Mexico, the U.K. and duty-free. And the timing of bulk sales accounted for about half of that 7%. Geographically, comparable net sales for our brands were up 2% in the U.S. and up 15% internationally. Outside the U.S., we benefited from strong sales gains in Australia and double-digit increases in markets including the U.K., Canada, Mexico and the collective BRIC markets. 
At the operating income line, OI before charges came in at $119 million, down 9%. Lower year-over-year OI margin was a function of several factors. The impact of the significant double-digit increase in strategic brand investments that we discussed three months ago, our previously announced incremental Route-to-market costs that annualized during the quarter, along with related international duties that we now record in sales and adverse foreign exchange as well as some degree of price mix.
As a reminder here, we held back on brand spend in the first half of 2009. So our stepped-up investment was magnified here in the first quarter. It will also impact Q2. Looking at the year-to-date performance of our key brands, net sales in constant currency and excluding excise taxes were higher for each of our three Spirits' consumer categories. That's up mid-single-digit rate for our industry-leading Bourbon portfolio; up mid-single digits for mixables, which includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordial; and up double digits for classics, which is our cognac, Canadian and Scotch Whiskey. 
In Bourbon, our flagship Jim Beam brand grew worldwide sales on strong performance in the U.S., including the success of Red Stag and Jim Beam Rye. Maker's Mark continued to make strong gains in international markets including Australia, the brand's largest export market. And Knob Creek posted double-digit gains against the year-ago quarter when supply was running short. 
In our Mixable category, Sauza tequila sales were up at a double-digit rate on a big bounce back in Mexico against an easy comparison, plus growth for Sauza Gold and Blanco in the U.S.
For our cordial brands, sales of DeKuyper were up modestly in the U.S., while Sourz grew at a double-digit rate in Europe. And Cruzan rum gained share in the U.S. 
In the Classics category, sales for Courvoisier were up at a strong double-digit rate on strong growth in Europe, Asia and global duty-free. Canadian Club sales were up slightly. Laphroaig Scotch grew sales at a double-digit rate. And Teacher's was higher on strong sales in India and Brazil.
Looking to the rest of the year in Spirits. It now appears the global spirits market in 2010 may be up a point or so better than our earlier expectations of flat to up a percent. As we've already shared with you, we believe investing in our brands in 2010 is an excellent opportunity to help drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth. And the progress we're making and encouraging market dynamics have reinforced that decision.
Our current outlook is that brand and strategic investments will pick up at a mid-teens rate year-over-year versus the approximately 10% estimate we talked about in January. The incremental spend will go against our digital media efforts, recent innovations that have momentum and our smaller brands with significant growth potential. That increased level of investment, coupled with our current outlook, will likely result in margins for 2010 in the range of 23%. I would highlight that, that continues to be among the best in the industry, that we're already getting traction in the marketplace from our initiatives investments, and that we are expecting further returns going forward.
Turning to Home and Security. We entered the year with an assumption that the overall home products market would be flat to up modestly. Included in that estimate was an assumption that spending on replace/remodel would be down in the low to mid-single-digit range, but spending on new construction would be up about 20% and that spending in the cabinets' market, as a big-ticket discretionary purchase, would lag the market and be down at a low to mid-single-digit rate.
Although the home products market still faces headwinds, we are seeing continued signs of stabilization. Spending on replace/remodel, new construction and cabinetry were all better than we expected in the first quarter. As a result, our current target is based on an assumption that the overall home product market will be up low-single digits in 2010, better than we anticipated three months ago. That estimate assumes new construction spending will be up in the range of 15% to 20%, overall replace/remodel spending flat to up to low-single digits and that spending for cabinetry will be off low-single digits.
Turning to the numbers. First quarter sales came in at $698 million, up 15%, reflecting double-digit increases for cabinetry, faucets, windows and doors. The top line benefited from broad-based share gains, inventory rebuilding by channel partners in faucets and doors and favorable comparison to the results of the year-ago quarter. Operating income before charges grew from negative $23 million a year ago to positive $24 million in the current quarter. That's the second consecutive quarterly increase in Home and Security.
Our strong OI growth in Home and Security reflects favorable operating leverage that resulted from higher volumes on top of our significantly lower cost structures. While we're obviously pleased that OI leveraged at 50% in the first quarter, that rate reflects cost benefits that are annualizing as the year progresses and flat year-over-year raw material costs. As we highlighted in the press release, raw materials will be a headwind in the coming quarters.
Bottom line, the underlying run rate was in the range of 30%, in line with our full-year expectations. Drilling down, sales from Moen increased more than 20% on strong gains for new products at home centers, inventory rebuilding in the wholesale channel and very strong growth in China and Canada.
Sales for our cabinetry brands were up at a high-teens rate, driven by very strong growth from share gains for our differentiated offerings at home centers, strong gains with builders and dealers and the benefit of favorable comparison.
Sales of windows and doors also increased in the high teens. Simonton windows continue to benefit from share gains and the federal tax credit for energy-efficient home purchases. Results for Therma-Tru doors benefited from favorable product mix, as demand grew for higher-end fiberglass entry doors.
Sales on security and storage products were slightly higher, as growth for Master Lock more than offset lower sales for Waterloo organization products. 
As we look to the balance of the year in Home and Security, despite the stabilization we've seen, the Home Products market still faces headwinds. While big-ticket remodeling has improved somewhat, we still expect consumers to remain cautious. The new homes being built are generally smaller, entry-level homes with fewer faucets and windows. And it remains to be seen how foreclosures, as well as the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit here in the second quarter, will impact the market.
That said, we were able to outperform the market and gain share in the first quarter. And we feel well-positioned to continue outperforming. Our cost and productivity initiatives are helping us at the bottom line, even as we boost strategic investments and face increased cost for commodities such as copper, zinc, steel and transportation. Of note since our January call, each of these commodities is up double digits. All in, we now anticipate full year OI margins will be up a point or so versus our prior estimate of flat to up modestly.
Moving on to Golf. We expect the industry to return to growth in 2010, after a double-digit decline in spending on golf in 2009. Despite soft first quarter industry conditions, partly due to lower rounds of play caused by adverse weather in U.S. warm weather locations, we're seeing golf consumers responding favorably to new product innovations in advance of the prime playing months as well as growth in the international market. 
We continue to expect that worldwide spending on golf equipment will be up at a low single-digit rate for the year. Our first quarter golf sales were $354 million, that's up 2%. On a constant-currency basis, sales were up 3% from the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of the new Pro V1. Geographically, sales were lower in the U.S. In international markets, sales in constant currency were lower in Europe and Japan, but up strongly in Korea, the Pac [Pacific] Basin and Latin America. Operating income in Golf was $44 million, up 27% before charges, reflecting the benefit of foreign exchange and successful productivity initiatives.
On a product-line basis, sales of golf balls were modestly lower due to challenging comparisons to the launch of new Pro V1 models in the year-ago quarter; as well as, again, the impact of poor weather on rounds of play. Worth noting is that while the early months of the year are relatively small, rounds of play in the U.S. were down more than 20% year-to-date through February due to the unusually bad weather.
Sales of Titleist golf clubs were up at a mid single-digit rate, reflecting strong demand for new Titleist iron models, as well as Scotty Cameron putters and the introduction in March of a driver designed specifically for the Japanese market.
Sales of FootJoy shoes rose at a double-digit rate on shipments of new ICON, Sport and eComfort models. FootJoy has gained significant share in the U.S. on- and off-course shoe market year-over-year, and those gains accelerated in the first quarter. The success of ICON and Sport is helping drive favorable mix shift.
Sale of gloves and accessories also increased at a double-digit rate. Looking to 2010, we're very well positioned to reinforce our industry leadership. With a sharp focus on outperforming the industry, we'll continue to invest in our trusted brands, new product innovations and growth initiatives in attractive international market.
Now before turning things back to Bruce, just a few additional items. Reviewing charges for the quarter, we recorded after-tax restructuring-related charges of $3 million, or $0.02 per share. That's related to previously announced projects in both Spirits and Home. 
With regard to our tax rate, our rate came in at 28.3% for the quarter, but approximately two points were attributable to the true-up of deferred taxes related to the recently enacted healthcare bill. We continue to target that our full year rate will be in the 26% to 27% range.
Turning to cash flow. Our target for 2010 remains $375 million to $475 million. And as a reminder, that's cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures. It also excludes the proceeds from the sale of the Cobra golf assets. That target represents an earnings-to-free cash flow conversion rate of more than 100%. We're particularly pleased about that.
Now back to Bruce for some final comments on our 2010 outlook."

And our first quarter results enhance our confidence in achieving that goal. Earlier this week as a result of our strong first quarter, we raised the bottom end of our earnings target range. We now are targeting to deliver EPS before charges and gains for 2010 in the range of $2.50 to $2.80. That's versus our prior target of $2.30 to $2.80.
As we indicated on Tuesday, we're holding the high end of our range, because there is still uncertainty in global economies, and it remains to be seen how the expiration of the U.S. government's stimulus program will impact home products demand. In addition, raw material costs have increased. The U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as previously indicated, we are increasing high-return strategic investments in our brands to capitalize on the improved consumer environment.
All that said, we feel very well positioned to deliver improved results. We expect the markets for each of our brand groups will be up at a low single-digit rate for the year. And we're aiming to outperform our categories, by continuing to invest in our brands and leverage our lower cost structures. 
Thank you again for joining us.  Now Craig and I will be happy to take any questions."

So we try to keep the consumers in the market very excited. So when you say that, you guys say, ""Okay, what's really going to fuel this thing?"" And to answer that, I think in the U.S. it's going to be jobs, jobs and people feeling more confident about what's in their wallet and go out and spend a little bit more aggressively on their home. There's obviously a pent-up demand, not only in what they want to do in their home, but also  when you just look at the basic math of housing formations versus housing starts over the last couple of years. It's just, I believe, that people have to feel more comfortable with what's going to happen in the general economy. I would also say that we are going in the Home business and the Golf business, we're going into fairly big quarters here. The second quarter is the spring selling season for home.

But looking out to the full year and our expectation is that raw material costs along with say ocean freight and transportation, we're looking at something that's going to be in the range of making incrementally say, $50 million or so year-over-year.

I think everyone last year in the Spirits industry -- and this is a generalization, obviously -- pulled back on brand expense somewhat, just to see where the consumer is going to be and what was happening. We might have pulled back a little bit more, mostly because we were going through the international route, the market change in the first half of the year. And as we then started to see the stabilization of the market -- I'm talking about us now -- and to see some of our innovations really start to take hold and some momentum in some particular markets, we decided to fuel those. We want to see, for example, Red Stag, it had a phenomenal start, and can this become a million-case brand. Well, let's go see and let's fund it. So when we have energy behind things, we want to put and continue to put money behind that to see how far we can take that. And I think that's part of what you're seeing here in the Spirits business. We have created some momentums in areas, and we want to see how far we can take that. Regarding the overall margin, again, the 23% is one of the higher ones in the industry. We are spending against brands that we think, both from a market and from a growth and return situation, are good return on investment propositions. That doesn't mean every brand is going to get funded. But the ones that we think have the most potential to grow and the best returns are the ones we're going to hit on harder."

Obviously, the move to 23%, the 1% or so is a function of the higher brand spend. It's a function of where we think we are right now in terms of foreign currency benefit.

And those obviously are in sales. They come out of cost of sales. So there's no impact at the OI line, but just from the math standpoint, it impacts the ROS that we have.

So the price mix piece is both looking at control and yield and it looks pretty healthy again. It's not as robust as maybe it was in '07 or '06, but it's on the plus. And the volumes are very strong too. So the market -- although it's only one quarter and we don't want to get way ahead of ourselves -- but the U.S. has responded well. Now there are other markets that are a lot more challenging. You go to Spain or you go to the U.K., much more challenging markets. And that's really economy-driven. But Australia's healthy, India's very healthy. Those are markets that we're obviously strong in. Mexico is coming back too. Canada has remained strong.

Now, it's been a combinations of a series of strategic moves, including getting a control of our Route to market; getting the brands positioned right from a price-value equation; getting them positioned right to have the right target audience to talk to for these particular brands; and then getting the messages out to them in the right fashion. So this is something, as you know, we've been working on for several years. And we started to see some traction during the Christmas holiday season, and it continued into the first quarter. And , you compound that with some innovation to bring some spark to it, and it really started to work well. Now we have a long way to go. This first quarter is not a big quarter in the Spirits business. And we have very fine-tuned focus. And we hope that this continual investment will purport building these brands and building the equity in these brands. And that will translate eventually into better pricing and to solid growth.

I mean, that obviously was aberrational, and in part was a function of just the fact that we had held back brand spend. But just to give you a sense just year-over-year, if you're looking at 20.7% this year against 27%, so we got basically six points of spread, which on the face of it, you'd say, ""My God, what's going on?"" But when you start to work your way down, FX accounts for probably about 1.5% or so of that. Route-to-market costs, along with the -- now we've got the international duties that are flowing through sales but don't come down to the OI line, the combination of those two is three points. The brand spend, which for competitive reasons we don't break out specifically nups [ph], that's a big part of it. And then obviously in the quarter, we had some degree of kind of price mix decline. I mean, as you're well aware, last year was a big year for us in terms of what we were able to do with price mix. In fact, I think we were ahead of a lot of the competition. As we kind of came into the tail end of the year, as Bruce outlined, I mean, we had competitors that were taking more aggressive actions. And so in select markets on select products, we've sharpened our pricing to be sure that we're where we need to be. So that's something that also was a factor here in the first quarter. But you know, it's small. And as we're outlining, as we look for the full year, our expectation is that the combination of price and mix -- and I would say to you that for now, price will be somewhat negative, but that mix will be positive. And the net of that will be positive for us. So we're not losing a lot of sleep over the first quarter at this point. It largely is tracking where we expect it to be.

It seems like a pretty big amount, especially in light of the fact that it's on products that are maybe 1/3 of your total sales. So I guess I was just wondering, is that inventory, is that the right way to think about it? And is that inventory loading something that will potentially come out of numbers reversed in Q2 through Q4? Or is that sort of permanent in the base?"

And it's in the game improvement side of the Club business. So a very, very competitive piece of business. When we look at basically, strategically, what we wanted to do with the Golf business and see that the international growth was really the heart of the business, along with the demographics that were happening here in the United States, and you look where the international growth was, predominantly in Asia, where Cobra really has no position. Cobra is strong here in the U.S. and in Europe, but very little position. And the investors we need to really get ahead of that market, we said, ""Can we really build three brands?"" We have two great brands with FootJoy and Titleist. Let's put all our resources behind that. Those have better returns and a better return proposition in those markets. So where then does Cobra fit? Then with the success we've had in the clubs with Titleist, it reinforced to us that maybe this asset would probably fit better with someone else. Simultaneously, PUMA was looking to get more involvement in the golf business. And as I think you've seen them, through some of their just brand investments there and some of the signage, they've gone to a little bit in the shoe side. But they already had a thirst to get into that space. And PUMA is a great brand with a very edgy profile. And Cobra's got that same type of profile, so it seemed to work from a marriage standpoint. So that's basically how it came together. We weren't necessarily looking to sell it, and I think they were looking to get into the space. Then we sort of assessed everything and it came together."

Welcome to our discussion of Fortune Brands' Seconds Quarter Results. Please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements.

Please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and include those listed in cautionary language at the end of our news release. Our actual results could differ materially from those targeted. The presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measure in our news release or on our website in the Supplemental Information linked to the webcast page.
Fortune Brands delivered a strong second quarter sales growth and double-digit growth in earnings, and we're on track for a strong full year results. In the quarter, we achieved broad-based share gains and levered well against lower-cost structures. We also benefit from the pull forward of sales by customers in our Home and Spirits segment, as well as favorable comparisons. 
Each of our three brand groups grew sales faster than our markets, delivering operating margins at or near the top of our Consumer segments and outperformed our expectations in the quarter. Fortune Brands is executing well in delivering compelling new products, global expansion initiatives and successful brand investment programs. Our consistently high quality and strong customer service are also helping us expand key customer relationships. 
In Spirits, we grew both net sales and case volumes at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, as brands such as Maker’s Mark bourbon, Courvoisier cognac, Hornitos Tequila, Cruzan Rum and Red Stag by Jim Beam helped fuel growth. 
Our Home and Security brands grew sales at 13%, benefiting from share gains fueled by new products, new offerings across price points and expanded relationships with key customers. Strong growth in international markets in double-digit sales gains for the  Titleist Pro V1 golf ball and FootJoy shoes helped drive our performance in Golf. 
Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the quarter. Net sales were $1.9 billion, that's up 9%. Sales were also 9% on a comparable basis. That measure excludes excise tax, foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. 
By brand group, comparable net sales were up 5% in Spirits, 12% in Home and Security and up 8% in Golf. Let me note that a few factors added to our strong underlying performance in the quarter. These factors included the pull-forward demand for Home products due to the expiration of the U.S. home buyers tax credit and the timing of Spirit orders in various markets.
We estimate that these factors benefited the second quarter at the expenses of the third quarter by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Net income was $227.4 million or $1.48 per diluted share. We recorded a net gain of $0.50 in the quarter, and Craig will touch on the charges and gains a little later. Excluding the charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.98, that's up 40% from $0.70 in the year-ago quarter. 
Reported operating income came in at $273.5 million. On a before-charges-and-gain basis, operating income was $263.7 million for the quarter. That's up 29%, reflecting a strong year-over-year growth in operating income in both Home & Security and Golf. 
Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax return on net tangible assets before charge and gains was 17%. Working capital efficiency came in at 36%. Asset-maturing inventories for our Spirits business, working capital efficiency was 19%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%, and return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%. 
We believe the results we've delivered this year reflect how well Fortune Brands is positioned to compete in the current economic environment. The strategic initiatives we undertook over the past two to three years are helping us to the top line, the bottom line and on our balance sheet. 
During the economic downturn, we focused on the three Cs: the consumer; the costs, our costs; and cash. First, adjusting to the evolving consumer environment, we stay close to our customers and made sensible brand investments leading to share gains. The focus of our investments included brand building programs, new product development and expanded offerings across price points, all aiming at attracting consumers to our brand. We also continue to strategically expand to new markets and segments by investing in adjacent product categories and promising international markets. 
Second, we were proactive on cost and supply chain flexibility. This included accelerating several key productivity initiatives and reducing our manufacturing footprint, especially in home products. These initiatives has helped create favorable operating leverage as volume has returned. At the same time, we've reserved the flexibility to ramp up production as needed to meet future demand. 
And third, we've aggressively managed our cash. Company-wide cash management initiatives, including sharp focus on the use of working capital has helped generate strong free cash flow. These cash initiatives, along with the proceeds from the sale of Cobra and three local spirits brands in Germany, give us greater financial flexibility, enable us to focus our priorities to pay down debt. 
We continue to make sensible strategic investments to build on our strong foundation. Our investments are designed to further build key brands, compete effectively in the global marketplace, ensure we have lean and flexible supply chain and to position each Fortune Brands to outperform our categories over the long haul. 
We're prudently increasing strategic investment in all three of our businesses this year, and as we've discussed before, that includes a double-digit increase behind our highest return to Spirits brand. 
On the growth side, we're continuing to fill out our new product pipeline and pop up innovative new products across our businesses. These includes Spirit innovation, such as the new Fort Maker’s 46 launched just this month, which will add incrementally to Maker’s Mark 2010 volume at a premium price. 
We've also just launched Cruzan 9, an excellent entry into the growing spice rum category, and we're benefiting from launches earlier in the year, such as the expansion of our Cocktail Cube line, new RTD products in Australia, Teacher's Origin in India and the relaunch of Double Aged Jim Beam Black. And of course, there's Red Stag by Jim Beam, which has simply been a home run new product that's bringing new consumers to the bourbon category. Since its introduction in the second quarter of 2009, we've shipped more than 200,000 cases of Red Stag, along with Maker’s Mark, Red Stag has helped fuel our share gains in the U.S. Bourbon segment.
In Home and Security, Moen is feeling growth with both new products in incremental innovations. We've just launched the innovative, first of its kind, Moen Spot Resist finish. And the brand continues to grow with new eco-performance faucets and showerheads. Energy-efficient windows and doors and new cabinetry styles across price points are also adding to our results. 
New products, coupled with our industry-leading lead times and after-sales service are helping us expand relationships with key Home Products customers. As a result, we're getting shelf space, winning new business and taking profitable market share.
In Golf, the new AP2 and AP1 irons are feeling growth for Titleist. And the new ICON and sport lines are driving strong growth and share gains for FootJoy. We've just launched a new Vokey design, WedgeWorks exclusive line, which brings customization to wedges for the first time, and the new Titleist 910 drivers are being validated on tour prior to consumer launch later this year. 
In Japan, we've launched a new premium-priced Titleist driver and a new Golf ball line, specifically, for the Japanese market. And these products are off to an excellent start. Our strategic investments are also helping us expand the promising international markets. As a result, our Spirits brands are demonstrating some of their strongest growth trends in the BRIC countries, including sustained growth in India and a rebound in Russia. 
Moen will more than double its number of show rooms in China this year, and it continues to expand in China, India and Latin America. Moen and Kitchen Craft Cabinets are growing in Canada. Master Lock is gaining in Europe, Latin America and China, and our Golf brands are growing very strongly in the Pacific basin. 
On the brand-building front, we're investing to reach consumers in both new and traditional ways. We're increasingly relying on digital media across all of our brands. For example, in our Spirits brands, we've increased the percentage of media spend dedicated to digital media to about 35%. That's up from less than 20% last year. These investments include Jim Beam program, such as our innovative partnership with ESPN, our Kid Rock Digital Download Program and digital media for Hornitos Tequila. At the same time, we've lost the first-ever TV campaign for Hornitos. We're also seeing favorable brand-health results in response to Jim Beam's return to TV advertising, and Moen return to TV advertising earlier this year to capitalize on the more favorable consumer environment. 
We're also supporting our Golf brands with highly targeted advertising and marketing programs. The development of online communities of brand fans, as well as the industry's most advanced on-course ball fitting program. 
And now moving on to the supply chain organizational initiatives. We've also invested in aligning our organizations and supply chains to win in this marketplace. In Spirits, we created a more effective and efficient organization with six focus units: three in the U.S. and three internationally, as well as a U.S. sales organization aligned by distributor rather than region. At the same time, we're progressing plans to consolidate our U.S. Bally facilities. 
In Home Products, even as we've reduced our manufacturing footprint by about 40% over the course of the downturn, we initiated productivity enhancements, including lean manufacturing processes, product platform simplifications and improved purchasing and sourcing. We've taken a very proactive approach and substantially completed our major restructuring initiatives over a year ago. This has enabled us to focus on growing the top line. As a result of our moves in Home Products, we have lean and flexible supply chain, able to ramp up to meet consumer and in customer demand. 
For example, the expansion of our distributor's assembly model in cabinetry has brought assembly closer to key customers while reducing freight cost. We're pleased that our strategies have given us the flexibility to accommodate multiple recent customer wins in cabinetry and at Moen, and we're adding jobs to support these new programs. 
At our Golf business, cost of productivity initiatives, combined with the success of our trusted brands, has enabled us to deliver industry-leading operating margins. And to support the growth prospects for our Golf business in Asia, we've invested in a new ball plate in Thailand, that has just begun initial production. We've also completed a previously announced sale of the Cobra Golf brand earlier in the quarter. 
Now here's Craig with a closer look at our markets and the second quarter performance for each of our segments."
249999,109085028,70933,"Fortune Brands Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Suntory Global Spirits Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bruce. Now starting with Spirits and the overall market. We continue to expect that the global Spirits market will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Here in the first half, we believe the global market performed slightly better than that",2158,"Thanks, Bruce. Now starting with Spirits and the overall market. We continue to expect that the global Spirits market will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Here in the first half, we believe the global market performed slightly better than that. Here in the U.S. in the first half, the market was up in the range of 2% to 3%, and we've seen some positive signs of consumers returning to the on-premise channel as well as modest return to premiumisation. We believe both bode well for the pricing and mix environment in the future. 
In Europe, the markets in the U.K. and Germany are up about 1%, while Spain is off, but improving. The market is flat in Australia, and we're seeing strong growth in Russia, India and Duty Free. 
Regarding our numbers for the quarter, our Spirits sales for the quarter came in at $631 million, that's up 5% on both a reported and a comparable basis. Our case volumes were similarly up 5%. Our second quarter results benefited from the timing of sales in various markets and higher bulk sales, that together, boosted our Spirits revenue by approximately 2% in the quarter. 
Geographically, comparable net sales for our brands were up low to mid-single digits in the U.S. and up mid-single digits, internationally. Our results outside the U.S. benefited from double-digit sales growth in the U.K., Spain, Germany, India, Brazil, Russia and Duty Free, and that was partly offset by soft results in Australia and Mexico. 
At the operating income line, OI before charges came in at $147 million for the quarter and that's up 4%. On a comparable basis, OI was up at a similar rate. The benefit of bulk sales and favorable manufacturing variances offset both the increased strategic investments we've previously discussed, as well as, targeted price promotions to enhance our long-term competitive position. 
Looking at the performance of our key brands on a year-to-date basis. Net sales in constant currency, and excluding excise taxes, are higher for each of our three Spirits consumer categories. In Bourbon, our industry-leading portfolio is up at a low-single digit range. Strong performance for Jim Beam in the U.S. is largely offsetting soft market conditions in Australia. Red Stag, Jim Beam Black and Jim Beam Rye are all contributing to the brand share gains in the U.S. Maker’s Mark is running solid growth in the U.S. and in promising international markets. And Knob Creek continues to grow at a double-digit rate. I would highlight that's up against supply constraints in the prior year. 
In our mixables category, which includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordials, our sales are up low-single digits. According to the latest Nielsen sell-through data, Sauza is outperforming the competitive U.S. tequila market in both dollars in volume. Cruzan Rum sales are higher as the brand gains momentum and market share in the U.S. EFFEN Vodka and our economy vodkas are performing well. Larios gin is up double digits on strong performance in Spain. And in cordials, DeKuyper sales are off in the U.S. while Sours is up in Europe. 
In the Classics category, which again includes our cognac, Canadian and Scotch whiskeys, our year-to-date net sales are up double digits. Sales of Courvoisier are up at a strong double-digit rate on broad-based growth across key markets, and that includes the U.S., U.K. and Duty Free. Canadian Club sales are up modestly. Strong results in India, Brazil and the U.K. are helping drive double-digit growth for Teacher's Scotch. Sales of Laphroaig are up double-digit rate on strong shipments in the U.S. and the U.K. and Whiskey DYC is up mid-single digits in its core Spain market. 
Looking at the rest of the year in Spirits, and as we've discussed before, we continue to increase brand and strategic investments to help drive profitable growth over the long-term. And we're pleased with the progress we've already made to build momentum behind our brands to innovate and to gain market share. 
That said, while we feel very good about the things we're doing in our Spirits business, second half operating income in Spirits will reflect a hit -- and I'll remind everybody, that's a hit of approximately $10 million to $15 million from FX at current rates. As a result of that adverse FX impact, our OI margins will likely be 50 to 100 basis points below our targeted run rate of approximately 23%. Even so, that continues to put us in the top tier in the industry. 
Turning to Home & Security, we discussed last quarter that we expect that the overall Home products market would be up at a low-single digit rate in 2010, and that remains our expectation. That said, the shape of the market this year is a little different than we originally anticipated. Spending in the Home Products market on replace-remodel and new construction and cabinetry was frankly stronger than we expected in the first half. Given the pull forward in demand due to the expiration of the home buyer tax credit and continuing signs of consumer caution, we believe the markets growth in the second half will be at a more moderate pace than it was in the first. 
Our full year assumptions about the market now reflect new construction spending, up in the range of 10% to 15% with overall replace-remodel spending continue to be flat to up low-single digits and spending for cabinetry off low-single digits. 
Looking at our numbers for the quarter. Home & Security sales came in at $878 million, up a healthy 13%, reflecting better year-over-year market conditions, broad-based share gains and pull forward related to the home buyer tax credit here in the U.S. Operating income before charges in Home and Security was $83 million, and that's up an outstanding 89%. We're pleased that our lower cost structures benefited the bottom line as we leveraged our incremental volume at 38% in the quarter and has now 44% in the first half. 
As we indicated what happened last quarter, we began to see the adverse impact of higher raw material costs in Q2. Here in the back half, higher cost for materials such as brass, zinc and resins, as well as for ocean freight, will be an increasing headwind. 
Drilling down, we drove growth across all of our product platforms. Sales for Moen grew at a strong double-digit rate on broad-based gains across channels including retail, wholesale, accessories and international markets. The number one faucet brand in North America gained share in both the Replace-Remodel and new Construction segments in the quarter. 
Our Cabinet brands continue to outperform the market with high-single digit growth. Cabinet product mix improved, and we saw gains across our customer base, including particularly, robust growth with builders as the market benefited from the home buyer tax credit. 
Sales for our windows and door brands were up at a strong double-digit rate, while Simonton and Therma-Tru benefited from share gains with the consumer tax credit for the purchase of energy-efficient products, particularly, helping Simonton. Sales of security and storage products grew at a mid-single digit rate as Master Lock continue to expand internationally, and water leak grew in the home center channel. 
As we look to the back half of the year at Home & Security, consumers remain cautious, and the strength of the market will depend to a large degree on the face of the overall economic recovery. We'll also be facing more headwinds than we saw in the first half. First, as we called out last quarter, we'll see the impact of the expiration of the U.S. home buyer tax credit, which as we said pulled demand forward into the first half. Second, as I just mentioned, we'll face higher year-over-year cost for commodities and transportation in the second half. Third, we have incremental strategic investments, and that includes cost for displays related to new business we've won that will contribute to results in 2011. And fourth, performance improvement programs will start to annualize in the second half making comparisons more challenging. 
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we'll be comping against Q4 '09, in which operating income actually increased year-over-year against Q4 '08. All that said, the market remains better than it was a year ago, and we still expect the market to be up low-single digits for the year. Even with the diminishing operating leverage here in the second half, we now expect full year OI before charges margins  will be up in the range of two points versus 2009. We also continue to expect that we'll leverage in the range of the 30% for the full year that we outlined before. 
Summing things up in Home & Security, we feel very good about things we're doing in the marketplace and on the supply-chain front, and we feel well positioned to continue outperforming the Home Products market. 
Now looking at Golf, we continue to expect that world-wide spending on Golf equipment will grow at a low-single digit rate for the year. After soft industry conditions in the first quarter, we saw more favorable trends in Q2 as year-over-year industry shipments improved in most product categories. The second quarter is seasonally important in the Golf industry, and we're pleased that we outperformed the category with growth across all product categories and in all major geographies. 
Our reported second quarter Golf sales were $389 million and that's up 6%. On a comparable basis, and constant currency and excluding Cobra, sales were 8% higher. Geographically, our comparable sales were up at a high-single digit rate in both the U.S. and in international markets. 
In constant currency, sales in Europe climbed at a mid-single digit rate, while Japan, Korea and China were all up double digits. Operating income before charges and the gain on the sale of Cobra came in at $54 million, up 29%. OI benefited from favorable product mix, as well as lower cost structures. Sales of Golf balls increase at a high-single digit rate benefiting from double-digit growth for the Titleist Pro V1, as well as shipments of the newly introduced NXT and DT SoLo model. Sales of Titleist clubs were up at a mid single-digit rate on strong acceptance for the new Titleist AP1, AP2, CB and MB iron. 
Let me also note the Titleist has been the most played iron, wedge and putter on the PGA Tour so far this season. And of course, Titleist continues to lead the bulk count across the world-wide professional tours. 
FootJoy is building strong momentum as the brand's footwear sales increase at a double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, benefiting from new sales and models, including the new flagship ICON line, as well as the new Sports Series. Sales of gloves and accessories grew modestly. 
We entered the back half of the year in a very strong position in Golf. We have excellent product in the market, our inventories are in good shape. We're excited about what we have in our new product pipeline, and our international investments are paying off in strong growth. We do see an opportunity to build on our momentum and extend our industry leadership by continuing to invest in our brand building, new product development and international growth initiatives. 
In addition to continuing higher year-over-year investments, let me remind everyone that due to the seasonality of the category, the third quarter is traditionally more challenging, and the fourth quarter historically generates a loss in Golf. Even so, we expect our full year margins in Golf will be a point or so better versus the prior year. 
Now before turning things back to Bruce, a few additional items. Reviewing gains and charges in the quarter, we recorded net structuring and related charges amounting to about $0.01 per share related to completion of previously announced supply chain initiatives. 
On the gain side, a couple of items. The gain on the sale of Cobra amounted to $10 million or $0.07 and a gain of $68 million or $0.44 per share related to favorable settlement of routine income tax audits in the U.S. and Spain. All told, these items add up to a net gain of $0.50 per share in the quarter. 
With regard to our tax rate, we continue to target that our full year rate will be in the 26% to 27% range. And then turning to cash flow, we're now targeting to generate free cash flow in 2010 in the range of $525 million to $600 million. Our target includes our anticipated higher earnings, as well as ongoing cash flow management efforts. The increase from our prior target of $375 million to $475 million reflects the benefit of asset sales. 
As a reminder here, our measure reflects cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures. I'd also note here that the target represents an earnings to free cash flow conversion rate well in excess of 100%. Now back to Bruce."

Looking to the full year for Fortune Brands and consistent with a view we've discussed throughout the year, the face of the economic recovery continues to be gradual and uneven. 
We're pleased with the success of our share gain initiatives and the momentum we built with the new products, new customer business and strong operating leverage. Our strategies are delivering, and we remain confident that Fortune Brands will produce strong earnings growth in 2010. As a result, we plan to continue investing behind our brands, including higher year-over-year support for long-term growth initiatives in the second half of 2010. 
In addition to the pull forward of sales in the second quarter, we anticipate the back half of the year will be impacted by certain headwinds we've previously discussed. Those include higher costs for raw materials and transportation, the stronger U.S. dollar, annualizing cost-savings and increasingly challenging comparison to last year's improving results. However, even with these headwinds, we continue to believe that the markets for each of our three brand groups will grow at a low-single digit rate for the year. 
Factoring in our strong  year-to-date results, as well as the challenging dynamics we anticipate in the second half, we're raising our full year earnings target. We're now targeting that Fortune Brands will deliver diluted earnings per share before charges and gains in the range of $2.60 to $2.94 for 2010. We're aiming to outperform our markets and believe that Fortune Brands is well positioned as we benefit from our strategic investments, share gains, lower cost structures and enhance productivity.

If you look at, probably, the drug channel, Nielsen's there, you'll see that that's a much more promotional in competitive environment. We have also some unusual dynamics there. We've added some distribution on lower mix items, especially in Florida and somewhat in California. Our economy vodkas are becoming a bigger piece of the pie, so a bit of that's mix, more than price, as you look forward. Again, that's about 15% in the market, and in general, that's a much more competitive, those are the bigger boxes. It's really measures Florida, California and a bit of Texas, which in those particular markets we have, the much larger grocery store chains and drug chains.

Obviously last year, I mean we had a very healthy year in terms of the price increases that we took, but as we look at where we are right now, we think that the trade off right now between price and mix is about where we would expect to be and as Bruce just outlined, when you look at where we are globally, our first half volume and value are comparable to each other. Our expectation for the full year, I think as we said on the first quarter call, was that for the full year for us, we'd be down somewhat on price, but that would be offset by mix and the net would be that we'd be up modestly, and that continues to be our expectation."

That gives us good confidence that we can get there. Now we just need the volumes to get up there, but we finished our restructuring about a year ago, and we'll do little things here and there with our major restructuring. And always when you do that, you try and not only take cost out, but you try to build a model for the future. And one of the things that we really focused in on was flexibility, and we did that not only just in how the supply chain and the sales worked, but also in the product platform structure and a design-to-assemble and design-to-manufacture side. So all that is working probably better than expected, but we're staying somewhat on those lines of approaching 15% mostly because there will be some investments, and along the way, we do need to scale up both on human side.

Welcome to our discussion of Fortune Brands' Seconds Quarter Results. Please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements.

Please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and include those listed in cautionary language at the end of our news release. Our actual results could differ materially from those targeted. The presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measure in our news release or on our website in the Supplemental Information linked to the webcast page.
Fortune Brands delivered a strong second quarter sales growth and double-digit growth in earnings, and we're on track for a strong full year results. In the quarter, we achieved broad-based share gains and levered well against lower-cost structures. We also benefit from the pull forward of sales by customers in our Home and Spirits segment, as well as favorable comparisons. 
Each of our three brand groups grew sales faster than our markets, delivering operating margins at or near the top of our Consumer segments and outperformed our expectations in the quarter. Fortune Brands is executing well in delivering compelling new products, global expansion initiatives and successful brand investment programs. Our consistently high quality and strong customer service are also helping us expand key customer relationships. 
In Spirits, we grew both net sales and case volumes at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, as brands such as Maker’s Mark bourbon, Courvoisier cognac, Hornitos Tequila, Cruzan Rum and Red Stag by Jim Beam helped fuel growth. 
Our Home and Security brands grew sales at 13%, benefiting from share gains fueled by new products, new offerings across price points and expanded relationships with key customers. Strong growth in international markets in double-digit sales gains for the  Titleist Pro V1 golf ball and FootJoy shoes helped drive our performance in Golf. 
Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the quarter. Net sales were $1.9 billion, that's up 9%. Sales were also 9% on a comparable basis. That measure excludes excise tax, foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. 
By brand group, comparable net sales were up 5% in Spirits, 12% in Home and Security and up 8% in Golf. Let me note that a few factors added to our strong underlying performance in the quarter. These factors included the pull-forward demand for Home products due to the expiration of the U.S. home buyers tax credit and the timing of Spirit orders in various markets.
We estimate that these factors benefited the second quarter at the expenses of the third quarter by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Net income was $227.4 million or $1.48 per diluted share. We recorded a net gain of $0.50 in the quarter, and Craig will touch on the charges and gains a little later. Excluding the charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.98, that's up 40% from $0.70 in the year-ago quarter. 
Reported operating income came in at $273.5 million. On a before-charges-and-gain basis, operating income was $263.7 million for the quarter. That's up 29%, reflecting a strong year-over-year growth in operating income in both Home & Security and Golf. 
Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax return on net tangible assets before charge and gains was 17%. Working capital efficiency came in at 36%. Asset-maturing inventories for our Spirits business, working capital efficiency was 19%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%, and return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%. 
We believe the results we've delivered this year reflect how well Fortune Brands is positioned to compete in the current economic environment. The strategic initiatives we undertook over the past two to three years are helping us to the top line, the bottom line and on our balance sheet. 
During the economic downturn, we focused on the three Cs: the consumer; the costs, our costs; and cash. First, adjusting to the evolving consumer environment, we stay close to our customers and made sensible brand investments leading to share gains. The focus of our investments included brand building programs, new product development and expanded offerings across price points, all aiming at attracting consumers to our brand. We also continue to strategically expand to new markets and segments by investing in adjacent product categories and promising international markets. 
Second, we were proactive on cost and supply chain flexibility. This included accelerating several key productivity initiatives and reducing our manufacturing footprint, especially in home products. These initiatives has helped create favorable operating leverage as volume has returned. At the same time, we've reserved the flexibility to ramp up production as needed to meet future demand. 
And third, we've aggressively managed our cash. Company-wide cash management initiatives, including sharp focus on the use of working capital has helped generate strong free cash flow. These cash initiatives, along with the proceeds from the sale of Cobra and three local spirits brands in Germany, give us greater financial flexibility, enable us to focus our priorities to pay down debt. 
We continue to make sensible strategic investments to build on our strong foundation. Our investments are designed to further build key brands, compete effectively in the global marketplace, ensure we have lean and flexible supply chain and to position each Fortune Brands to outperform our categories over the long haul. 
We're prudently increasing strategic investment in all three of our businesses this year, and as we've discussed before, that includes a double-digit increase behind our highest return to Spirits brand. 
On the growth side, we're continuing to fill out our new product pipeline and pop up innovative new products across our businesses. These includes Spirit innovation, such as the new Fort Maker’s 46 launched just this month, which will add incrementally to Maker’s Mark 2010 volume at a premium price. 
We've also just launched Cruzan 9, an excellent entry into the growing spice rum category, and we're benefiting from launches earlier in the year, such as the expansion of our Cocktail Cube line, new RTD products in Australia, Teacher's Origin in India and the relaunch of Double Aged Jim Beam Black. And of course, there's Red Stag by Jim Beam, which has simply been a home run new product that's bringing new consumers to the bourbon category. Since its introduction in the second quarter of 2009, we've shipped more than 200,000 cases of Red Stag, along with Maker’s Mark, Red Stag has helped fuel our share gains in the U.S. Bourbon segment.
In Home and Security, Moen is feeling growth with both new products in incremental innovations. We've just launched the innovative, first of its kind, Moen Spot Resist finish. And the brand continues to grow with new eco-performance faucets and showerheads. Energy-efficient windows and doors and new cabinetry styles across price points are also adding to our results. 
New products, coupled with our industry-leading lead times and after-sales service are helping us expand relationships with key Home Products customers. As a result, we're getting shelf space, winning new business and taking profitable market share.
In Golf, the new AP2 and AP1 irons are feeling growth for Titleist. And the new ICON and sport lines are driving strong growth and share gains for FootJoy. We've just launched a new Vokey design, WedgeWorks exclusive line, which brings customization to wedges for the first time, and the new Titleist 910 drivers are being validated on tour prior to consumer launch later this year. 
In Japan, we've launched a new premium-priced Titleist driver and a new Golf ball line, specifically, for the Japanese market. And these products are off to an excellent start. Our strategic investments are also helping us expand the promising international markets. As a result, our Spirits brands are demonstrating some of their strongest growth trends in the BRIC countries, including sustained growth in India and a rebound in Russia. 
Moen will more than double its number of show rooms in China this year, and it continues to expand in China, India and Latin America. Moen and Kitchen Craft Cabinets are growing in Canada. Master Lock is gaining in Europe, Latin America and China, and our Golf brands are growing very strongly in the Pacific basin. 
On the brand-building front, we're investing to reach consumers in both new and traditional ways. We're increasingly relying on digital media across all of our brands. For example, in our Spirits brands, we've increased the percentage of media spend dedicated to digital media to about 35%. That's up from less than 20% last year. These investments include Jim Beam program, such as our innovative partnership with ESPN, our Kid Rock Digital Download Program and digital media for Hornitos Tequila. At the same time, we've lost the first-ever TV campaign for Hornitos. We're also seeing favorable brand-health results in response to Jim Beam's return to TV advertising, and Moen return to TV advertising earlier this year to capitalize on the more favorable consumer environment. 
We're also supporting our Golf brands with highly targeted advertising and marketing programs. The development of online communities of brand fans, as well as the industry's most advanced on-course ball fitting program. 
And now moving on to the supply chain organizational initiatives. We've also invested in aligning our organizations and supply chains to win in this marketplace. In Spirits, we created a more effective and efficient organization with six focus units: three in the U.S. and three internationally, as well as a U.S. sales organization aligned by distributor rather than region. At the same time, we're progressing plans to consolidate our U.S. Bally facilities. 
In Home Products, even as we've reduced our manufacturing footprint by about 40% over the course of the downturn, we initiated productivity enhancements, including lean manufacturing processes, product platform simplifications and improved purchasing and sourcing. We've taken a very proactive approach and substantially completed our major restructuring initiatives over a year ago. This has enabled us to focus on growing the top line. As a result of our moves in Home Products, we have lean and flexible supply chain, able to ramp up to meet consumer and in customer demand. 
For example, the expansion of our distributor's assembly model in cabinetry has brought assembly closer to key customers while reducing freight cost. We're pleased that our strategies have given us the flexibility to accommodate multiple recent customer wins in cabinetry and at Moen, and we're adding jobs to support these new programs. 
At our Golf business, cost of productivity initiatives, combined with the success of our trusted brands, has enabled us to deliver industry-leading operating margins. And to support the growth prospects for our Golf business in Asia, we've invested in a new ball plate in Thailand, that has just begun initial production. We've also completed a previously announced sale of the Cobra Golf brand earlier in the quarter. 
Now here's Craig with a closer look at our markets and the second quarter performance for each of our segments.

249999,109085028,70948,"Fortune Brands Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Suntory Global Spirits Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bruce. Now starting with Spirits and the overall market. We continue to expect that the global Spirits market will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Here in the first half, we believe the global market performed slightly better than that",2158,"Thanks, Bruce. Now starting with Spirits and the overall market. We continue to expect that the global Spirits market will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Here in the first half, we believe the global market performed slightly better than that. Here in the U.S. in the first half, the market was up in the range of 2% to 3%, and we've seen some positive signs of consumers returning to the on-premise channel as well as modest return to premiumisation. We believe both bode well for the pricing and mix environment in the future. 
In Europe, the markets in the U.K. and Germany are up about 1%, while Spain is off, but improving. The market is flat in Australia, and we're seeing strong growth in Russia, India and Duty Free. 
Regarding our numbers for the quarter, our Spirits sales for the quarter came in at $631 million, that's up 5% on both a reported and a comparable basis. Our case volumes were similarly up 5%. Our second quarter results benefited from the timing of sales in various markets and higher bulk sales, that together, boosted our Spirits revenue by approximately 2% in the quarter. 
Geographically, comparable net sales for our brands were up low to mid-single digits in the U.S. and up mid-single digits, internationally. Our results outside the U.S. benefited from double-digit sales growth in the U.K., Spain, Germany, India, Brazil, Russia and Duty Free, and that was partly offset by soft results in Australia and Mexico. 
At the operating income line, OI before charges came in at $147 million for the quarter and that's up 4%. On a comparable basis, OI was up at a similar rate. The benefit of bulk sales and favorable manufacturing variances offset both the increased strategic investments we've previously discussed, as well as, targeted price promotions to enhance our long-term competitive position. 
Looking at the performance of our key brands on a year-to-date basis. Net sales in constant currency, and excluding excise taxes, are higher for each of our three Spirits consumer categories. In Bourbon, our industry-leading portfolio is up at a low-single digit range. Strong performance for Jim Beam in the U.S. is largely offsetting soft market conditions in Australia. Red Stag, Jim Beam Black and Jim Beam Rye are all contributing to the brand share gains in the U.S. Maker’s Mark is running solid growth in the U.S. and in promising international markets. And Knob Creek continues to grow at a double-digit rate. I would highlight that's up against supply constraints in the prior year. 
In our mixables category, which includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordials, our sales are up low-single digits. According to the latest Nielsen sell-through data, Sauza is outperforming the competitive U.S. tequila market in both dollars in volume. Cruzan Rum sales are higher as the brand gains momentum and market share in the U.S. EFFEN Vodka and our economy vodkas are performing well. Larios gin is up double digits on strong performance in Spain. And in cordials, DeKuyper sales are off in the U.S. while Sours is up in Europe. 
In the Classics category, which again includes our cognac, Canadian and Scotch whiskeys, our year-to-date net sales are up double digits. Sales of Courvoisier are up at a strong double-digit rate on broad-based growth across key markets, and that includes the U.S., U.K. and Duty Free. Canadian Club sales are up modestly. Strong results in India, Brazil and the U.K. are helping drive double-digit growth for Teacher's Scotch. Sales of Laphroaig are up double-digit rate on strong shipments in the U.S. and the U.K. and Whiskey DYC is up mid-single digits in its core Spain market. 
Looking at the rest of the year in Spirits, and as we've discussed before, we continue to increase brand and strategic investments to help drive profitable growth over the long-term. And we're pleased with the progress we've already made to build momentum behind our brands to innovate and to gain market share. 
That said, while we feel very good about the things we're doing in our Spirits business, second half operating income in Spirits will reflect a hit -- and I'll remind everybody, that's a hit of approximately $10 million to $15 million from FX at current rates. As a result of that adverse FX impact, our OI margins will likely be 50 to 100 basis points below our targeted run rate of approximately 23%. Even so, that continues to put us in the top tier in the industry. 
Turning to Home & Security, we discussed last quarter that we expect that the overall Home products market would be up at a low-single digit rate in 2010, and that remains our expectation. That said, the shape of the market this year is a little different than we originally anticipated. Spending in the Home Products market on replace-remodel and new construction and cabinetry was frankly stronger than we expected in the first half. Given the pull forward in demand due to the expiration of the home buyer tax credit and continuing signs of consumer caution, we believe the markets growth in the second half will be at a more moderate pace than it was in the first. 
Our full year assumptions about the market now reflect new construction spending, up in the range of 10% to 15% with overall replace-remodel spending continue to be flat to up low-single digits and spending for cabinetry off low-single digits. 
Looking at our numbers for the quarter. Home & Security sales came in at $878 million, up a healthy 13%, reflecting better year-over-year market conditions, broad-based share gains and pull forward related to the home buyer tax credit here in the U.S. Operating income before charges in Home and Security was $83 million, and that's up an outstanding 89%. We're pleased that our lower cost structures benefited the bottom line as we leveraged our incremental volume at 38% in the quarter and has now 44% in the first half. 
As we indicated what happened last quarter, we began to see the adverse impact of higher raw material costs in Q2. Here in the back half, higher cost for materials such as brass, zinc and resins, as well as for ocean freight, will be an increasing headwind. 
Drilling down, we drove growth across all of our product platforms. Sales for Moen grew at a strong double-digit rate on broad-based gains across channels including retail, wholesale, accessories and international markets. The number one faucet brand in North America gained share in both the Replace-Remodel and new Construction segments in the quarter. 
Our Cabinet brands continue to outperform the market with high-single digit growth. Cabinet product mix improved, and we saw gains across our customer base, including particularly, robust growth with builders as the market benefited from the home buyer tax credit. 
Sales for our windows and door brands were up at a strong double-digit rate, while Simonton and Therma-Tru benefited from share gains with the consumer tax credit for the purchase of energy-efficient products, particularly, helping Simonton. Sales of security and storage products grew at a mid-single digit rate as Master Lock continue to expand internationally, and water leak grew in the home center channel. 
As we look to the back half of the year at Home & Security, consumers remain cautious, and the strength of the market will depend to a large degree on the face of the overall economic recovery. We'll also be facing more headwinds than we saw in the first half. First, as we called out last quarter, we'll see the impact of the expiration of the U.S. home buyer tax credit, which as we said pulled demand forward into the first half. Second, as I just mentioned, we'll face higher year-over-year cost for commodities and transportation in the second half. Third, we have incremental strategic investments, and that includes cost for displays related to new business we've won that will contribute to results in 2011. And fourth, performance improvement programs will start to annualize in the second half making comparisons more challenging. 
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we'll be comping against Q4 '09, in which operating income actually increased year-over-year against Q4 '08. All that said, the market remains better than it was a year ago, and we still expect the market to be up low-single digits for the year. Even with the diminishing operating leverage here in the second half, we now expect full year OI before charges margins  will be up in the range of two points versus 2009. We also continue to expect that we'll leverage in the range of the 30% for the full year that we outlined before. 
Summing things up in Home & Security, we feel very good about things we're doing in the marketplace and on the supply-chain front, and we feel well positioned to continue outperforming the Home Products market. 
Now looking at Golf, we continue to expect that world-wide spending on Golf equipment will grow at a low-single digit rate for the year. After soft industry conditions in the first quarter, we saw more favorable trends in Q2 as year-over-year industry shipments improved in most product categories. The second quarter is seasonally important in the Golf industry, and we're pleased that we outperformed the category with growth across all product categories and in all major geographies. 
Our reported second quarter Golf sales were $389 million and that's up 6%. On a comparable basis, and constant currency and excluding Cobra, sales were 8% higher. Geographically, our comparable sales were up at a high-single digit rate in both the U.S. and in international markets. 
In constant currency, sales in Europe climbed at a mid-single digit rate, while Japan, Korea and China were all up double digits. Operating income before charges and the gain on the sale of Cobra came in at $54 million, up 29%. OI benefited from favorable product mix, as well as lower cost structures. Sales of Golf balls increase at a high-single digit rate benefiting from double-digit growth for the Titleist Pro V1, as well as shipments of the newly introduced NXT and DT SoLo model. Sales of Titleist clubs were up at a mid single-digit rate on strong acceptance for the new Titleist AP1, AP2, CB and MB iron. 
Let me also note the Titleist has been the most played iron, wedge and putter on the PGA Tour so far this season. And of course, Titleist continues to lead the bulk count across the world-wide professional tours. 
FootJoy is building strong momentum as the brand's footwear sales increase at a double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, benefiting from new sales and models, including the new flagship ICON line, as well as the new Sports Series. Sales of gloves and accessories grew modestly. 
We entered the back half of the year in a very strong position in Golf. We have excellent product in the market, our inventories are in good shape. We're excited about what we have in our new product pipeline, and our international investments are paying off in strong growth. We do see an opportunity to build on our momentum and extend our industry leadership by continuing to invest in our brand building, new product development and international growth initiatives. 
In addition to continuing higher year-over-year investments, let me remind everyone that due to the seasonality of the category, the third quarter is traditionally more challenging, and the fourth quarter historically generates a loss in Golf. Even so, we expect our full year margins in Golf will be a point or so better versus the prior year. 
Now before turning things back to Bruce, a few additional items. Reviewing gains and charges in the quarter, we recorded net structuring and related charges amounting to about $0.01 per share related to completion of previously announced supply chain initiatives. 
On the gain side, a couple of items. The gain on the sale of Cobra amounted to $10 million or $0.07 and a gain of $68 million or $0.44 per share related to favorable settlement of routine income tax audits in the U.S. and Spain. All told, these items add up to a net gain of $0.50 per share in the quarter. 
With regard to our tax rate, we continue to target that our full year rate will be in the 26% to 27% range. And then turning to cash flow, we're now targeting to generate free cash flow in 2010 in the range of $525 million to $600 million. Our target includes our anticipated higher earnings, as well as ongoing cash flow management efforts. The increase from our prior target of $375 million to $475 million reflects the benefit of asset sales. 
As a reminder here, our measure reflects cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures. I'd also note here that the target represents an earnings to free cash flow conversion rate well in excess of 100%. Now back to Bruce.

Looking to the full year for Fortune Brands and consistent with a view we've discussed throughout the year, the face of the economic recovery continues to be gradual and uneven. 
We're pleased with the success of our share gain initiatives and the momentum we built with the new products, new customer business and strong operating leverage. Our strategies are delivering, and we remain confident that Fortune Brands will produce strong earnings growth in 2010. As a result, we plan to continue investing behind our brands, including higher year-over-year support for long-term growth initiatives in the second half of 2010. 
In addition to the pull forward of sales in the second quarter, we anticipate the back half of the year will be impacted by certain headwinds we've previously discussed. Those include higher costs for raw materials and transportation, the stronger U.S. dollar, annualizing cost-savings and increasingly challenging comparison to last year's improving results. However, even with these headwinds, we continue to believe that the markets for each of our three brand groups will grow at a low-single digit rate for the year. 
Factoring in our strong  year-to-date results, as well as the challenging dynamics we anticipate in the second half, we're raising our full year earnings target. We're now targeting that Fortune Brands will deliver diluted earnings per share before charges and gains in the range of $2.60 to $2.94 for 2010. We're aiming to outperform our markets and believe that Fortune Brands is well positioned as we benefit from our strategic investments, share gains, lower cost structures and enhance productivity. Thank you again for joining us. Now Craig and I will be happy to take your questions.

We've added some distribution on lower mix items, especially in Florida and somewhat in California. Our economy vodkas are becoming a bigger piece of the pie, so a bit of that's mix, more than price, as you look forward. Again, that's about 15% in the market, and in general, that's a much more competitive, those are the bigger boxes. It's really measures Florida, California and a bit of Texas, which in those particular markets we have, the much larger grocery store chains and drug chains.

Obviously last year, I mean we had a very healthy year in terms of the price increases that we took, but as we look at where we are right now, we think that the trade off right now between price and mix is about where we would expect to be and as Bruce just outlined, when you look at where we are globally, our first half volume and value are comparable to each other. Our expectation for the full year, I think as we said on the first quarter call, was that for the full year for us, we'd be down somewhat on price, but that would be offset by mix and the net would be that we'd be up modestly, and that continues to be our expectation.

We're responding to some of the actions that were taken by certain competitors a couple of quarters ago. And the other thing is that, as I said earlier, it's a lot of mix. We don't talk about a lot, but we have an Economy Vodka portfolio that is well-positioned there, and as the consumer has traded down, we have been attracting them to those brands: the  Wolfschmidts, the Kamchatkas, the Dark Ice. Those are brands that we have. So in fact, we're being rewarded for that, and it's not taking away from any of our other business because we don't have basically a portfolio in the middle of the vodka category. The last piece, and this is more of a California and Texas statement, is that there is an oversupply of agave right now in tequila, and that's causing some pricing and promotional activity as well throughout the industry and in Mexico as well.

Well, we were very pleased obviously with the leverage we received, actually, the last two quarters, and that just reinforces us that the things that we did the last couple of years are working, and that the model we expected to deliver, if we get back to the volumes that we had outlined, that we would be approaching 15%. That gives us good confidence that we can get there. Now we just need the volumes to get up there, but we finished our restructuring about a year ago, and we'll do little things here and there with our major restructuring. And always when you do that, you try and not only take cost out, but you try to build a model for the future. And one of the things that we really focused in on was flexibility, and we did that not only just in how the supply chain and the sales worked, but also in the product platform structure and a design-to-assemble and design-to-manufacture side. So all that is working probably better than expected, but we're staying somewhat on those lines of approaching 15% mostly because there will be some investments, and along the way, we do need to scale up both on human side. On the capital side, we're in pretty good shape because of the flexibility we've built into the models. But we have more confidence to those numbers now is a better way to say it.

And this presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measure in our news release or on our website in the Supplemental Information linked to the webcast page.
Fortune Brands' third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and the company remains on track to deliver strong results for the full year. Our results reflect the headwinds we publicly projected three months ago, including the acceleration of demand into the second quarter due to the expiration of the U.S. homebuyer tax credit and the timing of spirit orders. Higher cost of raw materials and increased strategic investments, we're making for long-term profitable growth. These investments which include support for new businesses we've recently won, new product innovations, long-term brand building and international growth initiatives are already delivering results. Importantly, our brands continue to perform very well in the marketplace and are well positioned for the future.
In Spirits, new products and successful strategic investments are fueling of momentum in the United States, as we see the positive impact of recent initiatives. We're also making progress in challenging global markets and growing strongly in priority emerging markets, such as India and Brazil. 
Even as the Home Products market has softened, we're outperforming the market and also winning profitable new business in the cabinetry, faucet and garage organization categories that will enhance our prospects in 2011 and beyond. Our initiatives have positioned us very well to accelerate growth when the housing market recovers. 
And in Golf, we've driven year-to-date growth in all product categories. We're continuing to expand strongly in key Asian markets, and the fourth quarter launch of the advanced-technology new Titleist 910 driver will build on a very successful year of new product introductions.
Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the quarter. Net sales were slightly higher at $1.7 billion and reflect the adverse impact of the pull-forward we've discussed. Sales were up 1% on a comparable basis. That measure excludes excise tax, foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestitures. By brand group, comparable net sales were up 2% in Spirits, up 1% in Home and Security, and up 3% in Golf. On a year-to-date basis, comparable sales for Fortune Brands are up 6%, driven by 5% growth in Spirits, 8% growth in Home and Security and 3% growth in Golf.
Net income was $102.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Results included modest charges and gains, and Craig will touch on those a bit later. Excluding charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.72. That's off 6% from $0.77 in the year-ago quarter. Note that we do not see the estimate pull forward of the -- we did see the estimated pull forward of a $0.10 to $0.15 bps from of the third quarter into the second quarter. Thus, if sales balance out, earnings per share before charges and gains would have been up solidly. Year-to-date, EPS before charges and gains is up 24%.
Reported operating income came in at $176.8 million. On a before charges and gains basis, operating income was $206.4 million for the quarter. That's down 3%, reflecting our increased strategic investments, higher raw material costs and the pull-forward of demand in the second quarter that we've previously discussed. Year-to-date, OI before charges and gains is up 17%.
Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax returns and net tangible assets before charges and gains was 17%. Working capital efficiency came in at 36%. Absent maturing inventories in Spirits, WC improved to 18%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%, and return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%.
Looking ahead, we continue to build on our long and successful track record for actively managing our brands in both good and challenging times. As we discussed before, during the downturn, we focused sharply on consumers, cost and cash. We continue to see the results of our focus here in 2010, including strong performance in the marketplace and the benefits of lean and flexible supply chains as demonstrated by our share gains and cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.
We believe our proactive approach has enabled Fortune Brands to emerge from the recession in a strong position to outperform the current environment and to enhance the company's future prospects to help maximize long-term shareholder value. 
Let me take a few moments to dive a little deeper and focus today of the few of the things we're doing to win in the marketplace, including how we build on our strong foundation of trusted brands with increased investments to seize competitive advantage in our consumer markets.
First, in our Spirits business. We've invested in building and gaining control over our global routes to market. We've also invested in our new product development pipeline and in our marketing capabilities. These investments have enabled us to bring new products and new brand-building marketing programs to market much faster. Our Innovations have brought exciting new energy to the bourbon category. Red Stag by Jim Beam is attracting new consumers to bourbon. We're continuing to expand the Red Stag distribution in the United States and preparing to launch it in key international markets. At the same time, Maker's 46 is off to a tremendous start. And the relaunch Jim Beam Black is adding to our gains in the category.
Let me add that Cruzan 9, an excellent new spiced rum is tracking at double our initial expectations. In our international business, the new Teacher's Origin scotch whiskey is adding some strong growth in India. DYC 8 and Larios scrub [ph] are doing well in the challenging Spanish market. Importantly, our innovations are also driving favorable mix. These are all value-added line extensions that sell at a premium to the core product. And we are even more in the pipeline. Courvoisier is the first of the four major houses of cognac to introduce their product with a declared age statement. Courvoisier 12-year-old and Courvoisier 21-year-old are hitting store shelves this month. Look for the new and upgraded single-barrel reserve in the months ahead. And we have even more innovative plans for introduction throughout 2011. 
Our investments to both elevate our marketing organization and impactful brand-building programs are creating a new energy around our brands. As we've discussed previously, we're significantly increasing the dollars devoted to digital media, including, for Jim Beam, multi-platform partnership with ESPN for iPhone apps and for new TV and online advertising for Hornitos Tequila.
Canadian Club has a prominent placement in two of this season's hottest TV series: AMC's Mad Men and HBO's Boardwalk Empire, and it's also returned to TV advertising in its native Canada. EFFEN Vodka boosted its profile in the New York market and to top-tier media as the official vodka of fashion week. And Maker's Mark launch is first ever international media campaign in Europe.
In Home and security, our track record of innovation and the proactive approach we've taken to manufacturing excellence, customer service and supply chain flexibility is leading to important new customer business. And our investments in new products and international expansion are further helping us outperform the market. Our Cabinetry business is on a roll, putting together an impressive winning streak of profitable new business across channels of distribution. 
While some of these programs are just beginning to roll out, they're already helping us gain market share, and when complete, they will add even more meaningful to our results in 2011, 2012 and beyond. Just this month, we'll be enrolling out a major cabinetry program at Lowe's that will result in our business producing the vast majority of both finished and unfinished in-stock cabinetry offerings for Lowe's stores. And we're installing new selling centers in the top 650 stores by year end to support our Diamond Prelude cabinetry line. That's on top of a Vendi [ph] program we recently launched in nearly 200 northeastern Lowe's stores. 
In September, we began taking orders for new market Martha Stewart Living cabinetry at the Home Depot. This program rolled out to all the nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores simultaneously, and it's already exceeding our expectations. In the current quarter, we've extended the launch of Martha Stewart Living cabinetry to Canada. We've also completed the rollout of Thomasville cabinetry at all Home Depot's Canadian stores and at the core high-end semi-custom brand at Home Depot's top 440 U.S. stores.
We also have exciting new products launch forthcoming in early 2011 in the dealer channel where we have a very strong leadership position. And Waterloo has won significant new business that will roll out in 2011, featuring its innovative garage organization platform in 16-foot sets at all Home Depot stores. 
The momentum of our home products and brands is reflected in a number of best-in-class awards we've recently earned. This include the EPA WaterSense Manufacturing Partner of the Year for Moen, the highest satisfaction for windows and doors and patio doors among consumers, builders and remodelers for Simonton in the latest J.D. Power and Associates study, and a major industry award for value, quality and energy efficiency for Therma-Tru, and multiple vendor of the year awards in cabinetry.
On the innovation front, we're supporting these new cabinetry lines with innovative features and organizational solutions. Additionally, Moen's new spot-resistant finish launched in the quarter is rolling out. And the number one faucet brand in North America continues to rollout new eco performance offerings for the kitchen, the shower and bath. Simonton is fueling growth and adding value with an exterior frame colors and energy-efficient glass packages. And Master Lock strategy of growing in adjacent security categories including door hardware and commercial safety continues to pay off. These also include innovations like the speed dial padlock, which are driving new demand and favorable mix. 
Internationally in Home and Security, Moen is on track to add 135 new showrooms and open up more than 40 new markets in China this year, while also continuing to build its emerging Indian business and its Latin America presence. In addition to our cabinetry gains in Canada, Moen is also growing in the Canadian market. Master Lock's focus on new growth opportunities is fueling gains in Europe, Latin America and China.
In Golf, our focus on both innovation and international expansion is strengthening our industry leadership. The Titleist Pro V1 golf ball continues to lead the field in the marketplace and on the worldwide professional tours. Two weeks ago, the Pro V1 celebrated its 10th anniversary, and one week later, we began testing the sixth generation of the Pro V1 on the worldwide professional tour. The next-generation Pro V1 has already been on tour and will be launched in early 2011. 
FootJoy's innovation such as the new flagship ICON golf shoe line and the sports line has given new momentum in 2010. We're also excited about FootJoy's successful expansion to perform its outerwear, the new FootJoy layering system, with a tagline, ""make everyday playable,"" launched in the quarter and we're seeing very strong initial demand. We've also introduced golf clubs and ball models designed specifically for the Japanese market. The Titleist DT #3 driver and golf balls are tailored to the swing characteristics of Japanese players, and they help drive share gains for us in that market.
As I mentioned earlier, we're excited about the launch next month of the sore proven Titleist 910 driver. The 910 driver features the fastest, most stable head design Titleist has ever created. And the new patented technology allows a loft and lie to be independently adjusted, taking precision fitting to a new level. We will also launch 910 fairways and hybrids early in 2011. 
Internationally, our ongoing investments to build our sales and marketing infrastructure in key growth markets such as Korea, China, Japan and Australia are delivering results and positioning us for business for long-term growth. We also completed a Titleist Ball Plant IV in Thailand, which supplements our ball plants in Massachusetts, enables us to serve key Asian markets very effectively. 
Underpinning each of our three businesses is a winning organizational structure with lean cost and flexible supply chains that enable us to deliver operating margins at or near the top of our industry and provide fuel for growth. Our businesses continue to further enhance our competitive position, with initiatives that enhance the productivity including lean manufacturing, product platform simplification, global sourcing and automated ordering of materials. 
Just look at our Home and Security business, for example. Thanks to supply chain enhancements and productivity initiatives we accelerated and reductions in facilities during the downturn, we're in a position to take on new business with a lower cost structure. And as the home products market recovers, we'll be able to ramp up further and leverage extreme well.
Lastly, we've made some incremental moves to sharpen the focus of our Spirits portfolio. In the quarter, we divested three local nonstrategic Spirit brands in Germany. That transaction will enable us to focus all of our resources in Germany on the growth of our global premium brands in that market.
Earlier this month, we announced agreement to sell the nonstrategic Coburn core brand to the family company that already owns the brand's production assets. We also announced that we are entering into a distribution arrangement with pasture organic liquors brands in the United States. 
Now here is Craig with a closer look at our markets and the third quarter performance in each of our segments."

Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%,",2177,"All right. Thanks, Bruce. Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%,  benefiting from more favorable industry conditions. In Europe, the U.K. and German markets should be up in the range of 1% to 2%. Spain will be lower, but continuing to improve. While the markets will likely be relatively flat in Australia, we continue to expect strong market growth in the BRIC countries, as well as across Southeast Asia and global duty-free. 
Looking at our numbers for the quarter, Spirits sales reached a third quarter record at $643 million, that's up 1%. Importantly, on a comparable basis, sales were up 2% and case volumes were also up 2% in the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, our comparable sales and case volumes are both up 5% and benefiting modestly from timing and the year-over-year impact of our Maxxium reorganization of international markets. As we indicated three months ago, the timing of sales in various markets and higher bulk sales hold some revenues and case volume forward from the third quarter into the second. 
Turning to operating income. OI before charges was $146 million, down 2%, reflecting the increased strategic investments we've discussed throughout the year. On a comparable basis, OI was off 3%.
Looking at the performance of our key brands on a year-to-date basis, each of our three Spirits consumer categories in constant currency and excluding excise taxes is up in net sales. In bourbon, where we're the global leader, our brands are up at a low single-digit rate worldwide. Red Stag and Jim Beam Black continue to support solid performance for Jim Beam in the U.S. Internationally, strong momentum for Jim Beam in Germany and other European markets is partly offsetting challenging market conditions in Australia.
Maker’s Mark is growing at a double-digit rate in the U.S., as well as in its expanding international markets. Our Knob Creek continues to grow at a double-digit range and we're seeing strong growth for our Rye whiskeys as well. In mixables, our sales are up low single-digits. This category includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordials.
Gains for Sauza and Hornitos Tequila in the U.S. are offsetting lower results in Mexico. Nielsen sell-through date indicates that Sauza is continuing to outperform in the U.S. tequila market, importantly in both dollars and volume, with share gains across multiple Sauza variants. We continue to drive strong growth and share gains for Cruzan rum as we raise the profile of the brand in the U.S. EFFEN Vodka is building momentum as we expand distribution and our economy vodkas are also continuing to perform well. And in cordials, higher sales for sours in Europe are partly offsetting lower sales for the DeKuyper in the U.S.
In the classics category, which includes our cognac and Canadian and Scotch whiskeys, we're up at a mid single-digit rate year-to-date. Courvoisier is up double digits on strong growth in the U.K., Canada and duty-free, while Canadian Club sales are up single-digits. The brand is gaining share in the U.S. in the Canadian whiskey segment, and Canadian Club ready-to-drink products are the fastest-growing RTD in Australia.
Sales of Teacher’s scotch are up at a double-digit rate on very strong growth in India and Brazil. Strong demand in the U.S. and the U.K. are helping drive double-digit sales growth for Laphroaig. 
As we approach the fourth quarter holiday season in Spirits, we have solid momentum in the U.S. market and we're making progress in our key international markets. I would add here that given the success of our strategic investments, we're continuing with our increased year-over-year investments in our best growth and return opportunities, including our innovation pipeline and strategic brand-building programs. We believe this proactive approach, which includes a double-digit increase in brand investment this year is positioning us well for sustainable long-term growth that outperforms the category.
On the OI margin front, we're continuing to target something in the range of 22.5%. While FX now appears largely neutral for the year, we'll be down from last year, largely due to both increased brand spend and the first quarter annualization of our international route to market investments. 
Now turning to Home and Security. As we've discussed throughout the year, our expectation for the home products market in 2010 has been low single-digit growth. While spending in the home products market on replace remodel, new construction and cabinetry was a little stronger than we expected in the first half, we clearly see things moderate here in the second half. 
Due to the pull-forward in demand we saw in the second quarter, combined with soft and uneven market conditions, we estimate spending on home products was off at a low single-digit rate here in the third quarter. And I would say to you, we don't see that changing here in Q4. And as a result, we now expect our home products market will be relatively flat for the full year. That includes an assumption that new construction spending will be up in the range of 5% to 10% for the year, with overall replace-remodel spending relatively flat. And spending for cabinetry, which is a big ticket discretionary purchase, off low to mid single-digits.
Looking at our numbers for the third quarter. Home and Security sales were $814 million, up 1%,  reflecting the pull-forward into the second quarter due to expiration of the home buyer tax credit in the U.S., offset by continued share gains and favorable product mix. I would highlight that year-to-date, sales are up 9%. 
Operating income before charges in Home and Security came in at $75 million, flat with the quarter a year ago. As we indicated last quarter, Q3 operating income in Home and Security reflected the impact of higher cost for materials and ocean freight, as well as our investments to support the start-up of significant new business we've recently won. These higher costs were offset by favorable resolution of patent litigation involving security products. 
Drilling down, we drove low to mid single-digit sales growth in all product categories except entry doors, which faced customer inventory reductions in the quarter.
Quarterly sales for Moen grew as gains at retail, strong growth in Canada and Asia and higher accessories demand, more than offset lower sales in the wholesale channel that serve new construction. For our cabinet brands, strong gains at major home centers more than offset modestly lower sales in other channels of distribution. Overall, our Cabinet business is well positioned in the home center channel across customers and across price points, and we're benefiting from business we've won. We'll see even greater benefits in 2011 and beyond.
In windows and doors, Simonton Windows benefited from continued share gains and favorable product mix, driven by energy-efficient glass packages and new colored and painted frame products. While Therma-Tru also drove improved product mix in the quarter, channel inventory reductions pulled results lower following double-digit sales gains in Q2. 
In Security and Storage products, Master Lock grew on back-to-school shipments and expansion in adjacent security categories and in international markets. Waterloo was higher on gains in adjacent categories, including its successful new garage organization products.
As we look ahead in Home and Security, we feel we're in an excellent competitive position that will enable us to accelerate our performance as the housing market recovers. Recovery will obviously depend on several factors, including employment and consumer confidence, home prices and credit availability and the rate of foreclosures. That said, we're bullish on the housing market over the long run. The fact is population and immigration trends will drive demand for new housing units over the next 10 years, and the existing housing stock will obviously need to be remodeled, and more importantly, repaired. 
In the near term, the recovery remains uneven and consumers remain cautious. Here in the fourth quarter, we're facing the headwinds we've previously discussed. These headwinds include our higher strategic investments to support the rollout of major new business as well as higher year-over-year cost for certain commodities and transportation.
Looking at our expectations for the year, we previously told you to expect Home and Security to leverage in the range of 30%. We now expect that will be in the high 30s to low 40s, and we continue to expect that full year OI before charges margins will be in the range of two points better than the prior year. 
Now turning to Golf. Looking first at the market, we began the year with an expectation that worldwide spending in golf equipment would grow at a low single-digit rate for the year. That remains our view. Industry conditions are relatively flat in the U.S., with rounds of play down about 3.5% year-to-date as poor weather has impacted play in regions of the country including Florida and California. At the same time, we're continuing to see growth internationally, particularly in the packed basin that's helping lift overall industry spending.
On a reported basis, Golf sales for the third quarter were $265 million, down 5%. On a comparable basis, in constant currency and excluding COBRA, sales were actually up 3%. Geographically, comparable sales were up at a single-digit rate in both the U.S. and international markets. In constant currency, sales were lower in Europe, but up in Canada, Japan, Korea and China. 
Operating income before charges came in at $6 million, and that's down $4 million from the year-ago quarter. OI reflected the impact of seasonality, higher year-over-year investments that we told everyone to expect, and obviously, the divestiture of COBRA. 
Sales of golf balls were up slightly in the quarter and are flat year-to-date in constant currency. We're continuing to support our industry-leading golf ball franchise through a variety of platforms, including leadership on the worldwide professional tours, targeted advertising, our growing ball-fitting program and word-of-mouth through the Titleist team community of brand fans. 
Sales of Titleist clubs were up at a double-digit rate in the quarter and are up double-digits year-to-date. Continued strong shipments of the new Titleist AP1, AP2, CB and MB irons, as well as demand for Vokey wedges and Scotty Cameron puttershelped drive the third quarter results.
While sales of FootJoy shoes were off at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, sales are up double-digits for the nine months. We continue to see very strong acceptance with a new flagship ICON golf shoe, as well as the FootJoy sport line. Sales of gloves and accessories continued their solid growth in the quarter.
Here in Q4, as we've said many times before, the seasonality of Golf historically results in a fourth quarter loss in this business. This year will be no different. That said, we continue to expect that our full year margins in Golf will be a point or so better than last year. 
Overall, we feel very good about our competitive position. We've got great new products launching this quarter and early in 2011 and our investments are continuing to build our growth profile in key Asian markets. Now before I turn things back to Bruce, just a few additional items.
Reviewing gains and charges for the quarter. We recorded a gain of $9.9 million or $0.06 per share related to the completion of U.S. tax audits as well as select international tax matters. We recorded an after-tax charge of $12.4 million or $0.08 per share related to the divestiture of the nonstrategic local Spirits brands in Germany. And we recorded after-tax restructuring charges of $5.6 million or $0.04 per share. The majority of these restructuring charges for initiatives in our Spirits business that are focused on organizational streamlining. We also recorded modest charges primarily associated with completion of various supply chain initiatives in Home and Security.
With regard to our tax rate, our third quarter rate on a before charges/gains basis came in at 27%. Our target for our full year rate remains in the 26% to 27% range. 
Now turning to cash flow. We've raised our target for free cash flow for 2010 to the range of $625 million to $700 million. That's up from the $525 million to $600 million, due principally to our better working capital position and what will be the timing of capital expenditures. 
A few points on this. First, our 2010 free cash flow is benefiting from a 200 to 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in working capital efficiency, driven by progress across all three of our businesses. Second, this target represents an earning to free cash flow conversion rate well in excess of 100%. Third, our full year target includes $130 million to $140 million of proceeds from asset sales, and that's principally related to our COBRA and German Spirits brands dispositions. And lastly, I'd highlight to everybody and remind everyone that debt reduction remains a priority for the use of our free cash flow. 
So with that, let me now turn it back over to Bruce."

As we look ahead, we continue to expect that the economic recovery will be gradual and uneven, with the Spirits and Golf markets likely to grow in the low single-digit range of the full year and the likelihood that our Home Products market will be relatively flat. The proactive steps we took during the downturn and the investments we're making at the front-end of the recovery have put Fortune Brands in a very strong competitive position. 
Trusted brands, combined with strong innovation, customer wins, strategic brand investments and global expansion initiatives are helping drive broad-based share gains. The leverage of our lower cost structures is helping the bottom line and our focus on cash is helping fortify our balance sheet. Fortune Brands remain on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2010. And results within our full year target range of $2.60 to $2.90 in diluted earnings per share before charges and gains, that's versus $2.43 in 2009.
Factoring previously discussed headwinds, including higher raw material costs, our increased strategic investments in comparison to last year's improving results are results attracting towards the middle of our target range. We believe we are well positioned to continue our momentum in the marketplace, leverage our lower cost structures and deliver continued earnings growth and improve returns as the economy continues to recover. 
Thank you, again, for joining us. Now Craig and I would be happy to take your questions."

A little bit of pickup here in September, but I don't think it's anything that's notable. So if you look at basically the home construction market, we started the first quarter, we're up roughly, we think, and I'm talking about the market now. About 40% new construction, about 11% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we're down about 15%. So obviously, that was where the significant volatility really happened. R&R was pretty much flat across the board. We're down a little bit in the first quarter, up both in the second and third quarter is how we view the market. Higher discretion items like cabinetries, big ticket remodeling items are tracking, maybe 3%, 4%, and that continued pretty much throughout the year."

And that's our continued philosophy. So what we're seeing is we're seeing gains right across all of our channels in cabinetry. The biggest gains are in the home centers just because of the -- when you get gains there, they're big in quantity and size just because of the nature of the level of the stores. Where at the dealer channel, it's more incremental because it's a smaller customer environment. But we're winning across the board.

Premiumization has picked up again, almost a full point this quarter. We're also seeing on-premise growing again. I wouldn't say back to the level it was, but definitely momentum towards getting back to the level it was. So the signs in the Spirit business in the U.S. are very healthy. If you go to Western Europe, it's a little bit more challenging. Germany is probably the best of the bunch. But Spain continues to be a challenge. That's a heavy on-premise market, almost 80% on-premise. That market continues to be down mid single-digit. Again, there, you don't get much price utilization. It's a very competitive market today. U.K., which is pretty much 80% off-premise and with big retailers that dominate, there's always been pricing pressure there. That's nothing unusual there. In emerging markets, there is price availability. So that's basically a summary of the markets."

Our business is structured the way it is because there's headroom in each of our three attractive categories. We believe there is value to be created there. And what we've done over time is use the breadth and balance of our portfolio, the combined cash flow of our portfolio to invest in the business at the right time, and to create value.

For us, tequila is a big area, mostly because there's a [indiscernible] right now. So there's a lot of supply. I think that's pretty much driving that particular area. But I don't think we're seeing anything that's going to be unusual. It's hard to tell. We aren't there yet as far as the calendar goes. So hen we really start seeing here in the middle of November. But from our promotional calendar, we expected to be pretty normal Christmas holiday season."

And this presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measure in our news release or on our website in the Supplemental Information linked to the webcast page.
Fortune Brands' third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and the company remains on track to deliver strong results for the full year. Our results reflect the headwinds we publicly projected three months ago, including the acceleration of demand into the second quarter due to the expiration of the U.S. homebuyer tax credit and the timing of spirit orders. Higher cost of raw materials and increased strategic investments, we're making for long-term profitable growth. These investments which include support for new businesses we've recently won, new product innovations, long-term brand building and international growth initiatives are already delivering results. Importantly, our brands continue to perform very well in the marketplace and are well positioned for the future.
In Spirits, new products and successful strategic investments are fueling of momentum in the United States, as we see the positive impact of recent initiatives. We're also making progress in challenging global markets and growing strongly in priority emerging markets, such as India and Brazil. 
Even as the Home Products market has softened, we're outperforming the market and also winning profitable new business in the cabinetry, faucet and garage organization categories that will enhance our prospects in 2011 and beyond. Our initiatives have positioned us very well to accelerate growth when the housing market recovers. 
And in Golf, we've driven year-to-date growth in all product categories. We're continuing to expand strongly in key Asian markets, and the fourth quarter launch of the advanced-technology new Titleist 910 driver will build on a very successful year of new product introductions.
Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the quarter. Net sales were slightly higher at $1.7 billion and reflect the adverse impact of the pull-forward we've discussed. Sales were up 1% on a comparable basis. That measure excludes excise tax, foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestitures. By brand group, comparable net sales were up 2% in Spirits, up 1% in Home and Security, and up 3% in Golf. On a year-to-date basis, comparable sales for Fortune Brands are up 6%, driven by 5% growth in Spirits, 8% growth in Home and Security and 3% growth in Golf.
Net income was $102.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Results included modest charges and gains, and Craig will touch on those a bit later. Excluding charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.72. That's off 6% from $0.77 in the year-ago quarter. Note that we do not see the estimate pull forward of the -- we did see the estimated pull forward of a $0.10 to $0.15 bps from of the third quarter into the second quarter. Thus, if sales balance out, earnings per share before charges and gains would have been up solidly. Year-to-date, EPS before charges and gains is up 24%.
Reported operating income came in at $176.8 million. On a before charges and gains basis, operating income was $206.4 million for the quarter. That's down 3%, reflecting our increased strategic investments, higher raw material costs and the pull-forward of demand in the second quarter that we've previously discussed. Year-to-date, OI before charges and gains is up 17%.
Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax returns and net tangible assets before charges and gains was 17%. Working capital efficiency came in at 36%. Absent maturing inventories in Spirits, WC improved to 18%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%, and return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%.
Looking ahead, we continue to build on our long and successful track record for actively managing our brands in both good and challenging times. As we discussed before, during the downturn, we focused sharply on consumers, cost and cash. We continue to see the results of our focus here in 2010, including strong performance in the marketplace and the benefits of lean and flexible supply chains as demonstrated by our share gains and cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.
We believe our proactive approach has enabled Fortune Brands to emerge from the recession in a strong position to outperform the current environment and to enhance the company's future prospects to help maximize long-term shareholder value. 
Let me take a few moments to dive a little deeper and focus today of the few of the things we're doing to win in the marketplace, including how we build on our strong foundation of trusted brands with increased investments to seize competitive advantage in our consumer markets.
First, in our Spirits business. We've invested in building and gaining control over our global routes to market. We've also invested in our new product development pipeline and in our marketing capabilities. These investments have enabled us to bring new products and new brand-building marketing programs to market much faster. Our Innovations have brought exciting new energy to the bourbon category. Red Stag by Jim Beam is attracting new consumers to bourbon. We're continuing to expand the Red Stag distribution in the United States and preparing to launch it in key international markets. At the same time, Maker's 46 is off to a tremendous start. And the relaunch Jim Beam Black is adding to our gains in the category.
Let me add that Cruzan 9, an excellent new spiced rum is tracking at double our initial expectations. In our international business, the new Teacher's Origin scotch whiskey is adding some strong growth in India. DYC 8 and Larios scrub [ph] are doing well in the challenging Spanish market. Importantly, our innovations are also driving favorable mix. These are all value-added line extensions that sell at a premium to the core product. And we are even more in the pipeline. Courvoisier is the first of the four major houses of cognac to introduce their product with a declared age statement. Courvoisier 12-year-old and Courvoisier 21-year-old are hitting store shelves this month. Look for the new and upgraded single-barrel reserve in the months ahead. And we have even more innovative plans for introduction throughout 2011. 
Our investments to both elevate our marketing organization and impactful brand-building programs are creating a new energy around our brands. As we've discussed previously, we're significantly increasing the dollars devoted to digital media, including, for Jim Beam, multi-platform partnership with ESPN for iPhone apps and for new TV and online advertising for Hornitos Tequila.
Canadian Club has a prominent placement in two of this season's hottest TV series: AMC's Mad Men and HBO's Boardwalk Empire, and it's also returned to TV advertising in its native Canada. EFFEN Vodka boosted its profile in the New York market and to top-tier media as the official vodka of fashion week. And Maker's Mark launch is first ever international media campaign in Europe.
In Home and security, our track record of innovation and the proactive approach we've taken to manufacturing excellence, customer service and supply chain flexibility is leading to important new customer business. And our investments in new products and international expansion are further helping us outperform the market. Our Cabinetry business is on a roll, putting together an impressive winning streak of profitable new business across channels of distribution. 
While some of these programs are just beginning to roll out, they're already helping us gain market share, and when complete, they will add even more meaningful to our results in 2011, 2012 and beyond. Just this month, we'll be enrolling out a major cabinetry program at Lowe's that will result in our business producing the vast majority of both finished and unfinished in-stock cabinetry offerings for Lowe's stores. And we're installing new selling centers in the top 650 stores by year end to support our Diamond Prelude cabinetry line. That's on top of a Vendi [ph] program we recently launched in nearly 200 northeastern Lowe's stores. 
In September, we began taking orders for new market Martha Stewart Living cabinetry at the Home Depot. This program rolled out to all the nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores simultaneously, and it's already exceeding our expectations. In the current quarter, we've extended the launch of Martha Stewart Living cabinetry to Canada. We've also completed the rollout of Thomasville cabinetry at all Home Depot's Canadian stores and at the core high-end semi-custom brand at Home Depot's top 440 U.S. stores.
We also have exciting new products launch forthcoming in early 2011 in the dealer channel where we have a very strong leadership position. And Waterloo has won significant new business that will roll out in 2011, featuring its innovative garage organization platform in 16-foot sets at all Home Depot stores. 
The momentum of our home products and brands is reflected in a number of best-in-class awards we've recently earned. This include the EPA WaterSense Manufacturing Partner of the Year for Moen, the highest satisfaction for windows and doors and patio doors among consumers, builders and remodelers for Simonton in the latest J.D. Power and Associates study, and a major industry award for value, quality and energy efficiency for Therma-Tru, and multiple vendor of the year awards in cabinetry.
On the innovation front, we're supporting these new cabinetry lines with innovative features and organizational solutions. Additionally, Moen's new spot-resistant finish launched in the quarter is rolling out. And the number one faucet brand in North America continues to rollout new eco performance offerings for the kitchen, the shower and bath. Simonton is fueling growth and adding value with an exterior frame colors and energy-efficient glass packages. And Master Lock strategy of growing in adjacent security categories including door hardware and commercial safety continues to pay off. These also include innovations like the speed dial padlock, which are driving new demand and favorable mix. 
Internationally in Home and Security, Moen is on track to add 135 new showrooms and open up more than 40 new markets in China this year, while also continuing to build its emerging Indian business and its Latin America presence. In addition to our cabinetry gains in Canada, Moen is also growing in the Canadian market. Master Lock's focus on new growth opportunities is fueling gains in Europe, Latin America and China.
In Golf, our focus on both innovation and international expansion is strengthening our industry leadership. The Titleist Pro V1 golf ball continues to lead the field in the marketplace and on the worldwide professional tours. Two weeks ago, the Pro V1 celebrated its 10th anniversary, and one week later, we began testing the sixth generation of the Pro V1 on the worldwide professional tour. The next-generation Pro V1 has already been on tour and will be launched in early 2011. 
FootJoy's innovation such as the new flagship ICON golf shoe line and the sports line has given new momentum in 2010. We're also excited about FootJoy's successful expansion to perform its outerwear, the new FootJoy layering system, with a tagline, ""make everyday playable,"" launched in the quarter and we're seeing very strong initial demand. We've also introduced golf clubs and ball models designed specifically for the Japanese market. The Titleist DT #3 driver and golf balls are tailored to the swing characteristics of Japanese players, and they help drive share gains for us in that market.
As I mentioned earlier, we're excited about the launch next month of the sore proven Titleist 910 driver. The 910 driver features the fastest, most stable head design Titleist has ever created. And the new patented technology allows a loft and lie to be independently adjusted, taking precision fitting to a new level. We will also launch 910 fairways and hybrids early in 2011. 
Internationally, our ongoing investments to build our sales and marketing infrastructure in key growth markets such as Korea, China, Japan and Australia are delivering results and positioning us for business for long-term growth. We also completed a Titleist Ball Plant IV in Thailand, which supplements our ball plants in Massachusetts, enables us to serve key Asian markets very effectively. 
Underpinning each of our three businesses is a winning organizational structure with lean cost and flexible supply chains that enable us to deliver operating margins at or near the top of our industry and provide fuel for growth. Our businesses continue to further enhance our competitive position, with initiatives that enhance the productivity including lean manufacturing, product platform simplification, global sourcing and automated ordering of materials. 
Just look at our Home and Security business, for example. Thanks to supply chain enhancements and productivity initiatives we accelerated and reductions in facilities during the downturn, we're in a position to take on new business with a lower cost structure. And as the home products market recovers, we'll be able to ramp up further and leverage extreme well.
Lastly, we've made some incremental moves to sharpen the focus of our Spirits portfolio. In the quarter, we divested three local nonstrategic Spirit brands in Germany. That transaction will enable us to focus all of our resources in Germany on the growth of our global premium brands in that market.
Earlier this month, we announced agreement to sell the nonstrategic Coburn core brand to the family company that already owns the brand's production assets. We also announced that we are entering into a distribution arrangement with pasture organic liquors brands in the United States. 
Now here is Craig with a closer look at our markets and the third quarter performance in each of our segments.

Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%,",2177,"All right. Thanks, Bruce. Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%,  benefiting from more favorable industry conditions. In Europe, the U.K. and German markets should be up in the range of 1% to 2%. Spain will be lower, but continuing to improve. While the markets will likely be relatively flat in Australia, we continue to expect strong market growth in the BRIC countries, as well as across Southeast Asia and global duty-free. 
Looking at our numbers for the quarter, Spirits sales reached a third quarter record at $643 million, that's up 1%. Importantly, on a comparable basis, sales were up 2% and case volumes were also up 2% in the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, our comparable sales and case volumes are both up 5% and benefiting modestly from timing and the year-over-year impact of our Maxxium reorganization of international markets. As we indicated three months ago, the timing of sales in various markets and higher bulk sales hold some revenues and case volume forward from the third quarter into the second. 
Turning to operating income. OI before charges was $146 million, down 2%, reflecting the increased strategic investments we've discussed throughout the year. On a comparable basis, OI was off 3%.
Looking at the performance of our key brands on a year-to-date basis, each of our three Spirits consumer categories in constant currency and excluding excise taxes is up in net sales. In bourbon, where we're the global leader, our brands are up at a low single-digit rate worldwide. Red Stag and Jim Beam Black continue to support solid performance for Jim Beam in the U.S. Internationally, strong momentum for Jim Beam in Germany and other European markets is partly offsetting challenging market conditions in Australia.
Maker’s Mark is growing at a double-digit rate in the U.S., as well as in its expanding international markets. Our Knob Creek continues to grow at a double-digit range and we're seeing strong growth for our Rye whiskeys as well. In mixables, our sales are up low single-digits. This category includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordials.
Gains for Sauza and Hornitos Tequila in the U.S. are offsetting lower results in Mexico. Nielsen sell-through date indicates that Sauza is continuing to outperform in the U.S. tequila market, importantly in both dollars and volume, with share gains across multiple Sauza variants. We continue to drive strong growth and share gains for Cruzan rum as we raise the profile of the brand in the U.S. EFFEN Vodka is building momentum as we expand distribution and our economy vodkas are also continuing to perform well. And in cordials, higher sales for sours in Europe are partly offsetting lower sales for the DeKuyper in the U.S.
In the classics category, which includes our cognac and Canadian and Scotch whiskeys, we're up at a mid single-digit rate year-to-date. Courvoisier is up double digits on strong growth in the U.K., Canada and duty-free, while Canadian Club sales are up single-digits. The brand is gaining share in the U.S. in the Canadian whiskey segment, and Canadian Club ready-to-drink products are the fastest-growing RTD in Australia.
Sales of Teacher’s scotch are up at a double-digit rate on very strong growth in India and Brazil. Strong demand in the U.S. and the U.K. are helping drive double-digit sales growth for Laphroaig. 
As we approach the fourth quarter holiday season in Spirits, we have solid momentum in the U.S. market and we're making progress in our key international markets. I would add here that given the success of our strategic investments, we're continuing with our increased year-over-year investments in our best growth and return opportunities, including our innovation pipeline and strategic brand-building programs. We believe this proactive approach, which includes a double-digit increase in brand investment this year is positioning us well for sustainable long-term growth that outperforms the category.
On the OI margin front, we're continuing to target something in the range of 22.5%. While FX now appears largely neutral for the year, we'll be down from last year, largely due to both increased brand spend and the first quarter annualization of our international route to market investments. 
Now turning to Home and Security. As we've discussed throughout the year, our expectation for the home products market in 2010 has been low single-digit growth. While spending in the home products market on replace remodel, new construction and cabinetry was a little stronger than we expected in the first half, we clearly see things moderate here in the second half. 
Due to the pull-forward in demand we saw in the second quarter, combined with soft and uneven market conditions, we estimate spending on home products was off at a low single-digit rate here in the third quarter. And I would say to you, we don't see that changing here in Q4. And as a result, we now expect our home products market will be relatively flat for the full year. That includes an assumption that new construction spending will be up in the range of 5% to 10% for the year, with overall replace-remodel spending relatively flat. And spending for cabinetry, which is a big ticket discretionary purchase, off low to mid single-digits.
Looking at our numbers for the third quarter. Home and Security sales were $814 million, up 1%,  reflecting the pull-forward into the second quarter due to expiration of the home buyer tax credit in the U.S., offset by continued share gains and favorable product mix. I would highlight that year-to-date, sales are up 9%. 
Operating income before charges in Home and Security came in at $75 million, flat with the quarter a year ago. As we indicated last quarter, Q3 operating income in Home and Security reflected the impact of higher cost for materials and ocean freight, as well as our investments to support the start-up of significant new business we've recently won. These higher costs were offset by favorable resolution of patent litigation involving security products. 
Drilling down, we drove low to mid single-digit sales growth in all product categories except entry doors, which faced customer inventory reductions in the quarter.
Quarterly sales for Moen grew as gains at retail, strong growth in Canada and Asia and higher accessories demand, more than offset lower sales in the wholesale channel that serve new construction. For our cabinet brands, strong gains at major home centers more than offset modestly lower sales in other channels of distribution. Overall, our Cabinet business is well positioned in the home center channel across customers and across price points, and we're benefiting from business we've won. We'll see even greater benefits in 2011 and beyond.
In windows and doors, Simonton Windows benefited from continued share gains and favorable product mix, driven by energy-efficient glass packages and new colored and painted frame products. While Therma-Tru also drove improved product mix in the quarter, channel inventory reductions pulled results lower following double-digit sales gains in Q2. 
In Security and Storage products, Master Lock grew on back-to-school shipments and expansion in adjacent security categories and in international markets. Waterloo was higher on gains in adjacent categories, including its successful new garage organization products.
As we look ahead in Home and Security, we feel we're in an excellent competitive position that will enable us to accelerate our performance as the housing market recovers. Recovery will obviously depend on several factors, including employment and consumer confidence, home prices and credit availability and the rate of foreclosures. That said, we're bullish on the housing market over the long run. The fact is population and immigration trends will drive demand for new housing units over the next 10 years, and the existing housing stock will obviously need to be remodeled, and more importantly, repaired. 
In the near term, the recovery remains uneven and consumers remain cautious. Here in the fourth quarter, we're facing the headwinds we've previously discussed. These headwinds include our higher strategic investments to support the rollout of major new business as well as higher year-over-year cost for certain commodities and transportation.
Looking at our expectations for the year, we previously told you to expect Home and Security to leverage in the range of 30%. We now expect that will be in the high 30s to low 40s, and we continue to expect that full year OI before charges margins will be in the range of two points better than the prior year. 
Now turning to Golf. Looking first at the market, we began the year with an expectation that worldwide spending in golf equipment would grow at a low single-digit rate for the year. That remains our view. Industry conditions are relatively flat in the U.S., with rounds of play down about 3.5% year-to-date as poor weather has impacted play in regions of the country including Florida and California. At the same time, we're continuing to see growth internationally, particularly in the packed basin that's helping lift overall industry spending.
On a reported basis, Golf sales for the third quarter were $265 million, down 5%. On a comparable basis, in constant currency and excluding COBRA, sales were actually up 3%. Geographically, comparable sales were up at a single-digit rate in both the U.S. and international markets. In constant currency, sales were lower in Europe, but up in Canada, Japan, Korea and China. 
Operating income before charges came in at $6 million, and that's down $4 million from the year-ago quarter. OI reflected the impact of seasonality, higher year-over-year investments that we told everyone to expect, and obviously, the divestiture of COBRA. 
Sales of golf balls were up slightly in the quarter and are flat year-to-date in constant currency. We're continuing to support our industry-leading golf ball franchise through a variety of platforms, including leadership on the worldwide professional tours, targeted advertising, our growing ball-fitting program and word-of-mouth through the Titleist team community of brand fans. 
Sales of Titleist clubs were up at a double-digit rate in the quarter and are up double-digits year-to-date. Continued strong shipments of the new Titleist AP1, AP2, CB and MB irons, as well as demand for Vokey wedges and Scotty Cameron puttershelped drive the third quarter results.
While sales of FootJoy shoes were off at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, sales are up double-digits for the nine months. We continue to see very strong acceptance with a new flagship ICON golf shoe, as well as the FootJoy sport line. Sales of gloves and accessories continued their solid growth in the quarter.
Here in Q4, as we've said many times before, the seasonality of Golf historically results in a fourth quarter loss in this business. This year will be no different. That said, we continue to expect that our full year margins in Golf will be a point or so better than last year. 
Overall, we feel very good about our competitive position. We've got great new products launching this quarter and early in 2011 and our investments are continuing to build our growth profile in key Asian markets. Now before I turn things back to Bruce, just a few additional items.
Reviewing gains and charges for the quarter. We recorded a gain of $9.9 million or $0.06 per share related to the completion of U.S. tax audits as well as select international tax matters. We recorded an after-tax charge of $12.4 million or $0.08 per share related to the divestiture of the nonstrategic local Spirits brands in Germany. And we recorded after-tax restructuring charges of $5.6 million or $0.04 per share. The majority of these restructuring charges for initiatives in our Spirits business that are focused on organizational streamlining. We also recorded modest charges primarily associated with completion of various supply chain initiatives in Home and Security.
With regard to our tax rate, our third quarter rate on a before charges/gains basis came in at 27%. Our target for our full year rate remains in the 26% to 27% range. 
Now turning to cash flow. We've raised our target for free cash flow for 2010 to the range of $625 million to $700 million. That's up from the $525 million to $600 million, due principally to our better working capital position and what will be the timing of capital expenditures. 
A few points on this. First, our 2010 free cash flow is benefiting from a 200 to 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in working capital efficiency, driven by progress across all three of our businesses. Second, this target represents an earning to free cash flow conversion rate well in excess of 100%. Third, our full year target includes $130 million to $140 million of proceeds from asset sales, and that's principally related to our COBRA and German Spirits brands dispositions. And lastly, I'd highlight to everybody and remind everyone that debt reduction remains a priority for the use of our free cash flow. 
So with that, let me now turn it back over to Bruce.

As we look ahead, we continue to expect that the economic recovery will be gradual and uneven, with the Spirits and Golf markets likely to grow in the low single-digit range of the full year and the likelihood that our Home Products market will be relatively flat. The proactive steps we took during the downturn and the investments we're making at the front-end of the recovery have put Fortune Brands in a very strong competitive position. 
Trusted brands, combined with strong innovation, customer wins, strategic brand investments and global expansion initiatives are helping drive broad-based share gains. The leverage of our lower cost structures is helping the bottom line and our focus on cash is helping fortify our balance sheet. Fortune Brands remain on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2010. And results within our full year target range of $2.60 to $2.90 in diluted earnings per share before charges and gains, that's versus $2.43 in 2009.
Factoring previously discussed headwinds, including higher raw material costs, our increased strategic investments in comparison to last year's improving results are results attracting towards the middle of our target range. We believe we are well positioned to continue our momentum in the marketplace, leverage our lower cost structures and deliver continued earnings growth and improve returns as the economy continues to recover. 
Thank you, again, for joining us. Now Craig and I would be happy to take your questions.

Again, we came off the tax credit in the April time frame. And we saw a continuation -- because our products are more in the back-end of new home construction or the remodeling project, we saw a continuation of those orders through May, and then it started to drift down in June and that continued through July, August and September. A little bit of pickup here in September, but I don't think it's anything that's notable. So if you look at basically the home construction market, we started the first quarter, we're up roughly, we think, and I'm talking about the market now. About 40% new construction, about 11% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we're down about 15%. So obviously, that was where the significant volatility really happened. R&R was pretty much flat across the board. We're down a little bit in the first quarter, up both in the second and third quarter is how we view the market. Higher discretion items like cabinetries, big ticket remodeling items are tracking, maybe 3%, 4%, and that continued pretty much throughout the year.

So obviously, there's a fairly size of big investments here in the third quarter just to get all these sets up and everything else. But it's good margin business.

I think, as you know, new business going to the store doesn't mean that all of a sudden the consumers are going to rally behind you. But we have initiatives to drive the consumers there as well. And the early signs of some of these has been excellent, especially Martha Stewart program at Home Depot. We've seen fabulous results early on.

It's just this year has been a banner year for us. And one of the things, we came into the year saying that our expectation was that commodities were going to be a more significant issue.

And that's our continued philosophy. So what we're seeing is we're seeing gains right across all of our channels in cabinetry. The biggest gains are in the home centers just because of the -- when you get gains there, they're big in quantity and size just because of the nature of the level of the stores. Where at the dealer channel, it's more incremental because it's a smaller customer environment. But we're winning across the board. And we brought out new programs for our dealer channel earlier this year, which have created a number of wins. We have some new innovation coming in, in the first quarter for the dealer network in '11, which we were excited about there, excited about and they've got a preview with that.

Premiumization has picked up again, almost a full point this quarter. We're also seeing on-premise growing again. I wouldn't say back to the level it was, but definitely momentum towards getting back to the level it was. So the signs in the Spirit business in the U.S. are very healthy. If you go to Western Europe, it's a little bit more challenging. Germany is probably the best of the bunch. But Spain continues to be a challenge. That's a heavy on-premise market, almost 80% on-premise. That market continues to be down mid single-digit. Again, there, you don't get much price utilization. It's a very competitive market today. U.K., which is pretty much 80% off-premise and with big retailers that dominate, there's always been pricing pressure there. That's nothing unusual there. In emerging markets, there is price availability. So that's basically a summary of the markets.

And when I came with the acceleration of the tax credit activity related to the tax credit, and with that inventory build, I think they were in the mentality that we don't want to miss an order. So we've seen some of that lead off. Same thing is true with the Therma-Tru or the door business, which is, again, majority goes to distribution. We saw a buildup of inventory in the first half, and as a result, showed -- that has been bleeding off here in the third quarter, getting better and balanced.

So I mean, you can look at what we've done recently with the investments we've made in the Spirits business, with the route-to-market taking -- where 8% of our sales were [indiscernible] sales organization to now 75, the change in marketing and leadership there to investing 2.5 years ago in innovation engine that's bringing out tremendous new products now. So you see those investments. At the same time, you see the investments in our home business that is allowing us to position this business to win early in the stages of the recovery. And for Golf, those to be able to be early in Asia, which is the new future of growth opportunities in the market. So the combined cash flow allows us to do that. Would you get some synergies on the cost side? But that's not the driving force behind it. The driving force is being able to, in these attractive markets with headroom for us to create value, to use the combined cash flow to smartly invest and to grow the businesses.

Fortune Brands' third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and the company remains on track to deliver strong results for the full year. Our results reflect the headwinds we publicly projected three months ago, including the acceleration of demand into the second quarter due to the expiration of the U.S. homebuyer tax credit and the timing of spirits orders, higher cost of raw materials and the increased strategic investments we're making for long-term profitable growth. These investments, which include support for new businesses we've recently won, new product innovations, long-term brand building and international growth initiatives are already delivering results. Importantly, our brands continue to perform very well in the marketplace and are well positioned for the future.
In Spirits, new products and successful strategic investments are fueling momentum in the United States, as we see the positive impact of recent initiatives. We're also making progress in challenging global markets and growing strongly in priority emerging markets, such as India and Brazil. 
Even as the Home Products market has softened, we're outperforming the market and also winning profitable new business in the cabinetry, faucet and garage organization categories that will enhance our prospects in 2011 and beyond. Our initiatives have positioned us very well to accelerate growth when the housing market recovers. 
And in Golf, we've driven year-to-date growth in all product categories. We're continuing to expand strongly in key Asian markets, and the fourth quarter launch of the advanced-technology new Titleist 910 driver will build on a very successful year of new product introductions.
Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the quarter. Net sales were slightly higher at $1.7 billion and reflect the adverse impact of the pull-forward we've discussed. Sales were up 1% on a comparable basis. That measure excludes excise tax, foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. By brand group, comparable net sales were up 2% in Spirits, up 1% in Home and Security, and up 3% in Golf. On the year-to-date basis, comparable sales for Fortune Brands are up 6%, driven by 5% growth in Spirits, 8% growth in Home and Security and 3% growth in Golf.
Net income was $102.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Results included modest charges and gains, and Craig will touch on those a bit later. Excluding charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.72. That's off 6% from $0.77 in the year-ago quarter. Note that we do not see the estimate pull-forward of the -- we did see the estimated pull-forward of a $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS from of the third quarter into the second quarter. Thus, if that was balanced out, earnings per share before charges and gains would have been up solidly. Year-to-date, EPS before charges and gains is up 24%.
Reported operating income came in at $176.8 million. On a before charges and gains basis, operating income was $206.4 million for the quarter. That's down 3%, reflecting our increased strategic investments, higher raw material costs and the pull-forward of demand in the second quarter that we've previously discussed. Year-to-date, OI before charges and gains is up 17%.
Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax returns on net tangible assets before charges and gains was 17%. Working capital efficiency came in at 36%. Absent maturing inventories for Spirits, WC improved to 18%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%, and return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%.
Looking ahead, we continue to build on our long and successful track record for actively managing our brands in both good and challenging times. As we discussed before, during the downturn, we focused sharply on consumers, cost and cash. We continue to see the results of our focus here in 2010, including strong performance in the marketplace and the benefits of lean and flexible supply chains as demonstrated by our share gains and cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.
We believe our proactive approach has enabled Fortune Brands to emerge from the recession in a stronger position to outperform the current environment and to enhance the company's future prospects to help maximize long-term shareholder value. 
Let me take a few moments to dive a little deeper and focus today on the few of the things we're doing to win in the marketplace, including how we’ve built on our strong foundation of trusted brands with increased investments to seize competitive advantage in our consumer markets.
First, in our Spirits business. We've invested in building and gaining control over our global routes to market. And we've also invested in our new product development pipeline and in our marketing capabilities. These investments have enabled us to bring new products and new brand-building marketing programs to market much faster. Our Innovations have brought exciting new energy to the bourbon category. Red Stag by Jim Beam is attracting new consumers to bourbon. We're continuing to expand the Red Stag distribution in the United States and preparing to launch it in key international markets. At the same time, Maker's 46 is off to a tremendous start. And the relaunch Jim Beam Black is adding to our gains in the category.
Let me add that Cruzan 9, an excellent new spiced rum, is tracking at double our initial expectations. In our international business, the new Teacher's Origin scotch whiskey is to some strong growth in India. DYC 8 and Larios 12 are doing well in the challenging Spanish market. Importantly, our innovations are also driving favorable mix. These are all value-added line extensions that sell at a premium to the core product. And we have even more in the pipeline. Courvoisier is the first of the four major houses of cognac to introduce their product with a declared age statement. Courvoisier 12-year-old and Courvoisier 21-year-old are hitting store shelves this month. Look for the new Knob Creek single-barrel reserve in the months ahead. And we have even more innovative plans for introduction throughout 2011. 
Our investments to both elevate our marketing organization and impactful brand-building programs are creating new energy around our brands. As we've discussed previously, we're significantly increasing the dollars devoted to digital media, including, for Jim Beam, multi-platform partnership with ESPN for iPhone apps and for new TV and online advertising for Hornitos Tequila.
Canadian Club has a prominent placement in two of this season's hottest TV series: AMC's Mad Men and HBO's Boardwalk Empire, and it's also returned to TV advertising in its native Canada. EFFEN Vodka boosted its profile in the New York market and to top-tier media as the official vodka of fashion week. And Maker's Mark launched its first ever international media campaign in Europe.
In Home and Security, our track record of innovation and the proactive approach we've taken to manufacturing excellence, customer service and supply chain flexibility is leading to important new customer business. And our investments in new products and international expansion are further helping us outperform the market. Our Cabinetry business is on a roll, putting together an impressive winning streak of profitable new business across channels of distribution. 
While some of these programs are just beginning to roll out, they're already helping us gain market share, and when complete, they will add even more meaningful to our results in 2011, 2012 and beyond. Just this month, we began rolling out a major cabinetry program at Lowe's that will result in our business producing the vast majority of both finished and unfinished in-stock cabinetry offerings for Lowe's stores. And we're installing new selling centers in the top 650 stores by year end to support our Diamond Prelude cabinetry line. That's on top of a Vendi [ph] program we’ve recently launched at nearly 200 northeastern Lowe's stores. 
In September, we began taking orders for the new market Martha Stewart Living cabinetry at the Home Depot. This program rolled out to all the nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores simultaneously, and it's already exceeding our expectations. In the current quarter, we've extended the launch of Martha Stewart’s Living cabinetry to Canada. We've also completed the rollout of Thomasville cabinetry at all Home Depot's Canadian stores and as a core high-end semi-custom brand at the Home Depot's top 440 U.S. stores.
We also have exciting new products launch forthcoming in early 2011 in the dealer channel, where we have a very strong leadership position. And Waterloo has won significant new business that will roll out in 2011, featuring its innovative garage organization platform in 16-foot sets at all Home Depot stores. 
The momentum of our home products brands is reflected in a number of best-in-class awards we've recently earned. These include the EPA WaterSense Manufacturing Partner of the Year for Moen; the highest satisfaction for windows and doors and patio doors among consumers, builders and remodelers for Simonton in the latest J.D. Powers and Associates study; and a major industry award for value, quality and energy efficiency for Therma-Tru; and multiple vendor of the year awards in cabinetry.
On the innovation front, we're supporting these new cabinetry lines with innovative features and organizational solutions. Additionally, Moen's new spot-resistant finish launched in the quarter is rolling out. And the number one faucet brand in North America continues to roll out new eco performance offerings for the kitchen, the shower and bath. Simonton is fueling growth and adding value with exterior frame colors and energy-efficient glass packages. And Master Lock strategy of growing in adjacent security categories, including door hardware and commercial safety, continues to pay off. These also include innovations like the speed dial padlock, which are driving new demand and favorable mix. 
Internationally in Home and Security, Moen is on track to add 135 new showrooms and open up more than 40 new markets in China this year, while also continuing to build its emerging Indian business and its Latin America presence. In addition to our cabinetry gains in Canada, Moen is also growing in the Canadian market. Master Lock's focus on new growth opportunities is fueling gains in Europe, Latin America and China.
In Golf, our focus on both innovation and international expansion is strengthening our industry leadership. The Titleist Pro V1 golf ball continues to lead the field in the marketplace and on the worldwide professional tours. Two weeks ago, the Pro V1 celebrated its 10th anniversary, and one week later, we began testing the sixth generation of the Pro V1 on the worldwide professional tour. The next-generation Pro V1 has already been a winner on tour and will be launched in early 2011. 
FootJoy's innovations, such as the new flagship ICON golf shoe line and the sports line, have given new momentum in 2010. We're also excited about FootJoy's successful expansion to perform its outerwear, the new FootJoy layering system, with the tagline, ""make every day playable,"" launched in the quarter, and we're seeing very strong initial demand. We've also introduced golf clubs and ball models designed specifically for the Japanese market. The Titleist DT #3 driver and golf balls are tailored to the swing characteristics of Japanese players, and they’ve helped drive share gains for us in that market.
As I mentioned earlier, we're excited about the launch next month of the tour-proven Titleist 910 driver. The 910 driver features the fastest, most stable head design Titleist has ever created. And the new patented technology allows a loft and lie to be independently adjusted, taking precision fitting to a new level. We will also launch the 910 fairways and hybrids early in 2011. 
Internationally, our ongoing investments to build our sales and marketing infrastructure in key growth markets such as Korea, China, Japan and Australia are delivering results and positioning us for business for long-term growth. We also completed Titleist Ball Plant IV in Thailand, which supplements our ball plants in Massachusetts and enables us to serve key Asian markets very effectively. 
Underpinning each of our three businesses is a winning organizational structure with lean cost and flexible supply chains that enable us to deliver operating margins at or near the top of our industry and provide fuel for growth. Our businesses continue to further enhance our competitive position, with initiatives that enhance the productivity including lean manufacturing, product platform simplification, global sourcing and automated ordering of materials. 
Just look at our Home and Security business, for example. Thanks to supply chain enhancements and productivity initiatives we accelerated and reductions in facilities during the downturn, we're in a position to take on new business with a lower cost structure. And as the home products market recovers, we'll be able to ramp up further and leverage extremely well.
Lastly, we've made some incremental moves to sharpen the focus of our Spirits portfolio. In the quarter, we divested three local nonstrategic Spirit brands in Germany. That transaction will enable us to focus all of our resources in Germany on the growth of our global premium brands in that market.
Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to sell the nonstrategic Cobra Court [ph] brand to the family company that already owns the brand's production assets. We also announced that we are entering into a distribution arrangement with Thatcher Organic Liqueurs brands in the United States. 
Now here is Craig with a closer look at our markets and the third quarter performance in each of our segments."
249999,114143126,82957,"Fortune Brands Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Suntory Global Spirits Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Bruce. Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%,",2179,"All right. Thanks, Bruce. Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%, benefiting from more favorable industry conditions. In Europe, the U.K. and German markets should be up in the range of 1% to 2%. Spain will be lower, but continuing to improve. While the markets will likely be relatively flat in Australia, we continue to expect strong market growth in the BRIC countries, as well as across Southeast Asia and global duty-free. 
Looking at our numbers for the quarter, Spirits sales reached a third quarter record at $643 million. That's up 1%. Importantly, on a comparable basis, sales were up 2% and case volumes were also up 2% in the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, our comparable sales and case volumes are both up 5% and are benefiting modestly from timing and the year-over-year impact of our Maxxium reorganization of international markets. As we indicated three months ago, the timing of sales in various markets and higher bulk sales pulled some revenues in case volume forward from the third quarter into the second. 
Turning to operating income. OI before charges was $146 million, down 2%, reflecting the increased strategic investments we've discussed throughout the year. On a comparable basis, OI was off 3%.
Looking at the performance of our key brands on a year-to-date basis, each of our three Spirits consumer categories in constant currency and excluding excise taxes is up in net sales. In bourbon, where we're the global leader, our brands are up at a low single-digit rate worldwide. Red Stag and Jim Beam Black continue to support solid performance for Jim Beam in the U.S. Internationally, strong momentum for Jim Beam in Germany and other European markets is partly offsetting challenging market conditions in Australia.
Maker’s Mark is growing at a double-digit rate in the U.S., as well as in its expanding international markets. Our Knob Creek continues to grow at a double-digit rate and we're seeing strong growth for our Rye whiskeys as well. In mixables, our sales are up low single-digits. This category includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordials.
Gains for Sauza and Hornitos Tequila in the U.S. are offsetting lower results in Mexico. Nielsen sell-through data indicates that Sauza is continuing to outperform in the U.S. tequila market, importantly in both dollars and volume, with share gains across multiple Sauza variants. We continue to drive strong growth in share gains for Cruzan rum as we raise the profile of the brand in the U.S. EFFEN Vodka is building momentum as we expand distribution, and our economy vodkas are also continuing to perform well. And in cordials, higher sales for sours in Europe are partly offsetting lower sales for DeKuyper in the U.S.
In the classics category, which includes our cognac and Canadian and Scotch whiskeys, we're up at a mid single-digit rate year-to-date. Courvoisier is up double digits on strong growth in the U.K., Canada and duty-free. While Canadian Club sales are off single-digits, the brand is gaining share in the U.S. in the Canadian whiskey segment, and Canadian Club ready-to-drink products are the fastest-growing RTD in Australia.
Sales of Teacher’s scotch are up at a double-digit rate on very strong growth in India and Brazil. Strong demand in the U.S. and the U.K. are helping drive double-digit sales growth for Laphroaig. 
As we approach the fourth quarter holiday season in Spirits, we have solid momentum in the U.S. market, and we're making progress in our key international markets. I would add here that given the success of our strategic investments, we're continuing with our increased year-over-year investments in our best growth and return opportunities, including our innovation pipeline and strategic brand-building programs. We believe this proactive approach, which includes a double-digit increase in brand investment this year, is positioning us well for sustainable long-term growth that outperforms the category.
On the OI margin front, we're continuing to target something in the range of 22.5%. While FX now appears largely neutral for the year, we'll be down from last year, largely due to both increased brand spend and the first quarter annualization of our international route to market investments. 
Now turning to Home and Security. As we've discussed throughout the year, our expectation for the home products market in 2010 has been low single-digit growth. While spending in the home products market on replace remodel, new construction and cabinetry was a little stronger than we expected in the first half, we clearly see things moderate here in the second half. 
Due to the pull-forward in demand we saw in the second quarter, combined with soft and uneven market conditions, we estimate spending on home products was off at a low single-digit rate here in the third quarter. And I would say to you, we don't see that changing here in Q4. And as a result, we now expect our home products market will be relatively flat for the full year. That includes an assumption that new construction spending will be up in the range of 5% to 10% for the year, with overall replace-remodel spending relatively flat, and spending for cabinetry, which is a big ticket discretionary purchase, off low to mid single-digits.
Looking at our numbers for the third quarter. Home and Security sales were $814 million, up 1%, reflecting the pull-forward into the second quarter due to expiration of the homebuyer tax credit in the U.S., offset by continued share gains and favorable product mix. I would highlight that year-to-date, sales are up 9%. 
Operating income before charges in Home and Security came in at $75 million, flat with the quarter a year ago. As we indicated last quarter, Q3 operating income in Home and Security reflected the impact of higher cost for materials and ocean freight, as well as our investments to support the start-up of significant new business we've recently won. These higher costs were offset by favorable resolution of patent litigation involving security products. 
Drilling down, we drove low to mid single-digit sales growth in all product categories except entry doors, which faced customer inventory reductions in the quarter.
Quarterly sales for Moen grew as gains at retail, strong growth in Canada and Asia and higher accessories demand more than offset lower sales in the wholesale channel that serves new construction. For our cabinet brands, strong gains at major home centers more than offset modestly lower sales in other channels of distribution. Overall, our Cabinet business is well positioned in the home center channel across customers and across price points, and we're benefiting from business we've won. We'll see even greater benefits in 2011 and beyond.
In windows and doors, Simonton Windows benefited from continued share gains and favorable product mix, driven by energy-efficient glass packages and new colored and painted frame products. While Therma-Tru also drove improved product mix in the quarter, channel inventory reductions pulled results lower following double-digit sales gains in Q2. 
In Security and Storage products, Master Lock grew on back-to-school shipments and expansion in adjacent security categories and in international markets. Waterloo was higher on gains in adjacent categories, including its successful new garage organization products.
As we look ahead in Home and Security, we feel we're in an excellent competitive position that will enable us to accelerate our performance as the housing market recovers. Recovery will obviously depend on several factors, including employment and consumer confidence, home prices and credit availability and the rate of foreclosures. That said, we're bullish on the housing market over the long run. The fact is population and immigration trends will drive demand for new housing units over the next 10 years, and the existing housing stock will obviously need to be remodeled, and more importantly, repaired. 
In the near term, the recovery remains uneven and consumers remain cautious. Here in the fourth quarter, we're facing the headwinds we've previously discussed. These headwinds include our higher strategic investments to support the rollout of major new business as well as higher year-over-year cost for certain commodities and transportation.
Looking at our expectations for the year, we previously told you to expect Home and Security to leverage in the range of 30%. We now expect that will be in the high 30s to low 40s, and we continue to expect that full year OI before charges margins will be in the range of two points better than the prior year. 
Now turning to Golf. Looking first at the market, we began the year with an expectation that worldwide spending in golf equipment would grow at a low single-digit rate for the year. That remains our view. Industry conditions are relatively flat in the U.S., with rounds of play down about 3.5% year-to-date as poor weather has impacted play in certain regions of the country including Florida and California. At the same time, we're continuing to see growth internationally, particularly in the Pac basin that's helping lift overall industry spending.
On a reported basis, Golf sales for the third quarter were $265 million, down 5%. On a comparable basis, in constant currency and excluding COBRA, sales were actually up 3%. Geographically, comparable sales were up at a single-digit rate in both the U.S. and in international markets. In constant currency, sales were lower in Europe, but up in Canada, Japan, Korea and China. 
Operating income before charges came in at $6 million, and that's down $4 million from the year-ago quarter. OI reflected the impact of seasonality, higher year-over-year investments that we told everyone to expect, and obviously, the divestiture of COBRA. 
Sales of golf balls were up slightly in the quarter and are flat year-to-date in constant currency. We're continuing to support our industry-leading golf ball franchise through a variety of platforms, including leadership on the worldwide professional tours, targeted advertising, our growing ball-fitting program and word-of-mouth through the Titleist team community of brand fans. 
Sales of Titleist clubs were up at a double-digit rate in the quarter and are up double-digits year-to-date. Continued strong shipments of the new Titleist AP1, AP2, CB and MB irons, as well as demand for Vokey wedges and Scotty Cameron putters helped drive the third quarter results.
While sales of FootJoy shoes were off at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, sales are up double digits for the nine months. We continue to see very strong acceptance of the new flagship ICON golf shoe, as well as the FootJoy sport line. Sales of gloves and accessories continued their solid growth in the quarter.
Here in Q4, as we've said many times before, the seasonality of Golf historically results in a fourth quarter loss in this business. This year will be no different. That said, we continue to expect that our full year margins in Golf will be a point or so better than last year. 
Overall, we feel very good about our competitive position. We've got great new products launching this quarter and early in 2011 and our investments are continuing to build our growth profile in key Asian markets. Now before I turn things back to Bruce, just a few additional items.
Reviewing gains and charges for the quarter. We recorded a gain of $9.9 million or $0.06 per share related to the completion of U.S. tax audits as well as select international tax matters. We recorded an after-tax charge of $12.4 million or $0.08 per share related to the divestiture of the nonstrategic local Spirits brands in Germany. And we recorded after-tax restructuring charges of $5.6 million or $0.04 per share, the majority of these restructuring charges for initiatives in our Spirits business that are focused on organizational streamlining. We also recorded modest charges primarily associated with completion of various supply chain initiatives in Home and Security.
With regard to our tax rate, our third quarter rate on a before charges/gains basis came in at 27%. Our target for our full year rate remains in the 26% to 27% range. 
Now turning to cash flow. We've raised our target for free cash flow for 2010 to the range of $625 million to $700 million. That's up from the $525 million to $600 million, due principally to our better working capital position and what will be the timing of capital expenditures. 
A few points on this. First, our 2010 free cash flow is benefiting from a 200 to 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in working capital efficiency, driven by progress across all three of our businesses. Second, this target represents an earning to free cash flow conversion rate well in excess of 100%. Third, our full year target includes $130 million to $140 million of proceeds from asset sales, and that's principally related to our COBRA and German Spirits brands dispositions. And lastly, I'd highlight to everybody and remind everyone that debt reduction remains a priority for the use of our free cash flow. 
So with that, let me now turn it back to Bruce."

As we look ahead, we continue to expect that the economic recovery will be gradual and uneven, with the Spirits and Golf markets likely to grow in the low single-digit range of the full year and the likelihood that our Home Products market will be relatively flat. The proactive steps we took during the downturn and the investments we're making at the front-end of the recovery have put Fortune Brands in a very strong competitive position. 
Trusted brands, combined with strong innovation, customer wins, strategic brand investments and global expansion initiatives are helping drive broad-based share gains. The leverage of our lower cost structures is helping the bottom line and our sharp focus on cash is helping fortify our balance sheet. Fortune Brands remains on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2010 and results within our full year target range of $2.60 to $2.90 in diluted earnings per share before charges and gains. That's versus $2.43 in 2009.
Factoring previously discussed headwinds, including higher raw material costs, our increased strategic investments and comparisons to last year's improving results, our results are tracking towards the middle of our target range. We believe we are well positioned to continue our momentum in the marketplace, leverage our lower cost structures and deliver continued earnings growth and improved returns as the economy continues to recover.

About 40% new construction, about 11% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we're down about 15%. So obviously, that was where the significant volatility really happened.

It fits very well with our infrastructure. So I think you're going to see us continue especially in the cabinetry and the garage storage area to exceed the marketplace. Now it'll take time to mature. And I think, as you know, new business going to the store doesn't mean that all of a sudden the consumers are going to rally behind you. But we have initiatives to drive the consumers there as well. And the early signs of some of these has been excellent, especially Martha Stewart program at Home Depot. We've seen fabulous results early on."

Biggest gains are in the home centers just because of the -- when you get gains there, they're big in quantity and size just because of the nature of the level of the stores, where at the dealer channel, it's more incremental because it's a smaller customer environment. But we're winning across the board. We brought out new programs for our dealer channel earlier this year, which have created a number of wins.

Premiumization has picked up again, almost a full point this quarter. We're also seeing on-premise growing again. I wouldn't say back to the level it was, but definitely momentum towards getting back to the level it was. So the signs in the Spirit business in the U.S. are very healthy. If you go to Western Europe, it's a little bit more challenging. Germany is probably the best of the bunch. But Spain continues to be a challenge. That's a heavy on-premise market, almost 80% on-premise. That market continues to be down mid single-digit. Again, there, you don't get much price utilization. It's a very competitive market today. U.K., which is pretty much 80% off-premise and with big retailers that dominate, there's always been pricing pressure there. That's nothing unusual there.

And this presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to the most closely comparable GAAP measure in our news release or on our website in the Supplemental Information linked to the webcast page.
 Fortune Brands' third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and the company remains on track to deliver strong results for the full year. Our results reflect the headwinds we publicly projected three months ago, including the acceleration of demand into the second quarter due to the expiration of the U.S. homebuyer tax credit and the timing of spirit orders. Higher cost of raw materials and increased strategic investments, we're making for long-term profitable growth. These investments which include support for new businesses we've recently won, new product innovations, long-term brand building and international growth initiatives are already delivering results. Importantly, our brands continue to perform very well in the marketplace and are well positioned for the future.
 In Spirits, new products and successful strategic investments are fueling of momentum in the United States, as we see the positive impact of recent initiatives. We're also making progress in challenging global markets and growing strongly in priority emerging markets, such as India and Brazil.
 Even as the Home Products market has softened, we're outperforming the market and also winning profitable new business in the cabinetry, faucet and garage organization categories that will enhance our prospects in 2011 and beyond. Our initiatives have positioned us very well to accelerate growth when the housing market recovers.
 And in Golf, we've driven year-to-date growth in all product categories. We're continuing to expand strongly in key Asian markets, and the fourth quarter launch of the advanced-technology new Titleist 910 driver will build on a very successful year of new product introductions.
 Now let's take a closer look at the numbers for the quarter. Net sales were slightly higher at $1.7 billion and reflect the adverse impact of the pull-forward we've discussed. Sales were up 1% on a comparable basis. That measure excludes excise tax, foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestitures. By brand group, comparable net sales were up 2% in Spirits, up 1% in Home and Security, and up 3% in Golf. On a year-to-date basis, comparable sales for Fortune Brands are up 6%, driven by 5% growth in Spirits, 8% growth in Home and Security and 3% growth in Golf.
 Net income was $102.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Results included modest charges and gains, and Craig will touch on those a bit later. Excluding charges and gains, diluted earnings per share was $0.72. That's off 6% from $0.77 in the year-ago quarter. Note that we do not see the estimate pull forward of the -- we did see the estimated pull forward of a $0.10 to $0.15 bps from of the third quarter into the second quarter. Thus, if sales balance out, earnings per share before charges and gains would have been up solidly. Year-to-date, EPS before charges and gains is up 24%.
 Reported operating income came in at $176.8 million. On a before charges and gains basis, operating income was $206.4 million for the quarter. That's down 3%, reflecting our increased strategic investments, higher raw material costs and the pull-forward of demand in the second quarter that we've previously discussed. Year-to-date, OI before charges and gains is up 17%.
 Reviewing our assets and investment return measures, after-tax returns and net tangible assets before charges and gains was 17%. Working capital efficiency came in at 36%. Absent maturing inventories in Spirits, WC improved to 18%. Return on equity before charges and gains was 8%, and return on invested capital before charges and gains was 6%.
 Looking ahead, we continue to build on our long and successful track record for actively managing our brands in both good and challenging times. As we discussed before, during the downturn, we focused sharply on consumers, cost and cash. We continue to see the results of our focus here in 2010, including strong performance in the marketplace and the benefits of lean and flexible supply chains as demonstrated by our share gains and cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.
 We believe our proactive approach has enabled Fortune Brands to emerge from the recession in a strong position to outperform the current environment and to enhance the company's future prospects to help maximize long-term shareholder value.
 Let me take a few moments to dive a little deeper and focus today of the few of the things we're doing to win in the marketplace, including how we build on our strong foundation of trusted brands with increased investments to seize competitive advantage in our consumer markets.
 First, in our Spirits business. We've invested in building and gaining control over our global routes to market. We've also invested in our new product development pipeline and in our marketing capabilities. These investments have enabled us to bring new products and new brand-building marketing programs to market much faster. Our Innovations have brought exciting new energy to the bourbon category. Red Stag by Jim Beam is attracting new consumers to bourbon. We're continuing to expand the Red Stag distribution in the United States and preparing to launch it in key international markets. At the same time, Maker's 46 is off to a tremendous start. And the relaunch Jim Beam Black is adding to our gains in the category.
 Let me add that Cruzan 9, an excellent new spiced rum is tracking at double our initial expectations. In our international business, the new Teacher's Origin scotch whiskey is adding some strong growth in India. DYC 8 and Larios scrub [ph] are doing well in the challenging Spanish market. Importantly, our innovations are also driving favorable mix. These are all value-added line extensions that sell at a premium to the core product. And we are even more in the pipeline. Courvoisier is the first of the four major houses of cognac to introduce their product with a declared age statement. Courvoisier 12-year-old and Courvoisier 21-year-old are hitting store shelves this month. Look for the new and upgraded single-barrel reserve in the months ahead. And we have even more innovative plans for introduction throughout 2011.
 Our investments to both elevate our marketing organization and impactful brand-building programs are creating a new energy around our brands. As we've discussed previously, we're significantly increasing the dollars devoted to digital media, including, for Jim Beam, multi-platform partnership with ESPN for iPhone apps and for new TV and online advertising for Hornitos Tequila.
 Canadian Club has a prominent placement in two of this season's hottest TV series: AMC's Mad Men and HBO's Boardwalk Empire, and it's also returned to TV advertising in its native Canada. EFFEN Vodka boosted its profile in the New York market and to top-tier media as the official vodka of fashion week. And Maker's Mark launch is first ever international media campaign in Europe.
 In Home and security, our track record of innovation and the proactive approach we've taken to manufacturing excellence, customer service and supply chain flexibility is leading to important new customer business. And our investments in new products and international expansion are further helping us outperform the market. Our Cabinetry business is on a roll, putting together an impressive winning streak of profitable new business across channels of distribution.
 While some of these programs are just beginning to roll out, they're already helping us gain market share, and when complete, they will add even more meaningful to our results in 2011, 2012 and beyond. Just this month, we'll be enrolling out a major cabinetry program at Lowe's that will result in our business producing the vast majority of both finished and unfinished in-stock cabinetry offerings for Lowe's stores. And we're installing new selling centers in the top 650 stores by year end to support our Diamond Prelude cabinetry line. That's on top of a Vendi [ph] program we recently launched in nearly 200 northeastern Lowe's stores.
 In September, we began taking orders for new market Martha Stewart Living cabinetry at the Home Depot. This program rolled out to all the nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores simultaneously, and it's already exceeding our expectations. In the current quarter, we've extended the launch of Martha Stewart Living cabinetry to Canada. We've also completed the rollout of Thomasville cabinetry at all Home Depot's Canadian stores and at the core high-end semi-custom brand at Home Depot's top 440 U.S. stores.
 We also have exciting new products launch forthcoming in early 2011 in the dealer channel where we have a very strong leadership position. And Waterloo has won significant new business that will roll out in 2011, featuring its innovative garage organization platform in 16-foot sets at all Home Depot stores.
 The momentum of our home products and brands is reflected in a number of best-in-class awards we've recently earned. This include the EPA WaterSense Manufacturing Partner of the Year for Moen, the highest satisfaction for windows and doors and patio doors among consumers, builders and remodelers for Simonton in the latest J.D. Power and Associates study, and a major industry award for value, quality and energy efficiency for Therma-Tru, and multiple vendor of the year awards in cabinetry.
 On the innovation front, we're supporting these new cabinetry lines with innovative features and organizational solutions. Additionally, Moen's new spot-resistant finish launched in the quarter is rolling out. And the number one faucet brand in North America continues to rollout new eco performance offerings for the kitchen, the shower and bath. Simonton is fueling growth and adding value with an exterior frame colors and energy-efficient glass packages. And Master Lock strategy of growing in adjacent security categories including door hardware and commercial safety continues to pay off. These also include innovations like the speed dial padlock, which are driving new demand and favorable mix.
 Internationally in Home and Security, Moen is on track to add 135 new showrooms and open up more than 40 new markets in China this year, while also continuing to build its emerging Indian business and its Latin America presence. In addition to our cabinetry gains in Canada, Moen is also growing in the Canadian market. Master Lock's focus on new growth opportunities is fueling gains in Europe, Latin America and China.
 In Golf, our focus on both innovation and international expansion is strengthening our industry leadership. The Titleist Pro V1 golf ball continues to lead the field in the marketplace and on the worldwide professional tours. Two weeks ago, the Pro V1 celebrated its 10th anniversary, and one week later, we began testing the sixth generation of the Pro V1 on the worldwide professional tour. The next-generation Pro V1 has already been on tour and will be launched in early 2011.
 FootJoy's innovation such as the new flagship ICON golf shoe line and the sports line has given new momentum in 2010. We're also excited about FootJoy's successful expansion to perform its outerwear, the new FootJoy layering system, with a tagline, ""make everyday playable,"" launched in the quarter and we're seeing very strong initial demand. We've also introduced golf clubs and ball models designed specifically for the Japanese market. The Titleist DT #3 driver and golf balls are tailored to the swing characteristics of Japanese players, and they help drive share gains for us in that market.
 As I mentioned earlier, we're excited about the launch next month of the sore proven Titleist 910 driver. The 910 driver features the fastest, most stable head design Titleist has ever created. And the new patented technology allows a loft and lie to be independently adjusted, taking precision fitting to a new level. We will also launch 910 fairways and hybrids early in 2011.
 Internationally, our ongoing investments to build our sales and marketing infrastructure in key growth markets such as Korea, China, Japan and Australia are delivering results and positioning us for business for long-term growth. We also completed a Titleist Ball Plant IV in Thailand, which supplements our ball plants in Massachusetts, enables us to serve key Asian markets very effectively.
 Underpinning each of our three businesses is a winning organizational structure with lean cost and flexible supply chains that enable us to deliver operating margins at or near the top of our industry and provide fuel for growth. Our businesses continue to further enhance our competitive position, with initiatives that enhance the productivity including lean manufacturing, product platform simplification, global sourcing and automated ordering of materials.
 Just look at our Home and Security business, for example. Thanks to supply chain enhancements and productivity initiatives we accelerated and reductions in facilities during the downturn, we're in a position to take on new business with a lower cost structure. And as the home products market recovers, we'll be able to ramp up further and leverage extreme well.
 Lastly, we've made some incremental moves to sharpen the focus of our Spirits portfolio. In the quarter, we divested three local nonstrategic Spirit brands in Germany. That transaction will enable us to focus all of our resources in Germany on the growth of our global premium brands in that market.
 Earlier this month, we announced agreement to sell the nonstrategic Coburn core brand to the family company that already owns the brand's production assets. We also announced that we are entering into a distribution arrangement with pasture organic liquors brands in the United States.
 Now here is Craig with a closer look at our markets and the third quarter performance in each of our segments.
"
249999,114143126,86278,"Fortune Brands Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Suntory Global Spirits Inc.","Executives"," All right. Thanks, Bruce. Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%",2177," All right. Thanks, Bruce. Starting with Spirits and the overall market. Our assumption continues to be that the global Spirits markets will grow in the range of 1% to 2% for the year. Geographically, we expect the U.S. market will grow in the range of 2%,  benefiting from more favorable industry conditions. In Europe, the U.K. and German markets should be up in the range of 1% to 2%. Spain will be lower, but continuing to improve. While the markets will likely be relatively flat in Australia, we continue to expect strong market growth in the BRIC countries, as well as across Southeast Asia and global duty-free.
 Looking at our numbers for the quarter, Spirits sales reached a third quarter record at $643 million, that's up 1%. Importantly, on a comparable basis, sales were up 2% and case volumes were also up 2% in the quarter.
 On a year-to-date basis, our comparable sales and case volumes are both up 5% and benefiting modestly from timing and the year-over-year impact of our Maxxium reorganization of international markets. As we indicated three months ago, the timing of sales in various markets and higher bulk sales hold some revenues and case volume forward from the third quarter into the second.
 Turning to operating income. OI before charges was $146 million, down 2%, reflecting the increased strategic investments we've discussed throughout the year. On a comparable basis, OI was off 3%.
 Looking at the performance of our key brands on a year-to-date basis, each of our three Spirits consumer categories in constant currency and excluding excise taxes is up in net sales. In bourbon, where we're the global leader, our brands are up at a low single-digit rate worldwide. Red Stag and Jim Beam Black continue to support solid performance for Jim Beam in the U.S. Internationally, strong momentum for Jim Beam in Germany and other European markets is partly offsetting challenging market conditions in Australia.
 Maker’s Mark is growing at a double-digit rate in the U.S., as well as in its expanding international markets. Our Knob Creek continues to grow at a double-digit range and we're seeing strong growth for our Rye whiskeys as well. In mixables, our sales are up low single-digits. This category includes tequila, rum, vodka, gin and cordials.
 Gains for Sauza and Hornitos Tequila in the U.S. are offsetting lower results in Mexico. Nielsen sell-through date indicates that Sauza is continuing to outperform in the U.S. tequila market, importantly in both dollars and volume, with share gains across multiple Sauza variants. We continue to drive strong growth and share gains for Cruzan rum as we raise the profile of the brand in the U.S. EFFEN Vodka is building momentum as we expand distribution and our economy vodkas are also continuing to perform well. And in cordials, higher sales for sours in Europe are partly offsetting lower sales for the DeKuyper in the U.S.
 In the classics category, which includes our cognac and Canadian and Scotch whiskeys, we're up at a mid single-digit rate year-to-date. Courvoisier is up double digits on strong growth in the U.K., Canada and duty-free, while Canadian Club sales are up single-digits. The brand is gaining share in the U.S. in the Canadian whiskey segment, and Canadian Club ready-to-drink products are the fastest-growing RTD in Australia.
 Sales of Teacher’s scotch are up at a double-digit rate on very strong growth in India and Brazil. Strong demand in the U.S. and the U.K. are helping drive double-digit sales growth for Laphroaig.
 As we approach the fourth quarter holiday season in Spirits, we have solid momentum in the U.S. market and we're making progress in our key international markets. I would add here that given the success of our strategic investments, we're continuing with our increased year-over-year investments in our best growth and return opportunities, including our innovation pipeline and strategic brand-building programs. We believe this proactive approach, which includes a double-digit increase in brand investment this year is positioning us well for sustainable long-term growth that outperforms the category.
 On the OI margin front, we're continuing to target something in the range of 22.5%. While FX now appears largely neutral for the year, we'll be down from last year, largely due to both increased brand spend and the first quarter annualization of our international route to market investments.
 Now turning to Home and Security. As we've discussed throughout the year, our expectation for the home products market in 2010 has been low single-digit growth. While spending in the home products market on replace remodel, new construction and cabinetry was a little stronger than we expected in the first half, we clearly see things moderate here in the second half.
 Due to the pull-forward in demand we saw in the second quarter, combined with soft and uneven market conditions, we estimate spending on home products was off at a low single-digit rate here in the third quarter. And I would say to you, we don't see that changing here in Q4. And as a result, we now expect our home products market will be relatively flat for the full year. That includes an assumption that new construction spending will be up in the range of 5% to 10% for the year, with overall replace-remodel spending relatively flat. And spending for cabinetry, which is a big ticket discretionary purchase, off low to mid single-digits.
 Looking at our numbers for the third quarter. Home and Security sales were $814 million, up 1%,  reflecting the pull-forward into the second quarter due to expiration of the home buyer tax credit in the U.S., offset by continued share gains and favorable product mix. I would highlight that year-to-date, sales are up 9%.
 Operating income before charges in Home and Security came in at $75 million, flat with the quarter a year ago. As we indicated last quarter, Q3 operating income in Home and Security reflected the impact of higher cost for materials and ocean freight, as well as our investments to support the start-up of significant new business we've recently won. These higher costs were offset by favorable resolution of patent litigation involving security products.
 Drilling down, we drove low to mid single-digit sales growth in all product categories except entry doors, which faced customer inventory reductions in the quarter.
 Quarterly sales for Moen grew as gains at retail, strong growth in Canada and Asia and higher accessories demand, more than offset lower sales in the wholesale channel that serve new construction. For our cabinet brands, strong gains at major home centers more than offset modestly lower sales in other channels of distribution. Overall, our Cabinet business is well positioned in the home center channel across customers and across price points, and we're benefiting from business we've won. We'll see even greater benefits in 2011 and beyond.
 In windows and doors, Simonton Windows benefited from continued share gains and favorable product mix, driven by energy-efficient glass packages and new colored and painted frame products. While Therma-Tru also drove improved product mix in the quarter, channel inventory reductions pulled results lower following double-digit sales gains in Q2.
 In Security and Storage products, Master Lock grew on back-to-school shipments and expansion in adjacent security categories and in international markets. Waterloo was higher on gains in adjacent categories, including its successful new garage organization products.
 As we look ahead in Home and Security, we feel we're in an excellent competitive position that will enable us to accelerate our performance as the housing market recovers. Recovery will obviously depend on several factors, including employment and consumer confidence, home prices and credit availability and the rate of foreclosures. That said, we're bullish on the housing market over the long run. The fact is population and immigration trends will drive demand for new housing units over the next 10 years, and the existing housing stock will obviously need to be remodeled, and more importantly, repaired.
 In the near term, the recovery remains uneven and consumers remain cautious. Here in the fourth quarter, we're facing the headwinds we've previously discussed. These headwinds include our higher strategic investments to support the rollout of major new business as well as higher year-over-year cost for certain commodities and transportation.
 Looking at our expectations for the year, we previously told you to expect Home and Security to leverage in the range of 30%. We now expect that will be in the high 30s to low 40s, and we continue to expect that full year OI before charges margins will be in the range of two points better than the prior year.
 Now turning to Golf. Looking first at the market, we began the year with an expectation that worldwide spending in golf equipment would grow at a low single-digit rate for the year. That remains our view. Industry conditions are relatively flat in the U.S., with rounds of play down about 3.5% year-to-date as poor weather has impacted play in regions of the country including Florida and California. At the same time, we're continuing to see growth internationally, particularly in the packed basin that's helping lift overall industry spending.
 On a reported basis, Golf sales for the third quarter were $265 million, down 5%. On a comparable basis, in constant currency and excluding COBRA, sales were actually up 3%. Geographically, comparable sales were up at a single-digit rate in both the U.S. and international markets. In constant currency, sales were lower in Europe, but up in Canada, Japan, Korea and China.
 Operating income before charges came in at $6 million, and that's down $4 million from the year-ago quarter. OI reflected the impact of seasonality, higher year-over-year investments that we told everyone to expect, and obviously, the divestiture of COBRA.
 Sales of golf balls were up slightly in the quarter and are flat year-to-date in constant currency. We're continuing to support our industry-leading golf ball franchise through a variety of platforms, including leadership on the worldwide professional tours, targeted advertising, our growing ball-fitting program and word-of-mouth through the Titleist team community of brand fans.
 Sales of Titleist clubs were up at a double-digit rate in the quarter and are up double-digits year-to-date. Continued strong shipments of the new Titleist AP1, AP2, CB and MB irons, as well as demand for Vokey wedges and Scotty Cameron puttershelped drive the third quarter results.
 While sales of FootJoy shoes were off at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, sales are up double-digits for the nine months. We continue to see very strong acceptance with a new flagship ICON golf shoe, as well as the FootJoy sport line. Sales of gloves and accessories continued their solid growth in the quarter.
 Here in Q4, as we've said many times before, the seasonality of Golf historically results in a fourth quarter loss in this business. This year will be no different. That said, we continue to expect that our full year margins in Golf will be a point or so better than last year.
 Overall, we feel very good about our competitive position. We've got great new products launching this quarter and early in 2011 and our investments are continuing to build our growth profile in key Asian markets. Now before I turn things back to Bruce, just a few additional items.
 Reviewing gains and charges for the quarter. We recorded a gain of $9.9 million or $0.06 per share related to the completion of U.S. tax audits as well as select international tax matters. We recorded an after-tax charge of $12.4 million or $0.08 per share related to the divestiture of the nonstrategic local Spirits brands in Germany. And we recorded after-tax restructuring charges of $5.6 million or $0.04 per share. The majority of these restructuring charges for initiatives in our Spirits business that are focused on organizational streamlining. We also recorded modest charges primarily associated with completion of various supply chain initiatives in Home and Security.
 With regard to our tax rate, our third quarter rate on a before charges/gains basis came in at 27%. Our target for our full year rate remains in the 26% to 27% range.
 Now turning to cash flow. We've raised our target for free cash flow for 2010 to the range of $625 million to $700 million. That's up from the $525 million to $600 million, due principally to our better working capital position and what will be the timing of capital expenditures.
 A few points on this. First, our 2010 free cash flow is benefiting from a 200 to 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in working capital efficiency, driven by progress across all three of our businesses. Second, this target represents an earning to free cash flow conversion rate well in excess of 100%. Third, our full year target includes $130 million to $140 million of proceeds from asset sales, and that's principally related to our COBRA and German Spirits brands dispositions. And lastly, I'd highlight to everybody and remind everyone that debt reduction remains a priority for the use of our free cash flow.
 So with that, let me now turn it back over to Bruce.

As we look ahead, we continue to expect that the economic recovery will be gradual and uneven, with the Spirits and Golf markets likely to grow in the low single-digit range of the full year and the likelihood that our Home Products market will be relatively flat. The proactive steps we took during the downturn and the investments we're making at the front-end of the recovery have put Fortune Brands in a very strong competitive position.
 Trusted brands, combined with strong innovation, customer wins, strategic brand investments and global expansion initiatives are helping drive broad-based share gains. The leverage of our lower cost structures is helping the bottom line and our focus on cash is helping fortify our balance sheet. Fortune Brands remain on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2010. And results within our full year target range of $2.60 to $2.90 in diluted earnings per share before charges and gains, that's versus $2.43 in 2009.
 Factoring previously discussed headwinds, including higher raw material costs, our increased strategic investments in comparison to last year's improving results are results attracting towards the middle of our target range. We believe we are well positioned to continue our momentum in the marketplace, leverage our lower cost structures and deliver continued earnings growth and improve returns as the economy continues to recover.
 Thank you, again, for joining us. Now Craig and I would be happy to take your questions.

Again, we came off the tax credit in the April time frame. And we saw a continuation -- because our products are more in the back-end of new home construction or the remodeling project, we saw a continuation of those orders through May, and then it started to drift down in June and that continued through July, August and September. A little bit of pickup here in September, but I don't think it's anything that's notable. So if you look at basically the home construction market, we started the first quarter, we're up roughly, we think, and I'm talking about the market now. About 40% new construction, about 11% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we're down about 15%. So obviously, that was where the significant volatility really happened. R&R was pretty much flat across the board. We're down a little bit in the first quarter, up both in the second and third quarter is how we view the market. Higher discretion items like cabinetries, big ticket remodeling items are tracking, maybe 3%, 4%, and that continued pretty much throughout the year.

It's just this year has been a banner year for us. And one of the things, we came into the year saying that our expectation was that commodities were going to be a more significant issue.

And that's our continued philosophy. So what we're seeing is we're seeing gains right across all of our channels in cabinetry. The biggest gains are in the home centers just because of the -- when you get gains there, they're big in quantity and size just because of the nature of the level of the stores. Where at the dealer channel, it's more incremental because it's a smaller customer environment. But we're winning across the board. And we brought out new programs for our dealer channel earlier this year, which have created a number of wins. We have some new innovation coming in, in the first quarter for the dealer network in '11, which we were excited about there, excited about and they've got a preview with that.

And U.S. obviously being the biggest profit pool is probably the one that you're most focused on. U.S. market, we saw a lot of promotion early or late last year, early part of this year. That definitely settled down. We are coming in to the biggest season right now, the Christmas season. So we'll see how that plays out. The mix has gotten better. Premiumization has picked up again, almost a full point this quarter. We're also seeing on-premise growing again. I wouldn't say back to the level it was, but definitely momentum towards getting back to the level it was. So the signs in the Spirit business in the U.S. are very healthy. If you go to Western Europe, it's a little bit more challenging. Germany is probably the best of the bunch. But Spain continues to be a challenge. That's a heavy on-premise market, almost 80% on-premise. That market continues to be down mid single-digit. Again, there, you don't get much price utilization. It's a very competitive market today. U.K., which is pretty much 80% off-premise and with big retailers that dominate, there's always been pricing pressure there. That's nothing unusual there. In emerging markets, there is price availability. So that's basically a summary of the markets.

Moen inventory is in pretty good shape on the retail side. On the wholesale side, we saw some destocking at wholesalers in the third quarter. Basically, I believe they did build up in the first couple of quarters anticipating the volume. And when I came with the acceleration of the tax credit activity related to the tax credit, and with that inventory build, I think they were in the mentality that we don't want to miss an order. So we've seen some of that lead off. Same thing is true with the Therma-Tru or the door business, which is, again, majority goes to distribution. We saw a buildup of inventory in the first half, and as a result, showed -- that has been bleeding off here in the third quarter, getting better and balanced.

I mean, we obviously had pull-forward in Spain because of what was going to be the VAT increase there. We had some acceleration of customer orders down in Mexico.

The 22.5% that we're saying or targeting are to be in that range versus the number we had last year. The differential there is primarily a function of the increase, the double-digit increase in brand spend, as well as the annualization of route-to-market. We obviously, I mean, do have as we outlined earlier in the year, we made some strategic decisions on pricing. Last year, we had a very strong year in terms of price benefit. And as we got toward the end of the year, we decided that because of what was going on with competition that there was a level of price repositioning that we wanted to do. So that's a little bit of a factor in there as well.
