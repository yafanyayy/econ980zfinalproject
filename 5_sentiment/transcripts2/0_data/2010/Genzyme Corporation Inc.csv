Mike Wyzga, our Chief Financial Officer; also Geof McDonough, our genetic disease area, he will be making some comments; John Butler, the renal area; and Mark Enyedy of the oncology and transplant area. All of them will make some comments. David Meeker is here. He will respond to comments related to manufacturing, and also matters and Pam Williamson, who's the head of our Global Regulatory Affairs side and she will make comments on anything related to regulatory affairs.2009 was a challenging year and I think all of us are very familiar with how challenging it was. But it was a year where the challenge was extremely well identified and very well defined. So we knew what we had to do and we knew what we had to overcome. And 2010 is a year where we are very significantly recovering from the effects of this manufacturing interruption that we experienced. There were three areas that were impacted in particular here. One of it is Cerezyme, where we could not continue to supply all patients through last year. We started the production of Cerezyme in the August, September timeframe and we started to get product out. We started to ship the new product to patients in the December timeframe. And we're now two months into that experience and I have to say it's a very good experience. 85% of the patients in the U.S. are back on therapy and we expect that to continue to grow. We are experiencing good manufacturing productivity and we expect that also to continue to grow this year but there was a very good start up after this moment of sanitizing the plant extremely good result. We are introducing inventory buffer into the system that allows us to better work with patients in over 100 countries to schedule their fusion  enzyme [ph]. All in all, a very, very positive moment of recovery year, that bodes well for the remainder of the year, bodes well for the market share of Cerezyme in this space. Fabrazyme has a slower recovery cycle, mainly because of the low productivity after the restart of the production of Fabrazyme. We talked about this together a few times, and we worked of course all along extremely hard to precisely identify what it is that causing this low productivity, as compared to our historical experience. We identified that the working cell bank is the culprit here. We introduced a new working cell bank into the back of Fabrazyme in the early part of last year and we have been working now very hard since September last year in a very comprehensive way to develop a new working cell that it's more productive. We think we have succeeded and we've now introduced this new shorter [ph] working cell bank into 2000 liter reactor, one of them, and we will also put into the next one, once that's over again. And that will make, if we do get the kind of productivity that we are experiencing at a much smaller scale, that would very, very significantly change the picture on Fabrazyme. Actually, it will turn that picture around materially. And we would expect the output of this new cell bank first to become available in the June timeframe as output of this first reactor is becoming released product. We need to work with regulators around the world to make sure that everybody's comfortable business changed. The change that we didn't make was really based on how we use to do things in the past and we expect that we will get a pretty good hearing on this. In any the case, we are confident enough that we are actually implementing this new cell bank at this time. And so, that's a very important development around Fabrazyme, that I feel extremely encourage about and I'm sure marketplace and patients are also looking forward to the results of this. The third element was Lumizyme. Lumizyme was delayed for a number of years. We've all talked about this many times. It was a very expensive delay. We are supplying probably free of charge to very severely impacted Pompe patients in the U.S. now for a few years. And then we were able to file in December, again, BLA, modified BLA that was based on the early filings and we got a PDUFA date of June 17 for this year. We are basing our assumptions for Myozyme Lumizyme revenues in the guidance that you have seen and introduction in an improved state of Lumizyme in the United States starting in July, so we look forward to that there are no changes that I have become aware of in this in terms of the interaction with the FDA. We are very confident that indeed, this is very good possibility that we will get approval after June time frame. And maybe whenever everybody's ready because in talking with the FDA about the need for this product to become more broadly available in the United States, I have to say we are very much aligned with the agency to make sure that we do what's right to make this product available, so hopefully we can do it even, potentially little bit earlier than the June timeframe.So these are the three things that helped us back. That was the Cerezyme picture, Fabrazyme picture, the Lumizyme picture and I say all of them at this stage as compared to six months ago, all this stage, are finding a very good traction and that bodes well for 2010. Also causes, of course, is a relatively steep curve on the earnings side during the year and that was described in the press release. We would expect to exit the year at about $1 a share, non-GAAP, but including amortization. And that's clearly all the steep curve versus the early part of the year. And we worked very hard, also on improving our ability and increasing our capability to manufacture both in terms of basic capacity and redundancy of capacity that is requiring investments both in people and in equipment and plant. And we are quite determined to make sure that the total manufacturing picture is at the complete different level once we are done with it. So we don't have the kind of interruption that we experienced last year. We changed the leadership of the manufacturing operations and you've heard announcements around that Ron Branning, joined us from Gilead's, where he was the Chief Compliance Officer in charge of all quality control efforts. He was also six, seven years with Genentech. Excellent individual with a lot of experience in very complex manufacturing circumstances. And we're very fortunate to attract Scott Canute, who was President of manufacturing for Eli Lilly and helped guide them through very difficult period when they have their challenges. And he will be on board with us, March 1.And beyond the things that I mentioned, which are all LSD, lysosomal storage disease products, and there are number of processing and hopefully they will come up during today's call because they are remarkable. And as you see from the guidance, the Hemo business or the GTO business, the Oncology business, including Thymoglobulin, which has a big oncology component globally is encouraging [ph] on $800 million next year, very positive growth rate and becoming very material and it is actually the first year that it started to make a significant bottomline contribution to the corporation. Renvela, in Europe, where we have half of the approval for CKD has a very interesting road ahead of it. The Genetic Diagnostic business has grown double digit over a number of years and again we are predicting that to happen this year. Very interesting is in the squamous [ph] cost and we are noticing an increasing interest by many of you in that product. It has a long ways to go in terms of its growth rate and in terms of its market penetration. And we will raise some comments about that during today as well. And our number of late stage programs that are making a progress and we are investing in that. You noticed a significant R&D increase year-on-year and part of that is the investment in these late stage programs. Alemtuzumab is one year away from opening up the first Phase III clinical trial that we hope will confirm the tremendous results that we seen in the Phase II. So next year and during this year, already we are starting to prepare ourselves to develop that market. And it is a very significant change in the marketplace going to once-a-year treatment versus the current practices. We reported on the infomercial earlier this quarter and we have two more trials that we will report on by mid-year. We will see the Ataluren results sometime in the first half of this year. And we saw and noted the excitement of the small molecule for Gaucher disease that where we are accruing two-phase clinical trial. So the core of the company and the new areas of the company are, both they fit think extremely well and they're very robust in the way that they're coming forward now. We are investing in those areas of the company that you know. We are not likely at this time to go outside for new investments, until we really are well on track with the businesses that we have already within the corporation this time. So with that, let me ask Mike Wyzga to run us through the financial results."
346012,78775783,50402,"Genzyme Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-17-2010",2010-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Genzyme Corporation, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Henry. As Henry mentioned, 2009 was a year of significant challenges for Genzyme. As we previously reported our full year revenue decreased by approximately $90 million on a year-to-year basis. Just to put this a little bit in perspective, our",1451,"Thank you, Henry. As Henry mentioned, 2009 was a year of significant challenges for Genzyme. As we previously reported our full year revenue decreased by approximately $90 million on a year-to-year basis. Just to put this a little bit in perspective, our volume reductions associated with the supply interruption reduced that topline by over $430 million year-to-year. Unfavorable currency impact further reduced the topline by additional $115 million. We did have increases in all of the areas, which helped us mitigate both the impact and softened the blow of the volume reductions, as well as the unfavorable currency. So our revenue came in as decrease of approximately 2%. As you could see from our earnings per share crosswalk, during the fourth quarter, our GAAP net income was $23 million. Now included in GAAP net income is a negative impact of approximately $21 million in pretax manufacturing and discrete items. These items predominately related to manufacturing inventory write-off. Our revised GAAP to non-GAAP crosswalk now excludes only the impact of acquisition-related charges that were associated with the oncology assets from Bayer, that was $47 million again in a pretax basis, as well as 123R stock option expenses of $48 million. Our Q4 non-GAAP net income was $83 million or $0.31 per diluted share. And for the full year, our non-GAAP net income was $621 million or $2.27 per diluted share. We already pre-announced our topline revenue at JPMorgan and those numbers haven't materially changed, but let me touch on a few other key points. The Genetic Disease segment, our largest segment was significantly impacted by the manufacturing supply interruption, net decreased 20% year-to-year. Within the Cardiometabolic and Renal segment including Thyrogen, it increased by about 6% on a year-on-year basis, including the transition of Renvela. Thyrogen's revenue increased by 15% and then ended the year with $171 million as Thyrogen's quickly becomes the standard of care for thyroid cancer testing. Within this franchise, as Henry touched on increased by about 25% and now it's due to the Synvisc-One sales. Since it's introduction in the United States Synvisc-One has also a very, very strong start and we expect to see that to continue in 2010. In the Hemo Oncology area, the revenue increased predominantly due to the Bayer transaction as well as the strong Mozobil revenue increases. The segment ended 2009 with revenue of about $300 million. As I mentioned in my opening, all the other segments increased by approximately double digits of revenue on a year-on-year basis. Kinetics and by 13%, Transplant by 17%. So again it's a nice balance. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the full year decreased to 71%. Lots of it associated with Allston plant shut down and the restart. Setting aside the manufacturing discrete item, our gross margin would've being approximately 73%. Within our operating expense our full-year non-GAAP R&D expenses were $804 million. The growth in R&D expenses focused on the two Phase III studies associated with MS, as well as the Cerezyme small molecule study. Our full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses were approximately $1.3 billion. Increases in SG&A including field sales and marketing components of the Bayer transaction, as well as the expenses associated with the Synvisc-One launch. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25% for the year. Our Q4 tax rate looks a little odd because it's represents the true for the full year amount, as well as the impact of the lower profits compared to our fixed tax benefits. Capital expenditures for the year were $662 million. Capital in 2009 was focused on our manufacturing infrastructure of Thymoglobulin, the cell culture expansion and the expansion of our Fill Finish line in Waterford, Ireland. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of securities approximately $1.1 billion in cash. Our stock repurchased for 2009 was 7.5 million shares or approximately $414 million. This leaves us with about 7 million shares remaining under our board authorized repurchased. So that close the books on 2009. Let me add a little more color on the 2010 guidance.As we move through our recovery period and gained momentum during the course of the year, we expect our total revenue to increase approximately $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion. We set the upper and lower range very purposely this year. The upper range of the revenue represents increased yields in Fabrazyme, accelerated approval of Lumizyme and maintenance of the Cerezyme market share. At the bottom end of our range, we excluded among other items the decreased in the budgeted euro rate. Our budgeted rate, at the time that we set our budgets was 1.5 on the euro. The bottom end of our range represent an estimated 1.4. So to that sort of gives you the book ends. Within the Genetic Disease segment, we expect to resupply and maintained Cerezyme as the market leader for the treatment of Gaucher's disease. And we expect the revenue to come in between $980 million to $1.04 billion. The Fabrazyme base revenue assumes a lower yield of the current cell line. Again, increased yields will move this revenue to the high-end of our guidance and perhaps a little beyond. Our revenue guidance in Fabrazyme is $360 million to $380 million. Lumizyme approval in the United States is another key event for us, as Henry mentioned our PDUFA date is in June. With approval, we eliminate the cause associated with the supply of free drug as capture the margins here in the United States. Our Lumizyme, Myozyme guidance for 2010 is $470 million to $500 million. Synvisc has revenue growth for us, as I mentioned, for 2009 and we expect that momentum to continue through 2010. Guidance in Synvisc area is $430 million to $450 million. With the ongoing rollout of our Renvela worldwide, we expect the revenue to increase in this area approximately 6% and after the range of $740 million to $770 million. The full year impact of the Bayer transaction and the Mozobil revenue will drive the Hemat [Hematologic Oncology] area to $775 million to $810 million, again that includes Thymoglobulin. I should note that there are five products within the segment which revenue expectations in excess of $100 million in 2010 so. We're really getting a lot of momentum there. There a number of moving of parts affecting our gross margin estimates. We are making significant investment, of this include quality and processing as Henry has mentioned significant improvement of our manufacturing operations this includes quality and process improvements, additional headcount and adding redundancy in a most of the aspects of our supply chain. And while these improvements expect to gain both stability and productivity in to a long haul. In the short term, this costs will impact our margins. The expenses as well as the product mix changes will impact our margins in 2010 and we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 71% to 73% of revenue. We're also focusing on non-GAAP SG&A expenses in a few major areas. One key initiative is the strengthening of our global sales and marketing around Fabrazyme and Cerezyme. We're also preparing for the launch Lumizyme here in the United States. With the success that we've seen to date and since this one, we'll be investing in a highly targeted efforts such as in house expenses consumer level marketing. I should note we also incur the full impact of the oncology products that we acquired from Bayer. With that all said, we expect our SG&A to increase to between $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion in 2010. Our non-GAAP R&D is expected to be in the order of $945 million to $960 million, again this is highly focused on the late stage and mistrials, as well as Gaucher's small molecule. With the increase in utilization of our foreign manufacturing, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to come in to a range of 27% to 28% on a profit before tax basis. Our weighted average shares are expected to be approximately 272 to 274 million shares. Our capital expenditures will come in about $600 million, and those will focus on infrastructure build. And we continue to focus and monitor our capital and return on capital, so that will be a major focus for us this your. We expect our cash flow return on capital to be coming around 13%. And while we expect Q1 to be relatively flat with Q4, earnings result as Henry's motion, is expected to deep [ph] throughout the year. Before you return your back to Henry, I'd like to remind you that you can find a line item detail or revenue and expense on our press release are also in our website. With that, let me stop and turn it back to Henry."

The Cardiometabolic and Renal positions to continue to provide significant growth in 2010. sevelamer revenues is expected to grow by more than 6%, but this number really doesn't reflect the strong underlying growth in demand. The volume in 2010 is expected to grow by more than 9% versus 2009. This lower revenue growth reflects lower net pricing in the U.S. due to accelerating conversion to Renvela and a lower price in Brazil, where our generic entrants has recently been introduced. Now volume growth in Brazil will remain strong as reinitials has been awarded the central supply contract with the federal government. The majority of the volume growth is coming from markets like Europe, launching Renvela with the CKD non-dialysis indication. In Latin America  and Asian market like Venezuela, Mexico, Russia and India, all still  at very low penetration rate. The's U.S. market will continue to grow from increased by the penetration of Renvela including the new powder formulation. We continue to work in the U.S. towards a final rule regarding phosphate finder's in the dialysis payment bundled. The dialysis community remains opposed and agreed that the best interest of patient has served physicians continue to select the product they believe is most appropriate clinically. However, we believe that we will be able to compete effectively in an environment where binders are included in the bundle. On the product development side, we know how to positive Phase III studies Mipomersen. And we will report data from the next two Phase III study by the middle of this year. We continue to work towards regulatory filing in the U.S and Europe by mid 2011. As a reminder, our first filling are targeting the homozygous FH patient, as well as severe hypercholesterolemia. Our market, we estimated over 25,000 patients in the U.S. and top five EU countries. We believe the data from our first two Phase III trials, the safety, tolerability and particularly the efficacy continue to support the strategy. We'll discuss the strategy with the FDA after we have all of our Phase III studies complete. Well we spoke to European authorities about the initial filing, we will seek formal scientific advice for study that will be necessary to expand our label to the heterozygous FH migration. We continue to do Pre- commercialization activities globally and we look forward to bringing this important product to patients in need. Henri?"

During the l",625,"Thanks, Henri. 2009 mark a year of significant progress with each of our business and Transplant, Oncology, MS and Genetic Services. We look forward to continuing that momentum into 2010, starting first with our Hematologic Oncology business. During the last 12 months, we solidify our base with the integration of our Transplant and Oncology businesses and the addition of three products from Bayer to create a single operating unit with six marketed products sold in over 90 countries around the world, generating in excess of $500 million in revenue. Going forward, as Mike mentioned, we will report revenues from this unit on a consolidated basis. In addition, we advance this portfolio on multiple front in 2009 from a development perspective with new data, including 90% abstracts at ASH, 40% of which were oral presentations. We substantially improved our financial picture with over 60% topline growth driven by the successful launch of Mozobil, the incremental revenue from Bayer and the significant growth of both Thymoglobulin and Clolar. So as we move into 2010, we look to build upon these positive trends with a focus in the following areas: First expanding global access for Mozobil through new registrations, name-patient programs and enhanced support for our existing markets; to these end the Mozobil launched continues to exceed our expectation in both the U.S. and the E.U. with Q4 revenue up almost 50% over Q3 driven by the U.K., Germany and the Nordic region where we've obtained official reimbursement. We've also seen strong name patient sale ahead of formal reimbursement authorization in several key markets, which we expect to obtain during 2010, including France, Italy and Spain. In the U.S, we've penetrated almost 100% of our target accounts and reorders now account for roughly 75% of our business, with an increasing share in the frontline setting. With regard to the remainder of the portfolio, in Q4, we saw more than 20% increases in the volume for both Campath and Fludara as well as increased in glucagon revenue during the quarter even as we work through the inventories we inherited from Bayer. We look to continue this trend in 2010 by repositioning Campath for high-risk patients, following FCR combination therapy and CLO, supporting the conversion of IV to oral Fludara in key markets and providing new data for Leukine. We will also further our efforts to optimize price for Thymoglobulin in selected geographies, substantial share of our business outside of the U.S. is in the hematology space and we look to lever our existing infrastructure to increase adoption in emerging markets such as China and Brazil. And we will continue the ongoing development clopreravine [ph] in multiple applications and support expanded access around the globe. Regarding multiple sclerosis, with enrollment completed ahead of schedule we remain on track to make available data from our Phase III program next year. In the interim, we will continue to publish long term data from our Phase II experience, which will include data of AAN in the second quarter with respect to the proportion of our patients that were clinically deceased three or four years mechanism of action studies with Alemtuzumab and four-year follow up data ITT cases from the Phase II study. Lastly, with regard to genetic services, we saw significant topline growth in each of our key segments. Reproductive and oncology testing during 2009. We expect this trend to continue in 2010 with multiple new test offerings in each segment, couple with improvements in our delivery platforms. We will also look to further integrate this business with our therapeutics portfolios to enhance the strategic value to the corporation. So we generated significant momentum with these businesses over the last year and look forward to updating you as these efforts progress in 2010."

We're obviously working through a dynamic period of recovery and activity in this marketplace. So my comments ca",1386,"Thank you, Henry. In making some comments about the Genetics Disease business, I'll speak in turn today about, Cerezyme Fabrazyme and Myozyme. We're obviously working through a dynamic period of recovery and activity in this marketplace. So my comments can be comprehensive, but I will highlight the areas of focus for us. Cerezyme closed the year with $793 million the fourth quarter marked the return of newly produced Cerezyme to the market, ending a period of several months of short supply for most patients with shipment at the end of December. As we said in December, the shipments were made to end the shortage period as quickly as possible for patients without a substantial working inventory position. We alerted the community to the risk of delays in the first quarter, as we work to match returning production with global demand from 5,500 patients in over 100 countries. In the first six weeks of the year, we have seen strong demand for Cerezyme, driven by rapid return to therapy for patients worldwide. As we mentioned in the release, we estimate this number to be about 85% of patients originally on Cerezyme. To give some insight to the way that figure rose up that country level, the U.S. had approximately 1500 patients on Commercial Cerezyme therapy before this crisis began, up from about 150 had switch, 90 are undecided and roughly 1260 or 85% have returned and will shortly  return to Cerezyme. These estimates because we do not have perfect insights of patient numbers and treatments status. And note that we will not report at this level of detail on patient numbers going forward, but I wanted in this period to provide transparency to the state of affairs in the marketplace. As Henry mentioned, production of Cerezyme in the bioreactor is up and running successfully with productivity levels above historical averages. Because we have built high [ph] to the manufacturing schedule to make system improvement and have increased the quality oversight process, still finish and quality inspection time for Cerezyme has been extended, resulting in relatively less Cerezyme being available for distribution in this early period of early period of the year than we had anticipated. In late January, early February, these longer manufacturing timelines for Cerezyme did cause a temporary disruption in our ability to ship Cerezyme to patients. The shipping delay caused some confusion and treatment interruption for many. It's critical that patients be able to depend on the regular availability of Cerezyme and it's clear from this initial experience in the year that we cannot reliably meet that goal working with little inventory. Therefore, we believe the best way to address this issue is to ship approximately 50% of current global demand for an eight-week or four infusion [ph] period by taking this step now proactively, we expect to build enough inventory to allow predictable schedules for Cerezyme delivery in the coming months and throughout the remainder of 2010. In the coming days, we'll be working with physicians, patients and regulatory authorities around the world to ensure that the shipping plan over the next core infusion is implemented as smoothly as possible. Shipments at full dose and normal intervals are expected to resume after this eight-week or core infusion period. Beyond supply has been active period in the broader Gaucher space. As many of you know the recent world meeting in Miami provided greater insight to the evolving landscape of therapeutic options for Gaucher disease. From the perspective of the ERC topline data from the ERC and development did not provide any surprises. Given the timelines necessary to demonstrate clinical impact bone disease, we continue to believe that current evidence based for Cerezyme will support its place as the gold standard in the field. There was considerable emphasis on the apparent differences and antibody formation among the enzymes and we expect that when the anti-body methodology is clarified and ultimately standardize these will be affirmative. We don't believe that there's an unmet need from a safety perspective when we review the over 40,000 patient years of experience with Cerezyme to date. Finally, the world meeting provided a venue for the two-year data on  eliglustat tartrate formally known as Genz-112638, are capsule in development. We were pleased to announce that follow-up data on 20 patients and two years demonstrated a continued improvement in all endpoints when compared to baseline with special emphasis on the impact on the bone. We observed a consistent response in both the mineral marrow compartment as measured by bone density in marrow dark matter on MRI theater. The changes observed were comparable to results achieved historically with Cerezyme four to six years. The Phase III studies for eliglustat tartrate are currently enrolling. Our Gaucher portfolio well-positioned to maintain our leadership in the field going forward. With respect to Fabrazyme, we closed the year with revenues of $430 million. As Henri mentioned, we continue to work through a series of intervention to restore productivity, which will be evaluable by early May this year. I believe we can gain confidence from the fact that we know understand the productivity problem and taken definitive steps to. address it. In the meantime, we've combined the effect of longer manufacturing cycle times and the time to require to restart Fill Finish operations at Austin have cost us to extend the period of 30% allocation through the end of May this year. As I mentioned in December last year, we have seen a number of early switches to Fabrazyme dosing to supply 1 milligram per kilogram for the most severely affected patients. We have seen a small incremental number of switches as physicians respond to disease progression in some patients on lower doses and then we now estimate that number of switches to be approximately 300 worldwide. During this period, we are seeing a strong reinforcement of the need for full does Fabrazyme in the community and we're very focused on returning to full supply as quickly as possible. More formal treatment expectations continue to emerge in the fabre field which recent publication of guidelines from an expert group appearing in CJ Online in late December of 2009. Reinforcing the expectation that a normal rate of renal progression, for example, can be achieved with early ineffective intervention. The field study design to evaluate the impact of lower dose Fabrazyme in children is continuing to enroll and we expect to complete enrollment in the second quarter of this year. On a Myozyme front, we finished 2009 with revenues of $324 million with growth of 10% year-over-year on the revenue line supported by a volume growth of almost 18% year-on-year. 2009 was a dynamic year for Myozyme with a dip in growth outside the United States in the first quarter, as we manage the tight period of supply, followed by resumption of growth in the subsequent quarters. This growth has been driven by continued awareness in the neuro-muscular community, especially the around the impact of testing adult patients with muscle weakness using dry blood spot enzyme assays. We would expect this element to play in the preparation and development of the U.S. market later this year as well. In addition, on the infantile side of the equation, we are seeing the first evidence that newborn screening can meaningfully improve outcomes in patients treated in the early newborn period with the Taiwan experience appearing in the literature with follow-up data up to three years and six patients. We expect the newborn screening will gain additional traction as the results of this experience are digestive. In the near term, were seeing an increased depreciation of the importance of earlier treatment for all patients, including adults. We have no updates to report regarding the PDUFA date for Lumizyme in the U.S. and believe that the review is preceding normally. The ATAP program, as Henri mentioned, has been opened to new patients in this interim period, and of the approximately 50 patients who are formally in our system were 20 eligible for ATAP and of those 11 have so far enrolled and we expect an additional 10 to 20 patients will enroll on the coming months. Finally, just to reinforce Henri's comment that we do expect to see topline data from the registration trial for Ataluren and not Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the first-half."

And if revenues are materially different from what we are projecting, we will react on the expense side. So that's a little bit motherhood and apple pie I'm afraid. We have a very, I think a very strict way to look at expenses. Investments is very similarly, if earnings don't allow results don't allow investments, then we won't do it. There's one broad exception that I make at this time. We are making deep investments in the manufacturing side, and I think we've been talking about it for a while, making deep investment on two elements that come that were caused by this interruption to create a recovery that's absolutely sustainable. We're making investments in manufacturing, both in terms of equipment and in personnel, and upgrading all operations in that area, and we are making investment on the marketing side of the equation to make sure that we are fully in touch with the marketplace as we reintroduce both these treatments into the field. I think these are very good investments to make. It takes extra time to come back from a moment like this and we are not going to shortcut what's needed to make this successful. But broadly, on the philosophy of how we look at expenses, they have to be related to the overall results and in order to get some level of predictability, in terms of earnings."

What we are seeing in the marketplace today is a strengthening conviction that dose is very important as a contributor to outcomes for patients with Fabry disease. The combination of dose and the timing of intervention with respect to disease severity are probably two very important elements. So the early behavior that we've seen in markets that have Replagal as an option has been to take the relatively less affected patients, or earlier, let's say, patients in the course of their disease, switch them to Replagal as a 0.2 milligrams per kilogram alternative for this short-term period and to consolidate the remaining Fabrazyme for the more severely affected patients, more advanced patients. So we would expect that for physicians who are thinking in this way about providing an actually effective doses to patients, that many of the patients who had been switched in this interim period would switch back in the presence of adequate supply for Fabrazyme. Of course, as the year unfolds, we'll get a better sense of that. But the  sense of treatment expectations and their relationship to timing of intervention and dose is supported by this publication I referenced in the outset here, MC Jason [ph]. So to get to your second question about inventory, the intention of the current allocation is to allow us to build a similar level of operating inventory to allow for smooth delivery of Fabrazyme going forward.

And so, we obviously looked at what we were doing very, very carefully, that this is a product that we will be producing going forward. We have first, our working cell banks but would have an interruption of that's worth the case. That's not what we expect at all. We could have stayed with the some working cell bank that we have, that would have kept the productivity at a level below where we needed it to be to fully supply and continue to grow the marketplace.

So I think, those are the dynamics that we're seeing in terms of the numbers and the rates.

Today, we are not setting a guidance for a percentage allocation that would result from the satisfactory performance of the new working cell bank. We know that if the working cell bank performs well, that in the June timeframe, we will have enough supply to enable increased dosing above the level where we are today. But we are going to wait until we know more about the performance in early-May timeframe to set that expectation. Now having said that, the performance of the working cell bank, if it's successful, would allow us to return to better and better levels in the back half of the year, which do allow us to cross the threshold of our lower guidance and indeed, to move through the range of the guidance that has been set for Fabrazyme. So, perhaps I'll turn it over to Dave, to give any further color on the working cell bank, but we would expect that in June, the doses will be higher. But we do not want to set today any expectation around what that number would be."

If we have the kind of result with the new working cell bank, as we experienced at the smaller scale, and if we do get the regulatory consent, which we fully expect in the June timeframe that I mentioned, then the yield improvement that would occur would materially get us back to where we need to be with this product. And because then we have two reactors running at yield at the minimum would recover the 30% that David mentioned. But potentially, if we get the kind of result at the large scale that we saw on the smaller scale, more than that. And that would then provide the upside. So our body language is careful. It is a little bit experienced where we come from. And Geoff, in particular, doesn't want to get ahead of ourselves because patients rely on these kinds of communications.

I have with me, Mike Wyzga, Chief Financial Officer; he will go through the financial details. Also Scott Canute, our new President for Manufacturing Operations Globally and he will talk about where we are in the manufacturing recovery programs. David Meeker is here, our new Chief Operating Officer, whom all of you know and Ron Branning, our Head of Quality Globally and he will make some comments and respond to Q&A. Actually he will respond to Q&A, Ron. And then Pam Williamson is here, the Head of Regulatory Affairs Globally, and the usual business unit leaders that all of you are familiar with are here too to respond to Q&A.
The first quarter was a very eventful quarter and a quarter where a number of things happened in our route to - our path to fully recovery and the least start of sustainable growth, that actually were constructive in some way and somewhat counterintuitive if you look at the fact that we had during the quarter, the issuance of at least the beginnings of discussions with the agency, the FDA on the consent decree and also late in the quarter, we had a manufacturing interruption that was talked about in the release.
It was very clear that in the short term our most important value creating and important thing for us to be able to accomplish is to get our manufacturing operations specifically, Allston into shape, so that we can produce at the high productivity in a reliable and productive way. Our, these two key products that have been impacted now for the last 12 months, Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, and Scott will talk about that. And it is very clear that we are making progress in this regard. We are seeing it on a daily basis when you are close to it, you can see it, discuss and talk about what that progress is. But it is something that has to stay in focus for us for the remainder of the year. If this clearly the subject around the consent decree, but it’s very importantly it impacts our ability to come back to full supply for Fabrazyme  and Cerezyme. 
And those two programs have been impacted now for a period of time. It is gratifying to see how - these are tremendous efforts, throughout the corporation, we are able to maintain connection into the marketplace that works and (at least) work well, the loyalty in the marketplace is really quite gratifying, but we clearly have to be able to get to full supply in order to maintain the right clinical impact of these therapies. We are hopeful indeed that the progress that we are making will expand itself in a much more reliable flow of product starting now.
The consent decree situation is much clarified. I think we did receive the draft from the agency, we did tell you in the release what that draft shares and we are in the middle of discussing important elements of this and the most important ones are - is a schedule, and the schedule that allows us to get out of the Allston facility in terms of filling and get to Waterford, our fill-finish operation in Ireland and to our CMO, Hospira in this case as (good way), predictable way and safer way, so that we don’t interrupt supply to products, but we do meet the schedule that we reown this agency. That’s where the discussions are taking place. Thomas DesRosier, our Chief Legal Officer is here, so I am sure if you have questions, he will be happy to answer them. 
The business was also pretty good during this quarter. We have made very progress indeed on a number of new products that were introduced last year or recently. Myozyme was up 28% from last year, despite an impact on shipping late in the quarter that we are recovering in the second quarter. Synvisc was 26% from last year and the first quarter is really a tough quarter for - the seasonality is quality pronounced around this product, the second quarter has actually traditionally been a very, very strong quarter. We are off on a strong start in the second quarter. And Synvisc-One is now 70% of revenues in that area and it’s quite gratifying to see how that product in an important way is making contribution to the company now. Mozobil was up 75% in the first quarter versus last year and we only introduced it across by the year-ago. And Clolar was up 36%, results are quite gratifying to see and a product that has long ways to go.
For this quarter, we are looking forward to June quarter, we are looking forward to June the 17th, the PDUFA date for Lumizyme. It’s an important date. We have been - it’s been a long (concluded) path to get to the point where we have again look forward to an approval of the product and start to really comfort the (inaudible) market side of (inaudible) base in the United States to free of charge programs, but also start to promote really the program in the United States which we have not yet been able to do. 
The other thing that happened last week at AM, the disclosures on the risk benefits of Alemtuzumab for MS contained to be extremely reassuring. We are now about 12 months away, a little more than 12 months away from seeing the results of the first Phase III clinical trial. We are learning a lot more about this marketplace. It is a very large marketplace and we are becoming increasingly encouraged about the role that Alemtuzumab can play in the treatment of MS. So it is clearly a game changer and if we are able in the Phase III clinical trials that we are enrolled in record time to reproduce these long-term results that we are now seeing on the Phase II, this truly is going to be a very, very important contribution to the treatment of these patients. 
Of course, the marketplace is large, it’s well over $10 billion right now. By the time we get there, it’s estimated to be about $13 billion and it’s clearly going to be very important driver in our future.
So we are at an very interested juncture in our recovery and repositioning of the company and we are going to have shortly on May the 6th, where we can talk about again at the Analyst Day about some of the things we are thinking of, how we think the composition of businesses that we have, the contributions that they make to - in this diversified picture that we represent in a unique way in biotechnology and also talk about some of these big drivers, growth drivers like Alemtuzumab for MS in the future. 
So at this moment, let me hand over to Mike, let’s (inaudible) show the financial results and then Scott will talk about the manufacturing. Mike?

346012,98255882,56907,"Genzyme Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Genzyme Corporation, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Henri. As Henri mentioned, the first quarter was a challenging quarter, we had so many moving parts. We are working our way through the manufacturing consent decree. And as we reported, we received the draft consent decree from the FDA. Now that",1391,"Thank you Henri. As Henri mentioned, the first quarter was a challenging quarter, we had so many moving parts. We are working our way through the manufacturing consent decree. And as we reported, we received the draft consent decree from the FDA. Now that consent decree provides with an upfront disgorgement of past profits of a $175 million as well as potential other future disgorgements. Still actively negotiating with the FDA, and we expect those to be completed in the second quarter. 
Non-GAAP accounting we were required to record a charge against our current income. If it’s two tier, if it’s probable that the expense has been incurred and if that expense can be estimated. So based upon the legal assessment of negotiations today, (it would determine) that the $175 million of the disgorgement of past profits meets both of those conditions. So with that, we backed up and we recorded a $175 million as an expense in our Q1 results. We tax effected that as (a corporate) right. We expect these negotiations to be complete in this quarter and we will provide an update for the full consent decree at that time. 
We are also working our way through the impact of healthcare reform. The impact from our estimate in 2010 will come from three major areas. The first is the Medicaid rebates which will increase from 15.1% to 23.1%. And the second is the 340V discount program, which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rate for those qualifying entities. Often drug products are exempt from the expansions of these new entities just as a backdrop. And the third is the change in the AMP discount definition. While still in estimate at this point, the total impact in the United States for revenues for Genzyme is less than $20 million in 2010, with most of the impact occurring in Q3 and Q4. If you multiply that by a Q4 run rate for those - for those items that will take you to about $30 million to $40 million in 2011. 
The device tax which is the last leg of this tool is most impactful in 2013. We estimate that will be about 2.3% of the device products of Genzyme and again that’s in 2013. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me turn my attention now to the quarter results. For Q1 of last year - from Q1 of last year, our top line revenue decreased by about 6% to approximately $1.07 billion. PGH revenue decreased to by about $157 million on a year-to-year basis. Now with all of that happening, Cerezyme decreased to - by to $179 million and that was mostly due to the supply limitations. With all that said, Cerezyme revenue increased by $74 million from Q4 to Q1, even as we started to rebuild our working inventory. 
Fabrazyme revenue decreased on a year-to-year basis to $53 million and again that was implemented by the implementation of dose reduction. Myozyme revenue came in at $86 million with Europe 4000 liter, making up most of the revenue. As we mentioned in our press release, we had a shipment of about $8 million that was delayed late in the quarter due to a quality hold, but with the subsequent release, the product has shipped and the revenue will be booked in the second quarter.
Revenue in the renal and endocrinology area increased by about 4% to $252 million. Renagel and Renvela revenue was $165 million, with increased volumes somewhat offset by the - by the average selling price declines. The average selling price decline was due to the impact of the conversion from Renagel to Renvela as well as lower pricing in Brazil. Thyrogen continues strong performance increasing by 18% on a year-to-year basis.
Within the biosurgery area, we increased by 15% overall. And the increase was predominantly Synvisc. Compared to last year worldwide Synvisc revenue increased 26% driven by Synvisc-One and increasing marketing share. From Q4 of last year, the revenue for Synvisc actually went down a little bit due to the normal seasonality that we’ve experienced with both Synvisc, our classic and now we are seeing with Synvisc-One. 
In the hematologic and oncology area, we increased by about 76%. Year-to-year increase files close of the - close of the deal with Bayer in June and the incremental revenues associated with Leukine, Fludara, and Campath. Mozobil impact, as Henri mentioned continues to grow. We had about 75% increase on a year-to-year basis. And Thymoglobulin, which is now part of the hema and oncology area increased to $53 million as we saw our greater sales in Asia.
Rounding up the top line in our other segment, genetics business is relatively flat due to shifts within the product mix and between reproductive testing and oncology; that resulted in lower ASP. And the diagnostics products increased to about $41 million.
Year-to-year the revenue was benefited by foreign exchange, that increase was about $30 million, but from Q4 of last year, the foreign exchange actually was negative and impacted our top line negatively by $18 million.
Our non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was $745 million or 69% of revenue. Our gross margin includes the $11 million of the manufacturing related to discreet cost, most of those are associated with the Iona facility in UK.
On a year-to-year basis, the gross margin was impacted by both product mix as well as product margin decreases. With regards to the product mix, with constrained supply, we have shipped high margin PGH products, which lowered the overall our gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter. Secondly and going forward, we see a - we continue to invest in our manufacturing. And while we expect the facilities to increase in both productivity and capacity overtime, in the short-term, the individual margins will be somewhat impacted. 
Our operating expenses came in significantly under our estimates in 2010 and decreased as a comparison for the Q4 of last year. 
Compared to Q1, our non-GAAP R&D expenses were $206 million. Last year’s R&D included about $18 million associated with the Exact Sciences transaction. And if you look at this on an apples-to-apples basis, the R&D actually increased by about $31 million. Now most of that was focused on the small molecule programs in the Myozyme ATAP support cost. We also increased due to the impact of the Bayer transaction, which we can close off in the June timeframe.
Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $353 million for the quarter. And as with the R&D expense, SG&A decreased on a quarter-to-quarter basis from Q4 last year. Compared to Q1 of last year, we saw an increase due to the full quarter of the oncology team, following again the transaction with Bayer. SG&A, also reflects some of the increased cost associated with the Synvisc-One. We also saw some increase in the global IT infrastructure cost. 
Amortization increased in the quarter to a $13 million over last year and that was again due to the Bayer transaction. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15%. Now this reflects the benefit of the audit settlements that we saw during the quarter, which we took as a discreet item. Over the remaining quarters, we expect our tax rate to be more normalized somewhere around the 28% range of profit range.
Our first quarter GAAP loss per share was $0.43 and again that’s due to the $175 million of the consent decree. In addition, we also on a GAAP to non-GAAP basis showed the pretax income - pretax expenses associated with the stock options. Those came in at $48 million. Pretax acquisition cost related to the deal with Bayer, were - contingent consideration of $62 million and purchase inventory step up of about $9 million.
The contingent consideration cost increased due to the revised - we had a revision of the long range forecast, and increased revenue assumptions for both Fludara and Leukine as well as Campath for MS. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.37 on a basis of 272 million shares outstanding. Our cash position decreased slightly in $952 million. Net cash from operations was approximately $126 million and our capital expenditures came in at a $152 million for the quarter and that was mostly focused on our manufacturing facilities.
So, let me stop there and turn it back over to Henri.

The timel",750,"Okay. Before I talk specifically about the supply guidance for Cerezyme and Fabrazyme that we provided today, I would like to briefly provide an update on a number of important aspects of our strategy across global manufacturing here at Genzyme. The timeline for our major capacity addition for our programs are all holding firm. Our new bioreactor suite at Framingham has now gone aseptic, we have cells in the building, we are preparing for engineering around and everything still remains on track for approval at yearend of 2011.
Our additional fill-finish capacity at Waterford is also on track for 2011 approval as well as our third Myozyme bioreactor at Belgium. Our projects move all of our fill-finish operations out of Allston is progressing well. We have previously transferred all of our Cerezyme 400 units filling to our Waterford plant. This represents about 80% of the volume of Cerezyme and 50% of the total volume that was previously filled at Allston. We will begin validation loss at Hospira in June of this year to transfer the remaining products out of Allston. We will be manufacturing all of our products in Q3 of this year at Hospira and the ultimate exit will depend on the regulatory pathway going forward.
We continue to progress well on our plans to upgrade our facilities, systems and equipment at Allston, increasing our levels of redundancy in overall level of reliability. In addition, while we don’t know the final elements of the consent decree yet, we are preparing our organization, our resources and our processes to be able to operate effectively under conditions that would be typically of most previous consent decrees.
We have initiated the new working cell bank at both Fabrazyme bioreactors and have seen approximately 30% improvement with the first bioreactor run is now complete. We have made some minor adjustments to a key process parameter that affects bioreactor productivity and we expect to see further improvement with the second bioreactor, which has recently been set and is currently running very well.
I do want to be clear that while we are working with minimal inventories of Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, while we complete these capacity addition projects and we strive to improve operations at our Allston manufacturing facility. Therefore, ability to supply these drugs can be impacted by non-routine manufacturing issues until we are able to build inventory after Framingham comes on line at the end of 2011. 
Today as you have seen already, we have updated our supply guidance due primarily to a problem relating to a piece of equipment in our water for injection system which was further compounded by a subsequent municipal power outage that we experienced. In early March, we began to see bioburden levels in our water for injection system that were higher than normal. We took all necessary actions to maintain control of the system, ultimately resulting in the removal of a heat exchanger from that system. At that point, we were in a state of control producing high-quality water for injection for our plant operations.
On March 29th, the plant suffered a significant municipal power outage. After the power outage, we again saw higher than historical levels of bioburden in our water for injection system. We immediately took the appropriate steps to remediate the problem, ultimately performing a chemical cleaning and sanitization. The system is currently in a state of control and is producing good quality of water and production is going very well. 
The impact of this problem really falls into two categories. The first is the loss of production time in order to take the necessary interventions to remediate the problem. Most of these interventions occurred post power outage, so it’s been relatively recent. Second impact is the potential to impact the work in process to the (way up) that was made during this period of higher than normal bioburden level. No product manufactured during this period has been released or will be released until we complete investigation report including product quality and medical assessment, that’s probably normal routine procedure. And I do want to stress that this is just a normal part of our overall operations that when we see incidents like this much like the event that we saw in Belgium around the Myozyme shipments, we take timeout, we do the proper investigations and then we make the proper disposition decisions going forward. We will provide an update on our expectations for supply of both Cerezyme and Fabrazyme in approximately one month.

So that’s one piece of the impact. 
The other piece of the impact is that we did lose some production days, because of the remediation efforts that we needed to take place to get the water systems back into a state consistent with historical performance. So these would be things like sanitizations we took, we changed some gasket materials and aligned, we did the chemical cleaning and all those types of things would impact our ability to process material on an ongoing basis. 
So that’s really the combination of those two impacts that have attributed and led us to the revised guidance that we did today.

Currently, Waterford does Myozyme, it does the Cerezyme 400 that I mentioned earlier, does all the Cerezyme 400 units that we have, as well as it does some Thymoglobulin formula, excuse me, cell finish as well. What’s remaining in Allston is about - they said about it’s around 50% of our volume is already moved out. Our historical volume has already moved out to the site and the remainder of that will be done at Hospira and that’s the two Fabrazyme formulations as well as the Thyrogen formulation. 
We will probably - not probably, we will absolutely when we have time to, we will validate Hospira for additional formulations of Cerezyme and we will validate Waterford, for additional formulations that we are doing in Hospira, so we have redundancy as we need to going forward.

The first is the study in treatment naive patients head-to-head against Rebif. And these are two-year studies followed by an extension study where the patients are rolled over for the potential for additional therapy if needed. So if the patients manifest progression of the disease, are they eligible for additional therapy and in addition to that the patients that were on the Rebif arm are also eligible to receive Alemtuzumab in the extension study.
The second Phase III study is again a head-to-head against Rebif in this case in patients who were on a license therapy, prior to study entry either one of the Inteferons or Copaxone, and have had progression with their disease, while on that therapy or the patients that are seen in this second study what we call the treatment experience study. Similar design in the sense that there is two-year follow-up for those patients and then they are eligible then to roll over into the expansion study.
The - there is nothing new to report in terms of the adverse event profile of the product in the Phase III studies. And what I can describe to you however is the experience in the long-term follow-up from the Phase II studies which was that the incident of opportunistic infection declined overtime with the patients in the study, so we saw the most infections in the first year and it declined in the second year. And then the Phase II study was the three-year follow-up and the rate of infection declined in the third year as well. And the important point here is that infections seen in these studies were overwhelming mild to moderate in their severity and consistent with some of the data that we reported at AN last week. 
What we see here is as opposed to a drug like TYSABRI or even FTY720 where there is chronic suppression of the immune system, what we see with Alemtuzumab is the reconstitution of the immune system, following therapy which seems to confer higher degrees of protection from infection while the patient is on therapy.

We have continued to have conservations as has the entire dialysis community around the fact that adding oral phosphate binders to the bundle isn’t the right decision for patients. We know that all of those meetings have been positive and they have certainly listened. It’s difficult to handicap what the outcome will be. But when the entire dialysis community from providers to patients to physicians to manufacturers all agree that this is something that needs consideration before you rush into it, we would like to think that that will allow for that kind of thinking and at a minimum have a delay in implementation.

Occasionally you will see interventions or you will see issues of a more major significance. And again inventory typically would protect the marketplace I mean from that and you set inventory targets based on your ability to just to supply reliably and that’s just normal supply chain management. We don’t have that luxury here obviously. Everyone is well aware of that. 
So you will see more of these things will impact on a real-time basis. I would say that because the water for injection system does - does touch so much of our operations that this would be a bit of an anomaly, it would not be usual to see this type of event occur on a frequent basis. So it’s - it does touch everything. And as Henri said very clearly, we are running very aggressively and so it has more of an impact in the short-term because of that, but again for good reason.

And the Renagel sales that remain are increasingly the lower priced Medicaid sales. So the prices actually as we go through the year will be coming together as well. And as the Renagel was left is just our lowest price product. 
The other thing that Mike mentioned was the price change in Brazil. Remember Brazil is our second largest market in the world, now significantly smaller than the US. But we took a significant price decrease there as we were competing against a couple of similar products that were approved and we decided to be very aggressive. Still we are left with a healthy gross margin in the 67% range. But again, it was a significant drop in our ASP and that had an impact on us.

I have with me Mike Wyzga, Chief Financial Officer, he will go through the financial details; also, Scott Canute, our new President for Manufacturing Operations Globally, and he will talk about where we are in the manufacturing recovery programs; David Meeker is here, our new Chief Operating Officer, whom all of you know; and Ron Branning, our Head of Quality globally, and he will make some comments and respond to Q&A, actually, he will respond to Q&A, Ron; and then Pam Williamson is here, the Head of Regulatory Affairs globally; and the usual business unit leaders that all of you are familiar with are here too to respond to Q&A.
The first quarter was a very eventful quarter where a number of things happened in our route to, our pass, to a full recovery and the restart of sustainable growth. And that actually were very constructive in some way and somewhat counter-intuitive when you look at the fact that we had too in the quarter the issuance of at least the beginnings of discussions with the agency, the FDA, on the consent decree. And also later in the quarter, we had a manufacturing interruption that was talked about in the release. 
It's very clear that in the short term, our most important value creating and important thing for us to be able to accomplish is to get our manufacturing operations, specifically Allston, into shape so that we can produce at the high productivity in a reliable and predictive way. These two key products that have been impacted now for the last 12 months: Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, and Scott will talk about that. And it is very clear that we are making progress in this regard. We are seeing it on a daily basis. When you're close to it, you can see it. Scott can talk about what that progress is, but it is something that has to stay focused for us for the remainder of the year. It is clearly the subject around the consent decree, but very importantly, it impacts our ability to come back full supply for Fabrazyme and Cerezyme. 
Those two programs have been impacted now for a period of time. It's gratifying to see how recent tremendous efforts throughout the corporation, we are able to maintain a connection into the marketplace that works and seems [ph] (10:19) to work well. The loyalty in the marketplace is really quite gratifying, but we clearly have to be able to get to full supply in order to maintain the right clinical impact of these therapies. We are hopeful indeed that the progress that we're making will express itself in a much more reliable flow of product starting now.
The consent decree situation is much clarified. I think we did receive the draft from the agency. We did tell you in the release what the draft says, and we are in the middle of discussing important elements of this. And the most important one is the schedule, the schedule that allows us to get out of the Allston facility in terms of filling and get to Waterford, our fill/finish operation in Ireland and to our CMO, Hospira in this case, in as good a way, a predictable way, a safer way so that we don't interrupt supply to products but we do meet the schedule that we agree with the agency, that's where the discussions are taking place. Tom DesRosier, our Chief Legal Officer is here, so I'm sure if you have questions, he will be happy to answer them.
The business was pretty good during this quarter. We made very good progress indeed on a number of new products that were introduced last year or recently. Myozyme was up 28% from last year despite an impact on shipping late in the quarter that we are recovering in the second quarter. Synvisc, it was up 26% from last year. And the first quarter is really a tough quarter for -- the seasonality is quite pronounced around this product. The second quarter is actually traditionally been a very, very strong quarter. We are off on a strong start in the second quarter. And since this one is now 70% of revenues in that area, it's quite gratifying to see how that product in an important way is making contribution to the company now. Mozobil was up 75% in the first quarter versus last year, and we already introduced it of course by the year ago. And Clolar was up 36%, results are quite gratifying to see in a product that has long ways to go. 
For this quarter, we are looking forward to June 17, the PDUFA date for Lumizyme, it's an important date. It has been a long convoluted pass to get to the point where we can look forward to an approval of the product and start to really convert the ATAP market side of program phases [ph] (13:26) in the United States, the free-of-charge programs. But also start to promote really the program in the United States, which we have not yet been able to do.
Also an important thing that happened last week at the AM, the disclosures on the risk benefits of alemtuzumab for MS, contained [ph] (13:47) to be extremely reassuring. We are now about 12 months away, a little more than 12 months away from seeing the results of the first Phase III clinical trial. We are learning a lot more about this marketplace. It is very large marketplace and we are becoming increasingly encouraged about the role that alemtuzumab can play in the treatment of MS. It is clearly a game-changer. And if we are able in the Phase III clinical trials, enrolled in record time to reproduce these long-term results that we are now seeing on the Phase II, this truly is going to be a very, very important contribution to the treatment of these patients. Of course, the marketplace is large, it's well over $10 billion right now. By the time we'd get there, it's estimated to be about $13 billion and clearly going to be a very important driver in our future. 
So we are at a very interesting juncture in our recovery and repositioning of the company. And we are going to have shortly a meeting on May 6, where we can talk about again at Analyst Day about some of the things we are thinking of, how we think about the composition of businesses that we have, the contributions that they make in this diversified picture that we represent in a unique way in biotechnology and also talk about some of these big drivers, growth drivers like alemtuzumab for MS in the future. 
So at this moment, let me hand over to Mike. Let's get to talk through the financial results and then Scott will talk about the manufacturing. Mike?"
346012,98255882,56939,"Genzyme Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Genzyme Corporation, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Henri. As Henri mentioned, the first quarter was a challenging quarter, we had so many moving parts. We're working our way to the manufacturing consent decree. And as we reported, we received a draft consent decree from the FDA. Now that consen",1355,"Thank you, Henri. As Henri mentioned, the first quarter was a challenging quarter, we had so many moving parts. We're working our way to the manufacturing consent decree. And as we reported, we received a draft consent decree from the FDA. Now that consent decree provides for an upfront disgorgement of past profits of $175 million, as well as potential other future disgorgements. We're still actively negotiating with the FDA and we expect those to be completed in the second quarter. 
Now the GAAP accounting rule require to record a charge against our current income. If it's two-tier, if it's probable, that the expense has been incurred and that if that expense can be estimated. So based upon the legal assessment of negotiations today to determine that the $175 million of the disgorgement for past profits meets both of those conditions. So with that, we backed up and we recorded $175 million as an expense in our Q1 results and we attack the effective debt at the corporate rate. We expect these negotiations to be complete in this quarter, and we'll provide an update for the year for the full consent decree at that time. 
We're also working our way through the impact of healthcare reform. The impact from our estimate in 2010 will come from three major areas: The first is the Medicaid rebates, which will increase from 15.1% to 23.1%; the second is the 340B discount program, which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rate for those qualifying entities. Orphan drug products are exempt from the expansion of these new entities, just as the backdrop; and then third is the change in the AMP discount definition. While still in estimate at this point, the total impact in the United States for revenues for Genzyme is less than $20 million in 2010, with most of the impact occurring in Q3 and Q4. If you multiply that by Q4 run rate for those items, that will take you to about $30 million to $40 million in 2011. Now the device tax, which is the last leg of tool [ph] (17:35) is most impactful in 2013. We estimate that will be about 2.3% of the device products of Genzyme, and again, that's in 2013. So with that as a backdrop, let me turn my attention out to the quarterly results.
From Q1 of last year, our top line revenue decreased by about 6% to approximately $1.07 billion. PGH revenue decreased by about $157 million on a year-to-year basis. Now with all of that happening, Cerezyme decreased to $179 million, and that was mostly due to supply limitations. With all that said, Cerezyme revenue increased by $74 million from Q4 to Q1, even as we started to rebuild our working inventory. 
Fabrazyme revenue decreased on a year-to-year basis to $53 million, and again, that was implemented by the implementation of those reductions. Myozyme revenue came in at $86 million, with Europe 4000 L making up most of the revenue. As we mentioned in our press release, we had a shipment of about $8 million. That was delayed late in the quarter due to a quality hold. With the subsequent release, the product has shipped and the revenue will be booked in the second quarter. 
Revenue in the renal and endocrinology area increased by about 4% to $252 million. Renagel and Renvela was $165 million, with increased volume somewhat offset by the average selling price declines. The average selling price decline was due to the impact of the conversion from Renagel to Renvela, as well as lower pricing in Brazil. Thyrogen continued strong performance, increasing by 18% on a year-to-year basis. 
Within the biosurgery area, we increased by 15% overall, and the increase was predominantly Synvisc. Compared to last year, worldwide Synvisc revenue increased 26%, driven by Synvisc-One and increasing marketing share. From Q4 of last year, the revenue for Synvisc actually went down a little bit due to the normal seasonality that we experienced with both Synvisc classic and now to Synvisc-One. 
In the hematologic and oncology area, we increased by about 76%. Year-to-year increase follows close to the close of the deal with Bayer in June and incremental revenue associated with Leukine, Fludara and Campath. Mozobil impact, as Henri Mentioned, continues to grow, we had about 75% increase on a year-to-year basis. In Thymoglobulin, which is now part of the hema and oncology area increased to $53 million, as we saw our greatest sales in Asia. Rounding out the top line and our other segment, Genetics business is relatively flat due to shifts within the product mix between reproductive testing and oncology that resulted in the lower ASP and the Diagnostics products increased to about $41 million. 
Year-to-year, the revenue was benefited by foreign exchange. That increase was about $30 million. Now from Q4 of last year, the foreign exchange actually was negative and then impacted our top line negatively by $18 million. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was $745 million or 69% of revenue. Our gross margin include the $11 million of manufacturing-related discrete costs, most of those are associated with the Ireland facility and the U.K. 
On a year-to-date basis, the gross margin was impacted by both product mix, as well as product margin decreases. If you've gone to the product mix, we've got a constrained supply, we shipped less high-margin PGH products, which lowered the overall gross margin as a percentage revenue for the quarter. Secondly and going forward, we continue to invest in our manufacturing. And while we expect the facilities to increase in both productivity and capacity over time, in the short term, the individual margins will be somewhat impacted. 
Our operating expenses came in significantly under our estimates in 2010 and decreased as a comparison for the Q4 of last year. Compared to Q1, our non-GAAP R&D expenses were $206 million. Last year's R&D included about $18 million associated with the Exact Sciences transaction. And if you look at this on an apples-to-apples basis, the R&D actually increased by about $31 million. Now most of that was focused on the small molecule program and the Myozyme ATAP support costs. We also increased due to the impact of the Bayer transaction, which can close off in the June time frame. 
Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $353 million for the quarter. And as with the R&D expense, SG&A decreased on a quarter-to-quarter basis from Q4 of last year. Compared to Q1 of last year, we saw an increase due to the full court of the oncology team, following the agenda transaction with Bayer. SG&A also reflects some of the increased costs associated with Synvisc-One. We also saw some increase in the global IT infrastructure costs. Amortization increased in the quarter by $215 million over last year, and that was again due to the Bayer transaction. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15%. Now this reflects the benefit of the audit settlements that we saw during the quarter, which we took as a discrete item. Over the remaining quarters, I would expect our tax rate to be more normalized, somewhere around the 28% of profit range. 
Our first quarter GAAP loss per share was $0.43, and again, that's due to the $175 million of the consent decree. In addition, we also, on a GAAP to non-GAAP basis, showed the pretax expenses associated with the stock options. Those came in at $48 million. Pretax acquisition costs related to the deal with Bayer were contingent consideration of $62 million and purchase inventory step-up of about $9 million. The contingent consideration costs increased due to the revised -- we've had a revision of the long-range forecast and an increased revenue assumptions for both Fludara and Leukine, as well as Campath for MS.
Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.37 on a basis 272 million shares outstanding. Our cash position decreased slightly to $962 million. Net cash for operations is approximately $126 million and our capital expenditures came in at $152 million for the quarter, and that was mostly focused on our manufacturing facilities. Let me stop there and turn it back over to Henri."

The timeline for ou",736,"Before I talk specifically about the supply guidance for Cerezyme and Fabrazyme that we provided today, I'd like to briefly provide an update on a number of important aspects of our strategy across global manufacturing here at Genzyme. The timeline for our major capacity addition program is all holding firm. Our new bioreactor suite at Framingham has now gone aseptic. We have cells in the building, we're preparing for engineering runs and everything still remains on track for approval at year end of 2011. 
Our additional fill/finish capacity at Waterford is also on track for 2011 approval, as well as our third Myozyme bioreactor at Belgium. Our project to move all of our fill/finish operations out of Allston is progressing well. We have previously transferred all of our Cerezyme 400-unit ceiling to our Waterford plant, this represents about 80% of the volume of Cerezyme and 50% of the total volume that was previously filled at Allston. We'll begin validation lots at Hospira in June of this year to transfer the remaining products out of Allston. We'll be manufacturing all of our products in Q3 of this year at Hospira and the ultimate exit will depend on the regulatory pathway going forward. 
We continue to progress well in our plants to upgrade our facilities, systems and equipment at Allston, increasing our levels of redundancy and overall level of reliability. In addition, while we don't know the final elements of the consent decree yet, we are preparing our organization, our resources and our processes to be able to operate effectively under conditions that would be typical of most previous consent decrees. We've initiated the new working cell bank in both Fabrazyme and bioreactors and have seen approximately 30% improvement for the first bioreactor where now is complete. We've made some minor adjustments to the key process parameter that affects bioreactor productivity and we expect to see further improvement for the second bioreactor, which has recently been set and is currently running very well. 
I do want to be clear that while we're working with minimal inventories of Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, while we complete these capacity addition projects and we strive to improve operations at our Allston manufacturing facility. Therefore, the ability to supply these drugs can be impacted by non-routine manufacturing issues until we're able to build inventory after Framingham comes online at the end of 2011. 
Today, as you've seen already, we've updated our supply guidance, due primarily to the problem relating to a piece of equipment in our Water for Injection system, which was further compounded by a subsequent municipal power outage that we experienced. In early March, we began to see bioburden levels in our Water for Injection system that were higher than normal. And then we took all necessary action to maintain control of the system, ultimately resulting in the removal of the heat exchanger from that system. At that point, we're in the state of control, producing high-quality Water For Injection for our plant and operations. 
On March 29, the plant suffered a significant municipal power outage. After the power outage, we again saw higher than historical levels of bioburden in our Water for Injection system. We immediately took the appropriate steps to remediate the problem, ultimately performing a chemical cleaning and sanitization. The system is currently in the state of control and is producing good-quality water and production is going very well. The impact of this problem really falls into two categories: The first is the loss of production time in order to take the necessary intervention to remediate the problem. Most of these interventions occur post-power outage, so have been relatively recent. Second impact is the potential impact the work in process, or the WIP, that was made during a period of higher than normal bioburden level. No product manufacturing during this period has been released or will be released until we completed the investigation report including product quality and medical assessment as part of normal routine procedure. I do want to stress that this is just a normal part of our overall operations, that when we see incidents like this, much like the event that we saw in Belgium around the Myozyme shipment, we take out, we do the proper investigation and then we make a proper disposition decision going forward. We'll provide an update on our expectations for supply of both Cerezyme and Fabrazyme in approximately one month. Henri?"

Currently, Waterford does Myozyme. It does the Cerezyme 400 that I mentioned earlier, develop Cerezyme 400 units that we have, as well as it does some Thymoglobulin still to finish as well. What's remaining in Allston that's at about -- it's around 50% of our volume has already moved up, our historical volumes already moved out of the site, and the remainder of that will be done at Hospira, and that's two Fabrazyme formulations as well as the Thyrogen formulation. We will absolutely, when we have time, we'll validate Hospira for additional formulations of Cerezyme and we'll validate Waterford for additional formulations that we're doing in Hospira. So we have redundancy as we need to going forward so that we've got multiple capacities. So right now, if you just look at it today, we'll be to a point where about half the volume is in Waterford, half of it will be in Hospira after we exit Allston.

And these are two-year studies followed by an extension study where the patients are rolled over for the potential for additional therapy, if needed. So if the patient manifests progression of the disease, or they're eligible for additional therapy and in addition to that, the patients that were on the Rebif arm are also eligible to receive Alemtuzumab in the extension study. The second Phase III study is again a head-to-head against Rebif, in this case in patients who were on a licensed therapy prior to study entry, either one of the interferons or Copaxone and have that progression with their disease while on that therapy or the patients that are seen in this second study, what we call a treatment experience study. Similar design in a sense that there's a two-year follow-up for those patients and they are eligible then to roll over into the expansion study. There's nothing new to report in terms of the adverse event profile of the product in the Phase III studies. And what I can describe to you, however, is the experience and the long-term follow-up from the Phase II studies, which was that the incidents of opportunistic infections declined over time with the patients in the study. So we saw the most infections in the first year and a decline in the second year and then the Phase II study was the three-year follow-up and the rate of infection declined in the third year as well. And the important point here is that the infections seen in these studies were overwhelmingly mild to moderate in their severity. And consistent with some of the data that we reported at AAN last week, what we see here as opposed to a drug like Tysabri or even FTY-720, where there is chronic suppression of the immune system. What we see with Alemtuzumab is the reconstitution of the immune system following therapy, which seems to confer higher degrees of protection from infection while the patient is on therapy."

The dialysis centers need to have time to assess the final rule across the board in order to decide whether they want to opt in fully or bundling or phase in over a four-year period so they need time to do that. CMS recognizes that, so we do expect that for the end of April or sometime in the spring. We would continue to have conversations as the entire dialysis community around the fact that adding oral phosphate binders to the bundle isn't the right decision for patients. We know that all those meetings have been positive and they certainly listen. It's difficult to handicap what the outcome will be, but when the entire dialysis community from providers to patients to physicians to manufacturers all agree that this is something that needs consideration before you rush into it. We'd like to think that, that will allow for that kind of thinking, and at a minimum have a delay in implementation."

So the prices actually as we go through the year, will be coming together as well. As the Renagel, what's left is just our lowest priced product. The other thing that Mike mentioned was the price change in Brazil. Brazil is our second largest market in the world. Now it's significantly smaller than the U.S. But we took a significant price decrease as we were competing against a couple of similar products that were approved, and we decided to be very aggressive. Still, we're left with a very healthy gross margin in the 67% range. But again, it was a significant drop in our ASP and that had an impact on us."

David Meeker's not here but he's on the call and he's available for response. He's in Singapore. He's our Chief Operating Officer and he can chime in as we go along.
And a number of senior executives are here for this comp to till the Q&A.
The second quarter, as expected, was a difficult quarter financially. At the beginning of the quarter, we guided that we would supply Cerezyme at 50% of demand through July and Fabrazyme is 70% of demands through September, and the results to be reported today are consistently set.
We see supply constraints ease, currently for Cerezyme and in the next quarter for Fabrazyme, and we have attached a new guidance accordingly. We also adjusted guidance for the divestitures and exchange rate, changes in Health Care Reform impact and the (percent) degree impact from a number of (various) details that were attached to the press release. But I think in a very detailed way gets us to where we were in the beginning of the year intentions guidance to where we now are expected to be for the total year. We also took into account the revenues for to be the best of businesses for the second half.
We are very focused on the value creation activities that we've spoken about in recent calls of this kind. There's clearly no more impactful element here is to resupply the Cerezyme and Fabrazyme market needs. And we will get in a picturesque where are - it is encouraging where we are. We are seeing the kind of progress that we're hoping for since our becoming much more novelized. We are working our way risk this product to the point that can become released and can be - supply patients around the world. It's a very encouraging moment. We are at the tail end of this very, very tough year that lift all together.
Very exciting is of course the launch of Lumizyme. It's as expected to go with the ramps and setting up the ramps and certifying et cetera, et cetera. It is a little bit - it takes a little while to get that going. But you'll not (inaudible) if you pull updates. It's obviously quite exciting to be able to bring that product to all patients in the United States and not having the limitations that we've lived on that for two years.
We deeply engaged in an effort to really understand all the costs and cooperation and ways to work more efficiently and stream line operations. And in the full, we will be communicating with you what the impacts of the actions that will follow this review. We're very much engaged in preparing for the Alemtuzumab (MS story). This is a very important driver. It's not just a new product but this is a major new element for the corporation. We are now half way through the clinical trials. We'll see the results next year summer for the first trial, a few months later for the second trial. We have many meetings reviewing the regulatory approach, the regulatory standard use and the cause of due trials. Well, the (inaudible) faster than we expected. And then so close together, we will be filing for regulatory actions dispose trials at once. This is a very exciting program that is taking increasing resources in the preparation of the launch that you would now expect late 2012 and abroad 2013.
We're optimizing - not on the optimizing but we'll be accelerating a number of the products that we recently launched. And some of those was else you can see. Well you take Cerezyme and Fabrazyme out of the equation, the rest of the business grew 13% despite the impact - not too great an impact but some impact of the exchange rates. Since this one did extremely well in the second quarter as it did in the first quarter of 30 percent plus. Most of you again had a very good quarter. Clover had a very good quarter up, almost 30%. Renvela is still a very exciting program but didn't have a very small potter and we are still in the launch base and many comes as a Europe on the CTD indication and all indications actually as we got pricing set up for this product . But it has a very interesting future half of it, no.
Of course here we have see a C durations in fact 2014, 2015, we will have the patent C duration occur. I guess you saw was during the quarter and take actions and implement some of the capital structure of decisions that we announced earlier. We did announce the debt of $1 billion and buyback programs for the $1 billon and the second $ 1 billion. The second $1 billion will be within the next 10 or so months. We also prepared the three businesses that we decided to announce to you that we would divest the Genetic Diagnostic business; the Diagnostic product business; a Pharmaceutical business that we took the second half sales out of the guidance. So you have seen and we are still planning that these transactions will happen before the end of the year.
So with this (inaudible) let me hand over to Mike Wyzga for the financial detail. Mike?

But we did make a lot of progress in a number of different areas. As we mentioned that on our Analyst day in May, we talked about our capital discipline. We outlined the number of (earnings) against that discipline. And after we find strategic alternatives to our genetics, our diagnostics and our pharmaceutical business and we're making good progress and have target to have these transactions to be complete by year end.
We also mentioned that we would seek a $1 million transits. June we issued an inaugural bond issuance in two transits. The first front was $500 million in a 5-year note. Net price was very well at 3.6%. In the other $500 million was in 10-year note, now it's priced at 5%. We immediately used the proceeds of those transits to do an accelerated stock repurchase program. This repurchase program represents the first half of our announced $2 billion stock repurchase program.
As we mentioned before, we're committed to an operation efficiency program. We made a lot of progress on that. It's a multi-year program. We expect a full implementation in the fall. We'll also discuss in the fall as well.
So lead my attention to the quarterly results and then I can say a few words about our guidance. From Q2 of last year, our top line decreased by about 12% to approximately $1.08 billion. The overall impact of foreign exchange is relatively immaterial. It decreased our top line revenue by about $6 million. That's not the case as you have see in our guidance package but it soon was the case on a Q-to-Q basis. And that's specific because while the Euro was unfavorable on a year-to-year basis, other currencies moves in the opposite direction from Q2 of last year. Now with all that said, the geographic dispersion can cause a different impact on the product-by-product basis and I'll talk through a little bit about that in a second.
Cerezyme decreased to $139 million, again due to the supply limitations. Fabrazyme revenue decreased on a year-to-year basis to $39 million, again impact by those reductions. Myozyme came in at $92 million and that's an increase of 16% year-to-year. The majority of the sales were in Europe and therefore the most severely impacted by the Euro foreign exchange. Revenue decreased by a little over half of the FX impacts for the overall corporation at the top line or about $3.7 million.
Revenue in the Renal and Endocrinology area increased by 4% to $258 million, Renagel and Renvela came in at $170 million and Thyrogen increased nicely by 8% due to strong growth here in the United States as well as in the international markets. Biosurgery revenue increased to $164 million or 18%. Again, due to Synvisc which demonstrate very, very strong revenue growth, compared to last year, Synvisc revenue increased by 31%, driven by increase in market share.
In the Hema and Oncology area, we increased by about 58%. And that follows the close of a deal with Bayer last June, and the incremental revenue of Leukine, Fludara and Campath. Mozibil continue to be a strong growth driver in this area increasing by 90% to $22 million. And Thymoglobulin, which is now part of the (inaudible), increased to $58 million due to the growth that we saw in the Asia-Pacific area.
Our non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter came at 68% of revenue. This gross margin increased $22 million of manufacturing related discreet item. As we disclosed in our last quarterly filing with the SEC, the majority of this costs are associated with the maturity that was just started due to the power interruption in Allston. This material was concluded on the QA, QC testing and written off in the second quarter. We also incurred the cost of a temporary shutdown of our facility in the U.K.
Our operating expenses continued to be lowered than our original estimates in 2010. Compared to Q2 of last year, our non-GAAP research and development expenses were $211 million. The increase that we saw on a year-to-year basis, about $21 million, and that was primarily focused on the Gaucher small-molecule program as well as the MTAP program, (Pomiva).
The non-GAAP SG&A expenses came in at $336 million for the quarter. Now compared to Q3 of last year, these expenses increased due to the full quarter of the oncology infrastructure following the (inaudible) Bayer. More importantly it also included what I'll call discreet type vitals, such as the proxy contest cost, the legal expenses due to the consent decree as well as costs associated with our business improvement program. We also increased our reserves against our accounts receivable increased by approximately $6.5 million. In motivation increased on a year-to-year basis due to the full quarter of a bigger transaction.
Let me talk a little bit about Isis investment. It is upon a policy we determine that the decrease in our equity investment in Isis was other than temporary, and we record an impairment charge of $32 million against that stocking in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate reflects the impact of a low (PBT) against our permit tax benefits. And you'll see that occur in the guidance as well.
Our second quarter GAAP includes the pre tax expenses associated with stock options which came in at a relatively flat $45 million as well as a pre tax acquisition cost related to the deal with them. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.18 on a basis of 270 million shares outstanding. Now the stock buyback protocol didn't made an impact as it came at the very end of the quarter. There's much more impact when Q3 and Q4 and beyond.
Our cash (inaudible) was $974 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our capital expenditures where $178 million for the quarter and those are mostly focused on manufacturing facilities.
So with that let me turn my attention 2010 guidance. In any I mentioned, our updated guidance takes in due account a number of factor, including the impact of supply estimates, any changes in the foreign exchange rate versus our original guidance, the first trans of our share repurchase, European pricing (elections), national health care reform here in the United States as well as the divested business these impact, both on the revenue line as well as on the expense line.
We have not included at this point any estimates for the cash benefits to devise the business on the second trans of stock of the repurchase under the new guidance. It typically it's really estimates this accurately.
So the revenue. Let me talk about the revenue a little bit. The easiest way to think about the changes in our top line revenue from the original guidance is in four major categories. The first are the volume decreases associated with supply constraint. The supply constraint can be related to some degree impacted Cerezyme, Fabrazyme and Thyrogen and decreased our original revenue guidance by approximately $315 million. The second category is the foreign exchange rate. As you recall, our original guidance was originally set at 1.5 for the Euro, which was the spot rate that time we put our bunch together. So using the con spot rate for the Euro, we adjusted the other ex-U.S. currencies that the decrease in product revenue is approximately $170 million. And again this should be compared against our original guidance.
The third category is the impact of the proposed divestitures to the business in the second half of the year. Our guidance includes the first half of the actual results of the three proposed strategic divestitures; the proposed divestitures reduced our revenue guidance by $336 million. And again this impacts the second half of the year. We've also adjusted and reflected our reduced operating expenses for the guidance for these divestures as well.
Lastly, we incorporated the impact of the U.S. health care reform and the European pricing on the revised top line guidance. As I mentioned on our last call, in the U.S., approximately it's about $20 million for the U.S. portion of it. The combined pricing actions for both U.S. as well as international at this point is $30 million for the year,
Our spent guidance we revised as well. SG&A and R&D expenses were revised to capture the impact as I mentioned of the devise to businesses as well as the additional operating cost reductions that we're seeing for remaining businesses.
We trued up our in motivation guidance a bit. And that was due to the impact of primarily the Bayer products as well is in risk. Now both of these products and both of these assets are amortized on the basis of revenue. As long-term revenue projections for both of these assets are expected to increase in the future year. The current period revenue is proportion amount of the total is smaller and therefore the amortization decreases proportionally.
We estimate our tax rate will be lower as percentage or probably before tax or lower property before tax dollar number against our six permanent tax benefits. Now with all that put together, our 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the area of $1.90 to $2 per diluted share.
Let me stop there and turn it back to Henri.

Two aspects of the consent decree are first of all the inspection that is required as a base line for our work plan. In this case that inspection which will result in a report to FDA in Q4 from Quantic and then our Genzyme comprehensive remediation work plan will be submitted to FDA by the end of this year.
Now the second part Is a batch record review and we are working with Quantic to synchronize our batch record review so that we will minimize the impact on release of product in a very timely way and that we will need to begin at the beginning of self convert. In addition we anticipate that there will be a number of regulatory inspections that will currently routine ongoing inspection process of our facilities at Allston and around the world.

Starting first with Allston Landing. Currently all six fire hatches are up and running. That's we start from approximately a year ago. We've been successfully completed eight Cerezyme runs in addition to the runs that are currently ongoing. The new working cell bank for Cerezyme has received both U.S. and EU approval. I would now completed three runs with the new working cell bank and have seen approximately 30% improvement in productivity. Our continuing to work on the optimization of the clinical process parameter, that we believe should lead to additional productivity improvements based on (parliaments).
We continue to profess well other plans to upgrade facilities, systems and equipments in Allston, increasing our levels of redundancy in overall level of reliability. Our new admin, lab and infrastructure expansion, including a cogent facility for back up steaming power is complete and will be operational in August.
Our project to move all of our fill/finish operations of Allston is progressing well. We have previously transferred all of our Cerezyme 400 units from our Waterford plants as well as Myozyme 160 liter. We've completed three validation runs for Thyrogen, and Fabrazyme and (Hatzpera). These lots ran well and are currently batch review. We remain on track for U.S. product exit by November 2010 and for all other markets by 2011.
Outside of Allston. The timeline for our major capacity programs is continuing to hold very firm. Our new bioreactors lead at Framingham is operational. We have run two bioreactors simultaneously and they ran well. Engineering runs will start in September. The validation beginning in Q1 of 2011. It's important to note that we will begin building Fabrazyme inventory when we begin the validation lots early next year and this material will be available for facility approval, which remains on track for end of year 2011. Our additional fill finish capacity at Waterford continues to be on track for approval on mid '11 and we have also added a third Myozyme bioraft at our facility in Belgium and that is also on track - continues to be on track for mid 2011 approval as well. In addition we have initiated detail design engineering to add two more 4000 meter biorafters for Myozyme at this point.
While we are returning to a more normalized production situation, as Henri said in his opening remarks, I do want to be clear that we are working with minimal inventories with Cerezyme and Fabrazyme while we complete the capacity addition projects and we strive to improve operations at our Allston manufacturing facility. Therefore our ability to supply these drugs can be impacted by non-routine manufacturing issues until we are able to build inventory after Birmingham comes online. Henri?

From a market perspective, we are squarely focused on the long-term strength of the business. Now key to this focus is maintaining open and accurate communication with patients and healthcare providers who have been very loyal to Genzyme through this process.
We are report to you today our current supply plan and our expectation of returning particularly returning Cerezyme patients to full dose by the end of the year. I do want to stress for patients, the details of when and how much drug will be available are still being refined. So as you can see from the range of our financial guidance, we will be continuing to communicate more specifically with patients and prescribers at the country level over the coming months, so the physicians can make appropriate treatment choices for their patients.
In addition to focusing on returning (inaudible) and fabry business to health, our other main priority is the growth of our business in pompe disease. Myozyme volume growth has been strong internationally with commercial patients increasing by 19% in the quarter versus Q209 and volume increasing by 23% reflecting the fact that new patients are more frequently now adult patients. As Henri mentioned, the Lumizyme launch is just beginning in the U.S. and this is our first experience with managing a REMS program and I have to say that we are quite pleased with the progress we have made.
To remind you, initiating the Lumizyme ace program, our REMS program consists of three pieces. First we have to train and enroll the sites, then train and enroll the individual prescriber and then enroll the patient. And in two months since approval, we have now trained and enrolled a 113 infusion sites, 156 prescribers and as of today, we have enrolled a 122 patients in the Lumizyme ace program. Recall that there are a 196 ATAP patients in total. This program, the ATAP program will remain open until August 20 to ensure patients have uninterrupted therapy while we work through the ace program. We expect to add these patients to treatment and now, of course, our sales team can also focus on increasing our pipeline of naive patients, which currently stands at about a 100 patients.

If you look at patient approval year-on-year, first half 2009 versus first half 2010 in Europe almost identical. Some might be speed with which you get the patient out of the treatment, but we are still identifying patients at a very good rate. I think to a significant extent you didn't see any of the Lumizyme, again with an approval on May probably would have had an expectation to see more. It's that - getting that REMS program up and running really kept us from having significant impact. But international again, guidance reflects that we are slightly below where we expected to be from a growth rate in our budgeting process, but I reflected the actual growth, which is again close to 20% on patient basis.

So not all of the 122 patients are being infused yet, again the numbers of patients that we're enrolling we're seeing increasing from yesterday to today that increased by six.
So with perspective we are significantly moving that number forward. And important date to remember is August 20 is when the ATAP program closes. We wanted to give time so that patients didn't get - have the opportunity to miss infusions but we won't be supplying product through ATAP any longer as of August 20 and that's a 196 patients who are ATAP patients. So an expectation that say the vast majority of those patients will be either being infused or very close to being infused by that date.

We're being appropriately conservative in terms of the assumptions we make we're very obvious and I think very appropriate reasons, but there is always upside the only caution l would stress at this point is because of the length of our cycles as we see upside in the plant it will take time for it to work its way through the system and be approved into the product and that's why I think we very appropriately articulated our ability to start increasingly our supplies in Q3 and Q4 as we roll into next year and we can clearly update you on our progress in terms of driving some of this upside in the next call as an (inaudible) business.

In terms of PCHS (ph) and hits that we've had, we've had no genuine hits on it fairly I mean anywhere in our process. We've seen a positive I mean at one point but it's fairly that was a lab issue clearly identifiable from that standpoint and just as a follow-on to that we continued to progress very well with our overall viral risk mitigation programs across all the dimensions and one of the big ones is our ability to detect something if we were to see it very, very early on and we're very happy we have that PCR test at this point.
In terms of any colliding variances or deviations, I may let Ron comment, but deviations would be a normal process, I mean in fact if you don't see deviations you would be confirmed that you're not really taking a close enough look and what's going with your process so we clearly seen on the vast majority of them are easily resolvable, we put in corrective actions preventive actions across the board, I mean now we've seen several things that would lead to lot that we would lose, yes absolutely and again but that's a routine part of operation and we've seen nothing that would be out of the ordinary at this point in time. In fact we're actually approving our ability quite effectively to be able to deviations as they come up and not impact our ability for a lot release in terms of Fabrazyme productivity, yes we saw, it's about 30% increase from what we were seeing in old working cell banks where we're at and if you recall what we said in the past was that we were hoping that we would be able to see somewhere 60% increase or so or we thought there was another 30% upside overall in our productivity from working cell bank standpoint.
We've not seen that additional productivities that we thought that was upside that we was demonstrated and poly scale activity. The model is pretty good but it's not a perfect predictor of what happens in the plant. We understand the critical process parameters more around solid density specific pieces in the process that if we control at appropriately we think we'll be able to get the additional productivity out and that's where we're focused right now.
So Fabrazyme productivity in general, if you go back and look it from the early days to now there is still some basic process understanding that we would like to improve and it does. There is some variation in it. So just go back historically in doing apples-and-apples comparisons is a little bit difficult from around but we're definitely significantly better off than we were before we changed this working cell bank up.

Today we've had six patients who have looked to patients who've looked to start on Cerezyme and we're going to begin working them through the process.
So when you think in terms of inventory, six patients really does an impact, our inventory but treating those six patients obviously significantly impacts them and we think we need to live up to their commitment. The time it takes to move them from the enquiry through the treatment as we said we expect to start increasing those since in September so their treatment will probably line up quite well with when we're beginning to be able to increase doses for a current patient also so we're not compromising increasing doses for our current patients between these new patients.
And then your last question was around the ATAP program the 196 ATAP patients. When I talk about the 122 patients, the vast majority of those consists of the 196 ATAP patients. So there are small numbers of naïve patients we've already enrolled in the Lumizyme ACE Program but that's a reflection of mostly moving those 196 out of ATAP onto Lumizyme ACE Program and onto commercial treatment.

As usual, we have a number of senior executives here who can respond in the Q&A section. Mike Wyzga's here, our Chief Financial Officer; Scott Canute will talk about the present manufacturing operations. We'll talk about where we are in the recovery of our manufacturing capacity; Ron Branning, our Senior Vice President, Global Quality, is here to talk about the consent  decree. John Butler will talk about where we are in PGH and managing this tough moment where we can't quite supply the Cerezyme and Fabrazyme needs in the marketplace. And of course, he will talk about the Lumizyme introduction. 
David Meeker is not here but he's on the call, and he's available for responses in Singapore. He is our Chief Operating Officer, and he can chime in as we go along, and a number of our senior executives are here to respond to the Q&A.
The second quarter, as expected, was a difficult quarter financially. At the beginning of the quarter, we guided that we would supply Cerezyme at 50% of demand through July, and Fabrazyme at 30% of demand through September, and the results we reported today are consistent with that.
We see supply constraints ease currently for Cerezyme and in the next quarter, for Fabrazyme, and we have attached new guidance accordingly. We also adjusted guidance for the divestitures and exchange rate changes and health care reform impact and the percent degree impact and a number of other details that were attached to the press release. But I think in a very detailed way, gets us to where we were in the beginning of the year in terms of guidance to where we now are expected to be for the total year. We also took into account the revenues to the divested businesses for the second half.
We are very focused on the value creation activities that we've spoken about in recent calls of this kind. There's clearly no more impactful element here is to resupply the Cerezyme and Fabrazyme market needs, and you will get a picture as to where we are. It is encouraging where we are. We are seeing the kind of progress that we have been hoping for since our becoming much more mobilized, and we are working our way with this product to the points where it can become released and can be supplied, patients around the world.
It's a very encouraging moment. We are at the tail end of this very, very tough year that we've all lived through together.
Very exciting is of course the launch of Lumizyme. It's as expected because of the ramps, and setting up the ramps and certifying, et cetera, et cetera [ph]. It takes a little while to get that going. But John Butler will give you full updates. It's obviously quite exciting to be able to bring that product to all patients in the United States and not having the limitations that we've lived under for two years.
We're deeply engaged in an effort to really understand all the costs in the corporation and ways to work more efficiently and the streamline operations. And in the fall, we will be communicating with you what the impacts of the actions that will follow this review are.
We are very much engaged in preparing for the alemtuzumab, the MS story. This is a very important driver. It's not just a new product, it is a major new element for the corporation. We are now halfway through the clinical trials. We'll see the results next year, summer for the first trial, a few months later for the second trial. And we've had many meetings for viewing, the regulatory approaches, the regulatory strategies and the cost of two trials for the goods [ph] faster than we expected and are so close together. We will be filing for regulatory actions, these post-trials at once. This is a very exciting program that is taking increasing resources in the preparation of the launch that we would now expect in 2012, late 2012, and abroad 2013. 
And we're optimizing, and not only optimizing, but really accelerating a number of the products that we recently launched, and some of these results you can see. When you take Fabrazyme and Cerezyme out of the equation, the rest of the business grew 13% despite the impact, and not too great an impact but some impact of the exchange rates. Synvisc-One did extremely well in the second quarter as it did in the first quarter, up 30% plus. 
Mozobil, again, had a very good quarter. Clolar had a very good quarter, up almost 30%, and Renvela is still a very exciting program. It didn't have a very strong quarter, and we are still in the launch phase. And many countries in Europe on the CKD [chronic kidney disease] indication and all indications, actually, as we get pricing set up for this product. But it has a very interesting future ahead of it.
Of course, here, we have a situation that by 2014, '15, we will have the patent situation occur. You saw us during the quarter take actions and implement some of the capital structure decisions that we announced earlier. We did announce the debt of $1 billion and the buy back programs for the first $1 billion. The second $1 billion will be -- we'll see in the next 10 or so months.
We also prepared the three businesses that we decided to announce to you we would divest, the Genetic Diagnostic business, the Diagnostic Product business, the Pharmaceutical Business. We took the second half sales out of the guidance as you have seen, and we are still planning that these transactions will help happen before the end of the year.
So with these comments, let me hand over to Mike Wyzga to go through the financial detail. Mike?"

As Henri mentioned, the second quarter was challenging financially. But we did make a lot of progress in a number of different areas. As we mentioned at our Analyst Day in May, we talked about our capital discipline, and we out",1590,"Thank you very much, Henri. As Henri mentioned, the second quarter was challenging financially. But we did make a lot of progress in a number of different areas. As we mentioned at our Analyst Day in May, we talked about our capital discipline, and we outlined a number of key action items against that discipline. We announced that we find strategic alternatives for our Genetics, our Diagnostics and our Pharmaceutical business, and we're making very good progress and have targeted these transactions to be complete by year end.
We also mentioned that we would seek a $1 billion net offering. In June, we issued in our inaugural bond issuance in two tranches. The first tranche was $500 million in a five-year note, net priced very well at 3.6%. And the other $500 million was in 10-year notes, and that was priced at 5%. We immediately used the proceeds of those tranches to do an accelerated stock repurchase program. This repurchase program represents the first half of our announced $2 billion stock repurchase program.
And as we mentioned before, where we committed to an operational efficiency program, we made a lot of progress on that, the multiyear program and we expect the full implementation in the fall. We'll also discuss it in the fall as well.
So let me turn my attention to the quarterly results and then I can say a few words about our guidance. From Q2 of last year, our top line decreased by about 12% to approximately $1.08 billion. The overall impact of foreign exchange was relatively immaterial. It decreased our top line revenue by about $6 million. That's not the case as you'll see in our guidance package, but it certainly was the case on our Q-to-Q basis. And that's specifically because while the euro was unfavorable on a year-to-year basis, other currencies moved in the opposite direction from Q2 of last year. Now with all that said, the geographic dispersion can cause a different impact on a product-by-product basis, and I'll talk through a little bit about that in a second.
The Cerezyme decreased to $139 million, again, due to the supply limitations. Fabrazyme revenue decreased on a year-to-year basis to $39 million, again, impacted by those reduction. Myozyme came in at $92 million, and that's an increase of 16% year-to-year.
The majority of the sales were in Europe, and therefore, it was the most severely impacted by the euro foreign exchange. Revenue decreased by a little over half of the FX impact for the overall corporation in the top line or about $3.7 million.
Revenue in the Renal and Endocrinology area increased by 4% to $258 million. Renagel and Renvela came in at $170 million, and Thyrogen increased nicely by 8% due to strong growth, both here in the United States as well as in the international markets.
Biosurgery revenue increased to $164 million or 18%, again, due to the Synvisc which demonstrate very, very strong revenue growth. Compared to last year, Synvisc revenue increased by 31% driven by increasing market share.
In the Hema [Hematology] and Oncology area, we increased by about 58% and that follows the close of the deal with Bayer last June and the incremental revenue of Leukine and Fludara and Campath. Mozobil will continue to be a strong growth driver in this area increasing by 90% to $22 million. And Thymoglobulin, which is now a part of the Hema on care [ph] increased to $58 million due to the growth that we saw in the Asia-Pacific area.
Our non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter came in at 68% of revenue. This gross margin includes $22 million of manufacturing-related discreet items. 
As we disclosed in our last quarterly filing with the SEC, the majority of these costs are associated with the material that was discarded due to the power interruption in Allston. This material was concluded on by QA/QC testing and written off in the second quarter. And we also incurred the cost of temporary shut down of our facility in the U.K.
Our operating expenses continue to be lower than our original estimates in 2010. Compared to Q2 of last year, our non-GAAP research and development expenses were $211 million. The increase that we saw in a year-to-year basis is about $21 million, and that was predominantly focused on the Gaucher small molecule program, as well as the MTAP [Myozyme Temporary Access Program] program for Myozyme.
The non-GAAP SG&A expenses came in at $376 million for the quarter. Now compared to Q2 of last year, these expenses increased due to the full quarter of the oncology infrastructure following the transaction with Bayer. More importantly, it also included what I call discreet-type items such as the proxy contest cost, the legal expenses due to the consent decree as well as costs associated with our business improvement program.
We also increased our reserves against our accounts receivable, increased by approximately $6.5 million. Amortization increased on a year-to-year basis due to the full quarter of the Bayer transaction.
Let me talk a little bit about our Isis investment. Based upon our policy, we determined that the decrease in our equity investment in Isis was other than temporary, and we record an impairment charge of $32 million against that stock in May in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate reflects the impact of a low PBT against our permanent tax benefits, and you'll see that occur in the guidance as well.
Our second quarter GAAP includes the pretax expenses associated with stock options, which came in at relatively flat at $45 million as well as a pretax acquisition cost related to the deal with Bayer.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.18 on the basis of 270 million shares outstanding. Now the stock buyback program didn't really impact that as it came in at the very end of the quarter. It's much more impactful in Q3 and Q4 and beyond.
Our cash position was $974 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our capital expenditures were $178 million for the quarter, and those are mostly focused on manufacturing facilities.
So with that, let me turn my attention to 2010 guidance. As Henri mentioned, our updated guidance takes into account a number of factors, including the impact of supply estimates, any changes in the foreign exchange rate versus our original guidance, the first tranche of our share repurchase, European pricing actions, national healthcare reform here in the United States as well as the divested businesses impact, both on the revenue line as well as on the expense line.
We have not included at this point any estimates for the cash benefits for the divested businesses or the second tranche of stock of the repurchase under the new guidance. It simply went to, really, to estimate these accurately.
So the revenue. Let me talk about the revenue a little bit. The easiest way to think about the changes in our top line revenue from the original guidance is in four major categories. The first are the volume decreases associated with the supply constraints. The supply constraints and the related consent decree impacted Cerezyme, Fabrazyme, and Thyrogen and decreased our original revenue guidance by approximately $315 million. 
The second category is the change in the foreign exchange rate. As you recall, our original guidance was originally set at 1.5 for the year, which was the spot rate at the time we put our budget together. So using the current spot rate for the euro and adjusting the other x U.S. currency, there's a decrease in the product revenue, approximately $170 million. And again, this should be compared against our original guidance.
The third category is the impact of the proposed divestitures to the business in the second half of the year. Our guidance now includes the first half of the actual results of the three proposed strategic divestitures.
The proposed divestitures reduced our revenue guidance by $336 million. And again, this impacts the second half of the year. We've also adjusted and reflected our reduced operating expenses for the guidance for these divestitures as well.
Lastly, we incorporated the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform and the European pricing on our revised top line guidance. As I mentioned in our last call, in the U.S., approximately it's about $20 million for the U.S. portion of it. The combined pricing actions for both U.S., as well as international at this point is about $30 million for the year.
Our expense guidance, we revised as well. SG&A and R&D expenses were revised to capture the impact, as I mentioned, of the divested businesses, as well as the additional operating cost reductions that we're seeing for the remaining businesses.
We trued up our amortization guidance a bit, and that was due to the impact of primarily the Bayer products as well as Synvisc. Now both of these products and both of these assets are amortized on the basis of revenue, as the long-term revenue projections for both of these assets are expected to increase in the future year, the current period revenue as a proportionate amount of the total is small, and therefore, the amortization decreases proportionally.
We estimate our tax rate will be lower as a percentage of profit before tax due to a lower profit before tax dollar number against our fixed-permanent tax benefits. And with all that put together, our 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the area of $1.90 to $2 per diluted share. 
Let me stop there and turn it back to Henri."

Two aspects of the consent decree are first of all, the inspection that is required as a baseline for our work plan. We've initiated that inspection, which will result in a report to FDA in Q4 from Quantic and then our Genzyme comprehensive remediation of work plan will be submitted to FDA by the end of this year.
The second part is a batch record review, and we are working with Quantic to synchronize our batch record review so that we will minimize the impact on the release of product in a very timely way, and that we will need to begin at the beginning of September. In addition, we anticipate that there will be a number of regulatory inspections that will occur as part of the routine ongoing inspection process of our facilities, both in Allston and around the world."

I'd like to briefly just provide an update, as Henri said, on a number of important aspects of our strategy across global manufacturing, starting first with Allston Landing. Currently, all six bioreactors are up and running. Since restart from approximately a year ago, we have successfully completed eight Cerezyme and eight Fabrazyme runs in addition to the runs that are currently ongoing.
The new working cell bank for Fabrazyme has received both U.S. and EU approval. We've now completed three runs with the new working cell bank and have seen approximately a 30% improvement in productivity. We're continuing to work on the optimization of a critical process parameter that we believe should lead to additional productivity improvements based on pilot runs.
We continue to profess well on our plans to upgrade facilities, systems and equipment at Allston, increasing our levels of redundancy in overall level of reliability. Our new admin, lab and infrastructure expansion, including our cogen  [cogeneration] facility for backup steam and power is complete and will be operational in August.
Our projects moved all of our fill/finish operations and Allston is progressing well. We have previously transferred all of our Cerezyme 400 units going to our Waterford plant, as well as Myozyme 160 L. We've completed three validation runs for Thyrogen and Fabrazyme at Hospira. These labs ran well and are currently under batch review. We remain on track for U.S. product exit by November 2010 and for all of the markets by August of 2011.
Outside of Allston, the timeline for our major capacity addition programs are continuing to hold very firm. Our new bioreactor suite at Framingham is operational. We run two bioreactors simultaneously and they run well. Engineering runs will start in September with validation beginning in Q1 of 2011. 
It's important to note that we'll begin building Fabrazyme inventory when we begin the validation lots early next year, and this material will be available for release upon facility approval, which remains on track for end of year 2011.
Our additional fill/finish capacity at Waterford continues to be on track for approval in mid-'11, and we've also added a third Myozyme bioreactor at our facility in Belgium, and that is also on track, continues to be on track for mid-2011 approval as well. In addition, we've initiated detail design and engineering to add two more 4,000 liter bioreactors for Myozyme at this point.
While returning to a more normalized production situation as Henri said in his opening remarks, I do want to be clear that we are working with minimal inventories with Cerezyme and Fabrazyme while we complete the capacity addition projects, and we strive to improve operations at our Allston manufacturing facility. Therefore, our abilities to supply these drugs can be impacted by non-routine manufacturing issues until we're able to build inventory after Framingham comes online.  Henri?"

Just from a market perspective, we're squarely focused on the long-term strength of the business. Now key to this focus is maintaining open and accurate communication with patients and health care providers have been very loyal to Genzyme through this process. We report here today our current supply plan and our expectation of particularly returning Cerezyme patients to full dose by the end-of-the-year.
I do want to stress for patients the details of when and how much drug will be available or still being refined as you can see from the range of our financial guidance. We will be continuing to communicate more specifically with patients and prescribers at the country level over the coming months so that physicians can make appropriate treatment choices for their patient.
In addition to focusing on returning our Gaucher and Fabry business to health, our other main priority is the growth of our business in Pompe disease. Myozyme volume growth has been strong internationally, with commercial patients increasing by 19% in the quarter versus Q2 '09 and volume increasing by 23%, reflecting the fact that new patients are more frequently now adult patients.
As Henri mentioned, the Lumizyme launch is just beginning in the U.S. Now this is our first experience with managing a REMS program, and I have to say that we're quite pleased with the progress we've made. To remind you, initiating the Lumizyme ACE program, our REMS program consists of three pieces. First, we have to train and enroll the site, then train and enroll the individual prescriber and then enroll the patient.
In the two months since approval, we've now trained and enrolled 113 infusion sites, 156 prescribers, and as of today, we've enrolled 122 patients in the Lumizyme ACE program. Recall that there are 196 ATAP patients in total. This program, the ATAP program will remain open until August 20 to ensure patients have uninterrupted therapy while we work through the ACE program. We expect to add these patients to treatment, and now of course our sales team can also focus on increasing our pipeline of naive patients, which currently stands at about 100 patients.  Henri?"

It's one we're focused on an ongoing basis, I can assure you. It's really pretty straightforward. The actual production process itself is a reasonably straightforward process, a simple free-flowing process. We have a lot of experience with Hospira. We know their systems, we know how they work, because we fill other products there and have done so successfully. And it's basically running from engineering runs to ensure that you can, in fact, make the product successful either the technology transfer has occurred. And then you run validation runs, basically, say, you're going to run the process this way, you run it and then you assess, did in fact work the way you thought it was. It's really that simple. And in this case, from a regulatory standpoint, we're actually, for the U.S. market, releasing the products into a comparability protocol, which means once we run a validation lot, a single validation lot, and we've run it successfully, the batch in fact approved and meets the criteria embedded in the comparability protocol. It is releasable to the marketplace. So where we're at right now is, we've successfully run engineering runs. We have run three validation lots, they're currently under batch review. If they, in fact, are approved lots, they will, in fact, be releasable to the marketplace immediately. And so that's why we can say, with good confidence, that we'll be able to meet that November deadline. We have additional validation lots planned in August and September. The more you run, of course, your level of confidence increases. But we feel very good about where we're at right now."

There were shipments that fell into Q2 that was European, I believe, shipments. So when you look at the growth numbers that are reflected, those were global growth numbers. Our European growth numbers have been running a little bit slower, which is kind of reflected in our slightly lower guidance. But you still had very strong growth. I believe it was 15% patient growth quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, Q2 versus Q2, and stronger volume growth as well. So there was a shift of revenue.

On a very conservative manufacturing guidance, I'd be glad to comment just very carefully [ph] here. There's clearly upside in any production process. I fact, the bioreactors themselves are running extraordinarily well right now. And in certain periods of time, the bottleneck actually moves down stream and down to the processing. And we have a number of de-bottlenecking activities that we're currently proceeding with and hopefully, to be able to fully capture and utilize that what we can produce in the bioreactors, presuming that we maintain the productivity  that we're currently seeing on ongoing basis. So there's de-bottlenecking activities there we're doing. We're doing a number of things, actually on our ability to approve lots more efficiently going forward, which will help us as we move forward. Fabrazyme productivities, we still think there's upside in this current working cell bank, but we're not resting there. We have two new working cell banks that we've actually laid down and are starting to run small-scale data on. And we've also have laid down a new master cell bank. So we've got some multiple shots out of goal. Now we're being appropriately conservative in terms of the assumptions we make for, very obvious, and I think very appropriate reasons, but there's always upside. The only caution I would stress at this point is, because of the length of our cycles, as we see upside in the plant, it will take time for it to work its way through the system and be approved into the product. And that's why, I think, we very appropriately articulated our ability to start increasing our supplies in Q3 and Q4 as we roll into next year.

Let me start, and if I don't catch them all, I mean, hold me to it, and I'll come back around. In terms of PCR tests and hits that we've had, we've had no genuine hits and clearly, I mean, anywhere in our process. We've seen a false positive, I mean, at one point. But it was a lab issue, clearly identifiable from that standpoint. And just as a follow on to that, we continue to progress very well with our overall viral risk mitigation programs across all of the dimensions. One of the big ones is our ability to detect something if we were to see it very, very early on. And we're very happy we have that PCR test at this point. In terms of any quality variances or deviation, I may let Ron comment, but deviations would be a normal process. I mean, in fact, if you don't see deviations, you'd be concerned that you're not really taking a close-enough look in what's going on in your process. So we, clearly, have seen them, the vast majority of them are easily resolvable. You put in corrective actions, preventive actions across the board. I mean, have we seen several things that would lead to a lot that we would lose? Yes, absolutely. And again, but that's a routine part of operations. And we've seen nothing that would be out of the ordinary at this point in time. In fact, we're actually improving our ability quite effectively to be able to deal with deviations as they come up and not impact our ability for a lot release. In terms of Fabrazyme productivity, yes, we saw, it's about 30% increase from what we are seeing with the old working cell bank, where we're at. And if you recall, what we said in the past, was that we were hoping that we would be able to see somewhere 60% increase or so, or we thought there was another 30% upside overall in our productivity from working cell bank standpoint. We've not see that additional productivity that we thought was upside, that was demonstrated in pilot-scale activity. The model's pretty good but it's not a perfect predictor of what happens in the plant. We understand the critical process parameters, more around cell density at specific pieces in the process, that if we control it appropriately, we think we'll be able to get the additional productivity out. And that's where we're focused right now. SO Fabrazyme productivity in general, if you go back and look at from the early days to now, there is -- there still some basic process understanding that we'd like to improve. And there is some variation in it. So let's go back historically, and do an apples-and-apples comparison, it's a little bit difficult from where we're at, but we we're definitely, significantly better off than we were before we change this working cell bank out."

And what we were talking about in the fall would be for us to be able to give you an insight as to what we think the potential is here. But then it would be the potential of a multiyear program that would provide the benefits over a number of years. Clearly, a very important set of benefits in 2011 and on 2012."

And really, when we look at -- we put this announcement out, I think, about three weeks ago, and asked for physicians to communicate with us when they have an interest in starting a new patient. To date, we've had six patients who've looked to start on Cerezyme. And we're going to begin working them through the process.  So when you think in terms of inventory, six patients really doesn't impact our inventory, but treating those six patients, obviously, significantly impacts them. And we think we need to live up to that commitment. The time it takes to move them from the inquiry through to treatment, as we said, we expect to start increasing dosage in September. So their treatment will probably line up quite well with when we're beginning to be able to increase dosage of our current patients also. So we're not compromising increasing doses for our current patients to treat these new patients. And then your last question was around the ATAP program, the 196 ATAP patients. When I talk about the 122 patients, the vast majority of those consist of the 196 ATAP patients. So there are small number of naive patients we've already enrolled in the Lumizyme ACE program, but that's a reflection of mostly, moving those 196 out of ATAP on to the Lumizyme ACE program and on to commercial treatment."

We'll also make some comments, so Doctor Mike Vasconcelles, who's the head of the clinical unit for oncology on putting in perspective the Clolar trial that was announced also, I believe, early this morning, the classic one trial for AML, for Clolar.
So quarter three wasn't really -- the quarter's really described the beginning of our financial recovery as a result of starting/restarting the supply of Cerezyme in the marketplace in the United States in particular. And we expect this to continue throughout the world in quarter four. And as a result, we've been able to increase, how we think about quarter four in Cerezyme for the first time in more normalized terms. We would expect that during this quarter, almost all patients that are still on Cerezyme around the world will be on full dose. And we're projecting a revenue number for the fourth quarter of $235 million to $245 million.
The other important driver of growth in the quarter was Lumizyme. We got approval very late in the second quarter as your remember. We started the introduction during the quarter. By mid-quarter, we stopped the ATAP program, and we are extremely happy indeed how that progressed during the quarter.
Revenues went from $4.5 million to its combination of Myozyme for the classical infantile babies and Lumizyme for $4.5 million in quarter two into $19.1 million in quarter three, and we are projecting for quarter four to reach $30 million, making it now a material product in our portfolio.
The recovery of Fabrazyme will start this quarter, we expect it to double shipments during the quarter and we're expecting revenues between $70 million and $75 million. Quarter four then is becoming, as we have often guided throughout the year, the first and more normal quarter since the manufacturing interruption started in the third quarter of 2009. And so a combination of the improved revenues and the implementation of the value improvement program that we also spoke about at prior calls. We now expect a very significant change, a more normalized position around the earnings per share, and the non-GAAP projections are $0.90 to $0.95 for the first quarter. And that then becomes the base for how we think about 2011. And we'll talk more about that as we start our London [ph] roadshow later this week.
So let me now ask Mike to do the sort of financial details. And then after Mike, Scott Canute will talk about our manufacturing update."

As Henri mentioned in his opening remarks, it's an interesting quarter for Genzyme as it sort of marked the clear turning point for the corporation.

As Henri mentioned in his opening remarks, it's an interesting quarter for Genzyme as it sort of marked the clear turning point for the corporation. We made significant progress on our manufacturing operations on our way to resupplying the market. We also took a number of steps beyond the manufacturing operations. As you recall earlier this year, we talked about a number of initiatives to increase shareholder value. One of those things was the strategic alternatives to some of our non-core business. As part of this, we recently announced the asset purchase agreement with LabCorp to acquire Genzyme Genetics for $925 million in cash. The remaining businesses divestitures remain on track and on target for completion by the end of the year.
Our financial results for this period also reflect the full quarter impact of our stock repurchase programs. Under this program, we repurchased approximately 15.7 million shares at an average price of about $63.90. Now this represents the first half of our announced $2 billion stock repurchase program.
And finally, we continue to make progress on our operational efficiency program. Henri touched on it, it's called the value improvement program, or VIP. The first steps of this multiyear program are now underway.
Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.26. Our GAAP to non-GAAP cross-work reflects the impact of our stock compensation expense, purchase accounting associated with the transaction of Bayer, the restructuring costs and discontinued operations. The pretax expenses associated with stock options were at $41 million. The pretax acquisition cost associated with the deal with Bayer were $5 million. And finally, we recorded a $3 million associated with severance in our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings.
Our third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.42. And this is in line with our overall non-GAAP EPS guidance that we gave earlier this year of $0.40 to $0.50. Resulted to a substantial increase in our Q3 of last year where we came in at $0.26, again, on a non-GAAP basis.
Let me turn on to our quarterly results and then say a few words about the guidance. For our Q3 of last year, our top line increased by 8% to approximately $1 billion. The revenue increases Henri mentioned is predominantly driven by Cerezyme, which we increased almost double or $180 million. Our patients in the U.S. began returning to normal dosing levels in September.
Fabrazyme revenue was $34 million and that was impacted predominantly by the supply constraints. We started the process of doubling the current allocations of Fabrazyme here in the United States, and we expect to roll this out globally in the fourth quarter.
Myozyme revenue came in at $106 million. And that's an increase of $20 million year-to-year. That was following the U.S. Lumizyme approval here in the United States and the transition of the ATAP patients to commercial therapy throughout the third quarter. We'll see the full quarter impact of this in the upcoming quarters.
Revenue in the renal and endocrinology area increased 4% to $270 million. Renagel and Renvela revenue came in at $179 million. Pectoral revenue came in $49 million and Thyrogen increased to $42 million. Biosurgery revenue increased to $157 million, or 8%. Synvisc revenue on a year-to-year basis, increased by 14%. The Synvisc third quarter revenue reflects some seasonal pattern that we have seen historically in this product.
The Hemo and Oncology area increased to $167 million, or 17% over last year. This increase is driven largely by Mozobil, which increased to $24 million, almost double that of last year. Now the overall revenue was impacted by foreign exchange, which was negative, decreasing our revenue by approximately $16 million on a year-to-year basis.
Our non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was $706 million, or70.5% of revenue. On a year-to-year basis, the gross margin as a percentage of revenue was impacted by both product mix and product margins. The margins in both Cerezyme and Fabrazyme can reflect some of the incremental cost associated with our quality investment and operating on the content degree. As we start to get higher capacity, those will dissipate.
In the margin we also reflect the impact of approximately $8 million of remediation cost associated with our facility in England. This facility has now restarted, and we don't expect to these costs then. And finally, the gross margin increased approximately $6 million of manufacturing-related discrete cost associated with our various inventory write-offs.
Our operating expenses continue to be lower than our initial 2010 estimates. And that really reflects the increased focus that we have on Sustainable operational efficiency. And on a year-to-year basis, it should be noted that our revenue increased by about 8%. Our Operating expenses actually decreased as both the dollar amount, as well as the percentage of revenue. 
Compared to Q3 of last year, our non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased to $193 million. And as I pointed out, as percentage of revenue, R&D decrease from 22% last year to about 19% this year.
Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses came in at $313 million compared to Q3 of last year, that's an increase of about $12 million. But as a percentage of revenue, again, we saw a decrease as our SG&A decreased from 32% last year to approximately 31% this year.
Our amortization decreased $6 million year-to-year. That's largely due to the increased revenue projection of Fludara. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, that's fairly consistent with last year. Our basic weighted average share has decreased to 255 million shares, and that reflects the stock repurchase of approximately 15.7 million shares, offset by about 4 million options that were exercised during the quarter.
Our cash position is $1.2 billion. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $167 million and those are focused mostly on our manufacturing operations.
Turning to our guidance for 2010, we've retained our guidance range from $0.90 to $0.95 for the fourth quarter. The expected increase per share in Q3 to Q4 is broken out on a step chart that we attached to our earnings. It was really driven by four major factors. The first is a return of normal dozing for Cerezyme on a worldwide basis. Remember, Q3 reflects only the U.S. patients returning to normal dozing. Q4 reflect the first quarter where we get to really the full dosing on a global basis.
The second is a doubling of the allocations of Fabrazyme globally. Again, in the third quarter, the allocation doubling was limited to the United States, and Q4 will start to capture the full increase of that increased allocation worldwide.
The third factor is the impact of the full quarter of Lumizyme patients on commercial products, as well as additional patient accruals that we expect during the quarter. And then lastly, we expect to continue to capture the impact of the expense reduction associated with our company-wide initiative to improve both efficiency in effect of our spending.  
We'll discuss all of these in more detail on our investor event on Friday, as well as talk about what it all means for 2011. So with that, let me turn it back to Henri."

I'd like to briefly provide an update on a number of important aspects in our strategy across Global Manufacturing. In Allston landing, all six bioreactors continue to be operational and running well. Since restart, we've successfully completed 12 Cerezyme and 10 Fabrazyme runs. Cerezyme productivity continues to run at or above historical trends.
For Fabrazyme, we've now completed five runs, with a new working cell bank and have seen approximately a 30% to 40% improvement in productivity. Our most recent run was the highest productivity we've seen since Q4 of 2008. We're continuing to work on the optimization of critical process parameters that we believe should lead to even further productivity improvement.
Our projects that involve our fill/finish operations out of Allston is progressing well. We previously transferred all of our Cerezyme 400-unit billing to a lot of different plants, as well as Myozyme 160 liter. We have now completed nine validation runs for Biogen and Fabrazyme at Hospira to date. These labs have run well and we've released our first Biogen lot to the market from Hospira, and our first Fabrazyme lot release in it. The remaining lots are currently under batch review.  We remain on track for U.S. product exit out of Allston by November 2010 and for all other markets by August of 2011.
Outside of Allston, the timeline for a major capacity addition programs are all holding firm as well. Our new cell culture bioreactor suite in Framingham continues to progress very well. Engineering runs began on schedule in September. We're currently more than halfway to our first run, and everything is going extremely well. It's important to note that we'll begin building Fabrazyme inventory when we begin validation lots in Q1. This material will be available upon facility approval which remains on track for end of year 2011.
Our additional capacity plans for both Waterford and Belgium also remain on track. While we're clearly returning to a more normalized production situation, I do want to be clear that we are working with minimal inventories of Cerezyme and Fabrazyme while we complete these capacity addition projects, and we strive to improve operations at our Allston manufacturing facility. Therefore, our ability to supply these drugs can be impacted by manufacturing issues until we're able to build inventory after Framingham comes online. Henri?"

We welcome the opportunity to share with you this morning the top line study results for classic one. This Phase III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial compared Clolar in combination with cytarabine, to cytarabine plus placebo in patients 55 years of age, or older with relapse or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or AML. Relapse AML, meaning AML that recurs after an initial response to treatment is a challenging disease.
Refractory AML, in other words, AML that has not responded to prior therapy is an even greater challenge. The only cure to therapy in both scenarios is hematic stem cell transplantation. No chemotherapy agent or regiment has demonstrated a survival advantage over any other, and that's no single standard of care exists.
Single-agent cytarabine is among the existing treatment choices and serves as a standard comparator arm in classic one.  As with newly diagnosed patients with AML, the primary goal of treatment in relapsed or refractory disease is to induce the clinical remission, meaning that no residual leukemia is present in the blood or bone marrow, and for a full blood count to have normalized, or nearly so.
Clinical remissions in this disease are important for two reasons. First, normalization of blood count, the risk of infection, anemia and bleeding are markedly reduced. This allows patients time away from the hospital to be with family and friends, a meaningful clinical outcome for patients with a fatal disease.
Second, the outcome for patients undergoing stem cell transplant are improved as they enter the transplant procedure in the critical remission. Whereas historically, only clinical remission was relevant for older adults like those enrolled in classic one, remission as a bridge to transplant is now becoming increasingly important since advances in transplantation are extending this treatment options to more and more older patients.
SO in an effort to improve these outcomes, the classic one study was designed in order to enroll patients 55 years of age or older with relapsed or refractory AML. The study assumptions provided 90% statistical power to detect the 50% improvement in overall survival, the primary study endpoint.
Prespecified secondary efficacy endpoints were included in the trial design in order to capture the full clinical impact of the study treatments, specifically complete remission, or CR, overall remission, or OR, and overall and four-month event free survival or EFS and four-month EFS, respectively, were assessed.
Event free survival has particular clinical meaning because this composite endpoint comprises remission, remission durability, in other words, how long the remission lasts, and survival wire line remission for the entire study population. In other words, EFS captures the important of durable remission and survival and remission in a clinically meaningful manner. 
We enrolled 326 patients across North America and Europe in classic one. Preliminary review of the patient demographic show that the two treatment arms were well-balanced for the prespecified strata based upon each patient's response to their first treatment regimen administered prior to study and treat.
Although the study does not show a difference between the arms and the primary endpoint of overall survival, the combination arm of Clolar, plus cytarabine demonstrate a statistical significance across all four of the prespecified secondary efficacy endpoints reviewed above. In other words, complete remission, overall remission, event free survival and four-month EFS, compared to the cytarabine plus placebo arm. Of particular note, the overall remission rate of 47% in the Clolar combination arm was double that of the cytarabine plus placebo arm and the composite endpoint of EFS demonstrated a 37% improvement in the Clolar combination compared to the cytarabine alone. A preliminary review of the adverse event revealed no new safety signals for Clolar.
These clinical trial data reaffirm our commitment to Clolar and AML. Though we would have welcomed the doubling of the overall remission rate and the improvement in EFS in the Clolar combination, I'm translating into an overall survival benefit to the entire patient population. Regardless, we anticipate that these data will be meaningful to physicians and patients as they face difficult treatment decisions for this disease.
We look forward to presenting these data in relevant, upcoming scientific meetings and discussing these results in their totality with regulatory authorities. As additional randomized clinical trial data become available anticipated as early as next year, such as the United Kingdom's National Cancer Research Institute's AML 16 trial in newly diagnosed AML patients over 60 years of age, we look forward to sharing those results with you as well as discussing their place within a spectrum of regulatory and clinical utility for Clolar and AML."

Q3 was an important quarter for the PGH business as it really marked the beginning of our recovery for both Fabrazyme and Cerezyme. For Cerezyme in September in the U.S., we began shipping two doses for all patients, with patients now moving to a dose every two weeks in October. In other words, normal dosing.
In July, we opened up a list in the U.S. for physicians to make us aware of patients who wanted to start Cerezyme therapy. Few patients joined the list before we started shipping at September at our increased quantities. We now have 50 patients who requested to start Cerezyme therapy, including restart patients, naive patients, and 10 patients who were looking to switch back to Cerezyme for alternative therapies.
Now this is of course early data, and we don't have a reason for switching back to Cerezyme for all patients. But for most, it's the patient's choice to return to Cerezyme from a competing therapy. We started the same process to return all Cerezyme patients to normal dosing worldwide, and we expect to have this completed for all patients by the end of this quarter.
Patient numbers now are harder to estimate, but we believe approximately 4,700 patients are on Cerezyme treatment today, or about 85% of the patients treated worldwide.
Turning to Fabrazyme. In the market, we've begun to communicate the availability of significantly more Fabrazyme supply in Q4 worldwide, allowing current patients to significantly increase their dose. In the U.S. to September and October, patients doubled dose from the previous two months and we still anticipate we'll have supply for these patients globally to return to their normal dose in the first half of 2011.
As we see increased volumes from Allston in 2011 in anticipation of the approval of the Framingham plant in late 2011, we're working to be prepared to move patients back to Fabrazyme from competitive therapies and begin to treat the many Fabry patients looking to start treatment with enzyme.
As mentioned before, Q3 marked the first full quarter of revenues for Lumizyme in the U.S. And our first focus was on transitioning the 196 ATAP patients to commercial therapy while working under our first REMS program, and we're very pleased with the progress. The ATAP program officially closed on August 20, so no patients remain on that program.
Now we expect that we'll have 185 of these patients on commercial therapy, with the balance moving to charitable treatment, not seeking treatment but unfortunately, one patient who passed away. Today, we have 179 of these ATAP patients on commercial product, and are working through the final 6 patient's insurance issues.
Additionally, we've added a significant number of naive patients to Lumizyme therapy as well. So for either reporting, we had about 100 commercial patients on Myozyme prior to the approval of Lumizyme. We currently have over 320 patients on Myozyme or Lumizyme therapy in the U.S. And of course, as Lumizyme patients are heavier adult patients. Our current priority is to continue to identify Pompe patients in the U.S. and build our pipeline.
On the development side, the three Phase III trials for eliglustat continue to enroll patients. The enrollment ENCORE, the switching trial, has been slowed by the Cerezyme shortage. But we've made adjustments to the protocol, and now are starting to see an increase in screening and enrollment. And in Q3, we also reported our final Phase III studies for Mipomersen. We now have four positive Phase III studies, and we're working towards our NDA and M&A filings in the first half of 2011, and we're working towards meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed indication for our first filing in homozygous FH and severe heterozygous FH.

We are now in a position, as John highlighted to completely resupply the Brazil market. And so those discussions are ongoing. Israel, though there is a very high concentration of Gaucher patients in Israel, it's a very small fraction of our overall global market. And I think the patients who are in competitive therapy are actually disproportionately [indiscernible] (49:53) in that market and are part of the 850 number that John referenced.

So for example, we have this range right now what we're seeing in 30%, 40% range. We've seen a recent run that will be closer to a 50% improvement in productivity from the previous working cell bank. And so we do think there's some upside than we continue to try and optimize going forward. We do not build that into our planning model. So the financial guidance, as well as the supply guidance that John has talked about is built on a lower end of that range. And as we demonstrate it, become more comfortable with it, then of course we will build that into our ongoing commitments. But right now, we're planning on the conservative side of driving the plant to be able to deliver more on the upside piece of it. I think that's prudent approach. In terms of the Framingham capacity that we have, we'll immediately, well upon release, approval of the product -- and remember, we're building inventory when we start validation lots in Q1 of next year. And under current assumptions, we'll have approximately two to three months of inventory that will immediately be available upon approval of that product of Fabrazyme, which will immediately be available for sale in the markets that approved the site, the first approval will most likely be the U.S. at this point. We all have two bioreactors and then we've got the existing two bioreactors that we currently have in Allston that we can choose to keep on Fabrazyme for as long as we need to and/or switch to Cerezyme. And so we're in a much, much stronger position increasing our overall capacity. And we have a lot more degrees of freedom and flexibility in was optimized, depending on what the demand of both products are, quite honestly. So we'll be, I wouldn't say in a comfortable position but certainly a much more comfortable position when Framingham comes online, and will allow us to build inventory levels for both products that we clearly desire. Both David and Henri had said, in the basically six to nine months inventory as quickly as we possibly can, and that will be clearly a very, very good place to be."

So it's very important for us in terms of our redundancy, in terms of our overall drug product manufacturing strategy, where we want cross-registration. What we will do though is we'll keep Hospira on line because we want to make sure that we got to approved sources both for Cerezyme, for Fabrazyme and for Thyrogen.

The key thing, Mark, what's challenging was the Fabrazyme number, even more so than Cerezyme, is that, that number that we are treating actually decreased particularly Europe where there was a heavy emphasis on ensuring that most of your patients could access the full dose of 1 milligram. So the number which was initially larger and there was an active collaborative effort to move as many patients as possible to competitive therapies to ensure that our supply could go to the more severe patients at the full dose. So again, when you look at total patients treated, I would say to a large extent, that number reflects closer to full dose for Fabrazyme."

We also make some comments; so Dr. Mike Vasconcelles, who is the head of the clinical unit for Oncology, putting in perspective the Clolar trial that was announced also I believe early this morning, the CLASSIC I trial for AML, for Clolar.
So quarter three was a quarter that really described the beginning of our financial recovery as a result of starting, restarting the supply of Cerezyme in the market place in the United States in particular. And we expect this to continue throughout the world in quarter four and as a result we have been able to increase how we think about quarter four and Cerezyme, for the first time in more normalized terms we would expect of doing this quarter almost all patients that are still on Cerezyme are under rolled will be on full dose. And we are protecting a revenue number for the fourth quarter of $235 million to $245 million.
The other important driver of growth in quarter was Lumizyme, they got approval very late in the second quarter as you remember we started introduction during the quarter by mid quarter we stopped the ATAP program and we are extremely happy indeed how that progress during the quarter, revenue went for 4.5 million due its combination of Myozyme for the classical infertile babies and Lumizyme for 4.5 million in quarter two went to 19.1 million at quarter three and we are projecting for quarter four to reach 2 million, making it now a material product in our portfolio.
The recovery of Fabrazyme will start this quarter we are expecting to double the shipments during the quarter and we are expecting revenues in 70 to 75. Quarter four then is becoming as we have often guided throughout the year the first more normal quarters since the manufacturing interruptions started in the third quarter of 2009. And so a combination of the improved revenues and the implementation of the valiant improvement program that we also spoke about at prior calls. We now expect a very significant change more normalized position around the earnings per share, and the non-GAAP projections are $0.90 to $0.95 for the fourth quarter, and that then becomes the base for how we think about 2011 and we will talk more about that as we start our non-deal roadshow later this week. So let me now ask Mike to give sort of financial details and then after Mike, Scott Canute talk about our manufacturing update.

As Henri mentioned in his opening remarks this is a interesting quarter for Genzyme sort of marked the, quite a turning point for this operation. We made significant progress on our manufacturing operations on our way to re-supplying the market. We also took a number of steps beyond the manufacturing operations. As you recall earlier this year we talked about a number of initiatives to increase shareholder value. One of those things was the strategic alternatives to some of our non core businesses. As part of this, we recently announced the asset purchase agreement with LabCorp to acquire Genzyme Genetics for $925 million in cash. 
The remaining businesses divestures remain on track and as they are on target for completion by the end of the year. Our financial results for this period also reflects the full quarter impact under our stock repurchase programs. Under this program we have purchased approximately 15.7 million shares at an average price of about $63.90. And this represents the first half of our announced $2 billion stock repurchase program. 
And finally we continue to make progress on our operational efficiency program. Henry touched on it’s color Value Important Program or VIP. The first steps of this multi-year program are now under way. 
Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.26. Our GAAP to non-GAAP cross work reflects the impact of our stock compensation expense, purchase accounting associated with the transaction with buyer. The restructuring costs and discontinued operations. The pre-tax expenses associated with stock options were $41 million, the pre-tax acquisition costs associated with the deal with Bayer, $5 million and finally we recorded up $3 million associated with severance to non-GAAP to non-GAAP earnings. Our third quarter non-GAAP earnings for diluted share was $0.42 and this is inline with our overall non-GAAP EPS guidance that we gave earlier this year of $0.40 to $0.50. Its also a substantial increase in our Q3 of last year order came in at $0.26 again on a non-GAAP basis.
Let me turn on to our quarterly result and then say a few words about the guidance. For Q3 of last year, our top line increased by 8% to approximately $1 million, the revenue increases having met this is predominantly driven Cerezyme which we increase almost double or $180 million. Patients in the US begin returning to normal dosing levels in September. Fabrazyme revenue was $34 million and that was impacted predominant by the supply constraint. We started the process of doubling the current allocations of Fabrazyme here in the United States and we expect to roll this out globally in the fourth quarter. Myozyme revenue came in at a $106 million and that’s an increase of $20 million year-to-year, that was following the US Lumizyme approval here in the United States and the transition of the ATAP patients to commercial therapy throughout the third quarter.
We'll see the full quarter impact of this in the upcoming quarters. Revenue in the Renal and Endocrinology area increased 4% to $270 million. Renagel and Renvela revenue came in at a $179 million, Hectorol revenue came in at $49 million and Thyrogen increased to $42 million. Biosurgery revenue increased to $157 million or 8%. Synvisc revenue on a year-to-year basis increased by 14%. The Synvisc third quarter revenue reflects some seasonal pattern that we have seen historically in this product.
The Hema and Oncology area increased to $267 million or 17% over last year. This increase is driven largely by Mozibil which increased to $24 million, almost double that of last year. Now the overall revenue was impacted by foreign exchange which was negative decreasing our revenue by approximately $16 million on a year-to-year basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter assuming for the third quarter was $706 million or 70.5% of revenue. On a year-to-year basis, the gross margin as a percentage of revenue was impacted by both product mix and product margins. The margins in both Cerezyme and Fabrazyme reflect some of the incremental costs associated with our quality investment and operating on a consent degree. 
As we start to get higher capacity, both will decapitate. The margin will also reflect the impact of approximately $8 million of remediation costs associated with our facility in England. This facility has now restarted and we now expect to see these costs again. And finally, the gross margin increased approximately $6 million of manufacturing related discrete costs associated with various inventory write offs. Our operating expenses continued below than our initial 2010 estimates. That really reflects the increased focus that we have on sustainable operational efficiency. 
And on a year-to-year basis, you should be noted that revenue increased by about 8%, our operating expenses actually decreased as both the dollar amount as well as a percentage of revenue. Compared to Q3 of last year, our non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased to $193 million. And as I pointed out, as a percentage of revenue R&D decreased from 22% last year to about 19% this year. Our non GAAP SG&A expenses came in at $313 million compared to Q3 of last year. 
That’s an increase of about $12 million but as a percentage of revenue again, we saw a decrease as our SG&A decreased from 32% last year to approximately 31% this year. Our amortization decreased $6 million year-to-year. That’s largely due to the increased revenue projection of Fludara. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21%. That’s really consistent with last year. Our basic weighted average share has decreased to 255 million shares, now reflects the stock repurchase of approximately 15.7 million shares offset by about 4 million options that were exercised during the quarter.
Our cash position is $1.2 billion. Our capital expenditures for the quarter are about $167 million and those were focused mostly on our manufacturing operations.
Turning to our guidance for 2010, we have retained our guidance range to $0.90 to $0.95 for the fourth quarter. The expected increase per share from Q3 to Q4 is broken out on a step charge that we attest to our earnings, but it is really driven by four major factors.
The first is a return of normal dosing for service on a worldwide basis. Remember Q3 reflects only the US patients returning to normal dosing. Q4 reflects the first quarter where we get to a full dosing on a global basis.
The second is a doubling of the allocations of Fabrazyme globally. Again in the third quarter, the allocation of doubling was limited to United States and Q4 will start to capture the full increase of that increased allocation worldwide. The third factor is the impact of the full quarter of Lumizyme patients on commercial products as well as additional patient accruals that we expect during the quarter.
And then lastly we expect to continue to capture the impact of the expense reductions associated with our company-wide initiative to improve both efficiency in effect of our spending. We will discuss all of these in more detail on our investor event on Friday as well as talk about what it all means for 2011.
So with that let me turn it back to Henri.

I’d like to briefly provide an update on a number of important aspects of our strategy across global manufacturing. In Allston Landing, all six bioreactors continue to be operational and running well. Since restart we successfully completed 12 Cerezyme and 10 Fabrazyme runs. Cerezyme productivity continues to run at or above historical trends. For Fabrazyme, we have now completed 5 runs with the new working cell bank and have seen approximately a 30 to 40% improvement in productivity.
Our most recent run was the highest productivity we have seen since Q4 of 2008. We are continuing to work on the optimization of critical process parameters that we believe should lead to even further productivity improvement. Our project to move all of our fill/finish operations out of Allston is progressing well.
We previously transferred all of our Cerezyme 400 unit filling to our Waterford plants as well as Myozyme 160 liter. We've now completed nine validation runs for Thyrogen, and Fabrazyme at Hospira today. These lots have run well, we‘ve released our first Thyrogen lot to the market from Hospira and our first Fabrazyme lot released is in that. The remaining lots are currently under batch review. We remain on track for US product exit out of Allston by November 2010 and for all other markets by August of 2011.
Outside of Allston, the timeline for our major capacity addition programs are all holding firm as well. Our new cell culture bioreactors suite in Framingham continues to progress very well. Engineering run began on schedule in September. We’re currently more than halfway through our first run and everything is going extremely well.
It's important to note that we will begin building Fabrazyme inventory when we begin validation lots in Q1, this material will be available upon facility approval which remains on track for end of year 2011. Our additional capacity plans of both Waterford and Belgium also remain on track.
While we are clearly returning to a more normalized production situation, I do want to be clear that we are working with minimal inventories of Cerezyme and Fabrazyme while we complete these capacity addition projects and we strive to improve operations at our Allston manufacturing facility. Therefore our ability to supply these drugs can be impacted by manufacturing issues until we are able to build inventory after Framingham comes online. Henri?

We welcome the opportunity to share with you this morning the top line study results for CLASSIC I. The Phase III randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared Clolar in combination with cytarabine to cytarabine plus placebo",756,"Thank you, Henri. We welcome the opportunity to share with you this morning the top line study results for CLASSIC I. The Phase III randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared Clolar in combination with cytarabine to cytarabine plus placebo in patients of 55 years of age or older with relapse of refractory acute myeloid leukemia or AML. Relapsed AML, meaning AML that recurs after an initial response to treatment, it’s a challenging disease. Refractory AML, in other words AML that has not responded to prior therapy is an even greater challenge. The only care to therapy in both scenarios is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No chemotherapy agent or regimen has demonstrated the trivial advantage over any other and that’s no single standard of character.
Single agent cytarabine is among the existing treatment choices and served as a standard comparative on the CLASSIC I. As with newly diagnosed patients with AML, the primary goal of treatment in relapsed on refractory has been induced with clinical remission, meaning that no residual leukemia is present in the blood or bone marrow and peripheral blood counts have normalized or nearly so.
Clinical remissions in this disease are important for two reasons: first, with normalization of blood counts the risks of infection, anemia and bleeding are the markedly reduced. This allows patients time away from the hospital to be with family and friends, a meaningful clinical outcome for patients with a fatal disease; second, the outcomes for patients undergoing stem cell transplant are improved if they enter the transplant procedure in a clinical remission. Whereas historically, only clinical remission was relevant for older adults like those enrolled in CLASSIC I, remission is a bridge to transplant is now becoming increasingly important since advances in transplantation are extending this treatment option to more and more older patients.
So in an effort to improve these outcomes, the CLASSIC I study was designed in order to enroll patients 55 years of age or older with relapsed or refractory AML. The study assumptions provided 90% statistical power to detect a 50% improvement in overall survival of the primary study endpoint. Pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints were included in the trial design in order to capture the full clinical impact of the study treatment, specifically complete remission or CR, overall remission or OR and overall and four-month event free survival or EFS and four-month EFS respectively were assessed.
Event-free survival has particular clinical meaning because this composite endpoint comprises remission, remission durability, in other words how long a remission lasts, and survival while in remission for the entire study population. In other words, EFS captures the importance of durable remission and survival in remission in a clinically meaningful manner.
We enrolled 326 patients across North America and Europe in CLASSIC I. Preliminary review of the patient demographics show that the two treatment arms were well balanced for the pre-specified strata based upon each patient’s response to their first treatment regimen administered prior to study entry. Although the study did not show a difference between the arms and the primary endpoint of overall survival, the combination on our Clolar plus cytarabine demonstrated statistical significance across all four of the pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints reviewed above. In other words, complete remission, overall remission, event-free survival and four-month EFS compared to the cytarabine plus placebo arm.
Of particular note, the overall remission rate of 47% in the Clolar combination arm was double that of the cytarabine plus placebo arm, and the composite endpoint of EFS demonstrated a 37% improvement in the Clolar combination compared to cytarabine alone. A preliminary review of the adverse event revealed no new safety signals for Clolar. These clinical trails data reaffirm our commitment to Clolar and AML. Now we would have welcomed the doubling of the overall emission rate and the improvement in EFS in the Clolar combination on translating into an overall survival benefit for the entire patient population, regardless we anticipate that these data will be meaningful to physicians and patients as they face difficult treatment decisions for this disease. We look forward to presenting these data to relevant upcoming scientific meetings and discussing these results in their totality with regulatory authorities. As additional randomized clinical trial data become available anticipated as early as next year, such as the United Kingdom’s National Cancer Research Institute's AML-16 trial in newly diagnosed AML patients over 60 years of age. We look forward to sharing those results with you as well and discussing their place within the spectrum of regulatory and clinical utilities for Clolar and AML.

Q3 was an important quarter for the PGH business as it really marked the beginning of our recovery for both Fabrazyme and Cerezyme. For Cerezyme in September in the US we began shipping two doses for all patients with patients now moving to a dose every two weeks in October in other words normal dosing. 
In July we opened up a list in the US for physicians to make us aware of patients who wanted to start Cerezyme therapy. Few patients joined the list before we started shipping in September at our increased quantities. We now have 50 patients who've requested to start Cerezyme therapy including restart patients, naïve patients and 10 patients who are looking to switch back to Cerezyme from alternative therapies. Now this is of course early data and we don’t have a reason for switching back to Cerezyme for all patients but for most, it’s the patient's choice to return to Cerezyme from a competing therapy. 
We’ve started the same process to return all Cerezyme patients to normal dosing worldwide and we expect to have this completed for all patients by the end of this quarter. Patient numbers are now harder to estimate, but we believe approximately 47,000 patients are on Cerezyme treatment today or about 85% of the patients treated worldwide. 
Turning to Fabrazyme, in the market we’ve begun to communicate the availability of significantly more Fabrazyme supply in Q4 worldwide allowing current patients to significantly increase their dose. In the US, since September and October patients doubled the dose from the previous two months and we still anticipate we'll have supply for these patients globally to return to their normal dose in the first half of 2011. 
As we see increased volume from Allston in 2011 and anticipation of the approval of the Framingham plant in late 2011. We're working to be prepared to move patients back to Fabrazyme from competitive therapies and begin to treat the many Fabry patients looking to start treatment with enzyme.
As mentioned before Q3 mark, the first full quarter of revenues for Lumizyme in the US and our first focus was on transiting the 196 ATAP patients to commercial therapy while working under our first REMS program and we are very pleased with the progress. The ATAP program officially closed on August 20th so no patients remain on that program. Now we expect it will have 185 of these patients on commercial therapy with the balance moving to charitable treatment not seeking treatment, where unfortunately one patient who passed away. 
Today we have 179 of these ATAP patients on commercial product and are working through the final six patients insurance issues. Additionally we’ve added a significant number of naïve patients to Lumizyme therapy as well. So for ease of reporting, we had about 100 commercial patients on Myozyme prior to the approval of Lumizyme. We currently have over 320 patients on Myozyme or Lumizyme therapy in the US and of course as Lumizyme patients are heavier adult patients. Our current priority is to continue to identify Pompe patients in the US and build our pipeline. 
On the development side, the three Phase 3 trials for eliglustat continue to enroll patients. The enrollment in ENCORE, the switching trial has been slowed by the Cerezyme shortage but we’ve made adjustments to the protocol and now are starting to see an increase in screening and enrollment.
And In Q3 we also reported our final Phase 3 studies from mipomersen. We now have four positive Phase 3 studies and we are working towards our NDA and MAA filings in the first-half 2011 and we are working towards meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed indication for our first filing in homozygous FH and severe heterozygous FH.

Israel although there is a very high concentration of Gaucher patients in Israel is a very small fraction of our overall global market and I think the patients who are on competitive therapy are actually disproportionately on VPRIV in that market and are part of the 850 number that John referenced. So, I don’t think we can give better calibration in terms of the risk there, but I think Taliglucerase at this point in time remains a small potential impact factor in terms of the overall picture.

And you have seen some patient debts as well. The more severe patients who started. So the netting is not as much as you saw earlier in the launch cycle but as we look at continuing to do wide screening initiatives etcetera across Europe they continue to yield really significant results. So we do continue to see that pipeline build in Europe and we are undergoing those same kind of screening efforts in the US with the MDA clinics to build that a robust pipeline in the US as well.

So for example I said we have this range right now what we are seeing in 30-40% range. We have seen a recent run that would be closer to 50% improvement in productivity from the previous working cell bank and so we do think there is some upside that we continue to try and optimize going forward. We do not build that into our planning model, so the are financial guidance as well as the supply guidance that John has talked about is built on a lower end of that range.
And as we demonstrate it will become more comfortable with that, than of course we will build that into our ongoing commitment, but right now we are planning on a conservative side but driving the plant to be able to deliver more on the upside piece of it and I think that’s a prudent approach.
In terms of Framingham, the capacity that we have will immediately, well upon release, approval of the product I mean remember we are building inventory, when we start validation loss in Q1 of next year and under current assumptions we will have approximately 2 to 3 months of inventory that will immediately be available upon approval of that product of Fabrazyme which will immediately be available for sale in the markets that approve this and the first approval will most likely be the US.
At this point, we will have two bioreactors and then we have got existing two bioreactors that we currently have in Allston that we can choose to keep on Fabrazyme for as long as we need to and/or switch to Cerezyme and so we are in a much, much stronger position increasing our overall capacity and we have lot more degrees of freedom and flexibility and/or optimized depending on what the demand of both products are quite honestly. So we will be, I wouldn’t say in a comfortable position, but certainly in a much more comfortable position when Framingham comes online and then it will allow us to build the inventory levels for both products that we clearly desire both David and Henri had said in the basically six to nine month inventory as quickly as we possibly can and that will be clearly a very, very good place to be.

So, it’s very important for us in terms of our redundancies, in terms of our overall drug product manufacturing strategy where we want to cross registration. What we will do though is we will keep Hospira online because we want to make sure that we’ve got two approved sources, both for Cerezyme and Fabrazyme and for Thyrogen.
We will cross register the products and keep both in play at least in terms of minimal level, so that we have practice that we can maintain a validate date for the products if in fact we would need to, that we would have an issue at one facility or the other. Over a longer period of time I would suspect that we will see a greater proportion of our overall production in the Waterford facility, but right now we want to make sure that we get both facilities in play and we are very comfortable with the quality of the product made as well as the operational capability in both cases.

So, the number which was initially larger and there was an active collaborative effort to move as many patients possible to competitive therapies to ensure that our supply could go to the more severe patients at the full dose. 
So, again when you look at total patients treated I would say to a large extent that number reflects closer to full dose for Fabrazyme.

I mean obviously in terms of the quarter re-mediation, the consent decree impact as well as it’s obviously critical that we get to product supply capabilities restore this quickly and as completely as we can and so you’ll certainly air on the side during much of the effectiveness over efficiency but as you improve our systems, you get a low run site. 
You’ll be able to get more volume through the site. It’s made of higher quality and everything just starts to run. And so, we might see a short term blip, I think we’ll probably will see a short-term blip in terms of incremental cost. But over a period of time when you can define time in the two or three year time period, we will see a more efficient operation at the end of the day. I have absolutely no question about it whatsoever. So all things being equal, I would expect to see actually an improvement in gross margins just because the efficiency of the operation. 
Now a lot of things play into that clearly; overall demand, capacity utilization et cetera, et cetera. So you can’t necessarily draw a straight line from -- and to what we’ll see but because of the investments we’re making, we will see a more efficient operation. I have no doubt about that whatsoever.

We'll also make some comments, so Dr. Mike Vasconcelles, who's the head of the clinical unit for oncology on putting in perspective the Clolar trial that was announced also, I believe, early this morning, the classic one trial for AML, for Clolar.
So quarter three wasn't really -- the quarter's really described the beginning of our financial recovery as a result of starting/restarting the supply of Cerezyme in the marketplace in the United States in particular. And we expect this to continue throughout the world in quarter four. And as a result, we've been able to increase how we think about quarter four and Cerezyme for the first time in more normalized terms. We would expect that during this quarter, almost all patients that are still on Cerezyme around the world will be on full dose. And we're projecting a revenue number for the fourth quarter of $235 million to $245 million.
The other important driver of growth in the quarter was Lumizyme. We got approval very late in the second quarter as your remember. We started the introduction during the quarter. By mid-quarter, we stopped the ATAP program, and we are extremely happy indeed how that progressed during the quarter.
Revenues went from $4.5 million to its combination of Myozyme for the classical infantile babies and Lumizyme for $4.5 million in quarter two went to $19.1 million in quarter three, and we are projecting for quarter four to reach $30 million, making it now a material product in our portfolio.
The recovery of Fabrazyme will start this quarter. We are expecting to double shipments during the quarter and we're expecting revenues between $70 million and $75 million. Quarter four then is becoming, as we have often guided throughout the year, the first and more normal quarter since the manufacturing interruption started in the third quarter of 2009. And so a combination of the improved revenues and the implementation of the value improvement program that we also spoke about at prior calls, we now expect a very significant change, a more normalized position around the earnings per share. And non-GAAP projections are $0.90 to $0.95 for the fourth quarter. And that then becomes the base for how we think about 2011. And we'll talk more about that as we start our non-deal roadshow later this week.
So let me now ask Mike to do the sort of financial details. And then after Mike, Scott Canute will talk about our manufacturing update."

As Henri mentioned in his opening remarks, it's an interesting quarter for Genzyme as it sort of marked the clear turning point for the corporation. We made significant progress on our manufacturing operations on our way to resupplying the market. We also took a number of steps beyond the manufacturing operations. As you recall earlier this year, we talked about a number of initiatives to increase shareholder value. One of those things was to seek strategic alternatives to some of our non-core businesses. As part of this, we recently announced the asset purchase agreement with LabCorp to acquire Genzyme Genetics for $925 million in cash. The remaining businesses divestitures remain on track and on target for completion by the end of the year.
Our financial results for this period also reflect the full quarter impact of our stock repurchase program.  Under this program, we repurchased approximately 15.7 million shares at an average price of about $63.90. Now this represents the first half of our announced $2 billion stock repurchase program.
And finally, we continue to make progress on our operational efficiency program. Henri touched on it. It's called the value improvement program, or VIP. The first steps of this multiyear program are now underway.
Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.26. Our GAAP to non-GAAP cross-work reflects the impact of our stock compensation expense, purchase accounting associated with the transaction of Bayer, the restructuring costs and discontinued operations. The pretax expenses associated with stock options were at $41 million. The pretax acquisition cost associated with the deal with Bayer were $5 million. And finally, we recorded a $3 million associated with severance in our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings.
Our third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.42. And this is in line with our overall non-GAAP EPS guidance that we gave earlier this year of $0.40 to $0.50. It's also a substantial increase in our Q3 of last year where we came in at $0.26, again, on a non-GAAP basis.
Let me turn on to our quarterly results and then say a few words about the guidance. For our Q3 of last year, our top line increased by 8% to approximately $1 billion. The revenue increases Henri mentioned is predominantly driven by Cerezyme, which increased almost double or $180 million. Our patients in the U.S. began returning to normal dosing levels in September.
Fabrazyme revenue was $34 million and that was impacted predominantly by the supply constraints. We started the process of doubling the current allocations of Fabrazyme here in the United States, and we expect to roll this out globally in the fourth quarter.
Myozyme revenue came in at $106 million. And that's an increase of $20 million year-to-year. That was following the U.S. Lumizyme approval here in the United States and the transition of the ATAP patients to commercial therapy throughout the third quarter. We'll see the full quarter impact of this in the upcoming quarters.
Revenue in the renal and endocrinology area increased 4% to $270 million. Renagel and Renvela revenue came in at $179 million. Pectoral revenue came in $49 million and Thyrogen increased to $42 million. Biosurgery revenue increased to $157 million, or 8%. Synvisc revenue on a year-to-year basis, increased by 14%. The Synvisc third quarter revenue reflects some seasonal pattern that we have seen historically in this product.
The Hemo and Oncology area increased to $167 million, or 17% over last year. This increase is driven largely by Mozobil, which increased to $24 million, almost double that of last year. Now the overall revenue was impacted by foreign exchange, which was negative, decreasing our revenue by approximately $16 million on a year-to-year basis.
Our non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was $706 million, or 70.5% of revenue. On a year-to-year basis, the gross margin as a percentage of revenue was impacted by both product mix and product margins. The margins in both Cerezyme and Fabrazyme can reflect some of the incremental cost associated with our quality investment and operating on the consent decree. As we start to get higher capacity, those will dissipate.
In the margin we also reflect the impact of approximately $8 million of remediation cost associated with our facility in England. This facility has now restarted, and we don't expect to these costs then. And finally, the gross margin increased approximately $6 million of manufacturing-related discrete cost associated with our various inventory write-offs.
Our operating expenses continue to be lower than our initial 2010 estimates. And that really reflects the increased focus that we have on Sustainable operational efficiency. And on a year-to-year basis, it should be noted that our revenue increased by about 8%, although our Operating expenses actually decreased as both the dollar amount, as well as the percentage of revenue. 
Compared to Q3 of last year, our non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased to $193 million. And as I pointed out, as percentage of revenue, R&D decrease from 22% last year to about 19% this year.
Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses came in at $313 million. Compared to Q3 of last year, that's an increase of about $12 million. But as a percentage of revenue, again, we saw a decrease as our SG&A decreased from 32% last year to approximately 31% this year.
Our amortization decreased $6 million year-to-year. That's largely due to the increased revenue projection of Fludara. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, that's fairly consistent with last year. Our basic weighted average share has decreased to 255 million shares, and that reflects the stock repurchase of approximately 15.7 million shares, offset by about 4 million options that were exercised during the quarter.
Our cash position is $1.2 billion. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $167 million and those are focused mostly on our manufacturing operations.
Turning to our guidance for 2010, we've retained our guidance range from $0.90 to $0.95 for the fourth quarter. The expected increase per share in Q3 to Q4 is broken out on a step chart that we attached to our earnings. It was really driven by four major factors. The first is a return of normal dosing for Cerezyme on a worldwide basis. Remember, Q3 reflects only the U.S. patients returning to normal dosing. Q4 will reflect the first quarter where we get to really the full dosing on a global basis.
The second is a doubling of the allocations of Fabrazyme globally. Again, in the third quarter, the allocation doubling was limited to the United States, and Q4 will start to capture the full increase of that increased allocation worldwide.
The third factor is the impact of the full quarter of Lumizyme patients on commercial products, as well as additional patient accruals that we expect during the quarter. And then lastly, we expect to continue to capture the impact of the expense reduction associated with our company-wide initiative to improve both efficiency in effect of our spending.  
We'll discuss all of these in more detail on our investor event on Friday, as well as talk about what it all means for 2011. So with that, let me turn it back to Henri."

I'd like to briefly provide an update on a number of important aspects in our strategy across Global Manufacturing. In Allston Landing, all six bioreactors continue to be operational and running well. Since restart, we've successfully completed 12 Cerezyme and 10 Fabrazyme runs. Cerezyme productivity continues to run at or above historical trends.
For Fabrazyme, we've now completed five runs, with a new working cell bank and have seen approximately a 30% to 40% improvement in productivity. Our most recent run was the highest productivity we've seen since Q4 of 2008. We're continuing to work on the optimization of critical process parameters that we believe should lead to even further productivity improvement.
Our project to move all of our fill/finish operations out of Allston is progressing well. We previously transferred all of our Cerezyme 400-unit filling to our Waterford plant, as well as Myozyme 160 liter. We have now completed nine validation runs for Biogen and Fabrazyme at Hospira to date. These lots have run well and we've released our first Biogen lot to the market from Hospira, and our first Fabrazyme lot release in it. The remaining lots are currently under batch review.  We remain on track for U.S. product exit out of Allston by November 2010 and for all other markets by August of 2011.
Outside of Allston, the timeline for our major capacity addition programs are all holding firm as well. Our new cell culture bioreactor suite in Framingham continues to progress very well. Engineering runs began on schedule in September. We're currently more than halfway through our first run, and everything is going extremely well. It's important to note that we'll begin building Fabrazyme inventory when we begin validation lots in Q1. This material will be available upon facility approval which remains on track for end of year 2011.
Our additional capacity plans for both Waterford and Belgium also remain on track. While we're clearly returning to a more normalized production situation, I do want to be clear that we are working with minimal inventories of Cerezyme and Fabrazyme while we complete these capacity addition projects, and we strive to improve operations at our Allston manufacturing facility. Therefore, our ability to supply these drugs can be impacted by manufacturing issues until we're able to build inventory after Framingham comes online. Henri?"

We welcome the opportunity to share with you this morning the top line study results for CLASSIC I. This Phase III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial compared Clolar in combination with cytarabine to cytarabine plus placebo",761,"Thank you, Henri. We welcome the opportunity to share with you this morning the top line study results for CLASSIC I. This Phase III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial compared Clolar in combination with cytarabine to cytarabine plus placebo in patients 55 years of age or older with relapse or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or AML. 
Relapsed AML, meaning AML that recurs after an initial response to treatment, is a challenging disease.  Refractory AML, in other words, AML that has not responded to prior therapy, is an even greater challenge. The only cure to therapy in both scenarios is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No chemotherapy agent or regiment has demonstrated a survival advantage over any other, and that's no single standard of care exists.
Single-agent cytarabine is among the existing treatment choices and serves as a standard comparator arm in CLASSIC I.  As with newly diagnosed patients with AML, the primary goal of treatment in relapsed or refractory disease is to induce the clinical remission, meaning that no residual leukemia is present in the blood or bone marrow, and for a full blood count to have normalized, or nearly so.
Clinical remissions in this disease are important for two reasons. First, with normalization of blood count, the risk of infection, anemia and bleeding are markedly reduced. This allows patients time away from the hospital to be with family and friends, a meaningful clinical outcome for patients with a fatal disease.  Second, the outcome for patients undergoing stem cell transplant are improved as they enter the transplant procedure in the critical remission. Whereas historically, only clinical remission was relevant for older adults like those enrolled in CLASSIC I, remission as a bridge to transplant is now becoming increasingly important since advances in transplantation are extending this treatment options to more and more older patients.
SO in an effort to improve these outcomes, the CLASSIC I study was designed in order to enroll patients 55 years of age or older with relapsed or refractory AML. The study assumptions provided 90% statistical power to detect the 50% improvement in overall survival, the primary study endpoint.
Prespecified secondary efficacy endpoints were included in the trial design in order to capture the full clinical impact of the study treatments, specifically complete remission, or CR, overall remission, or OR, and overall and four-month event free survival, or EFS and four-month EFS, respectively, were assessed.
Event free survival has particular clinical meaning because this composite endpoint comprises remission, remission durability, in other words, how long the remission lasts, and survival while in remission for the entire study population. In other words, EFS captures the importance of durable remission and survival in remission in a clinically meaningful manner. 
We enrolled 326 patients across North America and Europe in CLASSIC I. Preliminary review of the patient demographic show that the two treatment arms were well-balanced for the prespecified strata based upon each patient's response to their first treatment regimen administered prior to study entry.
Although the study did not show a difference between the arms and the primary endpoint of overall survival, the combination arm of Clolar, plus cytarabine demonstrated a statistical significance across all four of the prespecified secondary efficacy endpoints reviewed above. In other words, complete remission, overall remission, event free survival and four-month EFS, compared to the cytarabine plus placebo arm. Of particular note, the overall remission rate of 47% in the Clolar combination arm was double that of the cytarabine plus placebo arm and the composite endpoint of EFS demonstrated a 37% improvement in the Clolar combination compared to the cytarabine alone. A preliminary review of the adverse event revealed no new safety signals for Clolar.
These clinical trial data reaffirm our commitment to Clolar and AML. Though we would have welcomed the doubling of the overall remission rate and the improvement in EFS in the Clolar combination on translating into an overall survival benefit for the entire patient population, regardless we anticipate that these data will be meaningful to physicians and patients as they face difficult treatment decisions for this disease.
We look forward to presenting these data in relevant, upcoming scientific meetings and discussing these results in their totality with regulatory authorities. As additional randomized clinical trial data become available, anticipated as early as next year, such as the United Kingdom's National Cancer Research Institute's AML 16 trial in newly diagnosed AML patients over 60 years of age, we look forward to sharing those results with you as well as discussing their place within a spectrum of regulatory and clinical utility for Clolar and AML."

Q3 was an important quarter for the PGH business as it really marked the beginning of our recovery for both Fabrazyme and Cerezyme. For Cerezyme in September in the U.S., we began shipping two doses for all patients, with patients now moving to a dose every two weeks in October. In other words, normal dosing.
In July, we opened up a list in the U.S. for physicians to make us aware of patients who wanted to start Cerezyme therapy. Few patients joined the list before we started shipping in September at our increased quantities. We now have 50 patients who have requested to start Cerezyme therapy, including restart patients, naive patients, and 10 patients who were looking to switch back to Cerezyme from alternative therapies.
Now this is, of course, early data, and we don't have a reason for switching back to Cerezyme for all patients. But for most, it's the patient's choice to return to Cerezyme from a competing therapy. We started the same process to return all Cerezyme patients to normal dosing worldwide, and we expect to have this completed for all patients by the end of this quarter.
Patient numbers now are harder to estimate, but we believe approximately 4,700 patients are on Cerezyme treatment today, or about 85% of the patients treated worldwide.
Turning to Fabrazyme. In the market, we've begun to communicate the availability of significantly more Fabrazyme supply in Q4 worldwide, allowing current patients to significantly increase their dose. In the U.S. to September and October, patients doubled the dose from the previous two months and we still anticipate we'll have supply for these patients globally to return to their normal dose in the first half of 2011.
As we see increased volumes from Allston in 2011, and in anticipation of the approval of the Framingham plant in late 2011, we're working to be prepared to move patients back to Fabrazyme from competitive therapies and begin to treat the many Fabry patients looking to start treatment with enzyme.
As mentioned before, Q3 marked the first full quarter of revenues for Lumizyme in the U.S. And our first focus was on transitioning the 196 ATAP patients to commercial therapy while working under our first REMS program, and we're very pleased with the progress. The ATAP program officially closed on August 20, so no patients remain on that program.
Now we expect that we'll have 185 of these patients on commercial therapy, with the balance moving to charitable treatment, not seeking treatment, where unfortunately one patient who passed away. Today, we have 179 of these ATAP patients on commercial product, and are working through the final six patients' insurance issues.  Additionally, we've added a significant number of naive patients to Lumizyme therapy as well. So for either reporting, we had about 100 commercial patients on Myozyme prior to the approval of Lumizyme. We currently have over 320 patients on Myozyme or Lumizyme therapy in the U.S. And of course, as Lumizyme patients are heavier adult patients. Our current priority is to continue to identify Pompe patients in the U.S. and build our pipeline.
On the development side, the three Phase III trials for eliglustat continue to enroll patients. The enrollment in ENCORE, the switching trial, has been slowed by the Cerezyme shortage. But we've made adjustments to the protocol, and now are starting to see an increase in screening and enrollment. And in Q3, we also reported our final Phase III studies for Mipomersen. We now have four positive Phase III studies, and we're working towards our NDA and MMA filings in the first half of 2011, and we're working towards meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed indication for our first filing in homozygous FH and severe heterozygous FH.

In terms of the Framingham capacity that we have, we'll immediately, well upon release, approval of the product -- and remember, we're building inventory when we start validation lots in Q1 of next year. And under current assumptions, we'll have approximately two to three months of inventory that will immediately be available upon approval of that product of Fabrazyme, which will immediately be available for sale in the markets that approve the site, the first approval will most likely be the U.S. at this point. We will have two bioreactors, and then we've got the existing two bioreactors that we currently have in Allston that we can choose to keep on Fabrazyme for as long as we need to and/or switch to Cerezyme. And so we're in a much, much stronger position increasing our overall capacity. And we have a lot more degrees of freedom and flexibility in order to optimize it depending on what the demand of both products are, quite honestly. So we'll be, I wouldn't say in a comfortable position but certainly in a much more comfortable position when Framingham comes online.

We're adding an additional filling line and two more freeze dryers. Freeze dryers are the bottleneck, so we're basically going from one to four, really up there. So a significant increase in our overall capacity. When Waterford fully approves in our markets, we would have capacity to make all of our products really there without actually using Hospira. So it's very important for us in terms of our redundancy, in terms of our overall drug product manufacturing strategy, where we want cross-registration. What we will do though is we'll keep Hospira on line because we want to make sure that we've got to approved sources both for Cerezyme, for Fabrazyme and for Thyrogen. We'll cross-register the products and keep both in play at least in terms of minimal levels so that we have practice, that we can maintain a validate date for the products if in fact we would need to, that we would have an issue at one facility or the other. Over a longer period of time, I would suspect that we will see a greater proportion of our overall production in the Waterford facility.

I would assume you're going to have increase process and controls at some of these plants even after the consent decree is resolved. So maybe if you can kind of give us a little bit of clarity in terms of what impact that might have on the long term gross margins in that business? How that may add to the consent decree?"

I mean, there's no question, you make additional investments when you're going through like -- some things like this. Obviously, in terms of the quality remediation, consent decree impact, as well as it's obviously critical that we get product supply capabilities restored as quickly and as completely as we can. And so you'll certainly err on the side very much of effectiveness over efficiency. But as you improve our systems, you get a well-run site. You'll be able to get more volume through the site. It's made at a higher quality, and everything just starts to run. And so we might see a short-term blip. I think we probably will see a short-term blip in terms of incremental costs. But over a period of time, and you can define time in the two- or three-year time period, we will see a more efficient operation out of it at that of the day. I have absolutely no question about it whatsoever. So all things being equal, I would expect to see actually an improvement in gross margins just because of the efficiency of the operation. Now a lot of things play into that clearly: Overall demand, capacity utilization, et cetera, et cetera. So you can't necessarily draw a straight line from that into what we'll see. But because of the investments we're making, we will see a more efficient operation. I have now doubt about that whatsoever."

We really just have what we're going to capitalize in terms of the engineering validation lots at this point. I mean, clearly, we're making some additional investments actually for Myozyme, and Belgium would be the biggest single investment we have. Most of our capacity additions are really winding down in the start-up phase. So Framingham, Waterford, we added a third reactor to Belgium and we will -- we're in the process of adding a couple of additional reactors to Belgium. We're in the design phase right now. And we'll move forward shortly. So that's the biggest chunk. So in general, you will see our capital expenditures begin to decrease as time goes on."
