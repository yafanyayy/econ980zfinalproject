As usual, it’s my responsibility to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company’s financial and other goals, are set forth within today’s earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K report, and in the company’s 2008 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the fourth quarter 2009 earnings release and earnings supplement on file with the SEC and an 8-K report, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We have provided information that describes the company’s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents and provide some brief summary remarks. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator, who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue, for the Q&A period where Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then, no one has actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan."

So while revenues and income are well below our pre-recession levels, they are heading in the right direction and represent the highest levels that we have achieved this year. So hook [ph] at total revenues ne",3898,"Okay, thanks, Ron. And I'll start on Slide 2. So while revenues and income are well below our pre-recession levels, they are heading in the right direction and represent the highest levels that we have achieved this year. So hook [ph] at total revenues net of interest expense came in at $6.5 billion, about equal with the amount in the fourth quarter of '08. On an FX adjusted basis, we were down about 4%. If you compare this to the third quarter, year-over-year on a reported basis, we were down 16%. So being approximately even with last year is a significant improvement.Income from continuing operations was $710 million, up 132% from the prior year. But we identified two significant items [Audio Gap] in last year's results, a re-engineering charge, as well as a MR-related item. And if you were to normalize from those, we're really up modestly about 5% compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.59, and return on equity was 14%.Moving to Slide 3, you can see that Billed business came in at $172 billion, up 8% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. Again, comparing it to the growth rates we had in the third quarter, reported Billed business was down 11%, and on an FX adjusted basis, was down 9%. So again, a significant improvement compared to the third quarter, and this improvement is really across all business lines as you'll see in a few minutes and is the first positive growth rate that we've had since the third quarter of '08.Cards, of course, came in at $87.9 billion and that's down 5% from last year. If you normalize to exclude the $3.3 million inactive cards that we canceled this year, we would be down about 1%. Average basic Cardmember spending was up 15%. But if you were to normalize to exclude the inactive cards that I just referred to and adjust for FX, we're up about 5% which is a strong rebound from the prior quarter.Managed loans continue to be well below '08 levels. You can see that it's down 14% on a managed basis, although we did increase sequentially compared to the third quarter by about 2%, and this is based on higher spending in our co-brand portfolio. Travel sales, while still down, also improved. They are down 5%. That compares with 29% in the third quarter.We move to Slide 4. This is more on billings. If you look at the bars, they represent the dollar amount of monthly billings, and the lines represent the year-over-year growth on both a reported and FX basis. And you can see that in the mid of September, time frame of '09, billings stabilized at about $52 billion per month, and billings were then higher in October, November and December. Now the growth rate is benefiting from easier comparisons as we saw our drops in billings in the fourth quarter of '08. It's also benefiting from higher levels of Billed business. And the growth rate comparison actually improved month-by-month in the quarter. So the growth rate in November was better than the growth rate in October, and the December growth rate was stronger than what we saw in November. Now the month of December '09 was the highest Billed business month in the AXP history on an FX-adjusted basis. And I point out that Global Commercial Services was particularly strong in December, up 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. Just a little bit about holiday spending. So in the month of December, U.S. retail shops was up about 5% year-over-year. U.S. department stores was flat. And if you look at U.S. online spending, it was up about 11%. And within that, U.S. retail online spend was up about 8%. If you compare that to the industry, which according to comps score was about 4%, we fared a little bit better than the industry.So moving to Slide 5, you're looking at percentage change on a year-over-year basis on an FX-adjusted basis. So you can see that Billed business really across all segments has improved from the third quarter. USCS and ICS are flat year-over-year, and Global Commercial Services is up about 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. GNS [Global Network Services], which is spending on cards issued by our partners, was up about 22%. Geographically, outside the U.S., we saw the strongest growth in Latin America, with JPA being next, so really broad-based improvement across all of our business lines.If you move to Slide 6, this is the network perspective. Now the blue line represents a number of transactions, and the light blue line represents the transaction size, and the green line is total spend. So both the number of transactions and the transaction size had positive growth in the quarter. Number of transactions grew 3%, and transaction size increased by 2%. Now if you compare that again to the third quarter, transactions in the third quarter were actually down 1%, and transaction size was down on about 11%. If you'll look at it geographically, average rock size in the U.S. was down about 2%, and international was up about 14% year-over-year. Now if you look at the trend in the growth in the number of transactions from the quarter, as I said, it was up about 3%. October was about flat, and the month of December was actually up about 5%, so a good trend. If we move to Slide 7, we're looking at Charge Card Billed business compared to receivable growth. The solid line represents the growth in Billed business, the dotted line in Cardmember receivables. So Charge Card Billed business and receivable growth continues to move in tandem. You can see that we have an upward trajectory on Billed business, and Charge Card had positive growth in the quarter of 6%, and the AR [ph] was growing in line with Billed business.We move to Slide 11, this is Lending Billed Business vs. Loan Growth. The solid line was Billed business again, and the dotted line represents loan growth. So historically spending on lending products and loan balances have correlated pretty closely. However, in the fourth quarter, spending has improved significantly with growth of about 2% year-over-year, driven by our premium lending focus on program cards. But loans, while up sequentially from the third quarter by $1.1 billion, is lower than the fourth quarter of '08 by 14%. Now some of the contributing factors to this separation is that we are having higher pay-down rates, and these statistics are actually based on our trust data. So the pay-down rate in December of '09 was 26.9% and that compares with 23% in December of '08. Now this is certainly being impacted in part by the change in the mix of the products as we focus on premium lending. It's also being impacted by the credit actions that we're taking, which are focusing on limiting high-balanced accounts in the lending portfolio, and this is having impact on total loans. In addition to that, BTs, which used to be a source of growth are basically at zero, and lending card acquisition is at lower levels and that also historically has contributed to the growth of loans.Now if we move to Slide 9, this is our U.S. Card Services Net Interest Yield on a Managed Basis. Now at the bottom of the chart, you can see certain other factors that are impacting the yield in each quarter. Now the fourth quarter '09 net interest yield is similar to the two prior quarters, but there really are a number of things that are taking place. So we've had some increases in pricing, which has a positive impact on yield, but there are various aspects that are reducing yield. One is the Cardmember assistance programs we have where we forgive interest that's having a negative impact on yield. Here, we're focused on premium lending so the revolve rate is dropping, also impacting yield. And then, also the credit actions that we're taking are having an impact. In addition to that, we're starting to see some of the impacts from the Credit Card Act affecting yield. Then we expect that the Credit Card Act will bring net interest yield down from '09 levels as we move into 2010. So I'm not making a forecast here, but I think in the future, it's likely that we'll move to the historical levels that we saw in the '06 to '08 time frame when you look at it on a managed basis.So moving to Slide 10, we're looking at revenue. So total revenues, as I said, were flat, on an FX-adjusted basis, were down about 4%. So this kind of revenue was up about 5%, that's a combination of Billed business increasing at 8%, and our average discount rate decreasing by two basis points year-over-year to 2.51%. Net card fees continue to be a strong story despite the weak economy. So clearly, if you have the right value proposition, Cardmembers continue to renew on our fee-based products which is a positive. If we'd look at net interest income and securitization, that's down about 7%. Net interest income decreased by 8%, as average owned loans were down 26%, partially offset by higher yield compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Securitization income was down 5%, primarily driven by a decrease in interest income. And other revenues are down 12%, driven primarily by lower delinquency fees which are a result of lower owned loans and the impact of various customer assistance programs.Moving to Slide 11, so this is the first in the series of slides on credit. Provision is significantly lower in the fourth quarter of '09 compared to '08, down 47%. Both Charge Card and Cardmember lending are making a large contribution. Charge Card improved by 67%, driven by improved write-off rates and lower past due rates. Cardmember lending provision decreased by 40% due to average owned loans decreasing by 22% year-over-year and lower levels of past due accounts. I would note that sequentially, compared to the third quarter, the lending provision decreased by 43% as write-offs and past dues improved. And I'll cover this in more detail in a few slides.So moving to Slide 12, looking at our expenses, marketing and promotion [M&P] was up 36% compared to the fourth quarter of '08, and up 41% on a sequential basis or $200 million compared to the third quarter of '09. So the increase in marketing and promotion and other increases in investment spending has been enabled by the increase in Cardmember spending and credit indicators showing further signs of improvement.Well, M&P is at higher levels, really, across all of our businesses. And if we now stop and look at rewards, you can see that that's up 8%. Now if we exclude a delta-related charge in MR that we had last year, this line is up 18%, and this is being driven by higher Cardmember spending, as well as higher co-brand expenses in the period.Now on this chart, you see that S&B [Salaries and Employee Benefits] is improved by 28%, but if you exclude net new engineering costs in both periods, then S&B would decrease by 8%, reflecting the lower employee levels that we have this year compared to last. Other operating expenses increased, and this reflects higher spending on credit and collections, investment spending in higher technology and related costs, and a charge to exit certain real estate properties this quarter.Moving to Slide 13, here, we're looking at marketing and promotion expense by quarter. And you can see that the fourth quarter is significantly higher than the other quarters in this past year. And the marketing and promotion is focused on Charge Card, program products, brand advertising, perceptions of coverage, product development and gift cards. All of these investments are on strategy for us.So if we move to Slide 14, we're looking at Charge Card write-offs and 30-day past due rates as it relates to the U.S. Consumer Services segment. Now this is really a start of the drill down on credit that will cover a number of slides, but you can see that USCS write-off rates and past dues have improved significantly compared to both the fourth quarter of '08 and the third quarter of this year. Both are contributing to the lower provision levels that we have, and these metrics are really at historic lows.If we move to Slide 15 and look at Charge Card net loss rates and 90-day past dues for our International Consumer business and Global Commercial Services, you can see here that the net loss ratios and the 90-day past dues are also performing very well. So in Charge Card, really has performed well across all three units, the U.S. consumer, international consumer, and Global Commercial Services, have performed well, not only in this quarter, but really, all year. So the Charge Card provision for the full year of 2009 is down 37% compared to the full-year 2008, and it's a very good story.So if we now move to Slide 16, Charge Card Reserve Coverage, so one of the provision in the fourth quarter of '09 and for the full-year 2009 are lower than 2008, you can see that the reserve coverage across all of the business units are up slightly compared to last year. And reserves, we think, reflect the inherent risk in our portfolio.Now let me move to lending in Slide 17. So this is Lending Managed Net Write-off Rates, and this is the second quarter in a row that managed net write-off rates have improved. Now the improvement is being affected by a broad range of credit and business actions, as well as the environment, and these actions include really enhanced credit and collection policies and practices, and in particular, by our efforts to limit the number of high-balanced lending accounts which is having a large impact in bringing write-offs down. Higher write-offs in the second quarter of this year is really contributing to the higher write-offs that we saw in Q2 '09. It's also benefiting from our focus on premium lending.So let me move to Slide 18. So this metric is important as we look forward, and you can see that the managed 30-day past dues are improving in the U.S. consumer business, as well as international consumer. And within the U.S., the states that were hardest hit, such as California and Florida, while still have higher delinquency rates than the average, are improving at a slightly faster rate.So let me move to Slide 19. This is the slide that we have focused on quite a bit over the last several quarters. And if we look at the upper left chart, which is current to 30-day past dues, and you look at the yellow triangles, which are July, August and September, this is what will lead to write-offs in the first quarter of 2010. And you can see that they are similar to the prior three months which drove write-offs in the fourth quarter of '09. So if the 30-day past due to write-off rate stays unchanged, and recoveries and bankruptcies remain constant, it would imply that the first quarter of 2010 write-offs will be similar to the fourth quarter of '09. So this is not a forecast, but if these assumptions were to take place, that's what we would see.Now if you'll look at the green triangles, these will write-off in the second quarter of 2010. Now assuming the same caveats that all the other factors remain the same, it would imply slightly lower 2Q 2010 write-offs than what we saw in the fourth quarter. But again, this not a forecast. It's simply based on those assumptions. You can also see on the right of this chart that bankruptcy filings have remained constant over the past three months.So let me move to Slide 20. Now this provides a trend by month in the USCS managed lending credit metrics. So write-offs in the fourth quarter were 7.5%. If you look at it by month, in October, it was 7.8%, November it was 7.6% and December it was 7.1%, so an improving trend. Now the 30-day past due, that we sight for the quarter, is really a month end number for December so that's a [Audio Gap] seven, but again, we have a positive trend in that 30-day past due at the end of October was 4.1%, end of November was 3.9% and December was 3.7%, so we're seeing improvement quarter-over-quarter and really a positive trend within the fourth quarter. So write-off rates here are still very high on a historic basis. And therefore, they continue to have a negative impact on our P&L. And the forecast is for unemployment to stay at relatively high levels. And if this were true, you would obviously have an impact on the ability of these credit metrics to improve in the future, so we need to keep that in mind.So moving to Slide 21, this is lending provision compared to write-offs. So the dark bars are provision by quarter, and the light bars are write-off dollars by quarter. So the trend, going back to the first quarter of '07, is that the amount of the dollars or provision have been higher than the dollar amounts of write-offs. So the fourth quarter of '09 is really the first quarter where provision is not higher than the amount of write-offs. And that reflects the lower write-off rates and the improvements that we've seen in the 30-day past due amount. Notwithstanding that, we remain cautious about the environment and that it still remains uncertain.So now let's go to Slide 22 and look at our lending reserve coverage, and here, you can see that the U.S. card services and worldwide reserve metrics. And even with provision in the fourth quarter lower than the write-off dollars that we saw on the prior slide, we think that we have an appropriate level of reserve coverage given the inherent risk in our portfolio. And you can see that most reserve coverage ratios are either similar or slightly higher than the amounts we had in the third quarter of this year.So moving to Slide 23, these are our capital ratios compared to regulatory benchmarks. And you can see that the capital ratios are all either the same or slightly higher than the third quarter. They are all above the well-capitalized current benchmarks. Both the actuals for the fourth quarter and the pro formas for the fourth quarter, which assume that securitizations or loans that were securitized came back onto the balance sheet as of the end of December. And as you know, securitized loans are scheduled to come back onto the balance sheet in the first quarter of next year. So again, both on an actual and a pro forma basis, well above the current benchmarks. And I would point out that our Tier 1 common ratio is along the best in the industry.If we move to Slide 24, this is a liquidity snapshot. And here as in other quarters, you can see that liquidity continues at a level where we're holding excess cash and marketable securities, the sufficient level to cover the next 12 months of maturities. So excess cash and securities are $26 billion, and funding maturities over the next 12 months are $20 billion.Moving to Slide 25, so this is the chart on our retail deposit program. And as you can see, we continue to grow deposits. We grew deposits by $2.4 billion in the third quarter. If you'll look at the retail CDs that we raised in the fourth quarter, the average duration was 23 months, and the average rate was 1.4%. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comment. Given the difficult environment over the past year and a half, we are focused on the basics of staying liquid, staying profitable and investing selectively for growth. We leverage the competitive strengths of our diversified business model to deliver on the first two of these priorities, and have increasingly been shifting to a higher level of investments.Over the last six months, improved credit trends, the benefits of our re-engineering initiatives and more recently, somewhat better Cardmember spending levels, enabled us to invest in initiatives designed to position the company for growth over the moderate to long term. Areas of focus for these investments include: Our premium lending products like our Delta, British Airways, Starword [ph] and Costco co-brands; our more proactive Charge Card product and marketing efforts; merchant acceptance around the globe; GNS partner-related product launches and signing efforts; profit service product offerings and expense management services; land [ph] being the initiatives in the U.S. and selected international markets; expanding our data and information management capabilities; and while still in the early stages of forming our enterprise growth unit, last week, we closed the acquisition of Revolution Money, our first initiative within this unit.Now certainly it is too early to say that all the economic challenges are behind us, but we have seen some encouraging signs of progress over the last several months. We expect the global economy to continue to recover gradually and the resulting environment to be characterized by billings growth that is more modest than we experienced before the recession, as consumers and businesses remain cautious about their spending. In addition, unemployment levels are forecasted to remain relatively high. Without job creation, credit metrics can only improve so far from the still relatively high current levels. And lastly, increased regulation could further impact profitability. In light of these challenges, it is more important than ever to invest in initiatives that will position American Express to sustain growth and continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As such, our priorities in 2010 are to drive growth, drive efficiency and deliver superior service. More specifically, while credit did turn positive for us in 2009, most companies, including us, drove 2009 earnings by reducing expenses. In 2010 and beyond, it will be important for us to grow revenues, as well as earnings. At the same time, we plan to have a cost structure that can help produce good returns and fuel investments even in a slower growth environment. And finally, service will be even more important as a differentiator during these uncertain times when customers are looking for companies they can trust and rely on. We believe American Express has the right products and services to be successful in this new economy. We are confident because our business model comprises a diverse set of activities to expand the payments industry. Our brands has a unique asset that is recognized and respected around the globe. Our premium Cardmember base remains a key advantage and retains the capacity to grow spending substantially as the economy improves. Our global merchant network is positioned to capitalize on many future growth opportunities that are resident within the payments industry, and our capital planning has anticipated the 2010 consolidation of all balance sheet receivables. And we are focused on maintaining a capital funding and liquidity profile that is appropriate for these volatile times. And lastly, we believe we have a set of winning strategies which position us to both capitalize on our core business opportunities today and evolve toward the emerging payments opportunities of the future. Thanks for listening, and we are now ready to take questions."

I guess the other point that I would make out, to the extent that we are more focused on premium lending and charge card, you're going to not see the same kind of pop in cards-in-force shall we bring up marking that you would've seen if we were bringing in proprietary lending cards. So to acquire higher spending, it costs a lot more dollars and you get fewer cards, but they have a good long-term benefit and they're very much in line with our strategy. So you may see a different correlation in terms of the growth in cards-in-force to our marketing dollars.

And we think that is a result of actions that we have taken. We have been very focused on enhancing our credit and collection practices, which are helping quite a bit. Other than that, because we are providing assistance to some customers and waiving some fees. We've seen the impact of that in our yield numbers. But you're also seeing that, a benefit of that within the metrics of write-offs and delinquencies. We think that's a smaller part. We really think it's the other credit and collection activities we have which are having a large impact. The other significant thing that we have done is, we are very focused on high-balance accounts. So in the early part of this year where our write-off rate was really moving up and really moving from being best in class to being the middle of the pack, a major fact that was affecting that is that the average write-off amount had grown. And we've been very focused to bring that down. And we think that's having a real positive impact in the write-off rate in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So I think we'll continue to be focused on that as we go forward. So those are some of the things that we've done, that I think has enabled us to distinguish ourselves from the industry. As I pointed out, if you follow the chart with the triangles, it gives some insight about what's going to take place next year. But I do want to be very clear that what's going to happen longer term, a, what's going to happen in the first and second quarter of next year is going to be driven by what takes place in the economy broadly, but particularly in unemployment.

And I wasn't sure if you had any ability to quantify any of those impacts. And just what do you think -- you've given a pretty broad range here for the margin '06 to '08.

This is the finance charge revenue that we're getting from customers less our cost of funds. So I guess there are a number of things that are taking place. So first it was pricing that took place in the quarter, but it only impacted a portion of the quarter. So the full effect of the pricing we'll see in the first quarter will be getting a piece of it in the fourth quarter. So if you put a pricing in place in November, you only get one month's worth of that benefit in the quarter. The other things that we're having an impact is the extent we have programs that are providing assistance to Cardmembers that have temporary liquidity issues. We're forgetting interest, so that's obviously having the impact of bringing yield down. And the Credit Card Act is negatively affecting it. But again, to the issue that you said, it's really our inability to reprice immediately. We actually have to give customers 45 days notice. So we're seeing the impact of that in the quarter. But the more significant impacts, as you're aware of the Credit Card Act, will come to us in the first and second quarter of next year. So it's really a variety of things moving in here. Now it's also being impacted by the fact that to the extent we are more focused on premium lending, some of those customers tend to act more like transactors. And so, that's going to reduce our revolve rate, which is also having an impact on yields. So all of these things are happening at the same time. Some are full-quarter impacts, some are partial-quarter impacts. Now I guess the other thing that I'd say just in terms of the guidance I was giving, if you look at kind of the '06 to '08 timeframe on a managed basis, that averaged about 9%. And that was really the direction and guidance I was looking to give. Again, this is not a forecast, but in terms of trying to be helpful in terms of how you might think about it over the long term, I think that's a pretty reasonable period to look at."

So if you look [ph] at total reve",3898,"Okay, thanks, Ron. And I'll start on Slide 2. So while revenues and income are well below our pre-recession levels, they are heading in the right direction and represent the highest levels that we have achieved this year. So if you look [ph] at total revenues net of interest expense came in at $6.5 billion, about equal with the amount in the fourth quarter of '08. On an FX adjusted basis, we were down about 4%. If you compare this to the third quarter, year-over-year on a reported basis, we were down 16%. So being approximately even with last year is a significant improvement.Income from continuing operations was $710 million, up 132% from the prior year. But we identified two significant items [Audio Gap] in last year's results, a re-engineering charge, as well as a MR-related item. And if you were to normalize from those, we're really up modestly about 5% compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.59, and return on equity was 14%.Moving to Slide 3, you can see that Billed business came in at $172 billion, up 8% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. Again, comparing it to the growth rates we had in the third quarter, reported Billed business was down 11%, and on an FX adjusted basis, was down 9%. So again, a significant improvement compared to the third quarter. And this improvement is really across all business lines as you'll see in a few minutes. And is the first positive growth rate that we've had since the third quarter of '08.Cards, of course, came in at $87.9 billion and that's down 5% from last year. If you normalize to exclude the $3.3 million inactive cards that we canceled this year, we would be down about 1%. Average basic cardmember spending was up 15%. But if you were to normalize to exclude the inactive cards that I just referred to and adjust for FX, we're up about 5% which is a strong rebound from the prior quarter.Managed loans continue to be well below '08 levels. You can see that it's down 14% on a managed basis, although we did increase sequentially compared to the third quarter by about 2%. And this is based on higher spending in our co-brand portfolio. Travel sales, while still down, also improved. They are down 5%. That compares with 29% in the third quarter.We move to Slide 4. This is more on billings. If you look at the bars, they represent the dollar amount of monthly billings. And the lines represent the year-over-year growth on both a reported and FX basis. And you can see that in the mid of September, time frame of '09, billings stabilized at about $52 billion per month. And billings have now moved higher in October, November and December. Now the growth rate is benefiting from easier comparisons as we saw drops in billings in the fourth quarter of '08. It's also benefiting from higher levels of Billed business. And the growth rate comparison actually improved month-by-month in the quarter. So the growth rate in November was better than the growth rate in October. And the December growth rate was stronger than what we saw in November. Now the month of December '09 was the highest Billed business month in AXP history on an FX-adjusted basis. And I point out that Global Commercial Services was particularly strong in December, up 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. Just a little bit about holiday spending. So in the month of December, U.S. retail shops was up about 5% year-over-year. U.S. department stores was flat. And if you look at U.S. online spending, it was up about 11%. And within that, U.S. retail online spend was up about 8%. If you compare that to the industry, which according to comps score was up about 4%, we fared a little bit better than the industry.So moving to Slide 5, you're looking at percentage change on a year-over-year basis on an FX-adjusted basis. So you can see that Billed business really across all segments has improved from the third quarter. USCS and ICS are flat year-over-year. And Global Commercial Services is up about 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. GNS [Global Network Services], which is spending on cards issued by our partners, was up about 22%. Geographically, outside the U.S., we saw the strongest growth in Latin America, with JPA being next, so really broad-based improvement across all of our business lines.If you move to Slide 6, this is the network perspective. Now the blue line represents a number of transactions. And the light blue line represents transaction size. And the green line is total spend. So both the number of transactions and the transaction size had positive growth in the quarter. Number of transactions grew 3%, and transaction size increased by 2%. Now if you compare that again to the third quarter, transactions in the third quarter were actually down 1%. And transaction size was down about 11%. If you'll look at it geographically, average rock [ph] size in the U.S. was down about 2%, and international was up about 14% year-over-year. Now if you look at the trend in the growth in the number of transactions, for the quarter, as I said, it was up about 3%. October was about flat. And the month of December was actually up about 5%, so a good trend. If we move to Slide 7, we're looking at Charge Card Billed business compared to receivable growth. The solid line represents the growth in Billed business, the dotted line in cardmember receivables. So Charge Card Billed business and receivable growth continues to move in tandem. You can see that we have an upward trajectory on Billed business. And Charge Card had positive growth in the quarter of 6%, and the AR was growing in line with Billed business.We move to Slide 11, this is Lending Billed Business vs. Loan Growth. The solid line was Billed business again, and the dotted line represents loan growth. So historically spending on lending products and loan balances have correlated pretty closely. However, in the fourth quarter, spending has improved significantly with growth of about 2% year-over-year, driven by our premium lending focus on program cards. But loans, while up sequentially from the third quarter by $1.1 billion, is lower than the fourth quarter of '08 by 14%. Now some of the contributing factors to this separation is that we are having higher pay-down rates. And these statistics are actually based on our trust data. So the pay-down rate in December of '09 was 26.9% and that compares with 23% in December of '08. Now this is certainly being impacted in part by the change in the mix of the products as we focus on premium lending. It's also being impacted by the credit actions that we're taking which are focusing on limiting high-balanced accounts in the lending portfolio. And this is having impact on total loans. In addition to that, BTs, which used to be a source of growth are basically at zero, and lending card acquisition is at lower levels and that also historically has contributed to the growth of loans.Now if we move to Slide 9, this is our U.S. Card Services Net Interest Yield on a managed basis. Now at the bottom of the chart, you can see certain other factors that are impacting the yield in each quarter. Now the fourth quarter '09 net interest yield is similar to the two prior quarters, but there really are a number of things that are taking place. So we've had some increases in pricing, which has a positive impact on yield, but there are various aspects that are reducing yield. One is the Cardmember assistance programs we have where we forgive interest that's having a negative impact on yield. Here, we're focused on premium lending so the revolve rate is dropping, also impacting yield. And then, also the credit actions that we're taking are having an impact. In addition to that, we're starting to see some of the impacts from the Credit Card Act affecting yield. Then we expect that the Credit Card Act will bring net interest yield down from '09 levels as we move into 2010. So I'm not making a forecast here, but I think in the future, it's likely that we'll move to the historical levels that we saw in the '06 to '08 time frame when you look at it on a managed basis.So moving to Slide 10, we're looking at revenue. So total revenues, as I said, were flat, on an FX-adjusted basis, were down about 4%. So this kind of revenue was up about 5%, that's a combination of Billed business increasing at 8%, and our average discount rate decreasing by two basis points year-over-year to 2.51%. Net card fees continue to be a strong story despite the weak economy. So clearly, if you have the right value proposition, Cardmembers continue to renew on our fee-based products which is a positive. If we'd look at net interest income and securitization, that's down about 7%. Net interest income decreased by 8%, as average owned loans were down 26%, partially offset by higher yield compared to the fourth quarter of '08. Securitization income was down 5%, primarily driven by a decrease in interest income. And other revenues are down 12%, driven primarily by lower delinquency fees which are a result of lower owned loans and the impact of various customer assistance programs.Moving to Slide 11, so this is the first in the series of slides on credit. Provision is significantly lower in the fourth quarter of '09 compared to '08, down 47%. Both Charge Card and Cardmember lending are making a large contribution. Charge Card improved by 67%, driven by improved write-off rates and lower past due rates. Cardmember lending provision decreased by 40% due to average owned loans decreasing by 22% year-over-year and lower levels of past due accounts. I would note that sequentially, compared to the third quarter, the lending provision decreased by 43% as write-offs and past dues improved. And I'll cover this in more detail in a few slides.So moving to Slide 12, looking at our expenses, marketing and promotion [M&P] was up 36% compared to the fourth quarter of '08, and up 41% on a sequential basis or $200 million compared to the third quarter of '09. So the increase in marketing and promotion and other increases in investment spending has been enabled by the increase in Cardmember spending and credit indicators showing further signs of improvement.Well, M&P is at higher levels, really, across all of our businesses. And if we now stop and look at rewards, you can see that that's up 8%. Now if we exclude a delta-related charge in MR that we had last year, this line is up 18%, and this is being driven by higher Cardmember spending, as well as higher co-brand expenses in the period.Now on this chart, you see that S&B [Salaries and Employee Benefits] is improved by 28%, but if you exclude net new engineering costs in both periods, then S&B would decrease by 8%, reflecting the lower employee levels that we have this year compared to last. Other operating expenses increased, and this reflects higher spending on credit and collections, investment spending in higher technology and related costs, and a charge to exit certain real estate properties this quarter.Moving to Slide 13, here, we're looking at marketing and promotion expense by quarter. And you can see that the fourth quarter is significantly higher than the other quarters in this past year. And the marketing and promotion is focused on Charge Card, program products, brand advertising, perceptions of coverage, product development and gift cards. All of these investments are on strategy for us.So if we move to Slide 14, we're looking at Charge Card write-offs and 30-day past due rates as it relates to the U.S. Consumer Services segment. Now this is really a start of the drill down on credit that will cover a number of slides, but you can see that USCS write-off rates and past dues have improved significantly compared to both the fourth quarter of '08 and the third quarter of this year. Both are contributing to the lower provision levels that we have, and these metrics are really at historic lows.If we move to Slide 15 and look at Charge Card net loss rates and 90-day past dues for our International Consumer business and Global Commercial Services, you can see here that the net loss ratios and the 90-day past dues are also performing very well. So in Charge Card, really has performed well across all three units, the U.S. consumer, international consumer, and Global Commercial Services, have performed well, not only in this quarter, but really, all year. So the Charge Card provision for the full year of 2009 is down 37% compared to the full-year 2008, and it's a very good story.So if we now move to Slide 16, Charge Card Reserve Coverage, so one of the provision in the fourth quarter of '09 and for the full-year 2009 are lower than 2008, you can see that the reserve coverage across all of the business units are up slightly compared to last year. And reserves, we think, reflect the inherent risk in our portfolio.Now let me move to lending in Slide 17. So this is Lending Managed Net Write-off Rates, and this is the second quarter in a row that managed net write-off rates have improved. Now the improvement is being affected by a broad range of credit and business actions, as well as the environment, and these actions include really enhanced credit and collection policies and practices, and in particular, by our efforts to limit the number of high-balanced lending accounts which is having a large impact in bringing write-offs down. Higher write-offs in the second quarter of this year is really contributing to the higher write-offs that we saw in Q2 '09. It's also benefiting from our focus on premium lending.So let me move to Slide 18. So this metric is important as we look forward, and you can see that the managed 30-day past dues are improving in the U.S. consumer business, as well as international consumer. And within the U.S., the states that were hardest hit, such as California and Florida, while still have higher delinquency rates than the average, are improving at a slightly faster rate.So let me move to Slide 19. This is the slide that we have focused on quite a bit over the last several quarters. And if we look at the upper left chart, which is current to 30-day past dues, and you look at the yellow triangles, which are July, August and September, this is what will lead to write-offs in the first quarter of 2010. And you can see that they are similar to the prior three months which drove write-offs in the fourth quarter of '09. So if the 30-day past due to write-off rate stays unchanged, and recoveries and bankruptcies remain constant, it would imply that the first quarter of 2010 write-offs will be similar to the fourth quarter of '09. So this is not a forecast, but if these assumptions were to take place, that's what we would see.Now if you'll look at the green triangles, these will write-off in the second quarter of 2010. Now assuming the same caveats that all the other factors remain the same, it would imply slightly lower 2Q 2010 write-offs than what we saw in the fourth quarter. But again, this not a forecast. It's simply based on those assumptions. You can also see on the right of this chart that bankruptcy filings have remained constant over the past three months.So let me move to Slide 20. Now this provides a trend by month in the USCS managed lending credit metrics. So write-offs in the fourth quarter were 7.5%. If you look at it by month, in October, it was 7.8%, November it was 7.6% and December it was 7.1%, so an improving trend. Now the 30-day past due, that we sight for the quarter, is really a month end number for December so that's a [Audio Gap] seven, but again, we have a positive trend in that 30-day past due at the end of October was 4.1%, end of November was 3.9% and December was 3.7%, so we're seeing improvement quarter-over-quarter and really a positive trend within the fourth quarter. So write-off rates here are still very high on a historic basis. And therefore, they continue to have a negative impact on our P&L. And the forecast is for unemployment to stay at relatively high levels. And if this were true, you would obviously have an impact on the ability of these credit metrics to improve in the future, so we need to keep that in mind.So moving to Slide 21, this is lending provision compared to write-offs. So the dark bars are provision by quarter, and the light bars are write-off dollars by quarter. So the trend, going back to the first quarter of '07, is that the amount of the dollars or provision have been higher than the dollar amounts of write-offs. So the fourth quarter of '09 is really the first quarter where provision is not higher than the amount of write-offs. And that reflects the lower write-off rates and the improvements that we've seen in the 30-day past due amount. Notwithstanding that, we remain cautious about the environment and that it still remains uncertain.So now let's go to Slide 22 and look at our lending reserve coverage, and here, you can see that the U.S. card services and worldwide reserve metrics. And even with provision in the fourth quarter lower than the write-off dollars that we saw on the prior slide, we think that we have an appropriate level of reserve coverage given the inherent risk in our portfolio. And you can see that most reserve coverage ratios are either similar or slightly higher than the amounts we had in the third quarter of this year.So moving to Slide 23, these are our capital ratios compared to regulatory benchmarks. And you can see that the capital ratios are all either the same or slightly higher than the third quarter. They are all above the well-capitalized current benchmarks. Both the actuals for the fourth quarter and the pro formas for the fourth quarter, which assume that securitizations or loans that were securitized came back onto the balance sheet as of the end of December. And as you know, securitized loans are scheduled to come back onto the balance sheet in the first quarter of next year. So again, both on an actual and a pro forma basis, well above the current benchmarks. And I would point out that our Tier 1 common ratio is along the best in the industry.If we move to Slide 24, this is a liquidity snapshot. And here as in other quarters, you can see that liquidity continues at a level where we're holding excess cash and marketable securities, the sufficient level to cover the next 12 months of maturities. So excess cash and securities are $26 billion, and funding maturities over the next 12 months are $20 billion.Moving to Slide 25, so this is the chart on our retail deposit program. And as you can see, we continue to grow deposits. We grew deposits by $2.4 billion in the third quarter. If you'll look at the retail CDs that we raised in the fourth quarter, the average duration was 23 months, and the average rate was 1.4%. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comment. Given the difficult environment over the past year and a half, we are focused on the basics of staying liquid, staying profitable and investing selectively for growth. We leverage the competitive strengths of our diversified business model to deliver on the first two of these priorities, and have increasingly been shifting to a higher level of investments.Over the last six months, improved credit trends, the benefits of our re-engineering initiatives and more recently, somewhat better Cardmember spending levels, enabled us to invest in initiatives designed to position the company for growth over the moderate to long term. Areas of focus for these investments include: Our premium lending products like our Delta, British Airways, Starword [ph] and Costco co-brands; our more proactive Charge Card product and marketing efforts; merchant acceptance around the globe; GNS partner-related product launches and signing efforts; profit service product offerings and expense management services; land [ph] being the initiatives in the U.S. and selected international markets; expanding our data and information management capabilities; and while still in the early stages of forming our enterprise growth unit, last week, we closed the acquisition of Revolution Money, our first initiative within this unit.Now certainly it is too early to say that all the economic challenges are behind us, but we have seen some encouraging signs of progress over the last several months. We expect the global economy to continue to recover gradually and the resulting environment to be characterized by billings growth that is more modest than we experienced before the recession, as consumers and businesses remain cautious about their spending. In addition, unemployment levels are forecasted to remain relatively high. Without job creation, credit metrics can only improve so far from the still relatively high current levels. And lastly, increased regulation could further impact profitability. In light of these challenges, it is more important than ever to invest in initiatives that will position American Express to sustain growth and continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As such, our priorities in 2010 are to drive growth, drive efficiency and deliver superior service. More specifically, while credit did turn positive for us in 2009, most companies, including us, drove 2009 earnings by reducing expenses. In 2010 and beyond, it will be important for us to grow revenues, as well as earnings. At the same time, we plan to have a cost structure that can help produce good returns and fuel investments even in a slower growth environment. And finally, service will be even more important as a differentiator during these uncertain times when customers are looking for companies they can trust and rely on. We believe American Express has the right products and services to be successful in this new economy. We are confident because our business model comprises a diverse set of activities to expand the payments industry. Our brands has a unique asset that is recognized and respected around the globe. Our premium cardmember base remains a key advantage and retains the capacity to grow spending substantially as the economy improves. Our global merchant network is positioned to capitalize on many future growth opportunities that are resident within the payments industry, and our capital planning has anticipated the 2010 consolidation of all balance sheet receivables. And we are focused on maintaining a capital funding and liquidity profile that is appropriate for these volatile times. And lastly, we believe we have a set of winning strategies which position us to both capitalize on our core business opportunities today and evolve toward the emerging payments opportunities of the future. Thanks for listening, and we are now ready to take questions."

So to acquire higher spending, it costs a lot more dollars and you get fewer cards, but they have a good long-term benefit and they're very much in line with our strategy. So you may see a different correlation in terms of the growth in cards-in-force to our marketing dollars.

Other than that, because we are providing assistance to some customers and waiving some fees. We've seen the impact of that in our yield numbers. But you're also seeing that, a benefit of that within the metrics of write-offs and delinquencies. We think that's a smaller part. We really think it's the other credit and collection activities we have which are having a large impact. The other significant thing that we have done is, we are very focused on high-balance accounts. So in the early part of this year where our write-off rate was really moving up and really moving from being best in class to being the middle of the pack, a major fact that was affecting that is that the average write-off amount had grown. And we've been very focused to bring that down. And we think that's having a real positive impact in the write-off rate in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So I think we'll continue to be focused on that as we go forward. So those are some of the things that we've done, that I think has enabled us to distinguish ourselves from the industry.

But I do want to be very clear that what's going to happen longer term, a, what's going to happen in the first and second quarter of next year is going to be driven by what takes place in the economy broadly, but particularly in unemployment. And you really do need at some point to have job creation here. It'll really help credit metrics improve over a longer period when we get back to the historic levels that we've seen."

Next time there's a slowdown, whether housing was a big factor or not, we'll have to wait and see. And the other thing I'd say is it's not reading all the factors exactly the same for every group of customers, for charge card high spenders, there may be certain aspects that get higher weighted than for customers that are, say, spending at lower levels. So we actually have this refined by product and spend level as we constantly strive to enhance the accuracy of our predictions."

And I wasn't sure if you had any ability to quantify any of those impacts. And just what do you think -- you've given a pretty broad range here for the margin '06 to '08.

This is the finance charge revenue that we're getting from customers less our cost of funds. So I guess there are a number of things that are taking place. So first it was pricing that took place in the quarter, but it only impacted a portion of the quarter. So the full effect of the pricing we'll see in the first quarter will be getting a piece of it in the fourth quarter. So if you put a pricing in place in November, you only get one month's worth of that benefit in the quarter. The other things that we're having an impact is the extent we have programs that are providing assistance to Cardmembers that have temporary liquidity issues. We're forgetting interest, so that's obviously having the impact of bringing yield down. And the Credit Card Act is negatively affecting it. But again, to the issue that you said, it's really our inability to reprice immediately. We actually have to give customers 45 days notice. So we're seeing the impact of that in the quarter. But the more significant impacts, as you're aware of the Credit Card Act, will come to us in the first and second quarter of next year. So it's really a variety of things moving in here. Now it's also being impacted by the fact that to the extent we are more focused on premium lending, some of those customers tend to act more like transactors. And so, that's going to reduce our revolve rate, which is also having an impact on yields. So all of these things are happening at the same time. Some are full-quarter impacts, some are partial-quarter impacts. Now I guess the other thing that I'd say just in terms of the guidance I was giving, if you look at kind of the '06 to '08 timeframe on a managed basis, that averaged about 9%. And that was really the direction and guidance I was looking to give. Again, this is not a forecast, but in terms of trying to be helpful in terms of how you might think about it over the long term, I think that's a pretty reasonable period to look at."

We think it's prudent to have as diverse a set of sources as we can have. When we get it back to more normal markets and more normal spreads, I think we will probably move between those three categories based on whatever's the most cost effective at that moment in time. But I think we will always endeavor to have a substantial amount of funding coming out of all three of those. But we had a slide in, and I think, the August Financial Community Meeting where we said, gee, if rates were the average that we've seen over the last, I think, three years, including the very high rates that we have had recently, and we had to replace all the debt that matured between now and 2012 at that rate, that it would increase our interest expense by, I think, either $120 million or $140 million. I don't remember exactly. So it will be slightly higher but certainly not dramatically higher than where we are. But to your point, I think seeing how the unsecured markets and the securitization markets come back would be very important in terms of the spreads that we have to pay above benchmark. So intentionally you use all three markets. And certainly, recently, we've seen our CVS spreads come in really pretty dramatically over the last several months. So we'll see it how long it takes to kind of get back to a more normal level, but we would plan to use all three funding sources."

That was driven by strong billed business and imp",4409,"Thanks Ron. Let’s look at slide 2, summary of financial performance. If you look half way down the slide you can see diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.73 compared to $0.32 last year, up 128%. That was driven by strong billed business and improved credit performance. 
A number of line items impacted by the adoption of accounting rule ASU 2009 16-17 formerly known as FAS 166 or 167. The rule requires that securitized loans be brought back onto the balance sheet and the related revenue and expense go back to their natural lines. We have not restated 2009. For better apples-to-apples comparisons I recommend you compare the 2010 to the 2009 managed results. 
At the top of the slide you can see revenue on that basis was down 1%. If we adjusted for FX it is down 4% as better discount revenue from billed business is offset by lower net spread. The difference on the growth rate that you see on continuing operations which is up 100% compared to the EPS growth of 128% is driven by the fact we had preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2009 and as you know we repaid that preferred stock in June of last year. 
If we move over to slide 3, here we are going to show the impact of the new accounting rule on our balance sheet. We recorded $29 billion of loans that were previously securities and off balance sheet. We have a related credit reserve on these loans of $2.5 billion and that was established through equity, not the P&L. At the bottom of the slide you can see the after-tax impact of that reserve, $1.8 billion. Now investment securities are the B, C and D trenches for certain securitizations. Historically we would sell all of the securitized receivables but starting in the third quarter of 2007 because of the wide spreads we held onto certain of the trenches. Those are now simply part of the loan balance. 
Other receivables represents restricted cash. When S&P reduced our rating the trust agreements required that we hold assigned cash related to debt that would mature in the near future, that now is moving from other receivables to other assets. When we get to slide 12 I will talk about some of the impacts of the new rule on those line items. So while this is something of a nuisance comparing 2010 to 2009 in the long-term it is a good change because the new rules provide a clear depiction of our financial results. 
So let’s move to slide 4 and look at billed business. You can see here it has increased 16%, 12% on an FX adjusted basis. Significantly better than our other major competitors. This clearly demonstrates we have a differentiated business model reflecting the makeup of our customer base and the design of our products which are focused on spending. You can see cards in force are down 4%. If we exclude the inactive cards we cancelled last year it is down 1%. 
We can see average spend was a major driver of billed business growth. On an FX adjusted basis it is up 20% and as we also factor out those inactive cards it is about 14%. When we look at card loans I recommend you look at total portfolio. You can see it is down 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an FX adjusted basis. This is in part driven by the credit actions we have taken and in part by customers de-leveraging just as we have seen across the entire industry. 
Travel sales are strong, both business travel and consumer travel. It reflects higher ticket prices and higher number of transactions. It also reflects customers moving from the back of the plane to the front of the plane and people taking longer flights. 
If we move to slide 5 this is more detail on billed business. Each of the bars represent a dollar amount of billed business in each month. The yellow and blue lines reflect the year-over-year growth on a reported and FX adjusted basis. If you look at the top it is a summary of what the quarterly change in billings were over the last several quarters and you can see the first quarter of 2010 is [negatively] better than the first quarter of 2009 and they are both depicted as green bars in this chart. 
The growth rate is significantly higher and the absolute dollars are higher. I recognize the growth rate in the first quarter of 2010 is higher in part because of the easy grow over. 2009’s first quarter was certainly our weakest billings quarter. As we look over the remaining quarters of 2010 the growth rates will be harder due to the fact we had higher billings later in 2009. That said March was the highest billings for any March in our history, slightly higher than March of 2008. 
Let me move to slide 6. Here we are looking at worldwide network spend. You can see transaction size and the number of transactions are both contributing to the higher spend. Number of transactions increased by 7% and transaction size also increased by 7% for a combined billed business growth of 16%. 
If we move to slide 7 we can see that billed business is growing across all of our businesses. The sharpest increase is in commercial services which is up 18% on an FX adjusted basis G&S continues to be very strong with growth of 25%  on an FX adjusted basis. Global consumer businesses also are showing strong growth. If we look at this internationally, Asia and Latin America were somewhat stronger but we also had good growth in Canada and Europe. 
If we move to slide 8, here we are showing you information for the U.S. consumer segment by product and we are showing it to you by quarter. You can see here we are getting the results based on the strategy we are deploying. We are focusing on driving charge card spend and premium lending which comes in the form of co-brand. This is where we are making our investments. You can see the U.S. consumer charge growth is up about 8%, co-brand is up 16% and proprietary lending is down 1%. 
If we move to slide 9 this is charge card. It is showing you both billed business growth and the change in accounts receivable to charge card. You can see that billings and receivable growth continue to move in tandem. Total charge card growth for the total company is up 15% so that includes both consumer and corporate cards globally. 
If we move to slide 10 we are looking at lending billed business and loan growth. Here, spending on lending products and loan growth are no longer correlated. Spending on lending products grew 11% while loans were down 11%. This is in part due to actions we have taken but also to consumers de-leveraging. Some of what is impacting this is we have reduced certain lines to certain customers. We have had lower lending card acquisition, there has been a significant reduction in balance transfers, the mix of the portfolio is changing to have a greater proportion of co-brand products. 
If you look at our lending trench you can see payment rates are up. In March of 2009 the payment rate was 22.8% and in March of 2010 it is 26.9%. So a notable increase. We are seeing lower revolve levels and fewer cardmembers are making minimum payments. So we are seeing loan balances shrink as consumers de-lever and this is consistent with the industry trend but what differentiates us from the competition is they are seeing either low single digit growth or negative growth and we are seeing robust spending growth because we have a larger percent of transactors in our portfolio. 
If we move to slide 11 this is our net interest yield. Here we have made some slight modifications to how we allocate interest among segments to make it simpler and more transparent for the business units and we have adjusted the yield calculation for each period on this slide. The change ranged from no change to about 30 basis points. 
So you can see that in the first quarter of 2009 the yield was 10.9% and in the first quarter of 2010 it is 10%. The driver of this was reduction in interest rates with certain customers that are in our Care program as well as a change in customer behavior when you have lower revolve rates. We also had the impact of the Card Act but that was offset by pricing increases we put in place. As we have previously discussed over the balance of 2010 we expect the yield to return to historic levels of about 9%. 
If we move to slide 12 this is our revenue performance. At the top you can see that discount revenue of 13% growth is a combination of growth in billed business up 16% and our discount rate dropping by one basis point to 2.55. So the discount rate continues to hold up well. Card fees are relatively consistent with last year. Net interest income I would look at on a managed basis and it is down 24%. That is both a combination of the drop in yield we just discussed and the fact that loans are down 11%. You can see we no longer have securitization income as these are all back on the natural line items. 
Travel, commission and fees are being driven by the higher volumes I discussed before and if we look at other revenues on a reported basis we have increases related to the inclusion of loans and some of the fees related to those loans such as FX conversion fees. We also have higher G&S revenues and that is partially offset by lower assessment fees and the fact the GE portfolio which last year was on this line is now on the natural lines. 
If you move to slide 13, the provision for losses, the improvement in charge card reflects lower write off rtes year-over-year, a notable improvement in the 30 day past due rates year-over-year and the fact we released approximately $50 million of reserves based on our credit performance. The improvement in cardmember lending provision is a result of lower write off rates and lower loans, therefore we have lower write off dollars. 
We have lower reserve requirements based on the improved credit metrics and we released $500 million of reserves in this quarter. I would note the 2010 first quarter numbers includes write offs related to the loans that were securitized last year. Last year you don’t have the write offs related to those loans. This improvement in provision is providing significant resources a portion of which is flowing to net income and a portion of which is being used to increase investments to drive growth in the medium to long term. I will have a number of additional slides on provision a little later. 
Let’s move to slide 14 and look at expense performance. You can see that marketing and promotion reflects the investments I just discussed before and are designed to drive future growth. I will talk a little bit more about that on the next slide. You can see cardmember rewards is up 43% and that is a combination of rewards related to our co-brand products as well as membership rewards. Co-brand volumes are up 16% and our cost per point is up slightly based on new co-brand agreements we have signed over the past year so the total increase in co-brand rewards is 24%. 
Membership rewards’ growth rate is being impacted by the fact that last year we made some refinements to the calculation that actually had a benefit in 2009 and therefore we have a grow-over this year. In addition to that URR is somewhat higher. That is being impacted by the fact that we continue to improve the value proposition and [haven’t] made it easier for our cardmembers to redeem. It is also being impacted by the fact our cardmembers are more tenured as we have had lower levels of acquisition and more tenured cardmembers tend to have higher estimates for ultimate redemption. 
In addition to that our cost per point is slightly higher. In 2009 customers utilized air as a redemption item to a lesser degree. Air is a higher cost redemption item and customers are moving back to normal levels of utilization of air as an option. The important thing here is long-term rewards are an important part of our value proposition and we believe we have the ability to properly manage these costs and have products that have very good economics. 
Next let me look at salaries and employee benefits which are up 6%. This is being driven by higher incentive compensation, some impact from FX, severance costs in the quarter related to some re-engineering done within our global commercial services segment partially offset by lower employee level. Employee level is about 5,000 lower than last year and that is a result of the re-engineering that we did last year. 
Other operating expenses reflect spending of certain costs that are driving growth such as technology spending but those expenses that are not driving growth in revenues are being very well controlled and I have a slide a little later on that. 
So if we move to slide 15 and look at marketing and promotion expense, each of these bars is the dollar amount of marketing and promotion for each of the prospective quarters. The green bars reflect the first quarter of 2008, 2009 and 2010. You can see the 2010 spending is significantly higher than the amount we did in the first quarter of 2009. In that period we were pulling back on marketing so we could stay profitable. We can see that the first quarter of 2010 is back to the level we had in first quarter 2008 and represents healthy spending levels in U.S. consumer, International Consumer as well as G&S. 
The increases are broad. They include spending on brand advertising. Last year we were basically dark in brand advertising so we brought back brand advertising. It also reflects spending on acquisitions. We note our acquisitions are focused on the affluent customer and therefore the number of accounts we are acquiring even though we are spending more on acquisition is similar to the number of accounts we acquired last year. 
We are also spending on loyalty and you can see the benefit of that in our average spend numbers. We are also continuing to invest in merchant programs and with our G&S partners. 
If we move to slide 16 this is a chart on operating expense. As we have indicated, investments are not just in marketing and promotion but also some are in operating expense and this chart is intended to give you an idea of how it splits out. On the chart you can see growth is about 8%. It is actually 4% on an FX adjusted basis. So the circles that are above the line are growing faster than the average and the circles below the line are growing smaller than the average. So we are trying to use color codes to give you an indication whether it is a large item, medium in size or small. Certain of these circles as we go forward will be on the chart each quarter and others will be on the chart when they are relevant. 
So the areas where we are spending above average are on partner investments such as marketing initiatives with Delta would be an example. We also continue to invest in global network services and that is marketing related to partners who issued cards that were on our network. We also are spending on technology to enable our growth initiatives. FDIC assessments while small is an indication of the type of item that is actually going above the average on this line. 
On the other hand collections because write off rates are down is below the average and as you can see staff functions such as finance, HR and general counsel are growing slower than the average as is global services group which is led by Steve Squeri and as you know we pulled this group together which is focused on improving quality and also very focused one efficiency. I would note we continue to plan over the balance of this year to continue to invest at healthy levels in both marketing and promotion and in operating expenses that will drive growth. 
So let me move to slide 17 which is the U.S. charge card net write off rate and 30 day past due chart. You can see that charge card continues to perform very well. Write off rates in the 30 day past due rate are now at historic lows. Actually in all likelihood over time these rates will actually probably move up more towards historic levels over time. 
If we move to slide 18 this relates to international consumer and global commercial charge cards and the net loss rate and 90 day past due bills ratio. First let me mention for these two segments we have moved the write offs from 130 days to 180 days to comply with banking regulatory guidelines. You may remember we made this change in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008. This has no impact on provision because the AR after 180 days is effectively fully reserves but the write offs do run through the net loss ratio calculation in this quarter and that piece is depicted by the dark blue section of this bar. 
So write offs excluding the write offs between 180 and 360 was 13 basis points. Another change we made relates to fraud losses. Historically fraud losses have been included in this bar but starting in this quarter they are being excluded. That is probably about three basis points. So the apples-to-apples comparison to last quarter 22 basis points would be the 13 basis points plus the three basis points for fraud, or 16 basis points. On an apples-to-apples comparison you can see it is improving. 
I would also note the 90 day past billings ratio is lower in part because of improved credit but also by the fact we made this change to write off those receivables that were between 180 and 360. 
Moving to slide 19 this is charge card reserve coverage. While credit has improved we remain cautious in our reserving. The coverage of the 30 day past due for the U.S. consumer card is similar to what we had last year. International consumer and global commercial services the 90 day past billing coverage has increased as you can see on this chart and that is because we modified our reserving methodology to move to a methodology that is based on losses to billed business ratios. As those losses continue to improve this coverage ratio will move back to historic levels. 
Let me move to slide 20. This is the lending net write off rate. So last quarter we forecasted the USCS write off rate would be flat with the fourth quarter of 5.7%. In fact it has come in slightly better at 7.2% and this is due to lower bankruptcy dollars. It is a combination of fewer filings and lower dollars per filing. We continue to significantly outperform the industry. Improved credit is a significant source of funding for higher earnings and higher investment levels. 
If we move to slide 21 this is the lending 30 day past due chart and you can see we continue to improve in the U.S. and are stable in the international consumer markets. 
If we move to slide 22 this is a chart we have used over the last several quarters. If the 30 day past due to write off rate remains stable, that is the bottom part of this chart, and bankruptcies and recoveries remain stable then improvements on the right hand side of this chart, improvements in the current to 30 day past due will flow to the bottom line with improved write offs. 
In that upper left chart the yellow triangles are what wrote off in the first quarter. Those three triangles are pretty similar to the green triangles preceding that and that is why we forecasted the first quarter would be similar to the fourth quarter. As I said before the reason for better performance in the first quarter was really driven by the right side of this chart which is we had lower bankruptcy filings. 
If we go back to the upper left hand chart and look at the green triangles we can see they are improving and therefore we would expect the second quarter write offs to be better or lower than the write off rate we saw in the first quarter of 2010. That is also consistent with what we said at the end of the first quarter. 
So moving to slide 23, we wanted to provide you with some information regarding lending reserve levels. If we start at the left side of this chart, starting at the end of 2008 and during 2009 we had write offs of approximately $1 billion. We had a provision of $1.4 billion. So we built reserves during this period by $400 million and that reflects the deterioration in delinquencies and the higher write off rates we were seeing in 2009. 
If you move to the right side of that chart we start at the end of 2009 and the first bar reflects the reserves we established related to the loans we brought back on balance sheet. I will remind you that ran through equity, not through the P&L. During this year we had write offs of $1.2 billion and a provision of $700 million so we effectively released $500 million in reserves and that reflects improving delinquencies, lower write off rates and lower loan balances. 
With improved credit metrics you would expect the red bar or the write offs in this year to be lower than the write offs we had last year. But the difference as we are showing in the little box in the upper right of the chart is this year we have write offs related to both the on balance sheet loans as well as the loans that came back on the balance sheet which were off balance sheet last year and therefore there were no write offs related to that. The comparable is that the $700 million related to non-securitized loans compared to the $1 billion so we actually saw a decrease in write offs on an apples-to-apples basis which you would expect. 
If we move to slide 24 this is our reserve coverage. Credit metrics, both write offs and past due, continue to improve. We reduced reserves by $500 million based on the inherent risk in the portfolio and the lower loan balances but we continue to be cautious due to the uncertain economic environment and you can see our reserve coverage, reserves as a percentage of past due and principle month’s coverage reflect our cautious outlook. 
If we move to slide 25 these are our capital ratios. Capital ratios remain above well capitalized levels. Tier 1 common ratio relative to other financial institutions are strong and we need to wait to see where the regulators actually set the benchmark. Again, on a comparative basis our Tier 1 common compared to other financial institutions is strong. 
If we move to slide 26 this is a liquidity snapshot. You can see we have excess cash and marketable securities of $27 billion. The next 12 months of maturities is $20 billion so we continue to hold cash and marketable securities equal to or greater the next 12 months of maturities. 
If we move to slide 27 this is retail deposits. We continue to build deposits. We now have $27.4 billion of deposits. If you look below the chart we have made some additional disclosures here. If you start at the very bottom you can see the average rate at issuance which is 2.3%. Also right above that you can see the weighted average maturity when the deposits were originally put on the books. That is 31 months. We think also a relevant disclosure is the weighted average remaining maturities so we have provided this additional information and we hope you find it useful. 
With that let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the improved economic environment and our shift to a more offensive posture versus last year’s defensive stance. Spending has rebounded across all business sectors with monthly comparisons improving due to both easier comparisons versus last year and higher absolute spending levels. We also show a sharp divergence between customer spending and borrowing levels. Some of it is due to our strategic and risk related actions and some reflects changes in customer behavior. 
While these offsetting influences, stronger billings growth and lower loan balances challenged overall revenue growth, credit trends continue to provide lower provision requirements and our underlying operating expense growth remains well controlled. This quarter is a clear demonstration of our differentiated business model reflecting the makeup of our customer base and the design of our products. Spending on our network increased well above industry average while loans decreased and credit performance was among the best in major card issuers. 
Our decisive and effective credit actions achieved improved credit performance without stifling spend by credit worthy cardmembers. The net effect of all these factors is our ability to invest in the business at significant levels while also generating strong earnings. While some investments are designed to drive metrics over the next 12 months we are also allocating resources to initiatives focused on the medium to long-term success of the company. 
Challenges to continued progress remain. Unemployment levels are still high and customer behavior as well as the legislative environment are uncertain. However, the global economy seems to be poised to continue to improve and our strong competitive position is yielding high quality comparisons versus the competition. This gives us confidence our investments and our differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace. 
Thanks for listening. We are now ready to take questions.

I think our products are designed to meet the needs of higher spending, more affluent customers. Last year when we saw the drop in billings in the first three quarters of last year when our billings were dropping at a rate similar to the competition we were actually relatively pleased by that because generally discretionary spending drops at a faster rate and our customers have more discretionary spending than the average population. 
I think what we see here is when things improve that discretionary spending is coming back. I think it is really the impact of a more affluent customer base. I think that is one part of it. The next part has to do with corporate card. Corporate card generally is more of a V. It goes down sharper than the rest of spending and it comes back a lot steeper and I think we are seeing that make a strong contribution here. We have a very strong position in corporate card. 
Thirdly we have a strong G&S business. As you can see from the charts spending on cards issued by our partners that run on our network is performing very well. I think it is all of those factors which are contributing to the billings growth which is significantly higher than we are seeing among other major competitors.

We actually have models we utilize that look at historical performance which is really the basis for the bulk of our reserve. We also look at whether there is a need for specific reserves for certain areas. For instance, we have done re-aging recently. Those re-aged accounts have greater credit risk than the overall portfolio so we set up some specific reserves for those. Then we also take into consideration what is taking place in the economy. Is it uncertain? Is it stable? We use that process to actually establish our reserves. We then take a look a whole variety of metrics including loans coverage, including the percentage of reserves compared to the total loan balances, reserves as a percentage of delinquencies, what level of new cards we put onto the books. There is a myriad of other factors that come into play. That is the way we set reserves. We don’t do it off of any single metric.

The actual percentage of total operating expense that OpEx is not the overwhelming majority. Let’s face it you need to have a fair amount of that operating expense supporting our core business but we are allocating more to that because we are emphasizing commercial card if we are going to grow commercial card it is generally related to sales force.

We are also very focused on new fee generation and new products that would drive fee revenue growth. We have talked about loyalty as an example of that.

Any time you venture into new areas some of which we are doing you have estimated returns and those estimated returns will give us actually very good economics. The certainty of those are obviously different because you don’t have history to know if you will be successful in achieving those. 
In any event the assumptions we have made will give us very good returns. The way we think about what portion is flowing to the bottom line and what portion we are investing is driven by the fact we want to ensure we are investing enough to drive growth in the future that will enable us to hit our financial targets. 
If you look back at the 2005 to 2008 timeframe and took marketing and promotion plus investments that drive growth within operating expense those two numbers would probably be about 13% of revenues. We have actually taken that up to about 14-15% in the current period. So we are investing at a slightly higher level than we did historically. Again we are trying to balance where our income level should be and investing to drive future growth in the years to come.

Quite frankly to the extent customers actually redeem we view that as a very positive thing because if customers are engaged we see them spend more. If over time the URR were to drift up some we would view that as a positive, not as a negative.

That is part of the reason why we made the Revolution Money acquisition. Online payments certainly receives a significant amount of attention by our senior management team. So we are balancing between what we are investing in the core business but it is also one of the reasons we want to allocate resources to investments that are really over the medium to long-term. 
When I said before we are focused on investments that drive metrics over the next 12 months those are our core business investments. We are allocating more money to those things like online payments, alternative payments, some of the new fee businesses. Those in all likelihood won’t provide significant returns to us over the next 24-36 months but we think they are very important to maintain our growth trajectory as you look out beyond that. So we are very cognizant of that and looking to invest in at an appropriate level.

I guess the question is I am sure you probably have looked at your business in this way. How should we be thinking about that relative to sort of near-term expectations? We have comments of some lower revenues and continued investing at this part in the cycle is certainly understandable but at these kinds of operating expense levels are we to sort of expect them at these levels for the next couple of quarters and then potentially get operating leverage in years to come?

We are investing in some areas that fall to a greater degree in operating expense that may have not been the case in the past. We are just trying to make that distinction. We are not moving away from our historical financial targets to grow revenues at greater than 8% and achieve EPS growth of 12-15%. I think that is probably one way of answering your question.

And let's look at Slide #2, summary of financial performance.

And that was driven by strong bi",4427,"Okay, thanks, Ron. And let's look at Slide #2, summary of financial performance. And if you look halfway down the Slide, you'll see the diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.73 compared to $0.32 last year, up 128%. And that was driven by strong bill business and improved credit performance. 
There were a number of line items that were being impacted by the adoption of accounting rule ASU 2009 16/17 formerly known as FAS 166 or 167. The rule requires that securitized loans be brought back onto the balance sheet and the related revenue and expense go back to their natural line. We have not restated 2009. For a better apples-to-apples comparison, I recommend you compare the 2010 to the 2009 managed results.
So the top of the Slide you can see that revenues on that basis were down 1%; if we adjusted for FX, it's down 4%. As better discount revenue from Billed business was offset by lower net spread. The difference in the growth rate that you see on continuing operations, which is up 100% compared to the EPS growth of 128% is driven by the fact that we had preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2009. And as you know, we repaid that preferred stock in June of last year. 
If we move over to Slide 3, here we want to show the impact of the new accounting rule on our balance sheet. So we're recording $29 billion of loans that were previously securitized in our balance sheet. We have a related credit reserve on those loans of $2.5 billion, and that was established through equity, not the P&L. 
At the bottom of the Slide, you can see the after-tax impact of that reserve, $1.8 billion dollars. Now investment securities are the B, C and D tranches from certain securitizations. Historically, we would sell all of these securitize receivables but starting in the third quarter of '07, because of the widespreads, we held onto certain of the tranches. Those are now simply part of the loan balance. Other receivables represent restricted cash. When S&P reduced our rating, the trust agreements required that we hold aside cash related to debt that would mature in the near future. That now is moving from other receivables to other assets. When we get to Slide 12, I'll talk about some of the impacts of the new rule on those line items. So while this is something of a nuisance comparing 2010 to 2009, in the long term it's a good change because the new rules provide a clear depiction of our financial results.
So let's move to Slide 4. And look at Billed business. You can see here that it's increased 16%, 12% on an FX adjusted basis, significantly better than our other major competitors. This clearly demonstrate that we have a differentiated business model, reflecting the makeup of our customer base and the design of our products, which are focused on spending. We can see the cards-in-force is down 4%. If we exclude the inactive cards that we canceled last year, it's down 1%. We can see that average spend was a major driver of good business growth. On an FX adjusted basis, it's up 20%. And if we also factor out those inactive cards, it's about 14%.
When we look at card loans, I recommend you look at total portfolio. You can see it's down 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. This is, in part, driven by the credit actions we've taken, and in part by customers deleveraging just as you've seen across the entire industry.
Travel sales are strong, both business travel and consumer travel. It reflects higher ticket prices and higher number of transactions. It also reflects customers moving from the back of the plane to the front of the plane and people taking longer flights.
If we move to Slide 5, this is a more detail on Billed business. Though each of the bars represent the dollar amount of Billed business in each month, the yellow and blue lines reflect the year-over-year growth on a reported and FX-adjusted basis. And if you look at the top, it's a summary of what the quarterly change in billings were over the last several quarters, and you can see that the first quarter of 2010 is notably better than the first quarter of 2009, and they are both depicted as green bars in this chart.
The growth rate is significantly higher and the absolute dollars are higher. Though I recognize that the growth rate in the first quarter of 2010 is higher in part because of the easy grow-over. 2009 first quarter was certainly our weakest billings quarter. As we look over the remaining quarters of 2010, the growth rates would be harder due to the fact that we had higher billings later in 2009. With that said, March was the highest billings for any March in our history, slightly higher than March of 2008.
Let me move to Slide 6. In here, we're looking at worldwide network spend. You can see that transaction size and the number of transactions are both contributing to the higher spend. Number of transactions increased by 7% and transaction size also increased by 7% for a combined Billed business growth of 16%.
If we move to Slide 7, we can see that Billed business is growing across all of our businesses. The sharpest increase is in commercial services, which is up 18% on an FX adjusted basis and GNS continues to be very strong, with growth of 25% on an FX-adjusted basis. Global consumer businesses also are showing strong growth. If you look at this internationally, Asia and Latin America were somewhat stronger but we also had good growth in Canada and Europe.
If we move to Slide 8, we were showing you information for the U.S. Consumer segment by product, and we're showing it to you by quarter. And you can see here that we're getting the results based on the strategy that we're deploying. We're focusing on driving Charge Card spend and premium lending, which comes in the form of co-brand, and this is where we are making our investments. You can see that U.S. consumer charge growth is up about 8%, co-brand is up 16%, and proprietary lending is down 1%.
If we move to Slide 9, this is Charge Card. It's showing you both Billed business growth and the change in accounts receivable for Charge Card, and you can see that billings and receivable growth continue to move in tandem. Total Charge Card growth for the total company is up 15%. That includes both consumer and corporate cards globally. 
If we move to Slide 10, we're looking at lending billed business and loan growth. And here, spending on lending products and loan growth are no longer correlated. Spending on lending products grew 11%, while loans were down 11%. And this is part due to actions we've taken but also consumers deleveraging. So some of what's impacting this is we have reduced certain lines to certain customers; we've had lower lending card acquisition; there's been a significant reduction in balance transfers; the mix of the portfolio was changing to be at a greater proportion of co-brand products. 
If you look at our lending trust, you can see that payment rates are up. In March of 2009, the payment rate was 22.8%, and in March of 2010, it's 26.9%, so a notable increase. We're seeing lower revolve levels and fewer Cardmembers are making minimum payments.
So we were seeing loan balance and strength as consumers delever, and this is consistent with the industry trend. But what differentiates us from the competition is they are seeing either low single-digit growth or negative growth and we are seeing robust spending growth because we have a larger percent of transactors in our portfolio.
If we move to Slide 11, this is our net interest yield. Now here, we've made some slight modifications to how we allocate interest among segments to make it simpler and more transparent for the business units, and we've adjusted the yield calculation for each period on this Slide. The change ranged from no change to about 30 basis points. So you can see that in the first quarter of '09, the yield was 10.9% and in the first quarter of 2010, it's 10%. Now, the driver of this was reduction in interest rates for certain customers that are in our Care program, as well as a change in customer behavior where we have lower revole rates.
Now we also had the impact of the CARD Act. But that was offset by pricing increases that we put in place. As we've previously discussed, over the balance of 2010, we expect the yield to return to historic levels of about 9%.
We move to Slide 12. This is our revenue performance. At the top, you can see that discount revenue of 13% growth is a combination of growth in Billed business of 16% and our discount rate dropping by 1 basis point to 2.55. So the discount rate continues to hold up well. Card fees are relatively consistent with last year. Now net interest income I would look at on a managed basis and it's down 24%. That's both a combination of the drop in yield that we just discussed and the fact that loans are down 11%. And you can see that we no longer have securitization income as these are all back on the natural line items.
Travel commissions and fees are being driven by the higher volumes that I discussed before. And if we look at other revenues on a reported basis, we have increases related to the inclusion of loans and some of the fees related to those loans, such as FX conversion fees. We also have higher GNS revenues, and that's partially offset by lower assessment fees and the fact that the GE portfolio, which last year was on this line, is now on the natural lines.
If we move to Slide 13, the provision for losses, the improvement in Charge Card reflects lower write-off rates year-over-year, a notable improvement in the thirty-day past-due rates year-over-year and the fact that we released approximately $50 million of reserves based on our credit performance.
The improvement in Cardmember lending provision is a result of lower write-off rates and lower loans. Therefore, we have lower write-off dollars. We have lower reserve requirements based on the improved credit metrics and we released $500 million of reserves in this quarter.
I would note that 2010 first quarter numbers includes write-offs related to the loans that were securitized last year. And last year, we don't have the write-offs related to those loans.
This improvement in provision is providing significant resources, a portion of which is flowing to net income and a portion of which is being used to increase investments to drive growth in the medium- to long-term. Now I'll have a number of additional slides on provision a little later.
Let's move to Slide 14 and look at expense performance. You can see that marketing and promotion reflects the investments I just discussed before and are designed to drive future growth. I'll talk a little bit more about that on the next Slide. 
You can see that Cardmember rewards is up 43%, and that's a combination of rewards related to our co-brand products as well as Membership Rewards. Co-brand volumes are up 16% and our cost per point is up slightly based on new co-brand agreement that we've signed over the past year. So the total increase in co-brand rewards is 24%.
Membership Rewards is being impacted by the fact or the growth rate is being impacted by the fact that last year, we made some refinements to the calculation, which actually had a benefit in '09. And therefore we have a grow-over this year. In addition to that, the URR [ph] is somewhat higher. That's being impacted by the fact that we continue to improve the value proposition and haven't made it easier for our Cardmembers to redeem. It's also being impacted by the fact that our Cardmembers are more tenured as we've had lower levels of acquisition and more tenured Cardmembers tend to have higher estimates for ultimate redemption.
In addition to that, our cost per point just slightly higher. In 2009, customers utilized air as the redemption item to a lesser degree. Air is a higher cost redemption item and customers are moving back to normal levels of utilization of air as an option.
The important thing here is long-term.  That rewards are an important part of our value proposition, and we believe we have the ability to properly manage these costs and have products that have very good economics.
So next, let me look at Salaries & Employee Benefits, which we're up 6%. This is being driven by higher incentive compensation, some impact from FX, severance costs in the quarter related to some  reengineering within our Global Commercial Services segment, partially offset by a lower employee level. Employee level is about 5,000 lower than last year, and that's a result of the reengineering that we did last year.
Other operating expenses reflect spending on certain costs that are driving growth such as technology spending. But those expenses that are not driving growth in revenues are being very well-controlled and I have a Slide a little later on that.
So if we move to Slide 15 and look at marketing and promotion expense.  Each of these bar is the dollar amount of marketing and promotion in each of the respective quarters. The green bars reflect the first quarter of '08, '09 and 2010, and you can see that the 2010 spending is significantly higher than the amount that we did in the first quarter of '09. In that period, we were pulling back on marketing so that we could stay profitable. You can see that the first quarter of 2010 is back to the level that we had in the first quarter of '08 and represents healthy spending levels in U.S. consumer, international consumer, as well as GNMS.
Now the increases are broad. They include spending on brand advertising. Last year, we were basically dark in advertising, so we brought back brand advertising. It also reflects spending on acquisition. Now I would note that our acquisitions are focused on the affluent customer, and therefore, the number of accounts that we're acquiring, even though we're spending more on acquisition, is similar to the number of accounts that we acquired last year.
We're also spending on loyalty. And you can see the benefit of that in our average spend numbers. We also continue to invest in merchant programs and with our GMS partners.
If we move to Slide 16, this is a chart on operating expense. Now as we've indicated, investments are not just in marketing and promotion, but also some are in operating expense. And this trust intended to give you an idea of how it splits out. Now on the chart you can see that growth is about 8%. It's actually 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. So the circles that are above the line are going faster than the average and the circles that are below the line are growing slower than the average. And we're trying to use color codes to give you an indication of whether it's a large item, medium in size or small. So certain of the circles as we go forward will be on the chart each quarter and others will be on the chart when they are relevant. 
So the areas where we're spending above average are on partner investments such as marketing initiatives with Delta Airlines, would be an example. We'll also continue to invest in Global Network Services and that's marketing related to partners who issue cards that run on our network. We also are spending on technology to enable our growth initiatives. An FDIC assessment, while small, is an indication of the type of item that has actually -- is growing above the average on this line. 
On the other hand, collections, because write-off rates are down is below the average. And as you can see, staff function such as finance, HR and General Counsel are growing slower than the average as is Global Services group, which is led by Steve Squeri. And as you know, we pulled this group together, which is focused on improving quality and also very focused on efficiency.
I would note that we continue to plan over the balance of this year to continue to invest at healthy levels in both marketing and promotion and in operating expenses that will drive growth.
So let me move to Slide 17, which is the U.S. Charge Card net write-off rate and 30-day past due chart. You can see that Charge Card continues to perform very well. Write-off rates in the 30-day past due rates are now at historic lows. Actually, in all likelihood overtime, these rates will actually probably move up more towards historic levels over time.
If we move to Slide 18, this relates to international consumer and global commercial card, Charge Cards and it's the net loss rate and 90-day past due billings ratio. So first, let me mention that for these two segments, we have moved the write-offs from 130 days to 180 days to comply with banking regulatory guidelines. You may remember that we made this change in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of '08. So this has no impact on provision because the AR over 180 days is effectively fully reserved. But the write-offs do run through the net loss ratio calculation in this quarter, and that piece is depicted by the dark blue section of this bar.
So write-offs, excluding the write-offs between 180 and 360, was 13 basis points. So another change that we made relates to fraud losses. Historically, fraud losses have been included in this bar. But starting in this quarter, they are being excluded, and that's probably about three basis points. So the apples-to-apples comparison to last quarter of 22 basis points would be the 13 basis points plus the three basis points before that or 16 basis points. On an apples-to-apples comparison, you can see that it is improving. I'd also note that the 90-day pass billings ratio is lower in part because of improved credit, but also by the fact that we made this change to write off those receivables that were between 180 and 360.
Moving to Slide 19, this is Charge Card reserve coverage. And while credit has improved, we remain cautious in our reserving. The coverage of the 30-day past dues for the U.S. consumer card is similar to what we had last year. Now international consumer and Global Commercial Services, the 90-day past billings coverage has increased, as you can see in this chart. And that's because we modified our reserving methodology to move to a methodology that's based on losses to Billed business ratios. As those losses continue to improve, this coverage ratio will move back to historic levels.
Let me move to Slide 20. So this is the lending net write-off rate. So last quarter, we forecasted that the USCS write-off rate would be flat, with the fourth quarter of 5.7%. In fact, it is coming slightly better at 7.2%. And this is due to lower bankruptcy dollars. It's a combination of fewer filings and lower dollars per filing. We continue to significantly outperform the industry. Improved credit is a significant source of funding for higher earnings and higher investment levels. 
Let me move to Slide 21. This is the lending 30-day past due chart, and you can see that we continue to improve in the U.S. and are stable in the international consumer markets. 
If we move to Slide 22, now this is a chart that we've used over the last several quarters and if the 30-day past due write-off rate remains stable, that's the bottom part of this chart, and bankruptcies and recoveries remain stable, then improvements, and that's on the right-hand side of this chart, improvements in the current 30-day past dues would flow to the bottom line with improved write-offs.
Now in that upper left chart, the yellow triangles are what wrote off in the first quarter, and those three triangles are pretty similar to the green triangles just preceding that, and that's why we forecasted the first quarter would be similar to the fourth quarter. As I said before, the reason for better performance in the first quarter was really driven by the right side of this chart, which is that we had lower bankruptcy filings.
Now if we go back to the upper left-hand chart and we look at the green triangles, we can see that they are improving. And therefore, we would expect the second quarter write-offs to be better or lower than the write-off rank that we saw in the first quarter of 2010. And that's also consistent with what we said at the end of the first quarter.
So moving to Slide 23. We want to provide you with some information regarding lending reserve levels. Now if you start on the left side of this chart, we're starting at the end of 2008 and during 2009, we had write-offs of approximately $1 billion and we had a provision of $1.4 billion. So we built reserves during this period by $400 million and that reflects the deterioration in delinquencies and the higher write-off rate that we were seeing in 2009.
Now if you move to the right side of that chart, we start at the end of '09. And the first bar reflects the reserves that we established related to the loans that we brought back on the balance sheet. And I'll remind you that that ran through equity, not through the P&L. During this year, we had write-offs of $1.2 billion and a provision of $700 million. So we effectively released $500 million in reserves and that reflects improving delinquencies, lower write-off rates and lower loan balances. Now, with improved credit metrics, you would expect the red bar or the write-offs in this year to be lower than the write-offs that we had last year. But the difference as we're showing up in that little box in the upper right of the chart is that this year we have write-offs related to both the on-balance-sheet loans, as well as the loans that came back on the balance sheet, which were off-balance sheet last year, and therefore there were no write-offs related to that. So the comparable is that the $700 million related to non-securitized loans compared to $1 billion. We actually saw a decrease in write-offs on an apples-to-apples basis, which you would expect.
If we move to Slide 24, this our reserve coverage. Credit metrics, both write-offs and past due continue to improve. We reduce reserves by $500 million based on the inherent risk in the portfolio and the lower loan balances. But we continue to be cautious due to the uncertain economic environment. And you can see that our reserve coverage, reserves as a percentage of past due and principal months coverage reflect our cautious outlook.
If you move to Slide 25, these are our capital ratios. Capital ratios remain above well-capitalized levels. Tier 1 common ratio, relative to other financial institutions, are strong. And we'll need to wait to see where the regulators actually set the benchmark. But again, on a comparative basis, our Tier 1 common compared to other financial institutions is strong.
If we move to Slide 26, this is a liquidity snapshot. You can see that we have excess cash and marketable securities of $27 billion. The next 12 months of maturities is $20 billion, so we continue to hold cash and marketable securities equal to or greater than the next 12 months of maturities.
If we move to Slide 27, this is retail deposits. We continue to build deposits. We now have $27.4  billion of deposits. Now if you look below the chart, we've made some additional disclosures here. You start at the very bottom, you can see the average rate at issuance which is 2.3%. Also right above that, you can see the weighted average maturity when the deposits were originally put on the books, and that's 31 months. And we think also a relevant disclosure is the weighted average remaining maturity and we provided this additional information and we hope you find it useful.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the improved economic environment and our shift to be more -- to a more offensive posture versus last year's defensive stance. Spending has rebounded across all business sectors with locally comparisons improving due to both easier comparisons versus last year and higher absolute spending level. We also saw a sharp diversions between customer spending and borrowing levels. Some of it is due to our strategic and risk-related actions, and some reflects changes in customer behavior. While these offsetting influences, stronger billings growth and lower loan balances challenge overall revenue growth, credit trends continue to provide lower provision requirements and our underlying operating expense growth remains well controlled. 
This quarter is a clear demonstration of our differentiated business model, reflecting the makeup of our customer base and a design of our products. Spending on our network increased well above industry average, while loans decreased and credit performance was among the best in major card issuance. Our decisive and effective credit actions, which we improve credit performance without stifling stand by credit-worthy Cardmembers. 
The net effect of all these factors is our ability to invest in the business at significant levels, while also generating strong earnings. While some investments are designed to drive metrics over the next 12 months, we are also allocating resources to initiatives focused on the medium- to long-term success for the company. Challenges to continue progress remain. Unemployment levels are still high and customer behavior, as well as the legislative environments are uncertain. However, the global economy seems to be poised to continue to improve and our strong competitive position is yielding high-quality comparisons versus the competition. This gives us confidence that our investments and our differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.
Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions."

I think our products are designed to meet the needs of higher spending, more affluent customers. And last year, when we saw the drop in Billings -- in the first three quarters of last year when our billings were dropping at a rate similar to the competition, we were actually relatively pleased by that because generally, discretionary spending drops at a faster rate and our customers have more discretionary spending than the average population. So I think what we see here is when things improve, that discretionary spending is coming back. So I think it's really the impact of a more affluent customer base. I think that's one part of it. 
The next part has to do with Corporate Card. Corporate Card generally is more of a ""V."" It goes down sharper than the rest of spending and it comes back a lot steeper. And I think we're seeing that make a strong contribution here. We have a very strong position in Corporate Card. And then thirdly, we have a strong GNS business. As you could see from the charts, spending on cards issued by our partners that run on our network is performing very well. So I think it's all of those factors which are contributing to the Billings growth, which is significantly higher than we're seeing among other major competitors."

Is it uncertain, is it stable? And we used that process to actually establish our reserves. We then take a look at a whole variety of metrics, including month's coverage, including the percentage of reserves compared to the total loan balances, reserves as a percentage of delinquencies, what levels of new cards we put onto the books. So there is a myriad of other factors that come into play. And that's the way we set reserves. We don't do it off of any single metric.

And any event, the assumptions that we've made would give us very good returns. 
The way we think about what portions flow through the bottom line and what portion we're investing is driven by the fact that we want to ensure that we're investing enough to drive growth in the future that will enable us to hit our financial targets. If you look back at the kind of '05 to '08 time frame and took marketing promotion plus investments to drive growth within operating expense, those two numbers would probably be about 13% of revenues and we've actually taken that up to about 14% or 15% in the current period. So we're investing at a slightly higher level than we did historically. But again, we're trying to balance where our income level should be and investing to drive future growth in the years to come."

There is another large financial institution that actually did some share repurchases this quarter after conversation with the regulators. So I think that'll be an assessment we make later in this year."

And let's look at Slide #2, summary of financial performance.

And that was driven by strong bi",4428,"Okay, thanks, Ron. And let's look at Slide #2, summary of financial performance. And if you look halfway down the Slide, you'll see the diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.73 compared to $0.32 last year, up 128%. And that was driven by strong bill business and improved credit performance.
There were a number of line items that were being impacted by the adoption of accounting rule ASU 2009 16/17 formerly known as FAS 166 or 167. The rule requires that securitized loans be brought back onto the balance sheet and the related revenue and expense go back to their natural line. We have not restated 2009. For a better apples-to-apples comparison, I recommend you compare the 2010 to the 2009 managed results.
So the top of the Slide you can see that revenues on that basis were down 1%; if we adjusted for FX, it's down 4%. As better discount revenue from Billed business was offset by lower net spread. The difference in the growth rate that you see on continuing operations, which is up 100% compared to the EPS growth of 128% is driven by the fact that we had preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2009. And as you know, we repaid that preferred stock in June of last year.
If we move over to Slide 3, here we want to show the impact of the new accounting rule on our balance sheet. So we're recording $29 billion of loans that were previously securitized in our balance sheet. We have a related credit reserve on those loans of $2.5 billion, and that was established through equity, not the P&L.
At the bottom of the Slide, you can see the after-tax impact of that reserve, $1.8 billion dollars. Now investment securities are the B, C and D tranches from certain securitizations. 
Historically, we would sell all of the securitized receivables but starting in the third quarter of '07, because of the wide spreads, we held onto certain of the tranches. Those are now simply part of the loan balance. Other receivables represents restricted cash. When S&P reduced our rating, the trust agreements required that we hold aside cash related to debt that would mature in the near future. That now is moving from other receivables to other assets. When we get to Slide 12, I'll talk about some of the impacts of the new rule on those line items. So while this is something of a nuisance comparing 2010 to 2009, in the long term, it's a good change because the new rules provide a clear depiction of our financial results.
So let's move to Slide 4. And look at Billed business. You can see here that it's increased 16%, 12% on an FX-adjusted basis, significantly better than our other major competitors. This clearly demonstrate that we have a differentiated business model, reflecting the makeup of our customer base and the design of our products, which are focused on spending. We can see the cards-in-force is down 4%. If we exclude the inactive cards that we canceled last year, it's down 1%. We can see that average spend was a major driver of Billed business growth. On an FX adjusted basis, it's up 20%. And if we also factor out those inactive cards, it's about 14%.
When we look at card loans, I recommend you look at total portfolio. You can see it's down 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. This is in part, driven by the credit actions we've taken, and in part by customers deleveraging just as you've seen across the entire industry.
Travel sales are strong, both business travel and consumer travel. It reflects higher ticket prices and higher number of transactions. It also reflects customers moving from the back of the plane to the front of the plane and people taking longer flights.
If we move to Slide 5, this is some more detail on Billed business. Though each of the bars represent the dollar amount of Billed business in each month, the yellow and blue lines reflect the year-over-year growth on a reported and FX-adjusted basis. And if you look at the top, it's a summary of what the quarterly change in billings were over the last several quarters, and you can see that the first quarter of 2010 is notably better than the first quarter of 2009, and they are both depicted as green bars in this chart.
The growth rate is significantly higher and the absolute dollars are higher. Though I recognize that the growth rate in the first quarter of 2010 is higher in part because of the easy grow-over. 2009 first quarter was certainly our weakest billings quarter. As we look over the remaining quarters in 2010, the growth rates will be harder due to the fact that we had higher billings later in 2009. With that said, March was the highest billings for any March in our history, slightly higher than March of 2008.
Let me move to Slide 6. In here, we're looking at worldwide network spend. You can see that transaction size and the number of transactions are both contributing to the higher spend. Number of transactions increased by 7% and transaction size also increased by 7% for a combined Billed business growth of 16%.
If we move to Slide 7, we can see that Billed business is growing across all of our businesses. The sharpest increase is in Commercial Services, which is up 18% on an FX-adjusted basis and GNS continues to be very strong, with growth of 25% on an FX-adjusted basis. Global consumer businesses also are showing strong growth. If we look at this internationally, Asia and Latin America were somewhat stronger but we also had good growth in Canada and Europe.
If we move to Slide 8, we are showing you information for the U.S. Consumer segment by product, and we're showing it to you by quarter. And you can see here that we're getting the results based on the strategy that we're deploying. We're focusing on driving charge card spend and premium lending, which comes in the form of co-brand and this is where we are making our investments. You can see that U.S. Consumer charge growth is up about 8%, co-brand is up 16%, and proprietary lending is down 1%.
If we move to Slide 9, this is Charge Card. It's showing you both Billed business growth and the change in accounts receivable for Charge Card, and you can see that billings and receivable growth continue to move in tandem. Total Charge Card growth for the total company is up 15%. That includes both consumer and corporate cards globally.
If we move to Slide 10, we're looking at lending Billed Business and loan growth. And here, spending on lending products and loan growth are no longer correlated. Spending on lending products grew 11%, while loans were down 11%. And this is part due to actions we've taken but also consumers deleveraging. So some of what's impacting this is we have reduced certain lines to certain customers. We've had lower lending card acquisition. There's been a significant reduction in balance transfers. The mix of the portfolio was changing to be at a greater proportion of co-brand products.
If you look at our lending trust, you can see that payment rates are up. In March of 2009, the payment rate was 22.8%, and in March of 2010, it's 26.9%, so a notable increase. We're seeing lower revolve levels and fewer Cardmembers are making minimum payments.
So we were seeing loan balance and strength as consumers delever, and this is consistent with the industry trend. But what differentiates us from the competition is they are seeing either low single-digit growth or negative growth and we are seeing robust spending growth because we have a larger percent of transactors in our portfolio.
If we move to Slide 11, this is our net interest yield. Now here, we've made some slight modifications to how we allocate interest among segments to make it simpler and more transparent for the business units, and we've adjusted the yield calculation for each period on this Slide. The change ranged from no change to about 30 basis points. So you can see that in the first quarter of '09, the yield was 10.9% and in the first quarter of 2010, it's 10%. Now, the driver of this was reduction in interest rates for certain customers that are in our Care program, as well as a change in customer behavior where we have lower revolve rates.
Now we also had the impact of the CARD Act. But that was offset by pricing increases that we put in place. As we've previously discussed, over the balance of 2010, we expect the yield to return to historic levels of about 9%.
We move to Slide 12. This is our revenue performance. At the top, you can see that discount revenue of 13% growth is a combination of growth in Billed business of 16% and our discount rate dropping by 1 basis point to 2.55. So the discount rate continues to hold up well. Card fees are relatively consistent with last year. Now net interest income I would look at on a managed basis and it's down 24%. That's both a combination of the drop in yield that we just discussed and the fact that loans are down 11%. And you can see that we no longer have securitization income as these are all back on the natural line items.
Travel commissions and fees are being driven by the higher volumes that I discussed before. And if we look at other revenues on a reported basis, we have increases related to the inclusion of loans and some of the fees related to those loans, such as FX conversion fees. We also have higher GNS revenues, and that's partially offset by lower assessment fees and the fact that the GE portfolio, which last year was on this line, is now on the natural lines.
If we move to Slide 13, the provision for losses, the improvement in Charge Card reflects lower write-off rates year-over-year, a notable improvement in the thirty-day past-due rates year-over-year and the fact that we released approximately $50 million of reserves based on our credit performance.
The improvement in Cardmember lending provision is a result of lower write-off rates and lower loans. Therefore, we have lower write-off dollars. We have lower reserve requirements based on the improved credit metrics and we released $500 million of reserves in this quarter.
I would note that 2010 first quarter numbers includes write-offs related to the loans that were securitized last year. And last year, we don't have the write-offs related to those loans.
This improvement in provision is providing significant resources, a portion of which is flowing to net income and a portion of which is being used to increase investments to drive growth in the medium- to long-term. Now I'll have a number of additional slides on provision a little later.
Let's move to Slide 14 and look at expense performance. You can see that marketing and promotion reflects the investments I just discussed before and are designed to drive future growth. I'll talk a little bit more about that on the next Slide.
You can see that Cardmember rewards is up 43%, and that's a combination of rewards related to our co-brand products as well as Membership Rewards. Co-brand volumes are up 16% and our cost per point is up slightly based on new co-brand agreement that we've signed over the past year. So the total increase in co-brand rewards is 24%.
Membership Rewards is being impacted by the fact or the growth rate is being impacted by the fact that last year, we made some refinements to the calculation, which actually had a benefit in '09. And therefore we have a grow-over this year. In addition to that, the URR [ultimate redemption rate] is somewhat higher. That's being impacted by the fact that we continue to improve the value proposition and haven't made it easier for our Cardmembers to redeem. It's also being impacted by the fact that our Cardmembers are more tenured as we've had lower levels of acquisition and more tenured Cardmembers tend to have higher estimates for ultimate redemption.
In addition to that, our cost per point just slightly higher. In 2009, customers utilized air as the redemption item to a lesser degree. Air is a higher cost redemption item and customers are moving back to normal levels of utilization of air as an option.
The important thing here is long-term.  That rewards are an important part of our value proposition, and we believe we have the ability to properly manage these costs and have products that have very good economics.
So next, let me look at Salaries & Employee Benefits, which we're up 6%. This is being driven by higher incentive compensation, some impact from FX, severance costs in the quarter related to some  reengineering within our Global Commercial Services segment, partially offset by a lower employee level. Employee level is about 5,000 lower than last year, and that's a result of the reengineering that we did last year.
Other operating expenses reflect spending on certain costs that are driving growth such as technology spending. But those expenses that are not driving growth in revenues are being very well-controlled and I have a Slide a little later on that.
So if we move to Slide 15 and look at marketing and promotion expense.  Each of these bar is the dollar amount of marketing and promotion in each of the respective quarters. The green bars reflect the first quarter of '08, '09 and 2010, and you can see that the 2010 spending is significantly higher than the amount that we did in the first quarter of '09. In that period, we were pulling back on marketing so that we could stay profitable. You can see that the first quarter of 2010 is back to the level that we had in the first quarter of '08 and represents healthy spending levels in U.S. consumer, international consumer, as well as GNMS.
Now the increases are broad. They include spending on brand advertising. Last year, we were basically dark in advertising, so we brought back brand advertising. It also reflects spending on acquisition. Now I would note that our acquisitions are focused on the affluent customer, and therefore, the number of accounts that we're acquiring, even though we're spending more on acquisition, is similar to the number of accounts that we acquired last year.
We're also spending on loyalty. And you can see the benefit of that in our average spend numbers. We also continue to invest in merchant programs and with our GMS partners.
If we move to Slide 16, this is a chart on operating expense. Now as we've indicated, investments are not just in marketing and promotion, but also some are in operating expense. And this trust intended to give you an idea of how it splits out. Now on the chart you can see that growth is about 8%. It's actually 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. So the circles that are above the line are going faster than the average and the circles that are below the line are growing slower than the average. And we're trying to use color codes to give you an indication of whether it's a large item, medium in size or small. So certain of the circles as we go forward will be on the chart each quarter and others will be on the chart when they are relevant.
So the areas where we're spending above average are on partner investments such as marketing initiatives with Delta Airlines, would be an example. We'll also continue to invest in Global Network Services and that's marketing related to partners who issue cards that run on our network. We also are spending on technology to enable our growth initiatives. An FDIC assessment, while small, is an indication of the type of item that has actually -- is growing above the average on this line.
On the other hand, collections, because write-off rates are down is below the average. And as you can see, staff function such as finance, HR and General Counsel are growing slower than the average as is Global Services group, which is led by Steve Squeri. And as you know, we pulled this group together, which is focused on improving quality and also very focused on efficiency.
I would note that we continue to plan over the balance of this year to continue to invest at healthy levels in both marketing and promotion and in operating expenses that will drive growth.
So let me move to Slide 17, which is the U.S. Charge Card net write-off rate and 30-day past due chart. You can see that Charge Card continues to perform very well. Write-off rates in the 30-day past due rates are now at historic lows. Actually, in all likelihood overtime, these rates will actually probably move up more towards historic levels over time.
If we move to Slide 18, this relates to international consumer and global commercial card, Charge Cards and it's the net loss rate and 90-day past due billings ratio. So first, let me mention that for these two segments, we have moved the write-offs from 130 days to 180 days to comply with banking regulatory guidelines. You may remember that we made this change in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of '08. So this has no impact on provision because the AR over 180 days is effectively fully reserved. But the write-offs do run through the net loss ratio calculation in this quarter, and that piece is depicted by the dark blue section of this bar.
So write-offs, excluding the write-offs between 180 and 360, was 13 basis points. So another change that we made relates to fraud losses. Historically, fraud losses have been included in this bar. But starting in this quarter, they are being excluded, and that's probably about three basis points. So the apples-to-apples comparison to last quarter of 22 basis points would be the 13 basis points plus the three basis points before that or 16 basis points. On an apples-to-apples comparison, you can see that it is improving. I'd also note that the 90-day pass billings ratio is lower in part because of improved credit, but also by the fact that we made this change to write off those receivables that were between 180 and 360.
Moving to Slide 19, this is Charge Card reserve coverage. And while credit has improved, we remain cautious in our reserving. The coverage of the 30-day past dues for the U.S. consumer card is similar to what we had last year. Now international consumer and Global Commercial Services, the 90-day past billings coverage has increased, as you can see in this chart. And that's because we modified our reserving methodology to move to a methodology that's based on losses to Billed business ratios. As those losses continue to improve, this coverage ratio will move back to historic levels.
Let me move to Slide 20. So this is the lending net write-off rate. So last quarter, we forecasted that the USCS write-off rate would be flat, with the fourth quarter of 5.7%. In fact, it is coming slightly better at 7.2%. And this is due to lower bankruptcy dollars. It's a combination of fewer filings and lower dollars per filing. We continue to significantly outperform the industry. Improved credit is a significant source of funding for higher earnings and higher investment levels.
Let me move to Slide 21. This is the lending 30-day past due chart, and you can see that we continue to improve in the U.S. and are stable in the international consumer markets.
If we move to Slide 22, now this is a chart that we've used over the last several quarters and if the 30-day past due write-off rate remains stable, that's the bottom part of this chart, and bankruptcies and recoveries remain stable, then improvements, and that's on the right-hand side of this chart, improvements in the current 30-day past dues would flow to the bottom line with improved write-offs.
Now in that upper left chart, the yellow triangles are what wrote off in the first quarter, and those three triangles are pretty similar to the green triangles just preceding that, and that's why we forecasted the first quarter would be similar to the fourth quarter. As I said before, the reason for better performance in the first quarter was really driven by the right side of this chart, which is that we had lower bankruptcy filings.
Now if we go back to the upper left-hand chart and we look at the green triangles, we can see that they are improving. And therefore, we would expect the second quarter write-offs to be better or lower than the write-off rank that we saw in the first quarter of 2010. And that's also consistent with what we said at the end of the first quarter.
So moving to Slide 23. We want to provide you with some information regarding lending reserve levels. Now if you start on the left side of this chart, we're starting at the end of 2008 and during 2009, we had write-offs of approximately $1 billion and we had a provision of $1.4 billion. So we built reserves during this period by $400 million and that reflects the deterioration in delinquencies and the higher write-off rate that we were seeing in 2009.
Now if you move to the right side of that chart, we start at the end of '09. And the first bar reflects the reserves that we established related to the loans that we brought back on the balance sheet. And I'll remind you that that ran through equity, not through the P&L. During this year, we had write-offs of $1.2 billion and a provision of $700 million. So we effectively released $500 million in reserves and that reflects improving delinquencies, lower write-off rates and lower loan balances. Now, with improved credit metrics, you would expect the red bar or the write-offs in this year to be lower than the write-offs that we had last year. But the difference as we're showing up in that little box in the upper right of the chart is that this year we have write-offs related to both the on-balance-sheet loans, as well as the loans that came back on the balance sheet, which were off-balance sheet last year, and therefore there were no write-offs related to that. So the comparable is that the $700 million related to non-securitized loans compared to $1 billion. We actually saw a decrease in write-offs on an apples-to-apples basis, which you would expect.
If we move to Slide 24, this our reserve coverage. Credit metrics, both write-offs and past due continue to improve. We reduce reserves by $500 million based on the inherent risk in the portfolio and the lower loan balances. But we continue to be cautious due to the uncertain economic environment. And you can see that our reserve coverage, reserves as a percentage of past due and principal months coverage reflect our cautious outlook.
If you move to Slide 25, these are our capital ratios. Capital ratios remain above well-capitalized levels. Tier 1 common ratio, relative to other financial institutions, are strong. And we'll need to wait to see where the regulators actually set the benchmark. But again, on a comparative basis, our Tier 1 common compared to other financial institutions is strong.
If we move to Slide 26, this is a liquidity snapshot. You can see that we have excess cash and marketable securities of $27 billion. The next 12 months of maturities is $20 billion, so we continue to hold cash and marketable securities equal to or greater than the next 12 months of maturities.
If we move to Slide 27, this is retail deposits. We continue to build deposits. We now have $27.4  billion of deposits. Now if you look below the chart, we've made some additional disclosures here. 
You start at the very bottom, you can see the average rate at issuance which is 2.3%. Also right above that, you can see the weighted average maturity when the deposits were originally put on the books, and that's 31 months. And we think also a relevant disclosure is the weighted average remaining maturity and we provided this additional information and we hope you find it useful.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the improved economic environment and our shift to be more -- to a more offensive posture versus last year's defensive stance. Spending has rebounded across all business sectors with locally comparisons improving due to both easier comparisons versus last year and higher absolute spending level. We also saw a sharp diversions between customer spending and borrowing levels. Some of it is due to our strategic and risk-related actions, and some reflects changes in customer behavior. While these offsetting influences, stronger billings growth and lower loan balances challenge overall revenue growth, credit trends continue to provide lower provision requirements and our underlying operating expense growth remains well controlled.
This quarter is a clear demonstration of our differentiated business model, reflecting the makeup of our customer base and a design of our products. Spending on our network increased well above industry average, while loans decreased and credit performance was among the best in major card issuance. Our decisive and effective credit actions, which we improve credit performance without stifling stand by credit-worthy Cardmembers.
The net effect of all these factors is our ability to invest in the business at significant levels, while also generating strong earnings. While some investments are designed to drive metrics over the next 12 months, we are also allocating resources to initiatives focused on the medium- to long-term success for the company. Challenges to continue progress remain. Unemployment levels are still high and customer behavior, as well as the legislative environments are uncertain. However, the global economy seems to be poised to continue to improve and our strong competitive position is yielding high-quality comparisons versus the competition. 
This gives us confidence that our investments and our differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.
Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions."

So I think what we see here is when things improve, that discretionary spending is coming back. So I think it's really the impact of a more affluent customer base. I think that's one part of it. The next part has to do with Corporate Card. Corporate Card generally is more of a ""V."" It goes down sharper than the rest of spending and it comes back a lot steeper. And I think we're seeing that make a strong contribution here. We have a very strong position in Corporate Card. And then thirdly, we have a strong GNS business. As you could see from the charts, spending on cards issued by our partners that run on our network is performing very well. So I think it's all of those factors which are contributing to the Billings growth, which is significantly higher than we're seeing among other major competitors."

We actually have models that we utilize that look at historical performance, which is really the basis for the bulk of our reserve. We also look at whether there's a need for specific reserves for certain areas. So for instance, we've done re-aging recently. Those re-aged accounts have greater credit risk than the overall portfolio, so we've set up some specific reserves for those. And then we also take into consideration what's taking place in the economy. Is it uncertain, is it stable? And we used that process to actually establish our reserves. We then take a look at a whole variety of metrics, including months of coverage, including the percentage of reserves compared to the total loan balances, reserves as a percentage of delinquencies, what level of new cards we put onto the books. So there is a myriad of other factors that come into play. And that's the way we set reserves. We don't do it off of any single metric. And at the end of the day, the reserves will be based on the inherent risk in the portfolio."

You have a very clear outlook there. But the actual percentage of total operating expense, that's -- OpEx is not the overwhelming majority. Let's say if you need to have a fair amount of that operating expense is supporting our core business, but we are allocating more to that because we are emphasizing commercial card. If we're going to grow commercial cards generally related to sales force, that would be an operating expense. We're also very focused on new fee generations and new products that will drive the fee revenue growth. We've talked about LoyaltyEdge as an example of that. We've talked about marketing data to merchants and all of those require OpEx to drive it. So we haven't split out that number exactly, but it's not inconsequential but it's not the vast majority."

We think the investments we're making this year in those core businesses will also be very good, very much along historic levels. Any time you venture into new areas, some of which we're doing, you have estimated returns and those estimated returns will give us actually very good economics. But the certainty of those are obviously different because you don't have history to know that you'll be as successful in achieving those. And any event, the assumptions that we've made would give us very good returns. The way we think about what portions flow through the bottom line and what portion we're investing is driven by the fact that we want to ensure that we're investing enough to drive growth in the future that will enable us to hit our financial targets. If you look back at the kind of '05 to '08 time frame and took marketing promotion plus investments to drive growth within operating expense, those two numbers would probably be about 13% of revenues and we've actually taken that up to about 14% or 15% in the current period. So we're investing at a slightly higher level than we did historically. But again, we're trying to balance where our income level should be and investing to drive future growth in the years to come."

So while we've ratcheted up the dollars that we're spending on acquisition, the actual number of accounts that we're acquiring this year are similar to the number of accounts that we acquired in the first quarter of last year, and that's a reflection more of who we're going after as opposed to a notable reduction in response rates.

If we look at American Express excluding Visa and MasterCard, benefits that you garnered over the past couple of years and when we trend your business back and we look at you like a payment processor, were total expenses relative to revenue sort of noncredit expenses related to revenues, we get kind of an operating margin. And this quarter itself was one of the lower operating margins that we've had, which is certainly okay if we're at the early part of a growth cycle. But I guess the question is I'm sure you probably looked at your business in this way, how should we be thinking about that relative to sort of near-term expectations? We have comments of some lower revenues and continuing investing at this part of the cycle is certainly understandable. But at these kinds of operating expense levels, are we to sort of expect them at these levels for the next couple of quarters and then potentially get operating leverage in years to come? How should we be putting that in context relative to where you've been historically because this quarter is one of the highest expense levels relative to revenues that we've had at least for the past couple, five years?"

But we are investing in some areas that fall to a greater degree to fill an operating expense, that may have been the case in the past. So we're just trying to make that distinction. But we are not moving away from our historical financial targets to grow revenues at greater than 8% and to achieve EPS growth of 12% to 15%.

See total earnings are up 13%, but the more appropriate line to look at is managed total revenues, which is down 1%. The reason for that is in '09, revenues did not include interest related to those receivables that had been securitized. If you exclude the ICBC gain that was in '09, revenues are actually up 2%. Income from continuing operations was $1.017 billion. '09 included two one-time items. One was the ICBC gain of $211 million pretax, and we also had re-engineering costs of $182 million pretax. So those more or less offset each other. EPS was $0.84, and that compares to $0.09 in the prior period. But you'll remember that in the second quarter of '09, we had a charge that was about $0.18 related to our repayment of TARP. So the better comparison is $0.27 last year compared to $0.84 this year, up significantly. And ROE increased to 23%.
We go to Slide 3 and we look at Billed business. It increased 16%, or 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. It is now approaching the pre-crisis levels in Billed business that we had back in '08. Cards-in-force are relatively flat with last year. GNS is up 7% and proprietary cards are down slightly. If we look at average Cardmember spending, it increased 20% on an FX-adjusted basis, but if you exclude the card cancellations of 2.7 million cards last year in the second quarter, average Cardmember spend would be up 16%, which is very much in line with the increase in Billed business.
Loans on a managed basis are down 9%, driven primarily by Cardmember behavior as well as our strategy which is changing the mix of receivables, as we are focused on premium lending in co-brand. Those customers tend to be more transactors and have higher pay-down rates. However, loans are down less than competitors and that's because we are having higher growth in spending by our Cardmembers and we have lower write-off rates. Travel is benefiting from a growth in transactions, as well as higher prices in Airline.
If you look at Slide 4, there's more detail on Billed business. The bars represent Billed business each month. The lines represent growth rates for both reported and FX-adjusted. On an FX-adjusted basis, April and May grew 15% and June grew 14%, for the average of 15% in the second quarter. July month-to-date growth is in the double digits and the growth rate is down slightly from June due to a tougher rollover in 2009.
If we move to Slide 5, this is information on network spending. And you can see that transactions are growing 8% and transaction size is higher by 6%. So they're both contributing to spending growth. 
If we move to Slide 6, this is growth by segment. And you can see that we had strong growth across all of our segments. The highest growth is in GNS and this is being driven by partners issuing additional cards. Promotional Card also had strong growth, and this is in part due to new signings, as well as higher level of spending from existing clients. International Consumer had growth of 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, and while it's slightly lower than the other segments, this is due in part by the fact that it dropped less in 2009. So we have broad-based growth in spending. We'll have to wait until all the statistics are in, but it would appear that we will gain share in the second quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Now this is some new disclosure that we thought that you would be interested in. It's spending by region. You can see that JAPA has the highest growth and this is in part driven by new GNS signings in Australia. We also expect that EMEA growth would be slightly below the average, but it's still strong at 11% on an FX-adjusted basis.
If we move to Slide 8, this is spending by product within the U.S. Consumer and Small Business Group. And it represents the spend decline or growth over the past five quarters. And you can see that in the current period, we are having strong growth in both charge and co-brand and this reflects the investment spending in these areas, consistent with our strategy. And we've had more modest growth in proprietary lending. So before I leave spending, let me make a few points. Spending on our network is growing faster than the industry in charge and credit. Spending growth is broad-based across segments and geography. Growth is concentrated in the areas of our strategic focus, charge and co-brand. And growth reflects our strategy of using improvements in credit to invest in the business.
Let me move to Slide 9, and this is Charge Card Billed business and receivable growth. And we see here that Charge Card receivables continue to move in tandem with the growth in Billed business. Charge Card Billed business was 15%, consistent with last quarter.
Moving to Slide 10. We're looking at lending, Billed business and managed loan growth. And here, lending, Billed business and managed loan growth, at this moment, is not closely correlated. It's in part because of actions that we've taken in terms of credit, as well as the change in our strategy to reduce acquisition and proprietary lending and focus more on premium and co-brand. It's also in part by Cardmembers looking to delever.
You can see this if you look at our trust data and look at pay-down rates. Back in June of '09, pay-down was 24.2%. And in June of 2010, it was 28.9%. So we expect the difference in growth rates and spending in loans to continue over the near term.
Let me move to Slide 11. So this is USCS net interest yield. And on the right, you can see that the yield was 9.3% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 9.7% in the second quarter of '09. This change reflects the implementation of the CARD Act, the pricing actions that we put in place over recent quarters, which were designed to mitigate the impact of the CARD Act, as well as changes in customer behavior.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, the impact from the CARD Act within yield is significant. However, we have worked to mitigate it through repricing activities over recent quarters. Our objective is to migrate back to the historical yield level of 9%. We believe our pricing is appropriate and reflects the necessary revenues for our business. But uncertainty does exist regarding the impact of the look-back or regulatory review required on a go-forward basis.
Staying with the CARD Act, we do not expect the revised late fee rules, which will be implemented in August, to have a material impact. We believe the CARD Act is more significant for us than financial reform due to the nature of our business model, which is not impacted by many aspects of the reform. With regard to financial reform legislation, we support the general principle of financial stability and consumer protection underlying the legislation. However, there clearly are costs associated with it. Many of the aspects will play out over time, giving us the ability to adopt to the changing marketplace.
While other industry participants have discussed details regarding debit pricing risk pursuant to the Durbin amendment, our Charge Card and credit cards are not directly impacted by the potential debit pricing adjustments. With regard to discounting, while merchants have long had the ability to provide discounts for payment of cash and check, the additional ability of merchants to discount price for payments with debit cards versus credit cards creates some additional uncertainty. However, based on our commitment to deliver high-quality customers and services to merchants, we are confident in our ability to adopt to the changing environment.
So let me get back to our second quarter results and move to Slide 12. This is a summary of our revenue performance. So discount revenue is driven by 16% growth in Billed business and is impacted by the higher growth in GNS and increased contra revenue related to co-brand partner investments. Net interest income for 2010 includes all the interest on all loans. 2009 does not include the interest related to those loans that were securitized. On an apples-to-apples basis, 2010 remains the same at $1.188 billion. 2009 would be $1.464 billion, so that would be down about 19% on a managed basis. And that's a result of average loans being down 10% and the yield this year being at 9.3%, compared to 9.7% in '09. Travel commissions and fees are benefiting from greater foreign currency revenues related to higher spending and partly offset by lower delinquency fees. Other revenues, if you were to back out the ICBC gain from last year, last year's number would be 898 and we actually see an increase up to 982 this year. And that's reflected in part by higher GNS partner-related revenues. One last point that I'd make about revenues is that we had 4% growth in revenues sequentially, compared to the first quarter. 
So let's move to Slide 13, which is provision for losses. So the provision for Charge Card and lending both are improving dramatically, based on the improved credit performance that we've seen. '09 provision does not include write-offs related to those loans that were securitized. If we included those, the provision would have increased to $2.420 billion, so that would mean a year-over-year improvement of $1.7 billion. Based on the improvement that we saw in credit performance, reserves declined $50 million in Charge Card and $450 million in lending, for a total reserve release of $500 million. As you will see in a few slides, our reserve coverage remains cautious.
Let's move to Slide 14 and expense performance. So you can see that marketing and promotion is up significantly, up to $802 million, compared with $352 million last year. And I'd point out that last year was unusually low, as we were looking to stay profitable in '09. But the $802 million is above historic levels. So this is very consistent with what we've said in the past; as credit improved, we would drop some to the bottom line and the balance we would invest to drive business growth, some of it to help the near term, but we're also investing for the medium-to-long term. If we look at rewards, it is growing in line with the growth in Billed business. Salaries and benefits are lower by 4%. However, if we adjust for the re-engineering charge that we had in '09, it's up 8%, reflecting merit increases, resumption of the 401(k) match program and profit sharing, as well as higher incentive accruals, partly offset by lower levels of employees. The tax provision and tax rate are up, reflecting higher earnings and a $44 million charge related to valuation of certain deferred tax assets.
Moving to Slide 15. This is now our spending levels over the past three years by quarter. Other than the fourth quarter of '07, when we received our initial Visa settlement payment, the second quarter of 2010 is the highest level on the chart; higher than the historic averages that we saw back in the second and third quarter of '07. If we were to compare our spending in the second quarter of 2010 back to that '07 period, within USCS, we see similar levels of spending on acquisition, but with a shift from proprietary lending to charge and co-brand. In ICS, International Consumer, we're seeing generally higher levels of spend across several areas. And within GMS, we're seeing a substantial increase in the investment and perception of coverage. 
As discussed over the prior quarters, the high level of investment spending reflects the provision benefit as credit is improving. As you can see from the chart, we have the ability to adjust investment levels. As these provision benefits lessen over time, we have the flexibility to move investment spending back towards historic levels.
I'll now move to Slide 16, which is information in terms of our operating expense. As we said to you, you should not look solely at marketing and promotion to judge our investment spending. Operating expense on average grew 8%. Within operating expense, you can see that support functions, which are organizations such as finance and other staff groups, and global services, are growing at a rate below the average. Collection expense is growing at a slower rate as credit improves. Above the dotted line, expense growth is growing faster than the average and there were some administrative costs, such as costs to comply with the new bank holding company and Basel II regulations, but the majority of the higher growth relates to expenses driving revenue growth such as sales force, network initiatives and partner investments.
Moving to Slide 17, this is the USCS Charge Card write-off and past-due rates. And you can see that these metrics are improving and really, the reason that provision is lower. And you can see that the write-off rate and 30 days past-due continued to improve here. 
If we move to Slide 18, this is International Consumer and Global Commercial Card. And again, here, you can see the net loss rate in the 90 day past-due billing ratio continues to perform very well. I'll remind you in the first quarter of 2010, that dark blue section in Q1 2010 was driven by a methodology change to do write-offs at 180 days, instead of the prior practice of 360.
Moving to Slide 19, Charge Card reserve coverage. As you can see from this slide, while credit improves, reserve coverage remains cautious across all segments. The International Consumer and Global Commercial Services 90 day past billings coverage increased in 2010 as we changed reserve methods to be based on a lost-to-bill business ratio. And that was discussed with you last quarter.
If we move to Slide 20, which is the managed lending net write-off rate, you can see that the write-off rate continues to improve in the U.S. and globally. Our metrics are performing substantially better than the industry and they're benefiting from the fact that we moved earlier and more decisively. And it also reflects the high quality of our Cardmember base. Our write-off rate is now down to 6%, and while this is still above historic averages, it represents a significant improvement from the second quarter of 2009.
Next, we're looking at the lending 30-day past due. And again, here we're seeing good improvement both in the U.S. and globally. Delinquency dollars are at $1.6 billion this quarter, compared to $2.7 billion in the second quarter of '09. Again, a significant improvement. 
If we look at Slide 22, here we're looking at roll rate information, which provides insight into why our write-off rates are improving and what might happen in the future. The write-off rate in the current month are a function of the current-to-30 day past-due roll rates five months prior. So the write-off rate in the second quarter relates to the green triangles in the upper left-hand chart. That's the chart on the current-to-30-day past-due. And they were lower than the prior three triangles. Therefore, second quarter write-offs were lower than the first quarter, and this is also dependent on the 30-day past-due-to-write-off rate, bankruptcies and recoveries remaining constant.
You can see that the next three triangles after the green triangles are down slightly. I remind you that we are in uncertain economic times and that the third quarter write-off rate will also depend on the 30-day past-due-to-write-off percentage, bankruptcies and recoveries.
Now the increase we saw sequentially in bankruptcies, the right-hand chart, in the second quarter is in line with the growth in bankruptcies in the industry.
Moving to Slide 23. So this is reserve activity in the second quarter of last year and this year. The left side of '09 doesn't include reserve activity for those receivables that were securitized in '09. In '09, we billed $200 million of credit reserves, based on the fact that credit metrics were deteriorating. And we released $500 million of lending reserves in the second quarter of 2010, as credit continues to improve. The blue box in the top right provides information with respect to the write-off split between securitized and non-securitized loans. So if you were to compare the $1.1 billion of write-offs in the second quarter of '09, it would compare to the $600 million in the second quarter of '10. So while we released reserves, we believe we have an appropriate level of reserve coverage. 
Now we can see that on the next slide, Slide 24. So we've seen credit metrics are improving and we've reduced lending reserves by $450 million in the quarter, based on the inherent risk in the portfolio. But we continue to be cautious in setting credit reserves, as the economic environment remains uneven, housing is stalled and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Our reserve coverage reflects the uncertainty that we see in the environment.
Moving to Slide 25, our capital ratios remain above well-capitalized. Our Tier 1 common ratio of 10.7% is strong relative to other U.S. financial institutions. Now as we know, new rules will be written in the near future regarding capital and capital requirements, will be higher than they have been historically. But as you can see from the slide, our capital position today appears to provide a good foundation for those future requirements.
Moving to Slide 26, this is our liquidity. We continue to hold excess cash and readily-marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. So we're holding $25 billion and maturities are $20 billion.
Moving to Slide 27, you can see retail deposits increased by $300 million in the second quarter. We didn't need to grow deposits in the quarter to meet funding needs. We did reduce brokered CDs [Certificate of Deposit] by about $1 billion and continue to grow Personal Savings; both CDs and High-Yield Savings balances.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect both general improvement in the economic environment versus last year, and our shift to a more offensive investment posture. Spending growth was relatively strong across our business segments due to both higher absolute spending levels and the weak volumes last year amidst a global economic slowdown. In fact, on an FX-adjusted basis, this was the strongest second quarter in terms of dollars spent.
We also continue to see a sharp divergence between customer spending and borrowing levels. Some of it is due to our strategies and risk-related actions, and some reflects changes in consumer behavior. The net effect of these trends is a lower risk profile for the company, as charge and co-brand spending are a key driver of our volumes and receivable trends.
While these offsetting influences, strong billings growth and lower loan balances challenge overall revenue growth, improving credit trends and well-controlled operating expense have provided the ability to invest in the business at a significant level, while also generating strong earnings. Some of these investments are intended to drive metrics in the near term, but others are allocated towards investments focused on the medium-to-long term success of the company. 
Challenges clearly remain as global economic indicators have weakened somewhat, and sentiment seems to show less strength than most would've expected a few months ago. In the U.S. and many other key markets, job creation remains weak, consumer confidence is volatile, consumer behavior is uncertain and regulatory and legislative initiatives will change aspects of the business going forward. While these factors have us approaching investment and expense commitments with caution, our strong competitive position is yielding high quality results. Spending on our network has been increasing well above the industry average and our credit performance was the best among major card issuers. This indicates to us our decisive and effective credit actions are achieving improved credit performance without stifling spending by credit-worthy Cardmembers. This gives us confidence that our investments and differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to manage through our challenges, capitalize on opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace. Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions."

We have been focused on charge and co-brand, but we've also increased our investment levels compared to historical levels internationally because we see that as an area of growth. We also have increased spending within our merchant business on perceptions of coverage, because often, customers don't perceive that we have the coverage that we actually do. So we want to make sure that we're communicating that clearly. The investments we make, even the ones that get short-term benefit like card acquisition, we actually make those investments because of the lifetime economics that we have from the customers that we acquire. So we're getting benefit now, but we'll get it in the long term. Now in terms of your comment on cards-in-force, I just say that to the extent we acquire charge cards and co-brand, where customers spend at a higher level, it's more expensive to acquire those cards. So we wouldn't expect to have the kind of card growth that we had when we were acquiring large numbers of proprietary lending customers. I'd also say that we're going to give you more detail on this at the Financial Community Meeting that takes place in the first week in August. But just getting back to where we're spending the $900 million, I think you're going to see the benefit of that in the long term, but you're also seeing the benefit of that in our billings numbers. So we do think that the higher volumes that we're achieving compared to last year, and the higher volumes that we're achieving compared to the other networks, are due in part to the higher level of investments that we’ve really made over the last several quarters."

We also set specific reserves against certain categories where we think it's appropriate. And then we also have a factor that relates to the environment. And our reserve coverage is cautious because of the uncertainty that exists in the environment. Whether you look at unemployment, which is stubbornly high, if you look at consumer confidence, you'll look at where housing is, it's just very uneven. And for that reason, we are remaining cautious as we said, on reserves. If you turn then to your second question about marketing, certain types of marketing, such as card acquisition, we have models that can predict very accurately when we bring in customers, what kind of spending we're going to get and when we're going to get it. And we constantly update those models based on recent activities. Other types of investments, if you go to the other end of the spectrum and you look at Revolution Money, we’re investing in a platform and developing capabilities. When we'll see the revenue from that will probably be some period of time in the future before it has a meaningful impact on our business. So we're really investing across a spectrum where we get some pretty immediate impact, a couple of months, and we see revenue in the top line, and others where it takes a longer period of time. And we believe it's very important to have investments that really go across the spectrum from short term to medium term to long term. So really, it depends on the investment. And then there are certain types of investments where it isn't as crystal-clear. So if you look at certain loyalty programs, we know in aggregate we get good returns on the aggregate loyalty programs we have. If you try to isolate that to one particular, it gets a little more difficult. If you look at marketing and advertising, clearly it’s something we want to be in the marketplace with. But again, measuring that on a precise basis isn’t as easy. So in some investments, you can see exactly when it's going to come; in others, it takes a longer period of time. So there's no formula I can give you to say, “For this dollars of marketing, this is the revenues that you should expect two quarters from now.”"

See total earnings are up 13%, but the more appropriate line to look at is managed total revenues, which is down 1%. The reason for that is in '09, revenues did not include interest related to those receivables that had been securitized. If you exclude the ICBC gain that was in '09, revenues are actually up 2%. Income from continuing operations was $1.017 billion. '09 included two one-time items. One was the ICBC gain of $211 million pretax, and we also had re-engineering costs of $182 million pretax. So those more or less offset each other. EPS was $0.84, and that compares to $0.09 in the prior period. But you'll remember that in the second quarter of '09, we had a charge that was about $0.18 related to our repayment of TARP. So the better comparison is $0.27 last year compared to $0.84 this year, up significantly. And ROE increased to 23%.
We go to Slide 3 and we look at Billed business. It increased 16% or 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. It is now approaching the pre-crisis levels in Billed business that we had back in '08. Cards-in-force are relatively flat with last year. GNS is up 7% and proprietary cards are down slightly. If we look at average Cardmember spending, it increased 20% on an FX-adjusted basis, but if you exclude the card cancellations of 2.7 million cards last year in the second quarter, average Cardmember spend would be up 16%, which is very much in line with the increase in Billed business.
Loans on a managed basis are down 9%, driven primarily by Cardmember behavior as well as our strategy which is changing the mix of receivables, as we are focused on premium lending in co-brand. Those customers tend to be more transactors and have higher pay-down rates. However, loans are down less than competitors, and that's because we are having higher growth in spending by our Cardmembers and we have lower write-off rates. Travel is benefiting from a growth in transactions as well as higher prices in Airline.
If we look at Slide 4, there's more detail on Billed business. The bars represent Billed business each month. The lines represent growth rates for both reported and FX-adjusted. On an FX-adjusted basis, April and May grew 15% and June grew 14%, for the average of 15% in the second quarter. July month-to-date growth is in the double digits and the growth rate is down slightly from June due to a tougher rollover in 2009.
If we move to Slide 5, this is information on network spending. And you can see that transactions are growing 8% and transaction size is higher by 6%. So they're both contributing to spending growth. 
If we move to Slide 6, this is growth by segment. And you can see that we had strong growth across all of our segments. The highest growth is in GNS, and this is being driven by partners issuing additional cards. Promotional Card also had strong growth, and this is in part due to new signings as well as higher level of spending from existing clients. International Consumer had growth of 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, and while it's slightly lower than the other segments, this is due in part by the fact that it dropped less in 2009. So we have broad-based growth in spending. We'll have to wait until all the statistics are in, but it would appear that we will gain share in the second quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Now this is some new disclosure that we thought that you would be interested in. It's spending by region. You can see that JAPA has the highest growth, and this is in part driven by new GNS signings in Australia. You would also expect that EMEA growth is slightly below the average, but it's still strong at 11% on an FX-adjusted basis.
If we move to Slide 8, this is spending by product within the U.S. Consumer and Small Business Group. And it represents the spend decline or growth over the past five quarters. And you can see that in the current period, we are having strong growth in both charge and co-brand and this reflects the investment spending in these areas, consistent with our strategy. And we've had more modest growth in proprietary lending. So before I leave spending, let me make a few points. Spending on our network is growing faster than the industry in charge and credit. Spending growth is broad-based across segments and geography. Growth is concentrated in the areas of our strategic focus, charge and co-brand. And growth reflects our strategy of using improvements in credit to invest in the business.
Let me move to Slide 9, and this is Charge Card Billed business and receivable growth. And we see here that Charge Card receivables continue to move in tandem with the growth in Billed business. Charge Card Billed business was 15%, consistent with last quarter.
Moving to Slide 10. We're looking at lending, Billed business and managed loan growth. And here, lending, Billed business and managed loan growth, at this moment, is not closely correlated. It's in part because of actions that we've taken in terms of credit, as well as the change in our strategy to reduce acquisition and proprietary lending and focus more on premium and co-brand. It's also in part by Cardmembers looking to delever.
You can see this if you look at our trust data and look at pay-down rates. Back in June of '09, pay-down was 24.2%. And in June of 2010, it was 28.9%. So we expect the difference in growth rates and spending in loans to continue over the near term.
Let me move to Slide 11. So this is USCS net interest yield. And on the right, you can see that the yield was 9.3% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 9.7% in the second quarter of '09. This change reflects the implementation of the CARD Act, the pricing actions that we put in place over recent quarters, which were designed to mitigate the impact of the CARD Act, as well as changes in customer behavior.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, the impact from the CARD Act within yield is significant. However, we have worked to mitigate it through repricing activities over recent quarters. Our objective is to migrate back to the historical yield level of 9%. We believe our pricing is appropriate and reflects the necessary revenues for our business. But uncertainty does exist regarding the impact of the look-back or regulatory review required on a go-forward basis.
Staying with the CARD Act, we do not expect the revised late fee rules, which will be implemented in August, to have a material impact. We believe the CARD Act is more significant for us than financial reform due to the nature of our business model, which is not impacted by many aspects of the reform. With regard to financial reform legislation, we support the general principle of financial stability and consumer protection underlying the legislation. However, there clearly are costs associated with it. Many of the aspects will play out over time, giving us the ability to adopt to the changing marketplace.
While other industry participants have discussed details regarding debit pricing risk pursuant to the Durbin amendment, our Charge Card and credit cards are not directly impacted by the potential debit pricing adjustments. With regard to discounting, while merchants have long had the ability to provide discounts for payment of cash and check, the additional ability of merchants to discount price for payments with debit cards versus credit cards creates some additional uncertainty. However, based on our commitment to deliver high-quality customers and services to merchants, we are confident in our ability to adopt to the changing environment.
So let me get back to our second quarter results and move to Slide 12. This is a summary of our revenue performance. So discount revenue is driven by 16% growth in Billed business and is impacted by the higher growth in GNS and increased contra revenue related to co-brand partner investments. Net interest income for 2010 includes all the interest on all loans. 2009 does not include the interest related to those loans that were securitized. On an apples-to-apples basis, 2010 remains the same at $1.188 billion. 2009 would be $1.464 billion, so that would be down about 19% on a managed basis. And that's a result of average loans being down 10% and the yield this year being at 9.3%, compared to 9.7% in '09. Travel commissions and fees are benefiting from greater foreign currency revenues related to higher spending and partly offset by lower delinquency fees. Other revenues, if you were to back out the ICBC gain from last year, last year's number would be 898 and we actually see an increase up to 982 this year. And that's reflected in part by higher GNS partner-related revenues. One last point that I'd make about revenues is that we had 4% growth in revenues sequentially, compared to the first quarter. 
So let's move to Slide 13, which is provision for losses. So the provision for Charge Card and lending both are improving dramatically, based on the improved credit performance that we've seen. '09 provision does not include write-offs related to those loans that were securitized. If we included those, the provision would have increased to $2.420 billion, so that would mean a year-over-year improvement of $1.7 billion. Based on the improvement that we saw in credit performance, reserves declined $50 million in Charge Card and $450 million in lending, for a total reserve release of $500 million. As you will see in a few slides, our reserve coverage remains cautious.
Let's move to Slide 14 and expense performance. So you can see that marketing and promotion is up significantly, up to $802 million, compared with $352 million last year. And I'd point out that last year was unusually low, as we were looking to stay profitable in '09. But the $802 million is above historic levels. So this is very consistent with what we've said in the past; as credit improved, we would drop some to the bottom line and the balance we would invest to drive business growth, some of it to help the near term, but we're also investing for the medium-to-long term. If we look at rewards, it is growing in line with the growth in Billed business. Salaries and benefits are lower by 4%. However, if we adjust for the re-engineering charge that we had in '09, it's up 8%, reflecting merit increases, resumption of the 401(k) match program and profit sharing, as well as higher incentive accruals, partly offset by lower levels of employees. The tax provision and tax rate are up, reflecting higher earnings and a $44 million charge related to valuation of certain deferred tax assets.
Moving to Slide 15. This is now our spending levels over the past three years by quarter. Other than the fourth quarter of '07, when we received our initial Visa settlement payment, the second quarter of 2010 is the highest level on the chart; higher than the historic averages that we saw back in the second and third quarter of '07. If we were to compare our spending in the second quarter of 2010 back to that '07 period, within USCS, we see similar levels of spending on acquisition, but with a shift from proprietary lending to charge and co-brand. In ICS, International Consumer, we're seeing generally higher levels of spend across several areas. And within GMS, we're seeing a substantial increase in the investment and perception of coverage. 
As discussed over the prior quarters, the high level of investment spending reflects the provision benefit as credit is improving. As you can see from the chart, we have the ability to adjust investment levels. As these provision benefits lessen over time, we have the flexibility to move investment spending back towards historic levels.
I'll now move to Slide 16, which is information in terms of our operating expense. As we said to you, you should not look solely at marketing and promotion to judge our investment spending. Operating expense on average grew 8%. Within operating expense, you can see that support functions, which are organizations such as finance and other staff groups, and global services, are growing at a rate below the average. Collection expense is growing at a slower rate as credit improves. Above the dotted line, expense growth is growing faster than the average and there were some administrative costs, such as costs to comply with the new bank holding company and Basel II regulations, but the majority of the higher growth relates to expenses driving revenue growth such as sales force, network initiatives and partner investments.
Moving to Slide 17, this is the USCS Charge Card write-off and past-due rates. And you can see that these metrics are improving and really, the reason that provision is lower. And you can see that the write-off rate and 30 days past-due continued to improve here. 
If we move to Slide 18, this is International Consumer and Global Commercial Card. And again, here, you can see the net loss rate in the 90-day past-due billing ratio continues to perform very well. I'll remind you in the first quarter of 2010, that dark blue section in Q1 2010 was driven by a methodology change to do write-offs at 180 days, instead of the prior practice of 360.
Moving to Slide 19, Charge Card reserve coverage. As you can see from this slide, while credit improves, reserve coverage remains cautious across all segments. The International Consumer and Global Commercial Services 90 day past billings coverage increased in 2010 as we changed reserve methods to be based on a lost-to-bill business ratio. And that was discussed with you last quarter.
If we move to Slide 20, which is the managed lending net write-off rate, you can see that the write-off rate continues to improve in the U.S. and globally. Our metrics are performing substantially better than the industry and they're benefiting from the fact that we moved earlier and more decisively. And it also reflects the high quality of our Cardmember base. Our write-off rate is now down to 6%, and while this is still above historic averages, it represents a significant improvement from the second quarter of 2009.
Next, we're looking at the lending 30-day past due. And again, here we're seeing good improvement both in the U.S. and globally. Delinquency dollars are at $1.6 billion this quarter, compared to $2.7 billion in the second quarter of '09. Again, a significant improvement. 
If we look at Slide 22, here we're looking at roll rate information, which provides insight into why our write-off rates are improving and what might happen in the future. The write-off rate in the current month are a function of the current-to-30 day past-due roll rates five months prior. So the write-off rate in the second quarter relates to the green triangles in the upper left-hand chart. That's the chart on the current-to-30-day past-due. And they were lower than the prior three triangles. Therefore, second quarter write-offs were lower than the first quarter, and this is also dependent on the 30-day past-due-to-write-off rate, bankruptcies and recoveries remaining constant.
You can see that the next three triangles after the green triangles are down slightly. I remind you that we are in uncertain economic times and that the third quarter write-off rate will also depend on the 30-day past-due-to-write-off percentage, bankruptcies and recoveries.
Now the increase we saw sequentially in bankruptcies, the right-hand chart, in the second quarter is in line with the growth in bankruptcies in the industry.
Moving to Slide 23. So this is reserve activity in the second quarter of last year and this year. The left side of '09 doesn't include reserve activity for those receivables that were securitized in '09. In '09, we billed $200 million of credit reserves, based on the fact that credit metrics were deteriorating. And we released $500 million of lending reserves in the second quarter of 2010, as credit continues to improve. The blue box in the top right provides information with respect to the write-off split between securitized and non-securitized loans. So if you were to compare the $1.1 billion of write-offs in the second quarter of '09, it would compare to the $600 million in the second quarter of '10. So while we released reserves, we believe we have an appropriate level of reserve coverage. 
Now we can see that on the next slide, Slide 24. So we've seen credit metrics are improving and we've reduced lending reserves by $450 million in the quarter, based on the inherent risk in the portfolio. But we continue to be cautious in setting credit reserves, as the economic environment remains uneven, housing is stalled and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Our reserve coverage reflects the uncertainty that we see in the environment.
Moving to Slide 25, our capital ratios remain above well capitalized. Our Tier 1 common ratio of 10.7% is strong relative to other U.S. financial institutions. Now as we know, new rules will be written in the near future regarding capital and capital requirements, will be higher than they have been historically. But as you can see from the slide, our capital position today appears to provide a good foundation for those future requirements.
Moving to Slide 26, this is our liquidity. We continue to hold excess cash and readily marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. So we're holding $25 billion and maturities are $20 billion.
Moving to Slide 27, you can see retail deposits increased by $300 million in the second quarter. We didn't need to grow deposits in the quarter to meet funding needs. We did reduce brokered CDs [Certificate of Deposit] by about $1 billion and continue to grow Personal Savings; both CDs and High-Yield Savings balances.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect both general improvement in the economic environment versus last year, and our shift to a more offensive investment posture. Spending growth was relatively strong across our business segments due to both higher absolute spending levels and the weak volumes last year amidst a global economic slowdown. In fact, on an FX-adjusted basis, this was the strongest second quarter in terms of dollars spent.
We also continue to see a sharp divergence between customer spending and borrowing levels. Some of it is due to our strategies and risk-related actions, and some reflects changes in consumer behavior. The net effect of these trends is a lower risk profile for the company, as charge and co-brand spending are a key driver of our volumes and receivable trends.
While these offsetting influences, strong billings growth and lower loan balances challenge overall revenue growth, improving credit trends and well-controlled operating expense have provided the ability to invest in the business at a significant level, while also generating strong earnings. Some of these investments are intended to drive metrics in the near term, but others are allocated towards investments focused on the medium-to-long term success of the company. 
Challenges clearly remain as global economic indicators have weakened somewhat, and sentiment seems to show less strength than most would've expected a few months ago. In the U.S. and many other key markets, job creation remains weak, consumer confidence is volatile, consumer behavior is uncertain and regulatory and legislative initiatives will change aspects of the business going forward. While these factors have us approaching investment and expense commitments with caution, our strong competitive position is yielding high quality results. Spending on our network has been increasing well above the industry average and our credit performance was the best among major card issuers. This indicates to us our decisive and effective credit actions are achieving improved credit performance without stifling spending by credit-worthy Cardmembers. This gives us confidence that our investments and differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to manage through our challenges, capitalize on opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace. Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions."

We have been focused on charge and co-brand, but we've also increased our investment levels compared to historical levels internationally because we see that as an area of growth. We also have increased spending within our merchant business on perceptions of coverage, because often, customers don't perceive that we have the coverage that we actually do. So we want to make sure that we're communicating that clearly. The investments we make, even the ones that get short-term benefit like card acquisition, we actually make those investments because of the lifetime economics that we have from the customers that we acquire. So we're getting benefit now, but we'll get it in the long term. Now in terms of your comment on cards-in-force, I just say that to the extent we acquire charge cards and co-brand, where customers spend at a higher level, it's more expensive to acquire those cards. So we wouldn't expect to have the kind of card growth that we had when we were acquiring large numbers of proprietary lending customers. I'd also say that we're going to give you more detail on this at the Financial Community Meeting that takes place in the first week in August. But just getting back to where we're spending the $900 million, I think you're going to see the benefit of that in the long term, but you're also seeing the benefit of that in our billings numbers. So we do think that the higher volumes that we're achieving compared to last year, and the higher volumes that we're achieving compared to the other networks, are due in part to the higher level of investments that we’ve really made over the last several quarters."

I was wondering if you guys have looked back in time and observed how long $1 of marketing spend translates to the top line benefit.

We also set specific reserves against certain categories where we think it's appropriate. And then we also have a factor that relates to the environment. And our reserve coverage is cautious because of the uncertainty that exists in the environment. Whether you look at unemployment, which is stubbornly high, if you look at consumer confidence, you'll look at where housing is, it's just very uneven. And for that reason, we are remaining cautious as we said, on reserves. If you turn then to your second question about marketing, certain types of marketing, such as card acquisition, we have models that can predict very accurately when we bring in customers, what kind of spending we're going to get and when we're going to get it. And we constantly update those models based on recent activities. Other types of investments, if you go to the other end of the spectrum and you look at Revolution Money, we’re investing in a platform and developing capabilities. When we'll see the revenue from that will probably be some period of time in the future before it has a meaningful impact on our business. So we're really investing across a spectrum where we get some pretty immediate impact, a couple of months, and we see revenue in the top line, and others where it takes a longer period of time. And we believe it's very important to have investments that really go across the spectrum from short term to medium term to long term. So really, it depends on the investment. And then there are certain types of investments where it isn't as crystal-clear. So if you look at certain loyalty programs, we know in aggregate we get good returns on the aggregate loyalty programs we have. If you try to isolate that to one particular, it gets a little more difficult. If you look at marketing and advertising, clearly it’s something we want to be in the marketplace with. But again, measuring that on a precise basis isn’t as easy. So in some investments, you can see exactly when it's going to come; in others, it takes a longer period of time. So there's no formula I can give you to say, “For this dollars of marketing, this is the revenues that you should expect two quarters from now.”"

The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intent, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2009 10-K report, and 2010 first and second quarter 10-Q reports, all already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the third quarter 2010 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will be structured differently than recent call. We will begin with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Chenault, who will provide some perspective on the evolving regulatory environment surrounding the payments industry and the DOJ's anti-trust lawsuit against the company. Then Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of Slides included with the earnings document and provide some summary or a brief summary remarks. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get in to the queue for the Q&A period where both Ken and Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions.
While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible, before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we expect you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken."

As Ron said, given the news that hit this month about the DOJ lawsuit, we're going to break from our norm on today's conference call. So before turning things over to Dan to cover the third quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes sharing my views on the various regulatory and legislative changes that have occurred over the last two years, including the DOJ lawsuit.
I'm going to discuss the issues raised by all of these changes, not just for our company but for the payments industry overall. First, I want to assure you that we're taking the DOJ lawsuit very seriously. However, a number of the changes we're currently seeing are likely to have far greater impact on industry growth, pricing, consumer behavior and merchant relationships than the DOJ suit alone. The lawsuit after all is about steering between credit products. Merchants are already allowed to offer a discount or incentive for customers who paid by cash, check, or debit card, but few do. For bank issued credit products, there is some rate differential between products. For example, for Visa credit products, the difference between their high and low interchange rates is approximately 90 basis points. That's $0.90 on a $100 purchase. All things being equal, it seems questionable were the merchants would disrupt the transaction at the point-of-sale and risk a potential loss of customer goodwill for the sake of a relatively small differential.
For me, the core issue of the lawsuit is a simple one. It's about consumer choice and the right of a customer to select the card they want to use at the point-of-sale. Now I don't believe the government or the merchant should be making this choice. This choice should belong to the customer. And I also believe that we, as a company, like American Express, should have the right to negotiate freely with our merchants on the terms of our contract. Our contract requires to welcome acceptance of our card products and our customers at the point-of-sale. And I don't believe that government intervention in this manner, or in any legal commercial negotiation, will lead to a positive outcome.
Finally, I disagree strongly with the DOJ's assertion that we have market power. That merchants are forced to accept our products. This is not the case, and I believe it's one of the many reasons why we'll win this suit. In terms of merchant acceptance, we have the smallest network, smaller even than Discover who is not a party to this suit. And the DOJ's own anti-trust case against Visa and MasterCard several years ago, they explicitly stated, and the courts agreed, that we did not have market power. Merchants chose to accept AMEX because they understand the value we bring them. Higher spending customers, our superior service and our marketing expertise to help them expand their business. Our actions in the marketplace are all about competition, not coercion. 
Now, as I said earlier, while we certainly take this lawsuit seriously, it's also essential to put into perspective, and in fact, connect the dots against all the changes across the payments and card industry in recent years. Just over the last two years, we've seen the CARD Act, the Dodd-Frank Bill, we've seen Durbin on interchange regarding debit and new regulatory limits on over limit fees. Now this regulation and the legislation has clearly been the most significant in the history of the card industry.  Each clearly reflects the political environment and have turned back towards regulation rather than competition in the banking financial services and card industry. And while they share a common starting point, each one is likely to have a different impact on the market, on the consumer and on different players in the industry.
For example, among other impacts, the CARD Act has changed how some consumer products are priced. On one side, it is simplified terms, conditions and made disclosure more transparent. It has insulated some consumers from higher interest rates and fees if they fall behind on payments. And it for some issuers to stop practices that were misleading or at best, very hard for customers to understand. 
Now on the other side, it may cause some lenders to limit access to credit to all but the most financially secured borrowers. It may increase the overall cost of borrowing from some banks as they offset their inability to charge higher rates for riskier customers. 
It's made the traditional, mass market credit card business less attractive. It's caused some issuers to reorient their sites on the premium sector. And it may cause others to scale back investments in the card business perhaps significantly. 
Now we've noted before that because of our spend base model, we are less impacted by the CARD Act than our bank issuing peers. For example, while we did have a significant impact within our yield because of the Act, we've worked to mitigate it through our repricing activities over recent quarters. The financial impact on many issuing banks from the CARD Act is substantially greater and therefore harder to mitigate. And during the second quarter earnings cycle, a number of our issuing peers disclosed that after mitigation, they would have net income losses of several hundred million dollars as a result of the CARD Act. 
The Dodd-Frank Act, which included Durbin and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, coupled with the Reg E changes to overdraft practices, are likely to have an equally broad impact on issuing banks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will represent continued uncertainty until its approach and regulatory program are clarified. And the combined effects of Durbin and Reg E are easier to see.
So on the one side, it's eliminated high, frequent, overdraft charges to consumers, Reg E. It's eliminated the practice of processing high ticket debit transactions, out of sequence, in order to generate multiple overdraft fees. It may provide merchants a lower interchange and/or transaction fee for debit in certain prepaid cards. And it has given consumers the choice of whether to accept and pay for overdraft protection.
On the other side, it's made the debit card business much less attractive to banks. If banks do end up imposing monthly debit or transaction fees, consumers may shift back to creditor charge products. And it may leave some banks to impose higher fees or rates elsewhere in retail banking to compensate for lost debit revenue. But there are certainly competitive consequences to an action like that. It has the potential to cause a scale back or elimination of rewards programs that are tied to debit products.
So what we have here is bank issuers are saying their debit economics squeezed from two sides. Low interchange rates and lower revenues from overdraft fees. Their previous public disclosures on these changes, again, projected loss revenue in the billions of dollars. Our charge and credit products do compete with debit, so the Durbin pricing adjustments will impact competition among payment products. However, whether into what extent that competition will affect our pricing in revenues will depend on these specific government guidelines and the reaction of consumers to steering. Depending on the Fed's reasonable and proportional debit study comes out, there is the potential for a 50 to 100 basis points reduction in debit interchange fees in current levels. And this could increase the gap between debit and credit rates to approximately 150 to 200 basis points.
With this potential benefit, some merchants may try to steer their customers towards debit, but given this rate differential, it's possible they could fund some discount or incentive to encourage customers to switch to debit. But there is still a question of whether the amount will be significant enough for merchants to disrupt the sales process and risk a potential loss of customer goodwill. 
Now the DOJ case on the surface addresses some of the same issues as Durbin. The terms of its settlement deal with Visa and MasterCard would allow merchants to steer consumers to a lower-priced credit or debit product. For example, if a consumer pulls out a Visa rewards product, the merchant has the right to ask a customer to switch to a Visa MasterCard credit product with a lower rate. The merchant could offer the consumer an incentive for them to switch or they could just ask. 
Now as I mentioned earlier, the gap between a higher cost of Visa and a lower-cost Visa is about 90 basis points. And for context, the AMEX average rate is about 25 basis points higher than Visa and MasterCard's average for credit products or about $0.25 on a $100 transaction. Assuming these differentials remain constant, steering between credit products does not offer a lot of marginal economics for merchants. Particularly when weighed against the potential alienation of good customers and the operational difficulties in implementing these actions at the point of sale.
The irony here is that if the DOJ's case against us were successful, and merchants did engage in steering, it is far more likely for merchants to steer customers to Visa and MasterCard and away from us, thereby making the two dominant players in the industry even more dominant and harming competition. This is why we must defend and win this case and we will. 
So in my view, as far as the DOJ settlement is concerned, it offers a remedy that could push more business to the two largest networks. And if it is put into effect, could push consumers to lower value cards that offer minimal protections, fewer benefits, limited customer service, scaled-back rewards and potentially higher interest rates. So for the card industry, over the last two years, the impact of the legislative, regulatory and DOJ actions can be summarized like this: The CARD Act will have the biggest impact on issuers who have relied heavily on interest income from basic revolving credit products. Issuers who relied heavily on back end and penalty fees and issuers that targeted less creditworthy borrowers. Durbin will have the biggest impact on debit card issuers and potentially on merchants steering to debit from other payment products. Now the DOJ impact is yet to be determined but it is more likely to have a smaller dollar impact on the industry than the CARD Act or Durbin.
Now going forward, I believe the traditional, lend centric models most bank issuers rely on will need to be refashioned. Some issuers will focus on low-cost, no-frills products, others will focus on full-service, high-value alternatives and this segmentation, among issuers, is already underway. Going forward, I believe debit based models will look much different and debit products will likely cost more for consumers to use while offering fewer rewards. But I also believe that despite all the changes, there are some consequences. First, that many consumers and merchants will continue to place a premium on superior value and service and second, that regardless of the industry, merchants, while they will always want to lower price, want high spending customers and value from the payment networks they choose to accept. Merchants know how important it is to treat customers well at the check out counter, particularly in a slow growth economy. And successful merchants will be reluctant to risk losing the goodwill of their customers, absent a real economic upside for them. So while everyone will need to adapt to a new regulatory environment, long-term success within payments will continue to depend on several factors: treating customers well; providing superior service; providing value and return for a fair price. Innovation is going to be critical, and obviously, keeping expenses in line. Superior service and value will continue to earn a premium price from card members and merchants and I believe that we can compete very successfully as a network of choice for high spending Cardmembers. Our strong recent performance has shown that we have been successful in each of these areas. And I remain highly confident in our ability to compete and win in the future.
So with that, let me now turn things over to Dan to go into detail on our third quarter results."
92001,113823895,81041,"American Express Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Okay, thanks, Ken. So I will use our slide package and start with Slide 2, summary of financial performance. So total revenues were up 17%, but the more appropriate line to look at is the managed total revenue line, which was up 5%. That compares with bei",2719,"Okay, thanks, Ken. So I will use our slide package and start with Slide 2, summary of financial performance. So total revenues were up 17%, but the more appropriate line to look at is the managed total revenue line, which was up 5%. That compares with being down 1% in the second quarter. Income is 1,093,000,000, that is the second quarter in a row that we've had income over $1 billion. EPS is at $0.90, a significant improvement from last year. And ROE is now 26%.
Moving to Slide 3, metric performance, Billed business had 14% growth and this is a continuation of the strong growth that we saw in both the first and second quarter. Cards-in-force, proprietary cards were flat with last year. GNS cards increased 3% so total cards are up 1%. Average spending also has continued to be strong with growth of 15%. Loans on a managed basis decreased 6% based on our actions and customer deleveraging. Now this is down less than what we saw in the first and second quarter.  Travel sales increased 21%, driven by Airline spending, which is up 20% as we saw both higher average price and higher number of transactions, both in consumer and corporate.
Looking at Slide 4, Worldwide Billed business, so the bars on this chart reflect the amount of Billed business each month. The lines represent the growth rate both on a reported and an FX basis. So monthly Billed business has been at $58 billion or more since March. The third quarter, we had growth of 14% despite more difficult rollovers as billings were improving last year. Now Billings month to date in October are growing at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 5, which is Billed business by segment, you can see that we had strong Billed business growth across all businesses. Each segment had double-digit growth both on a reported and an FX adjusted basis. GNS continues to have the strongest growth but Global Commercial Services or GCS, continues to grow at above average rates. Again this quarter, it appears that we will gain share in the U.S. as growth in our spending by our customers is notably above the growth we see in our competitors' spending.
Slide 6, Billed business growth by region. So here again, we see strong performance in all regions, particularly, JPAA, which is Asia and Australia. All regions had double-digit growth on an FX adjusted basis so we can see that the growth in business is really very broad-based both by business and by geography.
Moving to Slide 7, so this is spending by product for U.S. consumer and small business. And you can see here, spending by product over the past five quarters. Billed business growth continues to be strongest in charge and co-brand products, consistent with our strategy in investments in premium lending and charge.
Moving to Slide 8, so this is Lending Billed business and managed loan growth. The solid line is Billed business and the dotted line is loans on a managed basis. So loan balance is no longer tracking closely with the increase in spending on lending products as you can see on the chart. Due in part to our actions and part to consumer deleveraging, our actions have included line management reductions, fewer prop lending acquisitions and a significant reductions in balance transfer. And Cardmembers have change their behavior as they are transacting more and revolving less. If you look at our lending trust pay-down rates, in September of '09, pay-down was 25.2% and in September of 2010, it was 29.28%, an increase of over 400 basis points.
So next is Slide 9, this is our net interest yields for USCS, we can get managed loans. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the impact of the CARD Act within yield is significant. However, we have worked to mitigate it through repricing. And you can see on the chart, the increase in yields from the fourth quarter of '08 to the first quarter of '09. We expect yield to migrate back to the historical range of yields in the high 8% or 9% and you can see that this is taking place in the second and third quarter of this year.
Moving to Slide 10, which is revenue performance, discount revenue is up 13% driven by 14% growth in Billed business, partially offset by faster growth in GNS Billed business and higher comps of revenues, including higher cash back rewards and corporate incentive payments. The average discount rate was 2.56%, up two basis points from last year and flat with the second quarter. The increase compared to last year reflects certain pricing initiatives. Going forward, we will likely see an erosion in the average discount rate over time.
Card fees continues to hold and were basically flat with last year. Net interest income should be look at on a managed basis, so we're down 16%, this is a combination of loans being down 6% and a decrease in yield from 10.2% last year to 9.5% in the third quarter of this year. So those are worldwide numbers, the numbers on the prior slide for USCS.
Travel commissions and fees reflect the higher travel sales that we saw earlier. Other revenues, up 13% on a reported basis and that reflects the fact that we have fees on loans that were previously securitized. If you look at it on a managed basis, we're up 4% and that's being driven by higher foreign currency conversion revenue and higher GNS partner related revenues.  Overall, we're up 5%. And while that's not robust, it compares very favorably to the revenue growth that we saw earlier in the year.
Now moving to Slide 11, Charge Card provision improved over $50 million based on improved metrics and lower reserve requirements. If we look at Cardmember loans or lending provision, it has improved dramatically by over $700 million on a GAAP basis, as you can see on the slide. On a managed basis, it's actually $1.2 billion better. And this is due to significantly improved write-off rates, which will result in lower write-off dollars in the quarter and improved 30-day past due levels that translate into lower reserve requirements. Reserves decreased by $548 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
Slide 12, expense performance, marketing promotion is up significantly in the third quarter compared to last year and up from $208 million in the second quarter of this year. This is consistent with what we have said, as credit improved we indicated we would drop some to the bottom line and invest to drive business momentum.
Next is rewards. Now here, if we exclude the benefit in the third quarter of '09 related to a policy change, related to accounts to a 30-day past due, rewards expense increased in line with spending.
Salaries and benefit increased 7%. This reflects merit increases, higher benefit costs and higher incentive compensation. On an employee basis, it's basically flat with last year.
Other operating expense includes, in last year, a benefit related through adjustments on how we accounted for our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. Absent that, it increased 17%, reflecting higher technology related expense, higher T&E and an investments in new business initiatives.
Now income taxes are higher and that is due in part to higher income and part to the fact that we have a higher tax rate. In this quarter it's 33%, in the third quarter of last year, it was 30%. And that really reflects the level of pretax income relative to the recurring permanent differences that we have. So if income is lower, those permanent differences have a larger impact and as income increases, has less of an impact. So a 33% rate is a reasonably normalized rate for our business.
Moving to Slide 13, marketing and promotion expense. As I've mentioned, marketing and promotion is above historic levels as you can see on this chart. We have elevated spending levels across U.S. Consumers and Small business, International Consumer and the Merchant and Network businesses. Within USCS, it's primarily charged and premium co-brand acquisition. In International Consumer it's primarily acquisition and spend stimulation. In the merchant business, it's spending on perceptions of coverage and brand communication. And in GNS, it's contractual payments driven by higher Billings.
Moving to Slide 14, operating expense. So operating expense growth was 12%. Now some portion of that is investment to drive growth of our business and that is above 12%. And a portion is not driving revenues and that's below the 12%. Here we can see that we have significantly higher levels of spending on technology development that supports business growth. New business initiatives including LoyaltyEdge, Revolution Money and Business Insights, as well as GNS partner investments and higher levels of sales force. While below the dotted line, we are controlling non-revenue-generating OpEx.
Moving to Slide 14, now this is Charge Card reserve coverage. Now while Charge Card credit metrics are improving, we haven't maintained appropriate levels of reserves across the U.S. card, international card and Global Commercial Services as you can see from the reserve coverage ratios on this page.
Now on Slide 16, here you're looking at managed lending net write-off rates. And here you can see that managed lending write-off rates have improved dramatically over the last four quarters in both the U.S. and international. In the U.S., in the third quarter, the write-off rate was 5.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the second quarter and 370 basis points improvement compared to last year. Our metric performance is substantially better than the industry.
Next, Slide 17. So this is the managed lending 30-day past due charge. So again, lending 30-day past due also continues to improve both in the U.S. and internationally. These improvements will prove to be beneficial to us as we move forward.
Next is Slide 18. Now here we're providing information for USCS lending related to roll rates and bankruptcy filings. So the current month write-off is a function of the current 30-day past due roll rate five months ago. So the three triangles in the upper left lead to the write-off rate in the third quarter of this year. And you can see that they are lower in the three triangles just before that. So all else being equal, you would expect write-offs in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter, which is what we've seen.
You'll also see that the three triangles following the three dots are lower. So all else being equal, we could see fourth quarter write-offs being lower than the third quarter. You'll also note the 30-day past due to write-off at the bottom left chart is improving slightly. Now bankruptcies on the right, if you took on average of the three quarters in 2010, you can see that they're slightly lower than what we saw in 2009, and this is the number of filings. Two other things to consider is the dollar amount of each filing. And they have been lower this year than in 2009. And the other is the percentage of filings that we've already written off, and that percentage is higher than we saw last year. So all in all, bankruptcy losses are lower than last year.
Now I remind you that these are uncertain economic times and what the write off rate in the fourth quarter will be will depend on the 30-day past due to write-off percentage, bankruptcies and recoveries, well they actually are.
Moving to Slide 19, so this is our lending reserve levels, and it reflects the activity in the third quarter of last year and this year and you can see that the dollar write-offs has improved significantly. So if you look at the chart and look at '09, write-offs were $850 million. This year, they were $810 million, but that includes both the previously securitized and those that are on balance sheet. If we look at this on an apples-to-apples basis, you'd have to add the write-offs related to the securitized receivables last year. They were about $500 million. So the actual comparison is about 1,350,000,000 compared to the 810 million that we had this year.
So the reserve level we have reflect our credit performance and the inherent risk in the portfolio and you can see that we have reduced lending reserves by $560 million.
Next, on Slide 20, we look at lending reserve coverage. And as you saw on the prior slides, credit metrics have been improving and we have reduced reserves based on our methodology. However, we continue to be cautious in setting reserves as the economic environment remains uneven and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Here, you can see the reserve coverage ratios in the U.S. and on a worldwide basis. Our reserve coverage reflects the uncertainty that we see in the environment. 
So next is our capital ratios. While the capital requirements, what they'll actually be is still evolving, our capital position and ratios remain strong, particularly Tier 1 common. And you can see that it has increased from 10.7% in the second quarter to 11.7% in the third quarter. One other thing that I would note is that it's our plan in the fourth quarter to repurchase shares approximately equal to the 15 million shares that we issued under employee programs over the past four quarters in the fourth quarter of this year.
So moving to Slide 22, this is our liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next month of funding requirements. Now the higher than normal level of excess cash is due to the funding maturities in the fourth quarter and the anticipated seasonal increase in the balance sheet associated with higher holiday spending in the fourth quarter.
Now looking at Slide 23, this is our retail deposits.  Now as accounts receivable and loan balances remains relatively consistent with the second quarter levels, we did not have a demands for higher funding levels. So this quarter, we focused on reducing brokerage CDs and continuing to grow direct Personal Savings CDs and high yield savings deposits.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the first half of this year. Spending growth remains strong across all our business segments. In fact, on an FX adjusted basis, this was the strongest quarter ever in terms of dollars spent.  
We also continue to see further improvement in credit trends. Some of this is due to our strategic and risk-related actions. Some reflecting the close recession behavior of consumers.  Even through these trends have contributed to a divergence between consumer spending and borrowing levels, the net effect is a lower risk profile for the company, as charge and co-brand spending are the main driver of volumes and receivable trends.  Managed revenue growth of 5% improved versus prior quarters and outpaced our large industry competitors as strong Cardmember volumes more than offset the impact of lower loan balances and yields.
Importantly, our strong billings growth, improving credit trends and well-controlled operating expense provided an ability to invest in the business at significant levels while also generating strong earnings. Some of these investments are driving metrics and improving revenue comparisons near-term but others are focusing on the medium to long-term success of the company. 
Challenges clearly remain in the U.S. in many other key markets, job creation remains weak, consumer confidence is volatile, consumer behavior is uncertain and regulatory and legislative initiatives are changing aspects of the business going forward. While we are currently investing at historically high levels, these factors have us approaching the future investments and spending commitments with caution. But the bottom line is that our strong competitive position is yielding high-quality results that spending on our network continues to increase well above industry average and our credit performance remains best among major card issuers.
This gives us confidence that our investments and differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to manage through our challenges, capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.
Thanks for listening. Ken and I are now ready to take questions."

It maybe not the level that we had back in '07 because I think the nature of our business is changing somewhat and you can see that we're investing in businesses that are more fee related and that generally will be driven by operating expense. But we will continue to be focused on having the right margins in TTI. So that's something we'll focus on going forward."

And the reality is that I think that certainly rewards are important, it's important to have a diversified rewards program. And it's clear that our competitors and ourselves are investing more in those capabilities, but at the end of the day, what we've been able to demonstrate is that we're getting very good returns from those investments. It's less clear, given the difference between a lend centric and spend centric model, if our competitors, in fact, we'll enjoy the same types of economics. But we've proven that we can impact those levers. The third piece that I think is very important is if we just look at the backdrop of the last 18 months and look at the disproportionate growth that we've been able to generate against our competitors, when in fact, some of our competitors have dramatically increased their marketing and advertising spending, it does not seem to have had a damaging impact, in fact quite the contrary, we have accelerated our growth and our market share improvement. The last piece that I think I would emphasize very strongly is that we have, in fact, made investments, we have concentrated on improving our service quality and our capability of service, both online and offline. It is easy to replicate a feature on a card product. It is much harder to deliver consistently high quality service. And if I go back to the J.D. Power award, frankly, and I won't name names, but if you take a look at the list of issuers, and those who are saying that they're focused on the premium market, some of them in fact are in fifth and sixth and seventh place. And we in fact have won for four years in a row. So one of the things is we clearly understand the causality of segmenting or customer service and providing it. So I think it's a focus, certainly, rewards are important, features are important, services are important but the momentum that we generated over the last year and the fact that, that moment is increasing. So that gives me a lot of confidence going into the Premium segment. But as I said earlier, when I was going through some of the trade-offs, I really do believe that someone who has a lend-centric model, which is most of the traditional bank card issuers, are going to have to substantially reconfigure their business models to compete effectively going forward because they have the impact, some of them of debit, they have the impact of the changes in pricing. And they've got to find some of the formulas that will allow them to really come up with a premium value proposition that resonates with the consumer."

And so going forward, it's likely that you'll see that rewards, as a percentage of revenues, will be slightly higher than we may have seen in the past. And we recognize that and that means that we need to be very focused on operating expense efficiency, which we are, and a combination of all those things, again, I think will provide economics that are very attractive."

And that's why our average spend is four times that of Visa and MasterCard. So I think what's very critical is you got to look at what we call as virtuous circle, that you've got to have a improved value proposition that customers really want, and obviously, then get those customers who will spend more so their value proposition at merchants is enhanced. And in these economic times, we're finding that to be incredibly valuable."

Because you have this double whammy squeeze going on as you have the squeeze going on the issuing side and what the features are going to be and then you have the issue of the potential of a lower interchange rate. So one, at the end of the day, we're not in the debit card business. But the point is that if you review the earnings releases and the statements that I've read from major banks, they're the ones saying that debit will not be as profitable, that they in fact some had said on an individual basis that they're going to lose billions of dollars in revenues. Now the point for us that I think is critical while it's hard to speculate on what the individual impact will be on us, the reality is what's not new news is that we know that merchants don't have to accept our products. And we have to earn a premium rate everyday by providing them with premium value. And as I said earlier, what we have seen, particularly in this environment, is that merchants value spending and that our average spending is three to four times the size of Visa and MasterCard. And they also value, which we are increasingly doing, we are providing them with information, insights, marketing help and all of which we think helped tremendously because we're seeing it that it helps with the acceptance of the card but also is providing us revenues in some of the particular services that we provide. So I think at the end of the day, premium value is at the core of what we do with merchants, and at the end of the day, we face a very competitive marketplace in terms of merchant pricing, I might add not just in the U.S., but all over the world. But I think what we've demonstrated very strongly in a very tough economy is that we continued to succeed and grow because of our ability to compete on value.

The reality is that even with surcharging, our fundamental positioning is the same that we provide substantial incremental value and plus business to merchants.

That was one of the points that I was implying is when it first happened, it certainly took some time for us to adjust, but what we were very encouraged and we saw a very tangible results is that we, in fact, were able to successfully reduce substantially the level of surcharging that was taking place because we were able to not only convince, but demonstrate the plus value that we were bringing to the merchant so the merchant no longer saw the value of surcharge. And so the reality is it exists still in some places but it has been substantially reduced. And again, as we look at our share of billings, our market share has increased which is concrete proof that, obviously, we have been able to successfully deal with surcharging.

But as we said in the earnings release, the investments that we've concentrated on for example, Charge Card and co-brand, are paying off. We are generating those results and you see them in the quality of cards that we've been able to perform. If you go back to the analyst meeting in August, we actually took you through the increase that we were seeing in spending from the new cards that we were bringing on, not just compared to 2009, but compared to previous years. And so what you're really seeing is a partial redirection of our payment strategy where we're focused on more select segments for lending, we're concentrating on premium lending. And Charge Cards, frankly, has become more of a product for the times. Consumers are becoming more disciplined. They're becoming more careful. And at the end of the day, the services, the rewards that we have on those Charge Card products is very appealing to a number of segments. So there, you are seeing relatively quick payback from the investments that we've made over the last year."

So before turning things over to Dan to cover the third qua",2030,"Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining our call today. As Ron said, given the news that hit this month about the DOJ lawsuit, we're going to break from our norm on today's conference call. So before turning things over to Dan to cover the third quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes sharing my views on the various regulatory and legislative changes that have occurred over the last two years, including the DOJ lawsuit.
I'm going to discuss the issues raised by all of these changes, not just for our company but for the payments industry overall. First, I want to assure you that we're taking the DOJ lawsuit very seriously. However, a number of the changes we're currently seeing are likely to have far greater impact on industry growth, pricing, consumer behavior and merchant relationships than the DOJ suit alone. The lawsuit after all is about steering between credit products. Merchants are already allowed to offer a discount or incentive for customers who pay by cash, check, or debit card, but few do. For bank issued credit products, there is some rate differential between products. For example, for Visa credit products, the difference between their high and low interchange rates is approximately 90 basis points. That's $0.90 on a $100 purchase. All things being equal, it seems questionable whether merchants would disrupt the transaction at the point-of-sale and risk a potential loss of customer goodwill for the sake of a relatively small differential.
For me, the core issue of the lawsuit is a simple one. It's about consumer choice and the right of a customer to select the card they want to use at the point-of-sale. Now I don't believe the government or the merchant should be making this choice. This choice should belong to the customer. And I also believe that we, as a company, like American Express, should have the right to negotiate freely with our merchants on the terms of our contract. Our contract requires the welcome acceptance of our card products and our customers at the point-of-sale. And I don't believe that government intervention in this manner, or in any legal commercial negotiation, will lead to a positive outcome.
Finally, I disagree strongly with the DOJ's assertion that we have market power, that merchants are forced to accept our products. This is not the case, and I believe it's one of the many reasons why we'll win this suit. In terms of merchant acceptance, we’re the smallest network, smaller even than Discover who is not a party to this suit. In the DOJ's own anti-trust case against Visa and MasterCard several years ago, they explicitly stated, and the courts agreed, that we did not have market power. Merchants chose to accept Amex because they understand the value we bring them. Higher spending customers, our superior service and our marketing expertise to help them expand their business. Our actions in the marketplace are all about competition, not coercion. 
Now, as I said earlier, while we certainly take this lawsuit seriously, it's also essential to put into perspective, and in fact, connect the dots against all the changes across the payments and card industry in recent years. Just over the last two years, we've seen the CARD Act, the Dodd-Frank bill, we've seen Durbin on interchange regarding debit and new regulatory limits on over limit fees. Now this regulation and the legislation has clearly been the most significant in the history of the card industry.  Each clearly reflects the political environment and have turned back towards regulation rather than competition in the banking, financial services and card industry. And while they share a common starting point, each one is likely to have a different impact on the market, on the consumer and on different players in the industry.
For example, among other impacts, the CARD Act has changed how some consumer products are priced. On one side, it has simplified terms, conditions and made disclosure more transparent. It has insulated some consumers from higher interest rates and fees if they fall behind on payments. And it forced some issuers to stop practices that were misleading or at best, very hard for customers to understand. 
Now on the other side, it may cause some lenders to limit access to credit to all but the most financially secured borrowers. It may increase the overall cost of borrowing from some banks as they offset their inability to charge higher rates for riskier customers. 
It's made the traditional, mass market credit card business less attractive. It's caused some issuers to reorient their sites on the premium sector. And it may cause others to scale back investments in the card business perhaps significantly. 
Now we've noted before that because of our spend base model, we are less impacted by the CARD Act than our bank issuing peers. For example, while we did have a significant impact within our yield because of the Act, we've worked to mitigate it through our repricing activities over recent quarters. The financial impact on many issuing banks from the CARD Act is substantially greater and therefore harder to mitigate. And during the second quarter earnings cycle, a number of our issuing peers disclosed that after mitigation, they would have net income losses of several hundred million dollars as a result of the CARD Act. 

The Dodd-Frank Act, which included Durbin and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, coupled with the Reg E changes to overdraft practices, are likely to have an equally broad impact on issuing banks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will represent continued uncertainty until its approach and regulatory program are clarified. And the combined effects of Durbin and Reg E are easier to see.
So on the one side, it's eliminated high, frequent, overdraft charges to consumers, Reg E. It's eliminated the practice of processing high ticket debit transactions, out of sequence, in order to generate multiple overdraft fees. It may provide merchants a lower interchange and/or transaction fee for debit in certain prepaid cards. And it has given consumers the choice of whether to accept and pay for overdraft protection.
On the other side, it's made the debit card business much less attractive to banks. If banks do end up imposing monthly debit or transaction fees, consumers may shift back to creditor charge products. And it may lead some banks to impose higher fees or rates elsewhere in retail banking to compensate for lost debit revenue. But there are certainly competitive consequences to an action like that. And it has the potential to cause a scale back or elimination of rewards programs that are tied to debit products.
So what we have here is bank issuers are seeing their debit economics squeezed from two sides. Low interchange rates and lower revenues from overdraft fees. Their previous public disclosures on these changes, again, projected loss revenue in the billions of dollars. Our charge and credit products do compete with debit, so the Durbin pricing adjustments will impact competition among payment products. However, whether and to what extent that competition will affect our pricing and revenues will depend on these specific government guidelines and the reaction of consumers to steering. Depending on the Fed's reasonable and proportional debit study comes out, there is the potential for a 50 to 100 basis points reduction in debit interchange fees from current levels. And this could increase the gap between debit and credit rates to approximately 150 to 200 basis points.
With this potential benefit, some merchants may try to steer their customers towards debit, but given this rate differential, it's possible they could fund some discount or incentive to encourage customers to switch to debit. But there is still a question of whether the amount will be significant enough for merchants to disrupt the sales process and risk a potential loss of customer goodwill. 
Now the DOJ case on the surface addresses some of the same issues as Durbin. The terms of its settlement deal with Visa and MasterCard would allow merchants to steer consumers to a lower-price credit or debit product. For example, if a consumer pulls out a Visa rewards product, the merchant has the right to ask a customer to switch to a Visa MasterCard credit product with a lower rate. The merchant could offer the consumer an incentive for them to switch or they could just ask. 
Now as I mentioned earlier, the gap between a higher cost of Visa and a lower cost Visa is about 90 basis points. And for context, the Amex average rate is about 25 basis points higher than Visa and MasterCard's average for credit products or about $0.25 on a $100 transaction. Assuming these differentials remain constant, steering between credit products does not offer a lot of marginal economics for merchants. Particularly when weighed against the potential alienation of good customers and the operational difficulties in implementing these actions at the point of sale.
The irony here is that if the DOJ's case against us were successful, and merchants did engage in steering, it is far more likely for merchants to steer customers to Visa and MasterCard and away from us, thereby making the two dominant players in the industry even more dominant and harming competition. This is why we must defend and win this case, and we will. 
So in my view, as far as the DOJ settlement is concerned, it offers a remedy that could push more business to the two largest networks. And if it is put into effect, could push consumers to lower value cards that offer minimal protections, fewer benefits, limited customer service, scaled-back rewards and potentially higher interest rates. So for the card industry, over the last two years, the impact of the legislative, regulatory and DOJ actions can be summarized like this. The CARD Act will have the biggest impact on issuers who have relied heavily on interest income from basic revolving credit products, issuers who relied heavily on back end and penalty fees and issuers that targeted less creditworthy borrowers. Durbin will have the biggest impact on debit card issuers and potentially on merchants steering to debit from other payment products. Now the DOJ impact is yet to be determined, but it is more likely to have a smaller dollar impact on the industry than the CARD Act or Durbin.
Now going forward, I believe the traditional, lend centric models most bank issuers rely on will need to be refashioned. Some issuers will focus on low-cost, no-frills products, others will focus on full-service, high-value alternatives and this segmentation among issuers is already underway. Going forward, I believe debit based models will look much different and debit products will likely cost more for consumers to use while offering fewer rewards. But I also believe that despite all the changes, there are some constants. First, that many consumers and merchants will continue to place a premium on superior value and service and second, that regardless of the industry, merchants, while they will always want to lower price, want high spending customers and value from the payment networks they choose to accept. Merchants know how important it is to treat customers well at the checkout counter, particularly in a slow growth economy. And successful merchants will be reluctant to risk losing the goodwill of their customers, absent a real economic upside for them. So while everyone will need to adapt to a new regulatory environment, long-term success within payments will continue to depend on several factors: treating customers well; providing superior service; providing value in return for a fair price. Innovation is going to be critical, and obviously, keeping expenses in line. Superior service and value will continue to earn a premium price from card members and merchants and I believe that we can compete very successfully as a network of choice for high spending Cardmembers. Our strong recent performance has shown that we have been successful in each of these areas. And I remain highly confident in our ability to compete and win in the future.
So with that, let me now turn things over to Dan to go into detail on our third quarter results."
92001,113823895,81061,"American Express Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Okay, thanks, Ken. So I will use our slide package and start with Slide 2, summary of financial performance. So total revenues were up 17%, but the more appropriate line to look at is the managed total revenue line, which was up 5%. That compares with bei",2718,"Okay, thanks, Ken. So I will use our slide package and start with Slide 2, summary of financial performance. So total revenues were up 17%, but the more appropriate line to look at is the managed total revenue line, which was up 5%. That compares with being down 1% in the second quarter. Income is $1,093,000,000, that is the second quarter in a row that we've had income over $1 billion. EPS is at $0.90, a significant improvement from last year. And ROE is now 26%.
Moving to Slide 3, metric performance, Billed business had 14% growth and this is a continuation of the strong growth that we saw in both the first and second quarter. Cards-in-force, proprietary cards were flat with last year. GNS cards increased 3% so total cards are up 1%. Average spending also has continued to be strong with growth of 15%. Loans on a managed basis decreased 6% based on our actions and customer deleveraging. Now this is down less than what we saw in the first and second quarter.  Travel sales increased 21%, driven by Airline spending, which is up 20% as we saw both higher average price and higher number of transactions, both in consumer and corporate.
Looking at Slide 4, Worldwide Billed business, so the bars on this chart reflect the amount of Billed business each month. The lines represent the growth rate both on a reported and an FX basis. So monthly Billed business has been at $58 billion or more since March. The third quarter, we had growth of 14% despite more difficult grow overs as billings were improving last year. Now Billings month to date in October are growing at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 5, which is Billed business by segment, you can see that we had strong Billed business growth across all businesses. Each segment had double-digit growth both on a reported and an FX adjusted basis. GNS continues to have the strongest growth, but Global Commercial Services or GCS, continues to grow at above average rates. Again this quarter, it appears that we will gain share in the U.S. as growth in our spending by our customers is notably above the growth we see in our competitors' spending.
Slide 6, Billed business growth by region. So here again, we see strong performance in all regions, particularly, JPAA, which is Asia and Australia. All regions had double-digit growth on an FX adjusted basis so we can see that the growth in business is really very broad-based both by business and by geography.
Moving to Slide 7, so this is spending by product for U.S. consumer and small business. And you can see here, spending by product over the past five quarters. Billed business growth continues to be strongest in charge and co-brand products, consistent with our strategy in investments in premium lending and charge.
Moving to Slide 8, so this is Lending, Billed business and managed loan growth. The solid line is Billed business and the dotted line is loans on a managed basis. So loan balances are no longer tracking closely with the increase in spending on lending products as you can see on the chart. Due in part to our actions and part to consumer deleveraging, our actions have included line management reductions, fewer prop lending acquisitions and significant reductions in balance transfer. And Cardmembers have changed their behavior as they are transacting more and revolving less. If you look at our lending trust pay-down rates, in September of '09, pay-down was 25.2% and in September of 2010, it was 29.28%, an increase of over 400 basis points.
So next is Slide 9, this is our net interest yields for USCS, we can get managed loans. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the impact of the CARD Act within yield is significant. However, we have worked to mitigate it through repricing. And you can see on the chart, the increase in yields from the fourth quarter of '08 to the first quarter of '09. We expect yield to migrate back to the historical range of yields in the high 8% or 9% and you can see that this is taking place in the second and third quarter of this year.
Moving to Slide 10, which is revenue performance, discount revenue is up 13% driven by 14% growth in Billed business, partially offset by faster growth in GNS Billed business and higher contra-revenues, including higher cash back rewards and corporate incentive payments. The average discount rate was 2.56%, up two basis points from last year and flat with the second quarter. The increase compared to last year reflects certain pricing initiatives. Going forward, we will likely see an erosion in the average discount rate over time.
Card fees continued to hold and were basically flat with last year. Net interest income should be looked at on a managed basis, so we're down 16%, this is a combination of loans being down 6% and a decrease in yield from 10.2% last year to 9.5% in the third quarter of this year. So those are worldwide numbers, the numbers on the prior slide for USCS.
Travel commissions and fees reflect the higher travel sales that we saw earlier. Other revenues, up 13% on a reported basis and that reflects the fact that we have fees on loans that were previously securitized. If you look at it on a managed basis, we're up 4% and that's being driven by higher foreign currency conversion revenue and higher GNS partner-related revenues.  Overall, we're up 5%. And while that's not robust, it compares very favorably to the revenue growth that we saw earlier in the year.
Now moving to Slide 11, Charge Card provision improved over $50 million based on improved metrics and lower reserve requirements. If we look at Cardmember loans or lending provision, it has improved dramatically by over $700 million on a GAAP basis, as you can see on the slide. On a managed basis, it's actually $1.2 billion better. And this is due to significantly improved write-off rates, which will result in lower write-off dollars in the quarter and improved 30-day past due levels that translate into lower reserve requirements. Reserves decreased by $548 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
Slide 12, expense performance, marketing promotion is up significantly in the third quarter compared to last year and up from $208 million in the second quarter of this year. This is consistent with what we have said, as credit improved we indicated we would drop some to the bottom line and invest to drive business momentum.
Next is rewards. Now here, if we exclude the benefit in the third quarter of '09 related to a policy change, related to accounts that were 30-day past due, rewards expense increased in line with spending.
Salaries and benefit increased 7%. This reflects merit increases, higher benefit costs and higher incentive compensation. On an employee base, it's basically flat with last year.
Other operating expense includes, in last year, a benefit related to an adjustment to how we accounted for our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. Absent that, it increased 17%, reflecting higher technology related expense, higher T&E and investments in new business initiatives.
Now income taxes are higher and that is due in part to higher income and part to the fact that we have a higher tax rate. In this quarter it's 33%, in the third quarter of last year, it was 30%. And that really reflects the level of pretax income relative to the recurring permanent differences that we have. So when income is lower, those permanent differences have a larger impact and as income increases, has less of an impact. So a 33% rate is a reasonably normalized rate for our business.
Moving to Slide 13, marketing and promotion expense. As I've mentioned, marketing and promotion is above historic levels as you can see on this chart. We have elevated spending levels across U.S. Consumers and Small Business, International Consumer and the Merchant and Network businesses. Within USCS, it's primarily charged and premium co-brand acquisition. In International Consumer it's primarily acquisition and spend stimulation. In the merchant business, it's spending on perceptions of coverage and brand communication. And in GNS, it's contractual payments driven by higher Billings.
Moving to Slide 14, operating expense. So operating expense growth was 12%. Now some portion of that is investments to drive growth of our business, and that is above 12%. And a portion is not driving revenues, and that's below the 12%. Here we can see that we have significantly higher levels of spending on technology development that supports business growth. New business initiatives including LoyaltyEdge, Revolution Money and Business Insights, as well as GNS partner investments and higher levels of sales force. While below the dotted line, we are controlling non-revenue-generating OpEx.
Moving to Slide 14, now this is Charge Card reserve coverage. Now while Charge Card credit metrics are improving, we haven't maintained appropriate levels of reserves across the U.S. card, international card and Global Commercial Services as you can see from the reserve coverage ratios on this page.
Now on Slide 16, here you're looking at managed lending net write-off rates. And here you can see that managed lending write-off rates have improved dramatically over the last four quarters in both the U.S. and international. In the U.S., in the third quarter, the write-off rate was 5.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the second quarter and 370 basis points improvement compared to last year. Our metric performance is substantially better than the industry.
Next, Slide 17. So this is the managed lending 30-day past due chart. So again, lending 30-day past due also continues to improve both in the U.S. and internationally. These improvements will prove to be beneficial to us as we move forward.
Next is Slide 18. Now here we're providing information for USCS lending related to roll rates and bankruptcy filings. So the current month write-off is a function of the current to 30-day past due roll rate five months ago. So the green triangles in the upper left chart lead to the write-off rate in the third quarter of this year. And you can see that they are lower in the three triangles just before that. So all else being equal, you would expect write-offs in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter, which is what we've seen.
You'll also see that the three triangles following the three dots are lower. So all else being equal, we could see fourth quarter write-offs being lower than the third quarter. You'll also note the 30-day past due to write-off, the bottom left chart, is improving slightly. Now bankruptcies on the right, if you took on average of the three quarters in 2010, you can see that they're slightly lower than what we saw in 2009, and this is the number of filings. Two other things to consider is the dollar amount of each filing. And they have been lower this year than in 2009. And the other is the percentage of filings that we've already written off, and that percentage is higher than we saw last year. So all in all, bankruptcy losses are lower than last year.
Now I’d remind you that these are uncertain economic times and what the write off rate in the fourth quarter will be will depend on the 30-day past due to write-off percentage, bankruptcies and recoveries, what they actually are.
Moving to Slide 19, so this is our lending reserve levels, and it reflects the activity in the third quarter of last year and this year, and you can see that the dollar write-offs has improved significantly. So if you look at the chart and look at '09, write-offs were $850 million. This year, they were $810 million, but that includes both the previously securitized and those that were on balance sheet. If we look at this on an apples-to-apples basis, you'd have to add the write-offs related to the securitized receivables last year. They were about $500 million. So the actual comparison is about $1,350,000,000 compared to the $810 million that we had this year.
So the reserve level we have reflect our credit performance and the inherent risk in the portfolio and you can see that we have reduced lending reserves by $560 million.
Next, on Slide 20, we look at lending reserve coverage. And as you saw on the prior slides, credit metrics have been improving and we have reduced reserves based on our methodology. However, we continue to be cautious in setting reserves as the economic environment remains uneven and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Here, you can see the reserve coverage ratios in the U.S. and on a worldwide basis. Our reserve coverage reflects the uncertainty that we see in the environment. 
So next is our capital ratios. And so while the capital requirements, what they'll actually be is still evolving, our capital position and ratios remain strong, particularly Tier 1 common. And you can see that it has increased from 10.7% in the second quarter to 11.7% in the third quarter. One other thing that I would note is that it's our plan in the fourth quarter to repurchase shares approximately equal to the 15 million shares that we issued under employee programs over the past four quarters in the fourth quarter of this year.
So moving to Slide 22, this is our liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next month of funding requirements. Now the higher than normal level of excess cash is due to the funding maturities in the fourth quarter and the anticipated seasonal increase in the balance sheet associated with higher holiday spending in the fourth quarter.
Now looking at Slide 23, this is our retail deposits.  Now as accounts receivable and loan balances remains relatively consistent with the second quarter levels, we did not have demands for higher funding levels. So this quarter, we focused on reducing brokerage CDs and continuing to grow direct Personal Savings CDs and high yield savings deposits.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the first half of this year. Spending growth remains strong across all our business segments. In fact, on an FX adjusted basis, this was the strongest quarter ever in terms of dollars spent.  
We also continue to see further improvement in credit trends. Some of this is due to our strategic and risk-related actions. Some reflecting the post-recession behavior of consumers.  Even through these trends have contributed to a divergence between consumer spending and borrowing levels, the net effect is a lower risk profile for the company, as charge and co-brand spending are the main driver of our volumes and receivable trends.  Managed revenue growth of 5% improved versus prior quarters and outpaced our large industry competitors as strong Cardmember volumes more than offset the impact of lower loan balances and yields.
Importantly, our strong billings growth, improving credit trends and well-controlled operating expense provided an ability to invest in the business at significant levels while also generating strong earnings. Some of these investments are driving metrics and improving revenue comparisons near-term but others are focusing on the medium to long-term success of the company. 
Challenges clearly remain in the U.S. in many other key markets, job creation remains weak, consumer confidence is volatile, consumer behavior is uncertain and regulatory and legislative initiatives are changing aspects of the business going forward. While we are currently investing at historically high levels, these factors have us approaching the future investments and spending commitments with caution. But the bottom line is that our strong competitive position is yielding high-quality results that spending on our network continues to increase well above industry average and our credit performance remains best among major card issuers.
This gives us confidence that our investments and differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to manage through our challenges, capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.
Thanks for listening. Ken and I are now ready to take questions."

But as we've said, as credit improved, we were going to continue to invest. And so credit continued to improve, Billed business continued to be very strong and so we actually elevated marketing spend to a somewhat higher that you saw in this quarter. And what you see in operating expense as what we said and the reason -- I think we provide the new bubble chart that we've had for a couple of quarters, is that investments are not solely marketing and promotion. Certainly, marketing and promotion is one aspect of our investments, in terms of acquiring customers and stimulating spending with existing customers. But investments also include being on the right capabilities, having the right talent to move forward with our new business initiatives and it also includes investing in higher sales force for both our Merchant business and our Commercial business. So I think the increase that you're seeing in operating expense is a reflection of that. So as long as we have strength in the business, we'll continue to invest at higher levels."

And the reality is that I think that certainly rewards are important, it's important to have a diversified rewards program. And it's clear that our competitors and ourselves are investing more in those capabilities, but at the end of the day, what we've been able to demonstrate is that we're getting very good returns from those investments. It's less clear, given the difference between a lend centric and spend centric model, if our competitors, in fact, will enjoy the same types of economics. But we've proven that we can impact those levers. The third piece that I think is very important is if we just look at the backdrop of the last 18 months and look at the disproportionate growth that we've been able to generate against our competitors, when in fact, some of our competitors have dramatically increased their marketing and advertising spending, it does not seem to have had a damaging impact, in fact quite the contrary, we have accelerated our growth and our market share improvement. The last piece that I think I would emphasize very strongly is that we have, in fact, made investments, we have concentrated on improving our service quality and our capability of service, both online and offline.
It is easy to replicate a feature on a card product. It is much harder to deliver consistently high quality service. And if I go back to the J.D. Power award, frankly, and I won't name names, but if you take a look at the list of issuers, and those who are saying that they're focused on the premium market, some of them in fact are in fifth and sixth and seventh place. And we in fact have won for four years in a row. So one of the things is we clearly understand the causality of segmenting our customer service and providing it. So I think it's a focus, certainly, rewards are important, features are important, services important but the momentum that we generated over the last year and the fact that, that moment is increasing. So that gives me a lot of confidence going into the Premium segment. But as I said earlier, when I was going through some of the trade-offs, I really do believe that someone who has a lend-centric model, which is most of the traditional bank card issuers, are going to have to substantially reconfigure their business models to compete effectively going forward because they have the impact, some of them of debit, they have the impact of the changes in pricing. And they've got to find some of the formulas that will allow them to really come up with a premium value proposition that resonates with the consumer."

And so going forward, it's likely that you'll see that rewards, as a percentage of revenues, will be slightly higher than we may have seen in the past. And we recognize that and that means that we need to be very focused on operating expense efficiency, which we are, and a combination of all those things, again, I think will provide economics that are very attractive."

And that's why our average spend is four times that of Visa and MasterCard. So I think what's very critical is you got to look at what we call this virtuous circle, that you've got to have a improved value proposition that customers really want, and obviously, then get those customers who will spend more so their value proposition at merchants is enhanced. And in these economic times, we're finding that to be incredibly valuable."

Becaus",398,"Yes, look, the point I'm making is that if you go through debit, and just don't listen to me, in fact, as you go through the pronouncements from a range of banks, what they're saying is that their revenues are being impacted by billions of dollars. Because you have this double whammy squeeze going on is you have the squeeze going on the issuing side and what the features are going to be and then you have the issue of the potential of a lower interchange rate. So one, at the end of the day, we're not in the debit card business. But the point is that if you review the earnings releases and the statements that I've read from major banks, they're the ones saying that debit will not be as profitable, that they in fact, some have said on an individual basis that they're going to lose billions of dollars in revenues. Now the point for us that I think is critical while it's hard to speculate on what the individual impact will be on us, the reality is what's not new news is that we know that merchants don't have to accept our products. And we have to earn a premium rate every day by providing them with premium value. And as I said earlier, what we have seen, particularly in this environment, is that merchant’s value spending and that our average spending is three to four times the size of Visa and MasterCard. And they also value, which we are increasingly doing, we are providing them with information, insights, marketing help and all of which we think help tremendously because we're seeing it that it helps with the acceptance of the card but also is providing us revenues in some of the particular services that we provide. So I think at the end of the day, premium value is at the core of what we do with merchants, and at the end of the day, we face a very competitive marketplace in terms of merchant pricing, I might add not just in the U.S., but all over the world. But I think what we've demonstrated very strongly in a very tough economy is that we’ve continued to succeed and grow because of our ability to compete on value. And I have no doubt that, that will continue to be the case in the U.S."

But at the end of the day, if you look at our fee services strategy, we are offering fee services to our card customers, we're offering fee services to merchants, we're offering fee services to non-cardmembers. And so I think we have a lot of options and the other point that I would make is with our enterprise growth group, under Dan Shulman, we'll be talking with you in the weeks and months to come about the growth opportunities there. And I would say that the vast majority of those growth opportunities are not related to impacts from the CARD Act. All that said, I want to reinforce, even in the CARD Act, we have a fundamental difference because of our spend-centric model against a lend-centric model that were less reliant on spread revenue and back end fees. That is a major difference in our model and why I think we've been able to navigate through those changes in a way that has put us in a better competitive position than the traditional bank card issuers."

And so that's why we're in a situation where Australia is generating good growth and good financials. Now I would add that didn't happen overnight. We had to adjust to those changes. But I think what we were able to demonstrate is that we were able to adjust and actually create not only a viable business, but in fact, a very well-performing business that has gained profitable market share over the last several years."

But over the time since the implementation of Australia's rules, the surcharge differential has been narrowing. And other than the qualitative that it's been narrowing that we've heard from you in the past, is there any sort of numerical evidence that you can share with us that shows that American Express has taken on Visa and MasterCard with regards to parity and at the point of sale with merchants?"

The reality is that even with surcharging, our fundamental positioning is the same that we provide substantial incremental value and plus business to merchants. So we have been successful and in fact, pushing back surcharging. That was one of the points that I was implying is when it first happened, it certainly took some time for us to adjust, but what we were very encouraged and we saw very tangible results is that we, in fact, were able to successfully reduce substantially the level of surcharging that was taking place because we were able to not only convince, but demonstrate the plus value that we were bringing to the merchant so the merchant no longer saw the value of surcharging. And so the reality is it exists still in some places but it has been substantially reduced. And again, as we look at our share of billings, our market share has increased which is concrete proof that, obviously, we’ve been able to successfully deal with surcharging. So it goes back to this fundamental point that the premium value positioning and premium value in your cards and premium value for your merchant really does work in the marketplace."

But as we said in the earnings release, the investments that we've concentrated on for example, Charge Card and co-brand, are paying off. We are generating those results and you see them in the quality of cards that we've been able to perform. If you go back to the analyst meeting in August, we actually took you through the increase that we were seeing in spending from the new cards that we were bringing on, not just compared to 2009, but compared to previous years. And so what you're really seeing is a partial redirection of our payment strategy where we're focused on more select segments for lending, we're concentrating on premium lending. And Charge Card, frankly, has become more of a product for the times. Consumers are becoming more disciplined. They're becoming more careful. And at the end of the day, the services, the rewards that we have on those Charge Card products is very appealing to a number of segments. So there, you are seeing relatively quick payback from the investments that we've made over the last year."
