As many of you will be aware, I have been elected IFF’s new Chairman and CEO effective no later than the end of the first quarter; that is the first quarter of 2010. While I am still finishing off my current commitments to Ansell and its shareholders, I want to take a moment to make some introductory comments today.
I’d like to start off by saying I am very excited to have the opportunity to join the wonderful IFF team. I have been on the board for over a year now and have also been able to meet the top 40, 50 Senior Managers in our global organization. What I have seen has impressed me, as the team is passionate and committed to our customers and their needs. We have a very good line of sight on current and future consumer needs that are required to deliver sustainable growth.
IFF has weathered the global economic crisis relatively well, and has emerged focused and stronger on a number of elements with the ability to further improve all attributes of our business. I am also pleased with the strong leadership that the executive team has shown over this period of transition. In a challenging economic environment they have worked as a strong team to make tough decisions and achieve fundamental improvements in our business, which has resulted in a stronger foundation, which will support a brighter future for our company. I would like to thank them and all of their teams for all they have accomplished during this transition period. They have done a terrific job of remaining focused to drive the improved performance over the second half of 2009.
Now I know that many of you are anxious to hear my thought on the future direction of the company and how that might be different, if at all, from what has been communicated to you in the past. You can appreciate that I cannot go into any specific details at this time; however, I will say that the board and I have been aligned with the strategies that are in place and working today. Of course, I will certainly look to work with the collective IFF team once I am on board to pressure test our strategies and all that we do in order to ensure that we are operating to the best of our ability. Over time we will, I am sure, evaluate other options. We will consider what if strategies and examine other growth avenues. In short, do what all good management teams do.
IFF has tremendous capabilities and research, consumer insight and creativity, all attributes that provide our customers with winning products, which translates into profitable growth for IFF. These capabilities when combined with the passion and the commitment of our talented workforce and our diverse geographic and product portfolio position will allow us to create long-term value for our customers, for our employees, and of course for our shareholders. I will continue to support and lead IFF through my role as Non-Executive Chairman.
In today’s call, I will let our key senior executives explain our performance and review the key issues in 2010. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman.

Before turning it over to Hernan and Nicolas, I will give you some insights on the performance of our business units.

Before turning it over to Hernan and Nicolas, I will give you some insights on the performance of our business units. I would like to provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter performance and some perspective on 2009 results.
Looking at our quarterly results, the improved trends in our performance reported in the third quarter continued through the fourth. Our worldwide local currency sales again grew 2% plus year over year in Q4 as the commercial environment continued to show improvement versus the first half of 2009.
The growth in the top line when combined with continued discipline in cost management supported a substantial improvement in margin as operating profit margin improved 310 basis points year over year. I feel it is important to note that roughly 100 basis points of this improvement was related to incremental R&D credits that our finance team realized through a collective effort over the course of the year.
Given the success of these efforts and the resulting magnitude of these credits in 2009, we felt it was prudent to become more in line with current reporting practices and revise these credits from income tax expense to operational expenses. It is also important to note that this had no impact on our net income; regardless, an integral part of our improved margin has been the continued discipline management of controllable costs. In Q4, we again demonstrated our ability to improve operational performance while continuing to support key growth initiative in each of our businesses. The end result allows us to report adjusted Q4 EPS growth of plus 26%.
Turning to our full-year performance; it is clear that 2009 turned out to be a tale of two halves. In the first half, our financial performance reflected the difficult operating environment. Sales were impacted by the economic environment and as such, our local currency sales were down 3% versus the prior year. This was due largely to a sharp falloff in Fine Fragrance sales as well as declines in Fragrance Ingredients that Nicolas will discuss shortly.
During the first half, we also experienced a dramatic rise in raw material costs, which had a large impact on gross margin. And of course, the year over year strengthening of the US dollar versus the first half of 2008 had a significant impact on our P&L. The resulting pressure on margin was strong.
While the financial performance was disappointing, the company took strong actions in the first half to mitigate the impacts of these issues, taking pricing at the beginning of the year and initiating strong cost control measures. These actions help to improve results in the second half and when combined with an easing of headwinds, drove a substantial improvement in performance. Specifically, worldwide local currency sales turned positive growing 2% plus year over year, 5 percentage points higher than the first half.
While raw material costs remained higher than year-ago prices in the second, we did see an easing of these cost increases over the second half of the year. Consequently, our pricing actions, margin recovery and cost control initiatives, and restructuring efforts were able to drive an improving picture over the second half of the year. Both, gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin improved in the second half versus the year-ago period. Gross margin improved 60 basis points to 40.5% in the second half 2009 versus the comparable year-ago period and we managed to deliver 150 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement in the second half of 2009 versus the comparable period last year.
A weakening dollar versus the year-ago comparable also supported improved results for sales and margin. The combination of this improved operational performance in the second half and an improved foreign exchange environment as well as some below-the-line leverage drove bottom line results in the second half of the year.
Adjusted EPS in the second half grew 16% year over year, the yearly recovering of the weakening realized in the first half. As we head into 2010 and left out 2009, it is important to note that 2009 was, indeed, this year of two halves. On the surface, our full-year financial performance did not show a full picture of the progress we made in 2009. It is important to understand the momentum that was seen in the second half as it is an important element into how we evaluate (inaudible).
As our strategic initiatives continue to gain traction and we adapt to an ever-changing economy, we believe we are well positioned to return to local currency sales growth and improve on our overall profitability in 2010.
I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances will provide an update on the Fragrance business.

As Kevin previously noted, it is clear that the operating environment in the second half improved greatly versus the first half of 2009. For the second consecutive quarter, the Fragrance business unit has posted solid local currency sales growth. In Q4, local currency sales grew 4% year over year, as accelerated pace of new wins in all categories drove performance.
In the fourth quarter, Fine Fragrance and Beauty Care trends continued to improve. Local currency sales decreased 1%, the smallest decline of 2009, as weakness in Fine Fragrance offset strong double-digit growth in Beauty Care. Fine Fragrance did improve; however, it remained under pressure as strong new win performance globally was mitigated by market inflection in the developed markets.
Within Beauty Care, toiletries and hair care posted strong double-digit growth driven by new win performance in greater Asia and Latin America. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we have seen accelerated growth in the Beauty Care category. Our success can be credited to a longstanding regional expertise and continued investment in consumer insights within the key emerging markets. This investment and category expertise are the primary drivers behind overall market growth and greater momentum.
For the full year, Fragrance and Beauty Care sales declined 8% as a result of sharp declines in retail consumption as well as supply chain contraction in North America and Europe in the Fine Fragrance business. Despite challenging market conditions, our Fragrance team was able to successfully maintain our share position while improve our position for 2010 as new win performance was at record levels. I am very pleased and proud of the significant progress this team was able to accomplish.
Functional Fragrance continued to perform very well growing 6% in local currency in the fourth quarter. This performance was once again driven by strong Personal Wash growth and new product wins and volume gained in Fabric Care. It is important to note that Functional Fragrance performance improved every quarter since June 1, finishing the year with 5% growth globally. This reflects our continued commitment to this category and the investment in consumer insight and talents made over the past few years to strengthen our position.
One area of incremental success that I would like to highlight is the technology of fragrance encapsulation for Fabric Care. For the full year, encapsulation represented a loss [ph] component of our growth and was one of the driving forces of our overall market growth level.
In the fourth quarter, Fragrance Ingredients sales also improved, as local currency sales increased 7%, the best performance of 2009. This was driven by underlying improvement in customer demand as we leveraged robust ingredient portfolio to deliver value innovation to our customers. For the full year, Fragrance Ingredients sales were 2%, primarily due to erosion in the Fine Fragrance category and customer destocking in the first half of 2009.
Looking at our geographic breakdown of sales; accelerated growth in the emerging markets once again drove our improvements. In Greater Asia and LATAM, new wins and increased demand from both global and regional customers continued to drive results. The European markets, Brazil, Russia, India and China continued to drive growth in all categories. In this market, Hair Care, Fabric Care and Personal Wash are driving impressive double-digit results in the fourth quarter and full-year 2009.
As evident by our performance, the investments we have made throughout the year combined with our historical human [ph] understanding and our presence of over 50 years in this market have allowed us to deliver above market growth.
From a profitability standpoint, adjusted operating profit increased by 19% or $8 million to $51 million, excluding a $3 million charge related to our previously-announced European facility’s virtualization. The improvement was driven by incremental R&D credit that Kevin noted earlier in the presentation. As a result, adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 16.3%. Excluding the impact of the R&D credit, operating profit increased $2 million year over year, as higher pricing and continued margin improvement initiatives more than offset unfavorable mix, higher input costs and higher incentive compensation expense.
As we look at 2010, the recent business momentum has provided us with some optimism. The progress achieved in 2009 as well as our strategic commitment to more aligned fragrance organizations has allowed us to strengthen our consumer expertise across every region and through all categories. When combined with R&D innovation initiatives, we are well positioned to deliver winning in consumer preferred fragrances to our customers that will increase retail and global market share and create greater productivity [ph].
I am now happy to introduce Hernan Vaisman, our Global President of Flavors.

Local currency sales in the fourth quarter increased 1% over the comparable 2008 period, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of local currency growth. Growth can be attributed to a solid performance in Greater Asia as higher volumes and new wins in Beverage and Dairy drove results. In North America, local currency sales remained constant as the strong performance in Beverage was offset by weakness in Dairy. Looking at EAME, local currency sales were down 1% year over year, similar to North America, a very strong performance in Beverage was offset by weakness in Confectionery and Savory. Sales in Latin America were mixed.
As we previously discussed, a loss of non-strategic business continued to impact results. In Great Asia, local currency sales were up 5% as new win performance and solid demand in Beverage and Dairy drove results. In addition, Beverage results were positive as previously discussed customer specific volume weakness or inventory destocking was eliminated. I’d also note that the underlying growth during the quarter was stronger than our final reported figures. We did experience lower sales shipment at year end as it appeared that some of our customers conservatively managed their inventory levels. This trend has reversed itself in the first few weeks of 2010 and we are expecting growth to return close to normal levels in quarter one.
On a full-year basis, local currency sales increased 2% plus. Greater Asia, Latin America and North America delivered solid growth resulting from new wins and price increases that more than offset weak economic conditions. Local currency sales in Europe remained constant as the economic slowdown and inventory reductions by our customers impacted our results.
In summary, I continue to be pleased with underlying demand trend behind our local currency sales performance. As we have in previous years, the Flavor teams posted solid local currency sales growth despite adverse economic conditions. The emerging markets once again are driving our results as we made great improvement in the Savory and Dairy categories. Complementing the success and together with our Fragrance team, we opened three new state-of-the-art facilities in Shanghai, China; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Moscow, Russia, positioning IFF to better serve these key growth markets.
As we look at our cost structure, margin recovery efforts including price increases, cost discipline and improved operating efficiencies drove improvement. More specifically, gross margin percentage in Q4 improved approximately 190 basis points year over year. This helped support the Flavors operating profit margin as it increased by 340 basis points year over year to 17.4% in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect local currency sales to be positive once again in 2010. While we are entering Q1, we have started the quarter in a positive note. Consistent with the second half result, we expect to see solid local currency sale growth that when combined with our continued focus on cost control initiatives should result in continued margin improvement. I am pleased with the performance of our Flavor business in 2009.
Looking ahead, our vision to create differentiation and brand value for our customers remains unchanged. We continue to support our customers' brands through brand superiority that will ensure that IFF Flavors delivers on its strategic intent to gain market share and expand margins.
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin.

Looking at the chart, it is now clear that Q2 represented an inflection point in our industry. It is encouraging to note that our underlying trends in the categories continued to either improve or remain firmly positive in Q4, and as a result, we finished the year with Flavors, Functional Fragrances and Fragrance Ingredients categories all recording positive local currency sales growth in Q4.
While Fine and Beauty Care remained negative in Q4, it is clear that weakness in the Fine Fragrance category continues to dissipate. The key takeaway here is that there has been a marked improvement across the board reflected in our second performance. Fine Fragrance remains the only business that has not returned to positive growth territory; however, we are continuing to win in this profitable category by realizing a high percentage of new wins. We remain cautiously optimistic for this part of our business going forward.
I would like to cover up on the other key drivers of our financial performance, specifically input costs, research, selling and administrative costs or what we call RSA and currency. Turning to input costs, we continue to see year-over-year increases in the P&L driven primarily by the fluctuations in raw material costs. In the fourth quarter, our input cost increases represented a 2% increase in our cost of goods.
As communicated earlier in the year, we did expect this cost increase to moderate throughout the balance of the year. This did happen as input cost increases versus the year-ago period were less than what we had seen in the first three quarters of 2009. However, our input cost compensation was mixed; and our Flavors business unit, input cost prices were down as we finished working through our higher cost inventories.
In the Fragrance business unit, we have once again experienced a rise in input costs in Q4 versus the year-ago period as the mix of the business from a geographic and segment basis resulted in the use of higher cost inventories in the fourth quarter. Despite the small increase in Q4, we did realize gross margin expansion plus 40 basis points for the second consecutive quarter as margin recovery efforts, including pricing, manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives offset the raw material cost increase.
Looking ahead to 2010, we continue to see our current purchases of raw materials at lower price levels. So it appears that this favorable trend will continue regardless input cost driven by the cost of raw materials will remain in levels that are above 2007 and 2008, prior to the accelerated increases seen in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009.
From an overhead cost standpoint, we continued to improve our cost structure. RSA expenses decreased $3 million year over year. Excluding the impact of currency, RSA cost was down $9 million year over year reflecting incremental R&D related credits, benefits of previously announced restructuring and continued cost management discipline. If we exclude the benefit of the R&D credits, RSA in constant currencies still declined $3 million versus the fourth quarter of 2008.
Within RSA, R&D expenses as percentage of sales declined to 8.1% of sales in 2009 compared to 9.6% last year, driven by the incremental R&D credits, a more focused approach to investments, and strict cost control. I am very pleased with the way our organization has responded to the pressures as we faced over the course of 2009. For the year, adjusted RSA expenses decreased $24 million year over year driven by the impact of the incremental R&D credits, ongoing cost reduction efforts, and the effects of a strong US dollar. If we exclude the positive impact of currency, RSA still declined $11 million, driven by reductions in Q3 and Q4.
In 2010, we will continue to maintain strict discipline in the management of our fixed cost structure to ensure we are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible. As always, potential investments in resources, R&D efforts, and commercial opportunities will be driven by our beliefs in the growth opportunities that these investments will deliver. We will look to fund these opportunities by our continued focus on cost discipline.
Moving to currency; it is important to note that the fourth quarter was the first quarter in 2009 we experienced positive currency tailwinds. From a sales standpoint, it had a positive $32 million impact or a 6% increase in sales and represented a $6 million benefit to operating profit. As a reminder, we have shown in the slide, the euro changes versus the dollar as a representative of our currency exposure, as a material portion of our portfolio is euro based.
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are today, we expect a relatively small impact to our results in the first half of 2009 due to currency parity. The weakened dollar on Q4 relative to the year-ago period has also proven to be beneficial to overall margin results. Similar to the past few quarters, I have tried to illustrate this issue by highlighting the drivers of change in our operating profit margins in the previous four quarters versus year-ago results.
In Q4, we continued our trend of operational improvements. As you can see, the margin improvement due to operations improved 260 basis points versus the year-ago period as a result of price increases, cost reduction efforts, and the impact of the incremental R&D credits. Even after eliminating the incremental benefits of the increased R&D credits, our margin improvement driven by operations was a robust 160 basis points. All in, including the positive impact from currency, margin improved 310 basis points in Q4 versus the comparable year-ago period. As we look forward, we expect that our efforts to drive operational improvements will continue to gain attraction.
Turning to our EPS reconciliation, I would like to reemphasize again the operational performance of the group. As highlighted on the slide, we continue to see improved operational performance, improving EPS by $0.19 or a 38% improvement versus the year-ago period. When including a net $0.06 costs associated with interest and other items partially offset by foreign exchange and higher income taxes, adjusted EPS grew 26% versus the year-ago adjusted figure.
I would love to provide you also with a quick update on the recent European Fragrance facility rationalization plan. As a reminder, we announced during Q3 that we had initiated a collective consultation process with employee representatives regarding the potential closure of our Fragrances compounding facility in Drogheda, Ireland, as well as the potential partial closure of a Fragrance Ingredients chemical plant in Haverhill, United Kingdom.
In the beginning of Q4, we announced that we concluded the consultation process and determined that we would proceed with the facility rationalization plan. As a result, we have recorded a $13 million provision, $10.5 million in Q3 and $2.5, in Q4 related to this restructuring activity. As a reminder, we expect to deliver our targeted annual cost savings for this strategic project of $17 million to $20 million annually, which will be fully realized in 2011.
Looking at our cash flow statement, our disciplined focus on operational improvement drove a significant reduction in working capital in 2009, as a reduction in inventories combined with better operating discipline over receivables and payables improved results. The improvement in working capital was the primary driver to improvement in cash flow from operations, up $71 million to $292 million for the year. Importantly we were able to more than offset the $34 million annual decrease in net income which was driven by the weakness in the first half to deliver this strong cash flow improvement. As a result of our strong cash flow performance through the end of 2009, we paid down additional debt of $150 million and made an incremental $20 million contribution to our US pension.
Through the full year, we reduced our gross outstanding debt by approximately $240 million, including $150 million previously mentioned, which was an early repayment of our Japanese term loan. Actions such as these reflect our commitment to maintaining our investment grade rate.
Looking at capital expenditures, we finished the year at levels near expectations. Going forward, we expect higher spend levels over the next few years as we will focus our investments behind supporting strategic growth, with focus in the emerging markets, and driving efficiencies by strategically improving our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. As earlier communicated, we would expect our future capital expenditures to grow to a level approximating 4% of sales.
So a perspective on our results; our Q4 results were certainly in line with our expectations and again indicative of improving business performance. As we leave a tumultuous 2009, it was clear that we managed through a year that had very different performance in the two halves of the year. Regardless without question, the strong discipline in maintaining focus against growth initiatives and cost management over the course of the year allowed us to dramatically improve results in the second half of the year and position us with some momentum as we enter 2010.
So what does that mean more specifically for 2010? We continue to be cautiously optimistic regarding the health of our customers’ businesses, which should translate into a more solid growth environment in 2010. In addition, the headwinds in raw material costs and currency are expected to turn and combine with our continued focus on driving margin improvements should translate into improved margin picture in 2010. Finally we would expect that the first half year-over-year performance will be stronger than the second half.
In summary, we are excited that our strategies and focused execution drove the market improvement in the second half of 2009. Specifically in Q4, we continued our operational improvements, our best performance all year and now we are beginning 2010 with stronger momentum behind us. Our global presence and diversified product portfolio continues to offer us great growth opportunities, and our emerging market presence continues to position us well in key growth areas around the world.
We also continue to be disciplined in driving efficiencies in all that we do, thus ensuring that we will have the ability to improve margins while continuing to support our growth initiatives. So as we enter 2010, we remain disciplined in the evaluation of our performance and as we consider additional investments to build stronger growth momentum, it will be done consistent with our ability to drive and improve margin picture. This commitment will ensure that our company will be able to win in the marketplace regardless of what the future might hold.
With that, we would be happy to take any questions that you may have.

We are also currently spending against the restructuring plan that has previously been announced. So if I were to talk about the general view of our CapEx going forward, that will continue to be the normal maintenance spend to ensure that our facilities are operating at high efficiency levels, and there potentially could be some restructuring dollars more oriented against our developed market positions.

I would probably answer it by saying I am pretty pleased with all that I have seen so far, maybe you would expect that given I’d come on to the board having done some due diligence. I think the company is - the overall goal that the company and the board have and I do too is really to grow the business profitably and I don’t make that as a trait statement, but the focus on growth is obviously a function of the top line and the profitability is both through the top line but also through what I think are some efficiency opportunities, Kevin touched a moment ago on some operational opportunities through restructuring which we have done in the past and we will continue to look forward to do so.
I think the hallmark that I have probably noticed in my time on the board so far is really what the need will be to be discriminating in terms of the many growth opportunities that we have. When you take a look at IFF’s geographic footprint, and these are elements which attracted me at the offset, the diversity of our footprint from a country point of view, Flavors versus Fragrances, the channels, and also the variety of wonderful customers that we have there is really a tremendous opportunity for growth across all of those. They will all take resources, so we are going to be strategically discriminating on where we put those growth opportunities.
Now obviously within the efficiency footprint, as I will work with the senior team and all those around the globe, we have to look for those productivity improvements. So and making the comment about growth being priority one, not trivializing for an instant the need to continue to get efficiencies which I would look, I think the whole team would look to do. And maybe the final comment really in response to your growth issue is really the challenge that the board has thrown against the entire management team that being to look at all avenues for growth, organic and also external, but certainly the good news from my point of view is that in evaluating the organic or internal growth opportunities that have been briefly touched upon by Nicholas and Hernan today, there are just a tremendous number of those internal organic opportunities for growth which I would look for us to maximize going forward.

Before turning over to Nicolas, I think obviously we had commentary on that subject in the past. I think the way we are approaching Fine, though, just to give you an overall color is that we are cautiously optimistic on the business, but we are managing it in such a way that we are not assuming anything as it relates to that business going back to the days of old. And so we are being quite prudent in terms the management of the portfolio and how we add resources or not as the case may be. So our expectation is that we are going to be able to be successful from a margin perspective regardless of what the future might hold. So we are certainly managing forward from that perspective. So we are not leaning in front of ourselves, I guess, from that perspective. I think Nicolas would certainly have some additional color on in terms of kind of the consumer and the future of that business.

Definitely Fine category disproportionately felt the impact of the external environment and very often in the category we talk about destocking at the retailer level. It was also at the consumer level. And we know that after two years of lot of innovation, consumers were in possession of several bottles of fragrances, and when we look at product rotation at retail and when we look at also the different face of buying we believe that the consumers were sitting on some inventory as well. So we probably have not seen them for quite a lot of time. I think that the prestige market has been most affected in North America, as you know, which was really the most challenging market last year. We are seeing some retailers - we are seeing some brands trying to focus on different initiative either focusing on supporting some of the classic or trying to brining innovation. We understand that market is still soft and we had to focus ourselves on investing on strong business and creative fundamentals. Right now, we feel very positive about our new win momentum regardless of the soft market.

I don’t know that we are noting any change in trend. But I would say a couple of points, one of which you’ve already mentioned, relative to comp versus year-ago, fourth quarter it was actually a pretty strong year-ago period. So that’s one area. I think the fourth quarter was the only quarter a year ago where we had some solid North American growth. So I think that’s part of the deal. And I think the dynamic as you think about kind of Christmas and what’s happening from that perspective, that clearly plays a role in terms of what’s happening in that fourth quarter period. So though, flavors had a really strong quarter, fourth quarter year ago. So there was a slight change there in terms of comparing versus that strong quarter. And from a Fragrance perspective, I think it maintained - we maintained our position. Hernan mentioned it a little bit, but we did get a sense over the course of the quarter where some of our customers seem to have taken a position on inventories right at the end of the year as we were seeing some pretty strong growth and right at the end of the quarter things fell off. So it certainly appears that there was an impact there, different dynamic than what we saw a year ago. So I think that that’s playing a little bit of a dynamic in terms of comparing the numbers. If we look at kind of where we are right now in the preliminary trends as we kind of turn the corner into 2010, things are actually looking pretty good. So we are pretty comfortable that there were some inventory positioning being taken by at least some of our customers.

So I won’t even think about going there. I would revisit the brief that the board has understandably provided to the incoming CEO and probably any CEO, which is to evaluate any and all opportunities for growth. So I and the management team will do see that the industry has a number of wonderful competitors who frankly challenge each other which is a very healthy dynamic. The number of competitors is sizable that obviously the customer base as well as the consumer base around the world is huge and therefore it supports the kind of competitors that exist in the marketplace. So I admire them and I will come to understand them better going forward. But I probably would reiterate the challenge notwithstanding what the board has said, evaluate everything. 
When I have looked inside the company at the strength that we have in our people, the diversity of our customers, the R&D strengths that we have as well as the global footprints in Flavors and Fragrances, there is a tremendous number of internal options to pursue for growth which we will do as the number priority. To answer the second part of your question I have had extensive experience in M&A activity through both Ansell and previously. They happened to be very good strategic moves in the context of entering new markets and/or acquiring new businesses and new challenges. So I was to have had that experience and it seemed that to be very beneficial for companies. It is not necessarily a platform at all for going forward for growth at IFF.

The transition I would concur seems to have taken a significant amount of time. That was a function of a contract that I have with Ansell and the obligations that I have to the board to fulfill that contract. It would run through the early part of March. So we are clearly at the tail end. To build on parts of your question, I’ve used the opportunity to get to know the senior team quite. I’ve used the opportunity to read immensely to try to understand what are the critical issues going forward. But I've been a little faithful to my Ansell duties but also have extreme confidence which was well placed in the operating committee, the senior leadership team here at IFF who have stewarded the ship in an exemplary fashion. 
I am quite at the speed on issues through that reading and understanding and attending a variety of meetings, but all the credit goes to them. But I should hit the deck and I will hit the decks running in the not-too-distant future. Turning now to really the heart and soul of your question, the company is in a very good position with the current platform that it has. It took a number of difficult, but necessary steps during the last year to restructure cost management, margin management to come out of the year quite strong. Nicolas and Hernan have already touched about the broad scale, wonderful position our businesses find themselves in with the notable exception of fine, but that's well understood. So the geography that we have, the customer base, the cost rigger that’s been taken in the current R&D pipeline gives certainly me great confidence going forward that we can achieve what goals we need to achieve through, what I would call, non-transformational. 
Any CEO change and particularly operating from a position of some strength allows the company and the board to deliberate on any and all options, and they will be considered. I think the really good news in response to your question is that this company does not need to make any transformational moves out of a position of needing to do something critical in order to make its - achieve its goals. That might occur but I definitely wouldn’t want you to bank on that, and that’s really a function of the great footprint we have going forward from an organic point of view. As I said, I'll hit the decks running. I'm quite knowledgeable on issues and delighted to be going to work with a wonderful group that already exist here.

Good morning, good afternoon to everyone. Before moving on to discuss our very strong Q1 results, I'd like to make a few introductory comments.

Before moving on to discuss our very strong Q1 results, I'd like to make a few introductory comments. As you know, effective March 1st of this year, I officially joined IFF full time as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. While it's still premature for me to make comments regarding any actions we might take on any possible changes to the strategic focus for IFF, I'd like to elaborate on some key items on which I will be focused.
Priority number one is to pressure test our current strategies and our business model to ensure we are operating to the best of our ability. While it is early in our review, I will say that my initial expectations of the organization I had prior to joining are no different after my first 60 days. I continue to believe that the IFF team has tremendous people and capabilities that provide our customers with winning products which translate into profitable growth for IFF.
Second, as I begin my new journey, it'll be imperative to ensure we continue to accelerate our short-term performance. The executive team as well as all IFF employees have done a very nice job delivering strong results in the back half of 2009 and in the first quarter of 2010. Capitalizing on this success, I expect we will continue to deliver on current commitments while reviewing options regarding our long-term strategies.
Finally, at the very heart of our organization, our most important asset are people as a critical priority. I believe that this organization has incredible talent as my objective to nurture and align that talent in such a way that I can ensure our future leaders of tomorrow are being developed from within the organization today.
I have taken a considerable amount of time to meet with many IFF employees and functions throughout various parts of the world to learn the issues and to provide a sense of my priorities and expectations. I will continue this process over the upcoming few months until I have reached all of our major constituents.
While I am focused on the long-term objectives, our organization remains committed to furthering our partnerships with key stakeholders. Starting with our customers, we continue to be an innovator of technological advancements versus a mere component of the supply chain.
Utilizing our capabilities and consumer insight in R&D and in creative insight, we partner with our key customers to create unique scent and taste experiences that our consumers love. This in turn helps bolster our customer's market share and helps grow the equity of their brands. If we continue to do this while providing overall superior customer satisfaction, we believe it will lead to increased customer loyalty that in turn drive our future business.
In order to continue to create shareholder value, we must ensure we are capable of driving consistent and sustainable long-term growth. Our recent results are an example of our financial potential. Our priorities going forward must focus on growing our top line, accelerating our productivity and investing in future growth in order to ensure that we are maximizing shareholder returns.
We also understand that our responsibility extends to being strong partners in the communities where we work and live and vigilance around our commitment to sustainability, through IFF charitable giving, we are proud to be able to provide financial support and countless hours of employee volunteerism to many community-based organizations.
And last, but not least, we will continue to support our valued employees. As our people represent a large component of our success as well as a competitive advantage, the people of IFF are a critical focus for me. As such, some additional comments are appropriate.
Our business comes to light through the 5,400 or so employees who create our unique scent and taste experiences. Without their passion, their dedication and creativity, we would not be who we are today. Our executive leadership team is seasoned and talented. As I stated earlier, these individuals have done a terrific job during the period of recent transition.
I am very confident that they will achieve even greater success as we work collectively to elevate IFF's performance to new heights in the new decade. We think our global teams including our creative and our R&D employees are the best in the industry. Their leadership from South Brunswick to Sao Paulo from Moscow to Manoa gives us local marketplace knowledge, great continuity and the ability to connect with communities and customers where we do business.
We will dedicate resources to ensure they continue to excel in their area of expertise. And I'm committed to giving them opportunities that will help them succeed in their careers. These offices interface with our customers to deliver superior solutions. I have seen firsthand results of this labor by attending numerous meetings with many of our customers, both global and regional. These customers fully respect IFF's creativity, ability to understand their needs and IFF's pension for providing winning solutions.
Now before turning over to the rest of the team, I'd like to make a few comments on our Q1 performance. The improved trends in the second half of 2009 continued through the first quarter of this year. Our strong new business performance combined with some elements of customer restocking and favorable comparisons resulted in accelerated levels of growth.
Our worldwide local currency sales grew 13% year-over-year as the commercial environment continued to show improvement versus the full year of 2009. This growth in our top line, when combined with continued discipline in cost management, supported a substantial improvement in margin as operating profit margin improved 220 basis points year-on-year. The end result was extremely positive, as adjusted earnings per share increased 42% year-on-year.
With that, I'm now pleased to introduce our Global President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman who will provide further context surrounding our strong Q1 results in Flavors.

I'm pleased to say that local currency sales in the first quarter increased 8% over the comparable 2009 period, marking the 19th consecutive quarter of local currency growth. Our strong performance was led by double-digit growth in Europe, Africa, Middle East and Greater Asia regions, as increased volumes and new business dropped results. In North America, local currency sales declined 1% due to the overall drop in volume which was not upset by new successes.
While we hope for better results, we are prepared to put this one quarter performance with the overall context of the strong growth we have seen in North America over the last years and especially versus our most difficult comparison of 2009 of flat 6% growth. We continue to feel good about our long-term share growth opportunities in these regions as we work with our customers and new business opportunities.
In EAME, local currency sales increased 12% year-over-year, as both categories were positive. In particular, the Flavors category continues to perform very well as new wins and stronger volumes are giving results. This marks the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in these categories. Regionally, it was high single-digit growth in developed countries while developing European markets grew at double-digit growth.
Africa, our Middle East market posted high double-digit growth into new wins and higher volumes across all categories. Sales in Latin America have reversed recent trends, growing 6% as new business and volume recovering Savory, Confectionary and Dairy offset the loss of non-strategic business that began in third quarter of 2009. We finished extremely positive above these results and we expect an accelerating growth base in the second semester due to critical wins in key categories.
Lastly, in Greater Asia, local currency sales were up 14%, as every category recorded impressive double-digit growth. The great momentum of our business in India, China and most Asian countries contributed substantially to the double-digit growth in this important part of the world. This was fueled by higher volumes and new wins across all categories and strategic customers.
While our track record of local currency sales growth is impressive, the level reported in the first quarter of 2010 marks one of the highest achievements. The Flavors teams continued to do an excellent job capitalizing on new business opportunities to drive above-market growth.
Further, our outstanding consumer understanding, unique product portfolio and differentiating test solutions help us to fully support our customers from positioning, making the effect the unique department in the creation of winning consumer products.
Turning to profit, Flavors operating profit in the quarter was very strong, increasing 17%, or $9 million to $62 million. This increase can be attributed to accelerated sales growth, improving input cost dynamic and our continuous success in improving our efficiencies.
As a result, operating profit margin continued to improve, increasing 60 basis points to 20.5% versus 19.9% in the prior year period. While we are very early in Q1 - in Q2, sorry, we have started the quarter with good momentum.
While it remains difficult to predict some element of our performance due to the volatility in our customer ordering patterns. We do expect to see solid local currencies - solid local currencies sales growth, that when combined with our continued focus on improving efficiency to result in continued margin improvement.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Global President of Fragrances Mirzayantz, who will provide an update on the Fragrance business.

Overall growth can be attributed to the (inaudible) strong base of new wins, some elements of customer and retailer restocking, improvement in underlying demand and favorable comparisons versus a year-ago period. In terms of performance, we grew double-digit in all regions, as well as every category.
In the Fine Fragrance and Beauty Care category, local currency sales grew 28%. Fine Fragrance has reversed its recent trends, growing very strong double-digits. The success can be accredited to the team's constant commitment to win new business and grow market share position.
In 2009, our Fine Fragrance team was successful in maintaining our market share and showed the ability to win new business by securing many of the key launches of 2010. This combination has proven to be beneficial in Q1.
When new business gains has helped support the strong Fine Fragrance results, I believe it is important to note that a portion of this improvement can be attributed to favorable comparisons as well as elements of customer and retailer restocking. While the elements of restocking are difficult to predict, I am confident that our team will continue to perform well, driven by our strong new business performance.
Turning to Beauty Care, the momentum we experienced in the second half of 2009 continued in 2010. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we have seen accelerated growth in the Beauty Care category as both Hair Care and Toiletries increased double digits. The strong performance can be attributed to successful introductions within key regions.
Functional Fragrance once again performed very well growing 10%, as Fabric Care performance remains strong. Our success continues to be accredited to a long standing expertise and continued investment in consumer insight within the key emerging market as well as Europe. This investment in category expertise are the primary drivers behind our consistent above-market growth. In addition, Home Care and Personal Wash also exhibited solid growth.
Finally, Fragrance Ingredient sales also improved. Local currency sales increased 21%, reflecting an underlying improvement in demand, some elements of customer's restocking and a favorable comparison versus a year-ago period.
Continuing on the trends since last year, the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China drove strong results. In this market, Hair Care, Fabric Care and Personal Wash continue to drive strong double-digit results. While this trend is impressive, I'd like to note that the developed markets of Europe and North America have also grown strong double-digits. I'm very proud of all Fragrance employees around the world as they accomplished great success in the first quarter.
From a profitability standpoint, adjusted operating profit grew an impressive 66% or $24 million to $61 million, excluding a $5 million expense related to a previously announced European facilities rationalization. As a result, adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter increased 470 basis points to 17.2% as higher volumes, moderating input cost and benefits from previous cost reductions initiatives drove the impressive performance.
As we look toward Q2 and beyond, we do note that our underlying business trends remain strong. While these trends have helped support our strong business results, it is important to note that a portion of this improvement can be attributed to customer and retailer restocking. While it's difficult to predict the effort of restocking for the balance of the year, we do not expect that these benefits will continue as our customers reach their targeted inventory levels going forward.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.

While we are only a quarter of the way through the year, I'd like to update you on how we're progre",1556,"Thanks, Nicolas, and good morning and afternoon to everyone. On our Q4 conference call, we highlighted four key trends that we would expect to see in 2010. While we are only a quarter of the way through the year, I'd like to update you on how we're progressing in these areas.
First, we communicated that local currency sales trends were expected to improve for the full year. As you've already heard, each of the businesses were able to realize improvement growth in Q1.
Second, we highlighted that we would see an improving input cost picture. Specifically lower input costs, when combined with our accelerated sales performance, allowed us to improve gross margin by 160 basis points year-over-year to 41.3%.
When combined with a strict discipline in the management of our research, selling and administrative expenses, or what we call RSA, we managed to capitalize on fixed cost leverage to deliver 220 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. This improved performance resulted in a substantial increase in our adjusted EPS.
In the quarter, adjusted EPS grew 42% to an all-time company high of $0.85. Our results are clearly aligned with our expectations that first half results would be relatively stronger than those that we would expect in the second half.
Looking at the recent sales trends, there's a clear indication that the challenges of 2009 appear to have subsided and there are signs we're beginning to see an improved operating environment. It is also clear, however, that customer restocking and favorable comparisons in Fine Fragrance and Ingredients specifically have aided results.
As seen in the chart, both Fine and Ingredients realized 20% plus growth levels in Q1, after having seen softness over most of 2009. While we have entered Q2 with good momentum, the growth levels achieved in Q1 are not projected to be sustainable, as our visibility through the balance of the year remains limited given economic volatility we have seen over the last 18 months.
I'd like to provide a bit more clarity on our input costs, as we have seen a year-over-year decrease in the levels of higher cost inventory. In the first quarter, our input costs decreases represented a 3% decrease in our overall cost to goods sold. As communicated earlier in the year, we expected to see this reduction in input costs in the first half of 2010.
Looking ahead, we expect input costs to remain favorable for the second quarter and full year. Although we are starting to see some increases in raw material categories that may reduce the favorable impact in the second half of 2010. Specifically, increases in the cost of oil will begin to place selective pressure on some oil-related costs and freight surcharges in the second half of the year.
From an overhead cost standpoint, we continue to remain disciplined in the management of our fixed cost structure. RSA, as a percent of sales, declined 50 basis points to 24.6%, as our fixed costs realized improved absorption rates due to our strong sales growth.
As an indicator of our continued discipline in cost management, while RSA expenses increased $21 million, the increase was almost entirely driven by foreign currency parity and additional incentive compensation expense. Excluding these currency and additional incentive compensation provisions, RSA expense increased only $3 million year-over-year. Within RSA, R&D expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased 50 basis points to 8%, compared to 8.5% last year driven by the fixed cost growth leverage noted above.
In 2010, we will continue to maintain strict discipline in the management of our fixed cost structure to ensure we are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible. However, we will continue to monitor our performance throughout the balance of the year as we look to make targeted operating investments to strengthen our marketplace division. As always, potential operating investments of resources, R&D efforts and commercial opportunities will be driven by our belief in the growth opportunities that these investments will deliver.
Moving to currency, for the second consecutive quarter, we have experienced positive currency tailwinds. In general terms currency was slightly accretive to operational performance, although this benefit was offset by some short-term fluctuation and balance sheet activities.
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are today, we expect a relatively minor impact to our results in the second quarter of 2010 due to currency parity.
As we look further out, at current rates, we expect to face some pressures in the second half of 2010. It is important to note, however, we are in the process of analyzing different options that will help minimize this financial risk. In particular, we have a process of evaluating hedging strategies and business opportunities that could provide for decreased volatility in this area.
Turning to our EPS reconciliation, I will not spend a lot of time going through the detail as I have already covered most of the topics early in my presentation. As highlighted on the slide, however, we continue to see improved operational performance. Improving EPS by $0.23, or 38% improvement, versus the year-ago period. When including a net $0.02 benefit associated with foreign exchange and interest partially offset by higher income tax and other items, adjusted earnings per share substantially improved versus the first quarter 2009, again growing 42%.
As we move from our adjusted EPS to our reported EPS, I would like to note that the $0.05 difference is entirely related to our previously announced European rationalization. As a reminder, we announced during the third quarter 2009, that we had initiated a collective consultation process with employee representatives, regarding the potential closure of our fragrances compounding facility in Drogheda, Ireland, as well as a potential partial closure of fragrance ingredients chemical plant in Haverhill, United Kingdom.
In the beginning of 2000 - excuse me, in the beginning of Q4, we announced that we concluded the consultation process and determined that we would proceed with the facility rationalization plan. As a result, we have reported a $19 million provision, $10.5 million in Q3, $3.5 million in Q4 and $5 million in Q1 related to this restructuring activity. We now expect our cost for this initiative to be approximately $27 million to $29 million, with targeted annual cost savings of $17 million to $20 million annually beginning in 2011.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in all elements of working capital efficiency. The largest component of our success in the first quarter came from our ability to increase inventory leverage and improve our discipline around payables.
As a result of this improvement, as well as the relative business strength in the quarter, operating cash flow from operations increased $46 million from the year-ago period to $32 million in Q1. This improvement was primarily driven by the reduction of working capital, as noted above.
As communicated in our previous conference calls, we continue to expect our future capital expenditures to grow to levels, near 4% of sales. These investments will focus on supporting strategic growth with a specific concentration in the emerging markets. And driving efficiencies by strategically improving our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. While our spending has started relatively slow, it is expected to ramp up to higher levels over the balance of the year, primarily in the second half.
Looking ahead to the full year, we expect local currency sales to trend above our long-term growth targets. We do expect relative strength in the second quarter, as we continue to have favorable year-over-year comparisons.
As mentioned earlier by Hernan and Nicolas, while it is difficult to predict the impact of customer restocking beyond Q1, we do believe that these benefits will subside over the balance of the year as customers and retailers work towards their targeted inventory levels.
Regarding our margin structure, while we do expect input post - input costs to be favorable for the full year, we are starting to see some increases in raw material categories that will reduce this benefit in the second half of 2010. We could also see some currency pressures in the second half of 2010 which also may adversely impact our results.
So what does that mean for 2010? Even though economic conditions remain fluid, we continue to be optimistic. The second quarter has started strong and is expected to have relative strength versus the second half, when stronger comparables and potential currency parity may dampen our year-over-year performance.
In wrapping up, we're very pleased with a strong start to 2010. Both our Flavors and Fragrances teams have done an excellent job capitalizing on new business opportunities to grow both sales and profits to record levels. While as we entered the second quarter with some good momentum, our visibility through the balance of the year remains limited, given the evolving economic landscape, particularly in North America and Europe. We remain cautiously optimistic in our full-year outlook and we are aware that the extremely strong Q1 sales momentum is not sustainable.
As a result, we will continue to proactively monitor our performance to evaluate potential operating investments that could strengthen our long-term growth opportunities. Our efforts will be guided by our objectives to continue to build a stronger IFF for tomorrow while simultaneously driving consistent growth and profit performance today.
With that, we would be happy to take any questions that you might have.

I don't think there is any clarity as to the level of restocking that really has occurred in the context of inventory changes. I make that comment both because we broadly discussed that internally, obviously. But also taking the opportunity to read many of our competitors and our customers their fellow first quarter results and they're all uncertain about the level of restocking.
I think the important point though is - really two, number one is the restocking elements in some parts of the world don't ever seem to have ever occurred. There wasn't destocking, per se in some parts of Asia and Latin America. Those economies continue to be robust. So the buoyancy that Hernan and Nicolas talked about, we've seen that buoyancy off of a sustaining inventory platform which is obviously very encouraging. I think it may be a different story in parts of Europe, particularly Western Europe, as well as in North America, where there was some destocking, but the finger on the pulse of how much restocking is going to occur. It's just not to be defined. I think it is important though that they all talk about the buoyancy we're seeing in H2 or in Q2, so far, and it's early. Nevertheless, it gives us confidence if there's real momentum as well as some elements of restocking. I'd invite Hernan and Nicolas to add to that.

Let me - a few preliminary comments. I'll hand it over to Hernan for some additional follow-up. In our third quarter call last year, we talked about the decision on the strategic side for the Flavors business in Latin America and we had talked about actually how our expectations at that point in time is. Even though, we were doing that, we thought we would be able to offset that loss by some strong underlying performance in the rest of the portfolio. That actually didn't end up occurring in Q4. We were off by one quarter, I guess, but what I think you're seeing in Q1 is again, the actual results tying into our feeling that the underlying strength of the portfolio was pretty strong and we would be able to more than offset some of that lost strategic business.
And I think that, that, we're seeing with that good solid single-digit growth number for Latin America and Flavors, I think you're seeing that. So the momentum's good there and we start to lap against the new base, really in third quarter. So you'll start to see probably some better numbers in the Flavors at that point in time, but I'll turn it over to Hernan if there is any other comments.

I mean the first quarter 2009 was very strong, was 6%, was in the middle of a crisis with really outstanding results.
Now going forward, I mean, we are feeling confident. As I mentioned, the pipeline is strong. In some way, we understand that the low performance in the first quarter was because some, I mean, there were some delaying launches for our customers, now are coming through.

But I'm not so sure we can pinpoint the specificity of that and I think as we look at the results of our competitors and our customers, they certainly are talking that there's some element of potential improving dynamic, but they're also being very cautious as well. Okay. Thank you.

I'd say it nevertheless is mercurial and fluid and things around the world - parts of the world remain very dynamic. So, we'll be extremely cautious about, as Kevin already articulated. We'll be cautious about the investments and the things we do.
I think IFF is blessed with the diversity of its geographic footprint and its portfolio of businesses because sentiments that I've seen in Asia and in Latin America were positive then and they remain positive now and there's been a relative improvement in particularly North America and I'd say to a lesser extent in Europe but nevertheless, directionally going that way. But here in North America, there is an improvement, the customer propensity for new products and investment. Both born out of the need to win back customers exists but the overall trend seems to be our friend everywhere. But as I say, I'm probably most pleased by the footprint that IFF has that, it hasn't - We're trying to go, if you will, from strength to strength in some parts of the world, while in other parts of the world, there's an economic rebound and we're a part of that.

But I think that we're going to continue to be diligent in terms of ensuring that we're going to have growth - fixed cost leverage. We're going to look to ensure that we continue to have growth and that growth element requires us to make investments at particular points in times. So that may dampen a little bit of that but at the end of the day, I think that is very clearly, our thinking that we would be diligent, we'll be focused and disciplined as it relates to making those investments so we ensure that we have top line growth. I think the other point is that there is a significant increase in some of the incentive numbers we have in this particular quarter because we are very low last year, higher this year. So, if you look at, like a new standard base, some of the costs that you're seeing in RSA won't necessarily be at those levels assuming we continue to be more a normalized level incentive comp over the long haul.
That'll be a piece of it, too. So, the first thing is, the $17 million to $20 million in 2011, the next piece is how incentive fits into the picture. Its variable right now that's because we're recovering from such low levels. The rest of it is our continued drive for improvements in gross margins and discipline in the management of our fixed cost structure.

So, I think, to Doug's point, innovation's going to continue to be key. It would be the lifeblood of us to be able to maintain our margins and improve them overtime but that's got to be one element of our efforts. The second part, which I've talked about in the past and I continue to talk about is our continued discipline in the management of our, say our controllable cost structure.

Before moving on to discuss our Q2 results, I would like to update you on one of the priorities we discussed on our Q1 conference call. Since joining IFF full time back in early March, we’ve begun to pressure test our current strategies and our business model to ensure we are operating to the best of our ability.
As a part of this review, we have engaged a strategic consultant to aid us with the process. While we are still in the initial phases, gathering data and understanding the complex dynamics, we believe we are working towards an optimum path that will lead to greater shareholder value. We are thoroughly examining our regions, our categories and our customers relative to the drivers of our current and future levels of profitability. 
Specifically, we are looking to optimize our resources to ensure we are putting emphasis where we will get the best overall return. We are evaluating the relative levels of human and capital resources that are required to deliver our current results.
Perhaps, but not surprisingly, we have discovered very different performance results whereas some categories, some customers and regions are creating much better returns than others. Please note, however that much work still needs to be done. My expectation is this project will continue throughout the balance of this year. We will do our best to keep you informed of our progress and how these results will lead to even greater financial performance that in turn will drive further shareholder value.
I can assure you this is the highest internal initiative at IFF and I am pleased with the efforts and the progress made thus far by the entire organization. 
Returning to our second quarter results, I would like to note some key non-financial accomplishments that I believe will position us well in the future. First, in Flavors, I’m happy to report that we have been selected as a global core supplier for a multinational flavor customer making us one of only three suppliers on that coveted list. 
This is great news for IFF and speaks volumes about its customers trust and our ability to deliver quality; innovative products that help them differentiate their brands in the marketplace.
Adding to our portfolio of health and wellness solutions is our newly signed licensing agreement with Redpoint Bio, developers of an all-natural sweetness enhancer derived from stevia that will be exclusively ours for five years. The addition of this product will enable us to offer our customers more natural solutions to reduce sugar products. 
We also like to mention that the Fragrance team once again showed that IFF is a stock leader in looking to the future of Fragrance as they demonstrated in their well-received Headspace symposium presented earlier this year in concert with Museum of Modern Art and the Parsons School of Design. 
For those of you who do not know the Headspace symposium gathers leading thinkers, designers, scientists, artists and established perfumers to challenge the conception, impact and potential applications of scent by exploring new territory for design. Opportunities such as these are great ways to think outside the box leading to the key innovations so necessary to our business. 
While the rest of the IFF senior team will take you through the full details of our Q2 performance, I’ll provide a few high-level comments. It is clear that the strong momentum we experienced in the beginning of the year continued into the second quarter. 
While we have benefited from restocking and favorable comparisons against the soft-based period, the team was successful in winning key new business that helped drive this record top-line performance. This growth in the top line alongside our continued focus on cost and productivity supported a strong improvement in the operating profit margin.
The end result was very positive. Adjusted EPF increased 31% year-over-year. Finally before passing on to Nicolas, who will provide further context surrounding fragrances Q2 results, I would like to acknowledge our global supply chain and manufacturing team. With so much activity in both Flavors and Fragrances, you might deduce that the strong volume would cause a strain on our supply chain and you would be correct. We experienced unanticipated demand, which was taxing our manufacturing plants and material sourcing. 
Despite that substantial increase in demand, I’m happy to report we kept up our service levels to our customers. The supply chain and manufacturing team have risen to the challenge and upheld our excellent customer service levels. 
Once Nicolas, Hernan and Kevin conclude their prepared remarks, I will come back to provide some perspectives on the future and our outlook for the balance of this year. With that, I would like to introduce our Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz.

I’m happy to report that local currency sales in the second quarter increased 23%, one of our highest achievements in company history. As all categories, all regions and all customer segments on a concreted basis, we reported double digit growth. 
Our very strong performance was driven by the team’s ability to execute against the key strategic initiatives developed two years ago, as well as their ability to win important new business. 
In the Fine Fragrance and Beauty Care category, local currency sales grew 37%. Robust trends in Fine Fragrance continued growing at a strong double-digit rate as their ability to secure many of the key 2010 launches drove results. 
While new business gains did help support a very strong Fine Fragrance results, it is important to note that a portion of this improvement can be attributed to weak prior-year comparables as well as some elements of restocking. Despite these benefits, I am confident that we should continue to perform well as strong new business wins should provide a solid foundation for future growth. 
In Beauty Care, Hair Care and Toiletries continued to perform very well, both increasing at a strong double-digit rate. We continued to win important new business that has strengthened our leadership position across all our global and regional customers and I believe many solid opportunities still exist.
Our Functional Fragrance business continued to grow double digits increasing 12% despite a more challenging year-over-year comparable. Fabric Care performance remains strong as key new wins in Europe, Greater Asia and Latin America aided results. In Home Care, we have a seen a return to growth following a challenging 2009 as we continue to benefit from the addition of an important [core lease] two years ago.
In Personal Wash, solid growth was achieved despite a strong 2009 comparable. Our excellent performance in Functional Fragrance continues to reflect our strategic investment in innovation, in particular with our microencapsulation technology. In the second quarter, this technology represented large component of our growth and was one of the driving force of all those market growth levels.
Finally, Fragrance Ingredient’s local currency sales increased 24%, driven by a favorable comparison versus a year-ago period as well as improvements in underlying demand. Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, I am very pleased with our performance across all regions. 
In the developed markets of Europe and North America, we experienced very strong double-digit growth of 29% and 19% respectively driven by new wins and volume growth. Complementing the success, the strong trends seen in the emerging market of the previous four quarters have continued. 
Brazil, Russia, India and China all continue to show double-digit growth driven by new win performance and increased demand from both global and regional customers. As a result, we enjoyed a growth of 19% in Asia and 18% in Latin America.
Operating profit increased by $28 million to $65 million, including approximately $2 million related to ongoing restructuring efforts in Europe as compared to $5 million related to restructuring charges in the prior-year period. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit grew nearly 60% or $25 million to $67 million as higher volumes, improving input cost and benefits from previous cost reduction initiatives drove results. 
Adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter increased 430 basis points to 18.6%, a level we have not seen in nearly five years. As we enter the second half, we have started the quarter with good momentum. It is important to know, however that we expect the benefits of restructuring to slow. 
In addition, as we face stronger prior-year comparisons, we do expect local currency sales in the second half to be lower than the first half as a strong performance in both Q1 and Q2 is not sustainable. Nevertheless, we believe our strong pipeline of new business should continue to position us well as we advance in the third quarter.
I would now like to turn the call over to our Group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman, who will provide an update on the flavor business.

We are pleased to say that local currency sales in the second quarter increased 7% over the comparative 2009 period marking the 20th consecutive quarter of local currency flow. Strong trends [Inaudible] continued as increased volume and new business win once again led to double-digit growth.
In North America, local currency sales returned to positive growth increasing 7% as our team did an excellent job working with our customers to win new business. Specifically a double-digit performance in both confectionary and beverage were impressive and gave us confidence that we look to increase market share opportunity. 
In EAME, local currency sales increased 18% over the prior-year quarter as Flavors categories reported double-digit growth. The beverage category continues to be a standout as new win and stronger volume are driving results.
This month, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth of this category returning emerging market of Eastern Europe and the Middle East grew 25% plus while the developed market of Western Europe grew in the high teens. 
States in Latin America were once again positive growing 4% as new business and volume recovery in savory, confectionary and dairy offset the loss of non-strategic business that began in the third quarter of 2009. Please note it is our final comparison that includes the loss of non-strategic business. So we expect growth to accelerate in the second half as a result of critical wins in key categories.
Lastly, in Greater Asia, local currency sales were up 12% as all category reported positive results. Recent momentum of our business in most Asian countries contributed substantially to the double-digit growth in this important part of the world. This was fueled by higher volumes and new wins across all categories. 
The Flavors team continues to do an excellent job capitalizing on new business opportunities to drive above market growth. While I am happy to report our highest sales growth in company history, what I am most proud of is our performance across all regions and all categories.
Turning to profit, Flavors operating profit increased 18% or $10 million to $60 million in the second quarter. This increase was driven by accelerated sales growth, improved input cost and our continued margin improvement initiatives. 
As a result, operating profit margin improved 100 basis points to 21.2% versus 20.2% in the prior-year period. While we are early in Q3, we have started the quarter with solid momentum. Our project pipeline remains very healthy and I believe we are in a good shape to continue our track record of local currency sales growth as we move into the second half of the year.

On our Q1 conference call, I highlighted four key trends that we expect to see in 2010. I would like to update you on how we are progressing in these areas.
First, we communicated that we expect local currency sales to trend above our long-term growth targets, with relative strength in the second quarter driven by favorable prior-year comparison. This indeed has happened with each of the business that we are able to realize substantial improvement in Q2.
Second, we highlighted that we would see an improving input cost structure. Specifically, slower input cost combined with our accelerated sales performance allowed us to improve gross margin by 270 basis points, over the prior-year period to 42.8%.
Our continued focus on cost discipline helped mitigate some higher than normal RSA cost, most notably incremental incentive compensation provisions, as we delivered 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement finishing the quarter at 16.5%. As a result, adjusted EPS for the second quarter increased 31% year-over-year to $0.85 per share.
Looking at our local currency sales trends over the past five quarters, I’d like to note that all categories in Q2 are showing double-digit growth. However, restocking and favorable comparison in Fine Fragrance and Ingredients certainly aided results.
As we enter the second half, it is important to note that the benefits of restocking appeared to be subsiding. When combined with stronger prior-year comparisons, the continued economic volatility, we expect local currency sales growth in the second half to grow on more normalized levels with relative strength in Q3 versus Q4.
Turning to input cost, we continued to see period-over-period decreases in the P&L driven by a reduction of higher cost inventory. As expected, input cost represented a 7% decrease in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we believe input cost should remain favorable for the full year, although the selective pressure in the second half may reduce the rate of favorability for the full year. Specifically, fluctuations in oil prices could place pressure on some oil-related materials and freight surcharges.
While we are experiencing benefits in 2010, I would like to remind you all that our overall input cost position remain above historical level.
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA has a percentage of sales increased 160 basis points to 26.3%. The $35 million increase is mainly attributable to additional incentive compensation provisions of $18 million, plus litigation-related costs, investments and spending to support the higher level of business activity, reduction of R&D credits, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower prior-period based spending. 
It should be noted that included in our RSA expense this quarter is roughly 250 basis point of expense versus what we consider more normalized levels. This increase can be attributed to additional incentive compensational provisions above normalized levels, obviously driven by a very strong performance in Q2 as well as additional litigation-related cost.
As our top-line performance returns to more normalized levels, we believe our cost structure will fall. Within RSA, R&D expense, as a percentage of sales, increased 60 basis points to 8.4% driven by incremental incentive compensation provisions, a reduction in R&D credits and incremental investments in support of our strategic growth initiatives.
Looking towards the second half, we will continue to maintain strict discipline in the management of our fixed cost structure. If our performance is similar to the performance experienced in the first half, we would expect, however additional cost associated with compensation provisions.
Moving to currency, while the Euro devalued against the U.S. dollar during Q2, the negative impact on our P&L was largely offset by the strengthening of other currencies. In the past, we have said that for every 1.1% strengthening or weakening of the US dollar we expect a plus or minus $0.02 impact on our EPS on an annual basis.
Please note that this can vary depending upon the mix of currencies and balance sheet impacts that are driven by point and time translation factors. The exact impact depends upon the consistency of the change across the major currencies in which we operate.
Looking ahead, the currency rates stay where they are today including the Euro at 132. We expect to face modest pressure on the second half of 2010. As we have communicated on our Q1 conference call, the evaluated cost provision strategy that provide for decreased volatility in this area. We have begun to implement these strategies and we believe that volatility should be reduced as we begin to enter the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, at current rates, we still believe that the above-mentioned currency role should be directionally accurate in Q3 and Q4 of 2010.
Turning to our EPS reconciliation that’s highlighted on the slide, we continue to see improved performance, including the abnormally high levels of incentive compensation provisions on legal-related cost previously noted, adjusted EPS still improved $0.20 or 31% versus the year-ago period. 
As we move from our adjusted EPS to our reported EPS, I would like to note that the $0.02 difference is entirely related to our previously announced European rationalization. As a reminder, to date we have recorded $20 million provision of which $2 million was recorded in this quarter.
We now expect our total cost for this initiative to be approximately $31 million to $34 million with targeted annual cost savings of $17 million to $20 million annually, beginning in 2011.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in working capital efficiency. As a result, a large component of our success in the second quarter came from our ability to better manage our receivables and payables. This improved efficiency combined with the relative business strength in the quarter drove $40 million increase year-over-year in cash flow from operation. 
As a result of the cash flow dynamic and the confidence in our long-term outlook, our board of directors authorized an increase in the company’s quarterly cash dividend raising it 8% from $0.25 to $0.27. This marks the fifth increase in six years that the board has raised the dividend and reports our continued commitment to return cash to shareholders. One point regarding our capital expenditures, we are, we believe on track with our goal, we are approximately spending 4% of sales for the year.
With that, I would like to turn it back over to Doug for a perspective on the balance of the year.

Looking towards the balance of the year, we believe that the operating environment in the second half is likely to be different than what we have seen in the first two quarters. In particular, we expect to face more challenging comparables as our sales performance improved during the second half of 2009, i.e., last year. 
In addition, while it’s difficult to say to what extent our first half performance was aided by restocking, it is clear that this benefit will not continue indefinitely as we progress through the balance of 2010. As we begin Q3, while business momentum appears solid driven by our strong new win performance, with substandard restocking benefits that aided Q1 and Q2 would appear to be subsiding. 
Finally, as economic and political volatility around the globe remains, we expect currencies to continue to fluctuate. As a large portion of our results are denominated in Euros, this will represent a head win during the second half of 2010 at current exchange rates when compared to year ago.
That said, as Kevin mentioned current hedging strategy should begin to reduce the volatility later in the year. So, what does all this mean? In order for IFF to be successful, we must continue to executive our plans, anticipate challenges and win in the marketplace every day.
We will focus on the areas we can control and will continue to be disciplined in the management cost as we look to mitigate some of these external pressures. The net result is that while we are cautious in our outlook, we believe the strength of the first half combined with our disciplined approach in the second will allow us to deliver results that have not been achieved over the last decade.
Specifically, we should see our local currency sales finish this year well above our long-term target and EPS will grow at a strong double-digit rate.
In summary, as we reflect back on the first six months of 2010, I would like to take a moment and congratulate the entire IFF team for all their accomplishments. Our performance year-to-date has been very strong driven in large part by the hard work and dedication across the organization. We would not have been able to achieve these strong financial improvements without excellent contributions from our employees. Suffice to say, our Board were complimentary to the organization on the breadth and the depth of the results.
As we look forward to the next six months, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic. While we have entered the second half with solid momentum, our visibility through the balance of the year remains limited given the evolving landscape particularly in developed markets.
In addition, as the restocking phenomenon must debate, we believe that the progress achieved in the first half, new wins in particular should continue to drive our disciplined growth strategy, and we are further exited about our growth prospects flowing out of our intensive strategy development project currently underway. 
Our goal entering 2010 was to return to local currency sales growth and improve our overall profitability. While we are only six months into the year, we are confident we should surpass these initial goals and achieve results above our long-term targets.
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you.

I think the real answer to your question hinges upon the deliberation that the management group will have with the board late this year, this calendar year of surrounding the strategy work that’s going on. 
It is such a comprehensive review that’s being undertaken of the company and it’s businesses, regions, customers, categories and so on that we will help with recommendations, will recommendations suggest a retention as the existing financial metrics or raise them or lower them, all that is yet to be played. 
I realistically don’t think anything, but equal or better are options and I’m confident we can do that. As you go through review that we have, it’s shown many, many parts the business are very successful, but as you probably expect review also identifies areas for improvement and that is what we are investigating and if those improvements can be delivered in a cost effective manner for the shareholders, then that would suggest a revision to the goals, but that is premature at this point.

Good morning and good afternoon and good evening to everyone. Before reviewing our recent results I would like to briefly update you on the progress of our strategic review.
Historically, at IFF we have evaluated all of our business sectors, whether customers, regions and categories, by subtracting our operating cost and taxes from our sales to determine profits. This approach, however, did not take into consideration the other costs that went in the sale, such as capital investments.
As part of our strategic review, we now have incorporated all costs to create a more robust fact base across our entire business portfolio. During the evaluation process we reconfirmed that both our Flavor and Fragrances businesses are sound.
Like most businesses, however, it appears there are areas where we have the potential to accelerate our top line growth by placing greater emphasis on the right categories, regions and customers, and improve our overall profitability by implementing margin enhancing solutions such as cost reduction or changes to our pricing on parts of the portfolio that are underperforming.
Now, I know many of you are eager to hear the full specifics of our review, but you can appreciate that we do not wish to divulge specifics for obvious competitive reasons.
In our next phase, which will take us through the balance of this year, I have asked our company leaders to develop solutions in those areas where we think we have the opportunity to improve. We will begin to incorporate these solutions into our 2011 plan.
Now, we won’t specify all parts of our strategic work. There are a few areas that I can cover. First, innovation remains a very important aspect of our business, both to date and into the future.
During our third quarter, we created a new position of Senior Vice President, Research and Development to which we promoted Dr. Ahmet Baydar to fill the role. Ahmet Baydar will be responsible for leading IFF’s efforts in innovation, technological development, and external collaborations, all of which are vital to our ability to serve our customers well and generate innovative solutions and new products to drive our future growth. Dr. Baydar has an extensive background in, both Flavor and Fragrance R&D, making him well suited for this key leadership position. Reporting directly to me, he has joined our senior leadership team and has the full support of the company and our Board in pursuit of his goals. So within R&D the trends in health and wellness are very attractive.
As we all try to live a healthier lifestyle, we are in search of foods that have less sugar, less salt, less fat but still taste great. Starting from a position of strength, we already invest substantial resources in the discovery and the development of molecules, natural ingredients, and delivery systems.
I am pleased to report and Hernan will go into greater detail that our health and wellness tools such as sugar and salt reduction solutions have led to a very high success rate with our customers in this quarter. My expectation is that as we reemphasize our investments in this area, we will continue to capitalize on this dynamic trend.
From a geographic perspective, the emerging markets will continue to be a critical component of our company’s long-term global strategy. IFF already has a large percentage of sales in the emerging markets as well as a high market share position relative to our overall portfolio. Year-to-date through September sales to emerging markets accounted for 44% of our total global sales. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on these markets due to their attractive growth rates.
Turning to our recent performance in Q3, I would like to provide a brief overview of our results. Our third quarter performance marks the continuation of excellent results. Our worldwide local currency sales once again grew double digits as all categories performed at or above expectations.
Both the Flavor and Fragrance teams continue to be successful in winning key new business that supported our strong growth. This outstanding top line performance combined with our continued focus on cost discipline enable us to deliver a margin profile of 18.3% that has not been achieved in over five years. The end result was extremely positive as adjusted Q3 earnings per share grew 20% to $0.98, an all time company high.
Now before passing on to Nicolas Mirzayantz, I would like to highlight two areas where IFF as an organization has excelled. First, as we completed the closure of (inaudible) manufacturing facility, which was part of our European restructuring announced last September, I would like to acknowledge all the employees for their hard work and their dedication and their professionalism, because of their efforts our customers continued to enjoy the outstanding service they had to come to expect even while this difficult change was underway.
Second, in early October we were recognized as one of the top performing global suppliers by Proctor & Gamble. For the second consecutive year our expertise in innovation, relationship management, commercial proactiveness and supply chain integration were acknowledged. My hat is off to the entire organization for this excellent achievement.
Once the team has concluded their prepared remarks, I plan to follow up with some perspectives on our fourth quarter outlook and the full year.
With that, I will like to introduce our Group President, Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz.

I am happy to report that local currency sales in the third quarter increased 15% as all regions reported double-digit growth. Our strong performance was once again driven by our ability to win important new business.
As our customers are searching for new and unique experiences for their brands, the demand for innovation and product superiority is high. Our in-depth consumer insight and superior creativity, combined with our cutting edge delivery systems, such as encapsulation are helping us satisfy their demand. This has driven our year-to-date results as we are now onto the fifth consecutive quarter of local currency growth.
In the fine fragrance and beauty care category, local currency sales grew 24%. Fine fragrance results continued to grow double-digit as key new wins drove the largest portion of our growth, highlighted by an exceptional performance in Europe and Latin America.
Some of our global key new launches included Armani Acqua di Gioia, Calvin Klein Beauty and (inaudible). The balance can be accredited to volume gains including some portion of restocking.
It is worth noting that in one of the most dynamic fragrance market in the world, Brazil, we are growing more than twice the market. Achievements similar to these are being realized worldwide, which helped drove growth absolute sales dollar above our previous record, higher than 2007 result.
In beauty care, hair care and toiletries once again achieved excellent results, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Our continued success can be credited to a long-standing presence and consumer insight investment within the emerging markets. In these markets growth in excess of 40% was achieved.
Our functional fragrance business continues to perform well, increasing 6% in local currency sales, despite a most challenging 9% year-over-year comparable in 2009.
Fabric care performance remained solid as new wins in Europe aided results. In Home care we grew double-digit as we continue to benefit access to new business. In personal wash, success in Greater Asia continued as reported strong results in this region.
Finally, Fragrance Ingredients local currency sales increased 18% as continued improvement in underlying demand drove results. While I am extremely pleased with our double-digit growth across all regions, I must say that our performance in the emerging market was outstanding.
So a strong trend seeing over the previous five quarters have continued as sales in our emerging markets grew 19% in the quarter. Brazil, Russia, India and China combined grew double digits 20% plus driven by new win performance and increased volume.
The fine fragrance and beauty care categories are exhibiting the strongest results in these regions with Latin America contributing approximately one-third of total Fragrance dollar growth. Our longstanding presence among with key investment like our March 2009 opening of our São Paulo Creative Center are strengthening our consumer understanding and leading to a broad market growth.
From a profitability standpoint, excluding a $2 million charge related to ongoing restructuring efforts in Europe this quarter and $11 million related to restructuring cost in the prior year period, adjusted operating profit grew a very strong 23% or $13 million to $71 million.
Our strong sales, favorable input cost and ongoing profit improvement initiatives drove 190 basis point improvements in adjusted operating margin to 19%. As we progressed to the fourth quarter, we are optimistic about our stock. As the benefits of restocking are subsiding, new win performance continued to be strong.

Emerging market performance continues to outpace the rest of the world as countries like Brazil, Russia, India and China combined grew over 15%. As a result, our emerging market presence in Flavors has grown to approximately 46% of sales. Our strong position in these key emerging markets continue to bode well for future flavor results, even the expected higher gross rate in these markets versus the rest of the world.
Performance in North America was robust, growing 9% as our team did an excellent job winning new business. The strong trends we experienced in the first half continued into the third quarter as both confectionary and beverage grew at a double-digit rate.
In EAME, local currency sales increased 13% over the prior year quarter as all categories reported solid results. Beverages continued to be a standout as increased volumes and new wins relate to a double-digit performance for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Local currency sales in Latin America grew 7% as double-digit growth in confectionary, savory, and dairy were achieved. Finally, in Greater Asia, local currency sales were up 11% as higher volumes and new wins fueled positive results across all categories.
As Doug noted earlier, an important component to our success this quarter has been our ability to capitalize on health and wellness trends.
I am pleased to report that our innovative tools such as sweetness enhancement and sodium reduction have lately very high success rate with our customers, a critical component to our new win performance this quarter. The combination of our exceptionally creative themes alongside these innovative tools allow us to work closely with our customer, defend existing business and get a foothold into new wins in this important area.
Turning to profit, Flavors’ operating profit increased 15% or $8 million to $63 million in the third quarter, driven by accelerated sales growth, improving input cost and our continued margin improvement initiatives. Operating profit margin improved 100 basis points to 21% versus 20% in the prior year period.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, I expect local currency sales growth to remain strong, although growth levels may begin to approach more normalized levels.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Kevin.

We are extremely pleased with our financial results in the third quarter. As you can imagine a 13% local currency sales growth was a key driver to our success and it had a considerable impact on the P&L.Looki",1016,"Thank you, Hernan, and good day to everyone. We are extremely pleased with our financial results in the third quarter. As you can imagine a 13% local currency sales growth was a key driver to our success and it had a considerable impact on the P&L.
Looking at the specifics of our top line performance, I would like to highlight that new wins continue to drive results. As expected volume trends while strong did slow relative to the first half due to a reduction in restocking and more challenging year-over-year comparables. In fact, for the first time this year, sales associated with new business wins accounted for a larger percentage of the overall growth and our volume growth from existing business.
It’s also worth noting that the reduction in volume was more pronounced in Fragrances as the benefits of restocking have slowed. Our operational leverage from our strong sales performance, when combined with lower input costs and our continued focus on efficiencies, drove an accelerated 15% increase in gross profit dollars, and when combined with the strict discipline in the management of our other cost, IFF benefited from further operating leverage to delivering 18% growth in our adjusted operating profit. This allowed our adjusted operating profit margin to rise 140 basis points to 18.3%.
Clearly, the continued benefit of growth leverage was also seen in our strong EPS performance. In the quarter, adjusted EPS grew 20% setting a company record for the highest quarterly EPS ever reported.
Turning to input costs, we continue to see year-over-year decreases in the P&L, driven by the reduction of higher cost inventory. As expected in the quarter, input cost decreased 3% versus the year ago period. Regarding our fourth-quarter outlook, we do anticipate that in cost should remain marginally favorable versus a year ago figures.
As we have noted in the past, while IFF has realized the benefits of lower input costs through the first nine months of this year, overall material costs remain above historical levels.
Importantly, while these costs remain elevated, we have been able to deliver gross margin improvements that have brought us back to gross margin levels not seen since 2006 and 2007. This can be attributed to our proactive efforts to take strategic pricing to offset cost pressures by driving margin enhancing innovation into our portfolio and achieving efficiencies throughout our supply chain.
Given that we expect input cost pressure to build in 2011, our continued efforts to drive margin improvements will be critical as we look to offset any potential pressures.
From an overhead cost standpoint, adjusted research, selling and administrative expenses or RSA as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points to 24.1%, driven by our strong growth, which resulted in additional incentive compensation provisions and other spending to support this growth.
Importantly, RSA as a percentage of sales declined 220 basis points from the second quarter, an indication of our continued discipline. Within RSAs, R&D expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points to 7.9%; however, on an absolute basis, R&D expense increased approximately $4 million as higher investments were made to support growth initiatives. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we certainly will continue to maintain strict discipline in the management of our fixed cost structure.
Turning to currency, the euro declined in value year-over-year against the U.S. dollar as expected which did pressure our results. In the past, we’ve said that for every 1% strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar, we expect a plus or minus $0.02 impact on our EPS on an annual basis. This indeed was the case in Q3 as both the profits and balance sheet activities combined negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.07
Looking ahead, if currency rates stay where they are today, including the euro at 1.40, we expect to face only modest pressure in Q4. As we had previously communicated, we have also implemented hedging strategies in order to protect our levels of euro-based profits at the local affiliate level.
Specifically, related to our Q4 forecast, we believe there will only be a limited impact on our results from these hedging strategies as we’re able to create hedges, which should secure local euro profits as foreign exchange rates very close to market levels.
Turning to our EPS reconciliation, we continue to see an improved performance. The combination of strong operational results as well as below the line leverage drove a 20% increase versus the year ago period.
As we move from our adjusted EPS to our reported EPS, I would like to note the $0.03 difference is entirely related to our previously announced European rationalization; a key effort focused on improving our Fragrance operations.
We continue to expect our total cost for this initiative to be approximately $31 million to $34 million with targeted annual cost savings of $17 million to $20 million beginning in 2011.
Importantly, as part of this initiative, we have finalized the former closure of the Drogheda, Ireland facility as well as the partial closure of our Haverhill, U.K. facility and expected we will begin to see the benefits fully realized in 2011.
In Q4 specifically, we continue to believe that some remaining transition costs will largely offset the benefits from the closure over this near-term quarter.
Finally, from a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in working capital efficiency versus the year ago period. While the tremendous sales growth seen in the first nine months of 2010 did place pressure on absolute levels, working capital increased only $21 million on a sales increase of $252 million.
This is a clear indication that our concentrated efforts are continuing to pay dividends. This efficiency, when combined with relative business strength in the quarter, drove an $8 million increase year-over-year in cash flow from operations.
Finally, a quick update and note regarding our capital expenditures, we continue to believe we will spend approximately 4% of sales for the full year 2010.
With that, I would like to turn it back over to Doug for his perspective on the fourth quarter and the full year.

Turning to our cost structure, we continue to believe that input costs will remain marginally favorable in the fourth quarter, though we are seeing an increasing trend in some of our costs. I would also like to remind you that the fourth quarter is seasonably our smallest quarter, which has implications on our gross margin, lower than our year-to-date results.

Now as a result of the above mentioned fourth quarter commentary, combined with our performance year-to-date, we expect both local currency and adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2010 to grow at least double digits.
In summary, we are extremely pleased that we have achieved another record quarter for our shareholders. This performance is a testament to the passion and the commitment to all the employees here at IFF. As we look forward, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic, but are confident that our business trends, supported by our new win performance will remain strong.
The combination of this underlying strength and the insights being gained from our strategy review should bode well for future performance. I would like to acknowledge the many parts of our organization for their significant contributions to this strategy process. Their findings and the ensuing actions are leading to continued optimism as we move forward and start implementing actions in 2011.
The net result is that, we expect 2010 to be a pivotal year not only from our robust financial performance, but also our ability to incorporate our strategic findings to maximize shareholder value going into the future. As we look towards 2011, we are confident we will continue to strengthen our organization ensuring our ability to win in the marketplace.
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions you might have.

Even though that’s incorporated into your two-year analysis, the impact of our ability to drive elevated levels of growth will ultimately be driven by our win performance. It’s clear at least from our perspective that we have a strong pipeline that looks good, but I am not so sure that we can ultimately say that we’re going to be able to grow in high single digits for ever and I think that’s probably the way respond to the question.

Really starting from the standpoint of looking into 2011 in relative growth rates, I mean there are, obviously, macroeconomic factors that we are assuming no significant economic trend down as I answer the question. So, we’ve got a pretty good pipeline. We’ve got a pretty good win rate and some confidence going into next year.
I think there is an area around what I would call quality of growth that we should probably talk a little bit about and that’s really flowed out of the strategy review we’ve had and that’s really come about in dissecting the company’s business. We’ve really earmarked some parts and most parts fortunately, which are clearly good growth, and by that, it’s good volume gains but also a healthy and attractive margins for us.
There is also some, I guess, I would call it not so good growth, which may be contribution to the top line that margins we don’t find attractive and over time we will look to either improve those businesses or reemphasize parts elsewhere. So, I think there is a potential for an impact on our top line that maybe positive on the bottom line though not necessarily positive on the top line. So that overall mix should improve going forward. Subject to gaining good volume we’ve got and the leverages that we’ve seen, I think Kevin would respond saying we’re heading towards that margin as being much more sustainable, which is our goal.

So, the comparables that we will face next year are going to be quite robust in the first half of 2010. So, as you’re thinking through that, clearly there is going to be greater challenges in the first half versus the second half.
I think that on the margin question, it’s about continued discipline and nothing is ever guaranteed as it relates to that. If we have input cost pressures we’re going to have to be dedicated in terms of potential pricing actions, we’re going to have to be dedicated in terms of ensuring we deliver against our restructuring initiatives that we’ve promised. So, it’s a requirement that day in day out we’ve got to stay continued focused and disciplined in the management of our cost to ensure that we can get to those kind of profit margins that you’re alluding to.

During the first half of 2010 we did have a considerable impact reversal. However, more recently in Q3 we did perform rather well, growing 7% in local currency, specifically in confectionaries, savory and dairy. So, basically I feel that we are coming back. We have a strong pipeline and we have now seen returning today the normal growth of that we used to have in Latin America. The pipeline is strong, the success rate now it’s coming very good. So my expectation is to really come back to the pervious performance of 2007 and ‘08.

We’ve obviously drawn a number of conclusions from the strategy review that’s, in the simple sense some businesses are better than others. We’re a stubborn bunch and we’re fighting bunch so the challenge is, now we’ve understood some of the business isn’t as profitable as we probably wanted, how do we get it that way and then over time try to remedy those fixes. If we haven’t and I won’t put timeframes around this, but if we haven’t achieved the remedies, mitigated those problems into the future then we probably would walk away from some businesses, but the areas that we’ve identified, we have also identified solutions and fixes which will need to put in to place.
I want to just build on the comment that Kevin made a minute ago, which is on the heels of what is truly shaping up to be splendid year in 2010 for IFF going into next year, a slower level of growth will still be on our blended average basis, over a couple of results, a terrific result. So, we will be looking for growth next year, but we’ll call it a more normalized level because on this call I have already indicated, we expect to finish the year more than double digits on the top line. So next year will certainly be an incredibly comparable versus year.

And then just the other thing I wanted to just follow up on was, this is more backward looking, but when would you say the momentum really changed internally for you in terms of win rates? Because my guess would be that a lot of commercialization you are seeing right now is briefs that have been won, I don’t know is it the past a year or 18 months and the companies and manufacturers were holding back on launching until they felt better about the state of the world. Is that fair and when would you say that inflection point really occurred?
