I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. But first, I'll comment about foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding Sun, the actual currency benefit we saw this quarter was less than our guidance by approximately 2% for both new license revenue and total revenue. However, even with currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were able to drive solid results this quarter as we beat our new license revenue guidance, beat our total revenue guidance, and we're at the high end of the EPS range, with record Q3 earnings per share. Q3 was a solid quarter. Before reviewing our income statement, I'd like to remind everyone that our guidance from last quarter excluded Sun. In discussing revenue, I will provide revenue results as reported. And for some key growth rates, I will exclude Sun revenue to align the results to our guidance from last quarter. In the third quarter, our new Software license revenues were $1.7 billion, including $46 million from Sun. New Software license revenues were up 13% and up 10% excluding Sun. This 10% growth beat the high end of our guidance range, calling for 9% growth. The Americas grew 22%, EMEA was up 3% and Asia was up 12%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business. And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually-large deals. Technology new license revenues were $1.2 billion, up 11%, as the Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 2%, and Asia was up 9%. Applications new license revenues were $477 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia was up 29%. Our Software license updates and product support revenues were $3.3 billion, including $25 million from Sun and up 12% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $273 million, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $224 million. Our Services revenues were $931 million, down 9% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Net total revenues were $6.5 billion, including $596 million from Sun. Total revenues for the quarter were up 18% and up 7% excluding Sun. Total revenues excluding Sun were at the high end of our guidance range even without the full benefit of currency tailwind included in our guidance. With some results now being included in our financial statements, non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 45%. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.9%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.38, at the high end of our Oracle-only EPS guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38. Earnings per share were up 9% from last year and include a $0.01 loss related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. In Q3, we repurchased 10.3 million shares at an average price of $24.28 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. Turning to the balance sheet, we have $17.5 billion in cash and investments. The days sales outstanding, excluding Sun, improved again to 47 days as compared to 49 days last year. Finally, we generated $8.0 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For star",731,"Thanks, Jeff. As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For starters, as Jeff mentioned, we exceeded the high point of our new license guidance with 10% growth in Software licenses excluding Sun. This clearly shows substantial strength in the Database, Middleware and Applications business. We also beat the high end of our total revenue guidance, with consistent strength in our Update and Support renewal.Results for our Application business were nothing short of stunning. We grew 21%, while SAP continues to shrink at a double-digit pace. Our Applications business is doing very well in all regions and in all verticals. And truly, no wonder, SAP is so unhappy. In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included, our operating margin was 45%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM. Our operating margin remains much higher than SAP's target, and we are now selling hardware. Regarding Sun, as you all know, the transaction closed at the end of January. So our Q3 results for Sun reflect a one month period, February, which would have been in the middle of their Q3. Sun's revenues for February were $596 million, which was far better than we expected and clearly demonstrates to us that customers are responding well to the acquisition. We believe the Oracle/Sun integration is off to a very strong start. We're moving forward quickly to implement the operational changes we described for you on January 27, and we continue to expect Sun to contribute $1.5 billion in non-GAAP operating income in fiscal year 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal year 2012. Now before I turn to guidance, let me just remind everyone that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. We will no longer be selling products at a loss as Sun did. As we promised in January, we've already ended or modified arrangements, where Sun resold other company's products at a loss. Just this change will immediately mean more profit on lower revenue. Second, we are now compensating our sales teams on margin, not just revenue. That has the effect of changing the sales mix from commodity system, where Sun lost money, to value-added systems, where Sun's differentiation clear to our customers. These two changes will baseline our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they will start to grow significantly next year. Now let me turn to guidance, which will include Sun. We believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. And the close rates I'm using for Software are more conservative than typical Q4 close rates for Software. For the coming quarter, assuming these exchange rates remain at current level, we expect there to be almost 3% positive currency effect on license growth rates and almost 4% effect on total revenue growth rates. With that, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 3% to 13%, up at current exchange rates and flat to up 10% in constant currency; Hardware product revenues are expected to range from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion at current exchange rates and actually at constant currency. Now these numbers exclude Hardware support revenues. These are just the Hardware product revenues.Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 36% to 41% at current exchange rates and 32% to 37% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 35% to 40% at current exchange rates and 31% to 36% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.52 to $0.56 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.46 last year and from $0.50 to $0.54 in constant currency. Now GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.37 to $0.41 using current exchange rates and $0.35 to $0.39 assuming constant currency. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for Q4, but may end up lower. Lastly, the Board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary competitor. Let me start with servers. Since we acquired Sun, we have embarked on putting together Cluster of Sun hardware running with our Database and Middleware software. That is, we have a collection of Sun machines interconnected by a modern InfiniBand network talking to storage also connected to the servers using a modern InfiniBand network. Actually, it is the best example of this clustered architecture, where we have collections of machines, storage and networks all built together with this offer in tuned for the software. What we've been able to do with Exadata -- and there will be other machines like our Clusters, like Exadata coming in out for Middleware applications, pretty much all the software that we sell. It's not uncommon for an Exadata benchmark when going up against a big IBM pSeries machine to beat them by a factor of 10. Because they just don't have a clustered architecture, they're stuck with kind of an old-fashioned SMP architecture for transaction processing. So we're taking advantage of new technologies, not just in InfiniBand, by the way, but Flash, very large scale memory, integrated memories. You'll see all of that has allowed us to deliver stunning performance using, if you will, commodity parts. And not only do we run much faster than the IBM pSeries, but also our architecture is clustered, there are multiple servers, multiple pieces of storage, it's full [indiscernible]. There's no single point of failure, so it's much more reliable while delivering this fantastic performance. And finally, it's much lower in cost, because the components themselves, if you will, are commodities. The components that we call it the disk drives and memory and processors, which we assemble with our software. So again we think, we can challenge IBM on the high end of the server market, better performance, lower cost and much more reliability. In Applications, SAP is the leader. But their Technology that they use for their applications is a proprietary technology, a German programming language called ABAP [Advanced Business Application Programming], where later this year, and that's a 25-year-old technology. But it's still the center of their architecture and strategy for applications going forward is ABAP. The center of our strategy going forward is Java, and a modern service-oriented architecture. And during this calendar year, we will deliver our Fusion Applications. We've been working on them for a while, but we have rewritten or written in Java, all of our accounting software, all of our supply chain software, all of our HR software, our sales automation, our service automation software, it's all been rewritten in Java with a modern service-oriented architecture. And we're going to go compete with SAP's 25-year-old technology. The interesting thing is we're competing quite well against SAP now. We think once we deliver Fusion, we're going to be well-positioned to challenge for the number one slot. One of the important things about our Fusion Applications is they're designed not simply to run on premise, which of course they do. But they're all on-demand or if you prefer, cloud-ready. So we'll be delivering those applications, both by selling the software directly, kind of the old way of doing it, which is still the most popular way, by the way. We'll be selling the Fusion Applications integrated with our hardware, our servers and our storage and our networks. And we'll be selling it on the cloud, all modern service-oriented 21st century stuff, competing against SAP. We think SAP is vulnerable. And we can take them on in a variety of industries. The other thing that we're doing, that SAP is not doing, is we're emphasizing industry functionality. So it's not just technology where we're competing with SAP, we're also competing with them in functionality. So we think we have much more functionality for a telco, a phone company, a large-scale retail operation, in insurance and in banking. We have industry-specific applications for a variety of industries. Healthcare, I could go on. So our strategy is to have a much better industry focus than SAP, in terms of functionality, and a much more modern technology underlying all of that functionality. Again it's a company that we think is vulnerable, and we think we have an excellent chance of becoming number one in Applications. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles."

It's an organization I thought did a great job integrating the Sun reps quickly. They executed very well as you can see within days and in most weeks, we have the accounts and territories and comp plans all assigned. Reps quickly got back in front of customers and that was a key factor in the quarter. And they stayed focused and built pipelines, so a great job all the way around the world. All the customer data has been converted over to Oracle systems, and pipeline and forecasting processes have been standardized. On the customer side, I would say, customers, I think the best word is intrigued with our strategy. And a good example of that is we had a CIO Summit yesterday in Atlanta, that's a day and a half actually. We were expecting about 125 CIOs. We invited -- we got over 175. 85% of them traveled to get them from surrounding states and 91% of them were first-time attendees to this type of event. So again our competitors' customers do come and hear what we have to say. They just want to know what's happening. And I think they sense that there's some sort of transformation in the industry that's possible based on what we're doing, and they want to know exactly what we're planning. So we're going to do a lot more of that. We're just getting started. We have four more CIO summits and CFO Summit and a CSO Summit in the next three months. So I'll keep my frequent flyer miles in. But we need to take advantage of this while it's there because we can an audience with almost anyone right now. So that's the ones that are back in that respect. By product area, let me start off with Database. Exadata, as we've been talking about in recent quarters, the pipeline continues to grow significantly. And what's changing now is we're getting multiple orders, multiple machines in a single order. And about 40% of our customers purchase multiple systems in the past quarter. I think Exadata has also generally been responsible, partially responsible for generating a lot of the interest in our strategy because it's a good example of what can happen when you synchronize innovation across Hardware and Software, which is hard to do in this industry. Key database wins include live technologies. That was a ULA for a Database, Middleware apps, kind of wall-to-wall Oracle. And I have told them I would mention him because he negotiated the deal at the Sun's basketball game on a Friday night and still got it done. Turkcell, which was a telco in the Middle East. I mentioned them because this is another ULA for Database, Middleware, including Exadata, ERP and CRM. They've been also a good customer on the comp side of it. So they're as close to a telco in a box strategy that we're embarking on. As you can get, they pretty much do everything on Oracle now. And then Buenos Aires city government and I mentioned them because they migrated to Oracle database 11g for the first time. They were an Informix customer. So I just kind of like to remind people, there still a lot of legacy databases out there like Informix and Sybase and DB2 that we get customers from every quarter. And Buenos Aires city government said, they're getting 80% improvement in performance. They're running that on Oracle Unbreakable Linux. We had some good Linux wins in the quarter, including Victoria University, Telkom SA, Reuters and GE Security. Switching to Middleware, I just kind of like to remind people of the skill that we've achieved in Middleware with 90,000 customers now, and that's not including the 20,000 apps customers that run Middleware with our apps. And so that's going very well. The upgrade cycle from 11g, I talked about 11g lines for the last couple of quarters. On average, it's taking customers about four to eight months, so that upgrade cycle is continuing as we expected, actually a little better than the last cycle. And there are many customers who are already live on the product. There are some components that are yet to ship as part of 11g. Over the next 12 months, they will be coming out. The ones that are scheduled are business process management, Tuxedo, enterprise content management, imaging and process management, Oracle BI enterprise edition. That will generate more upgrades and more uptake of related components. Now also in past calls, I talked about how important it was to get the ISPs to support our Middleware stat. That's driving adoption as well. So in this past Q3, we had 18 key ISP partners. Select components, they're major components of our Middleware to standardize on. That included in the North America, Landmark Graphics, SunGard, Intuit, Cerner and EMEA IFS and LHS. So we have a partner technical services organization that's part of development and they've trained over 11,000 consultants globally and developers on 11g in the last nine months. And so that's a key part of getting that adoption. We're starting to see the benefit of that now. Key customer wins, Cox Communications, U.S. Department of Transportation selected us over WebCenter to do their portal for their hazardous materials information system. Kaiser Permanente chose us for BI over Cognos. In the EPM area, we had wins with Carlyle Group and Herbalife and then the management of standardizing University of Texas. In the Applications area, Larry mentioned our competition with SAP. I'm certainly seeing a shift there, where I would say two years ago, SAP was considered a safe choice even if the technology was a little bit old and complex to implement and all that. But that seems to be changed as customers appear more nervous about their technology and strategic directions and they're more open to discussing things with Oracle, even as SAP customers and their largest customers. So that's a change that we're seeing. And secondly, they didn't have anything new to talk about. It's the same product, same technology. And basically, they're focused on general ledger. And the industry gets moving broader than that to include industry applications and entire systems. So here are some key wins over SAP in the quarter: IBCO, a large privately held food and beverage company in the United Arab Emirates; D&A's Distribution, one of the nation's leading technology distributors; a really important one, NBN Co. and this is a new company and we don't get these often. But the government of Australia has a national initiative to build a national broadband network from scratch. This is a mandate by the government. It will be the single-largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australian history, and the Chief Operating Officer selected Oracle. He was just actually at our headquarters two weeks ago and he wants to go wall-to-wall Oracle and he selected us over SAP. We beat them at Genuine Parts, Nomura Holdings. We had a good quarter with PeopleSoft. PeapleSoft beat them at Carlyle Group, Alberta Health Services, UBS, Bank of America, Department of Energy and are holding many more here, too many to list. CRM on-demand, we had key wins against sales force at General Motors, SAIC, Broadcom, Merck, Avis and Starbucks and important wins for CRM on-premise at U.S. Immigration and Northwestern Mutual. The vertical Applications did well. They actually grew faster than the overall apps number, and we saw a rebound in the retail, GBU, a big one at our hold, and Communications GBU had wins, three each against the MDOCS converse and convergence rebuilding in the quarter. Financial Services has wins at Central Bank of UAE, Union Bank of Jordan and National Australia Bank. An important win in enterprise taxation product, we had the State of Nevada selected for unemployment insurance. And the way these deals work, they take one tax at a time. And if we do this well, which we plan to do, there'll be other taxes, they migrate to the platform and we charge for those as well. On the Hardware side of it, since we have started talking about that as well in these calls, we had a good win with Sun Ray. This is our thin client with one of the branches of the armed services, which I can't name. But they contracted to deploy a high-secure and multi-level security solution with our thin client device. And this is just the beginning. This is going to be scheduled across the distributed federal network. And they have a planned growth across other command in the architecture over time. We had a win at 1&1 Internet, the world's number one web hosting company based in Germany, and that was 6000 and 9000 SPARC Enterprise servers. MTN Group in Nigeria has 21 countries, 90 million subscribers of big telco and Sun SPARC Servers Enterprise (sic) [Enterprise Servers] T5000. And then we had a top 10 U.S. bank that replaced Tandem and HP. That was a replacement there when a major financial services company that liked our solid state disk and hybrid arrays, we replaced EMC there. They, in fact, they moved EMC from the supply list when they saw the performance. I said a lot of good wins right down on the server side of it, more on the way to the pipeline seems to be there. And lastly, I'll mention, a large U.S. federal agency, which you can probably guess, that selected an M8000. And that one will support 5 million pages of handwritten census data that's been currently being collected probably in your mailbox right now, converted into digital format using OCR offletting [ph] on Sun servers. So with that, we're pretty excited about the pipeline and what's happening, as you can see. Lots more are out there. I'll turn it back over."

And just, operationally, the way we work with our customers has already changed. As you know, we've moved to a build-to-order model versus build-to-stock model. And we're not encouraging stocking in general even with our resellers, such that customers can order exactly the box they want. In that way, we can optimize through the time it takes to get them exactly that box. And that obviously also reduces any kind of obsolescence or inventory issues for us. That's really in place now for a while and really moving along very, very quickly. The regular contractual terms, et cetera, the way we're working with our partners, many of them recognized that the old model really didn't work for either them or for customers, and surely not for Sun, and are very, very open to readjusting those. And many of those have already been completely adjusted faster than I originally expected. As far as maintenance or our product support, it turns out that many of our customers are really in need of higher quality of supports that really only Sun can give them and the Sun Oracle combination. And they are really looking to support, that is, both hardware and software integrated more and more. And so we're really moving ahead, both technically and operationally, to be able to deliver a more integrated support model for them. And we do expect that customers are very happy to purchase their support directly from Sun and not from others, simply because the level of support and engineering support that they need really can best, if not only, be done by us at Oracle. So we expect that to be very significant financially, ultimately, and that should start it, of course."

And so I'll tell you the best way for you to judge what's going to happen is both to use our guidance and also to really look at what Q4 was. This Q3, if you think about it, it was a February. By the time everybody knew where the water fountain was, it was halfway through February would think. So there's no way to extrapolate from this Q3 anywhere. Breaking it out is really not possible, because you know us, we start integrating right away. Everybody is an Oracle employee as much as possible. So obviously, selling hardware has lower gross margins than selling software, regardless. There's just no way to compare it. So our expenses are not a big number in comparison to our revenues. So operating margins, at least, for a while, will be lower, and you can figure that out from the guidance. So expenses grow quickly, but our revenues are growing quickly also. And you'll be able to really better extrapolate after you see Q4, frankly."

We're winning large deals in retail, large deals in banking, large deals in telecommunications. And that's dragging a lot of ERP and CRM applications with them. We're doing well in pharma, there are bunch of industries, healthcare in general. There are bunch of industries where we're very, very strong, and we have applications that SAP simply does not have. So one of our strategies was to beat SAP in CRM, which we do, and then beat SAP in industry-specific vertical applications. For example, the telecommunication company has applications to provision. You call up AT&T and you turn on your iPhone and you want to turn on interactive TV, well, that provisioning software -- when you provision an application in a lot of telcos, when you provision an application, that's the Oracle software that's been automatically turning on those services for you. SAP has nothing like that. When you receive your bill, that's an Oracle application that's sending you the bill. SAP has nothing like that. When you deposit money in your savings account, that's an Oracle application that keeps track -- literally an Oracle-banking application that keeps track. SAP doesn't have that. And I can go on and on in a variety of industries where we have industry functionality that they don't have. So that gives us opportunities that are simply not available to them. We also -- we sell these applications a piece at a time, rather than a big rip-and-replace strategy. So what people aren't doing big ERP buys or big -- by the way, ERP is rather mature market. We think we're competing very well in ERP, but it is a mature market. And SAP, it's to some degree, is saturated. And SAP is not a diversified company in terms of their application suite. They don't have a lot of what you're calling edge applications, they don't have a lot of industry-specific applications and their technology is fraying around the edges. So some of it is our good execution, I think, and some of it is probably SAP. We were at [indiscernible] setting -- we were up 26% in ERP. I suspect that, that's a lot better than what SAP is seeing. So we're taking advantage of our strategy that we think is working. We're taking advantage of their weakness. And we think we're going to get stronger while they get weaker. I'm sorry to go on for so long, but let me say that their strategy right now is to try to sell ERP to customers that have less than [ph] 100 employees. That's their new strategy, business by design, which has been, I guess, three years late. And by the way, if it's successful, you can't make a lot of money selling ERP to companies with less than 100 people. So we think that's a strategy that goes nowhere. It's a different technology than they currently sell, it's a different sales force, it's  different customers than they currently sell to, we think it's a massive destruction for them. Well, our strategy is not to find all new customers, it's to sell more to existing customers, sell industry-specific apps to existing customers, sell technology upgrades to existing customers. We think they've made a fundamental strategic mistake. We think they have kind of lost their way. And if they don't want to be number one, we sure do."

First of all, I want to make sure you understand that the Sun product line continues in its current form, so there is no cutting back on the Sun product line beyond where we're at. Those products are actually expanding. We've got some incredible products coming up. I mean, the focus of Oracle and the Oracle-Sun combination is on reselling our intellectual property. So if you understand that, then you realize that in most places, there are certain areas in which, obviously, we have components from third parties in our equipment and all that, but the real value is in our intellectual property, the way we bring it all together, et cetera. That's the focus of the company. Now we do resell some other folks' products, we do still are winding down the resale of the Hitachi storage servers, obviously, we're very focused on our customers and for those, there'll be very steady wind down period and we're managing those together with Hitachi. Hitachi is a very long-term partner of Oracle and Sun and things are going very well there. But the big focus of selling other people's -- those storage servers, that focus is really going to be going on to some of our own products, so we've talked about already. So that's already in place. There are few other, reselling other people software and things like that. And as you know, Heather, that's not what we focus on here in Oracle.

We got a number of large customers lined up to take the product this calendar year. We are, again, this is years and years of efforts. We put into writing all of this in Java. Modern architecture, modern order orchestration, I can go on and on, but this is 21st century technology. It's really the only application suite. Even Salesforce.com was kind of late 20th century technology. So we think we're going to have huge competitive advantage. Customers like it very much because of the fact that it is so. So they can start using some of these buzzwords, they can use BPELs [Business Process Execution Languages] to link the different applications, the different Web services together. It is no rip-and-replace strategy, they can take parts of it at a time and gradually adopt Fusion. It has a modern Web 2.0 user interface. It's low cost to deploy because everything's written on this. It's one technology stack, Java technology stack, all in our Fusion Middleware. The customers that have seen see huge value in the built-in business intelligence. So BI is not an add-on to Fusion, BI is built into Fusion. The application that you install at your site is the same as the application you run on a cloud, our cloud or someone else's. So those generate a huge amount of enthusiasm.

So pure or four-legged sales calls, as we call them, and shift away from fulfillment and expand the market. So we're going to direct them into the mid-market and key areas where we don't have good coverage. We're hiring pretty aggressively right now on the high end to make sure we have a hardtop 1,000 account service directly by Oracle reps and by Oracle support. And we're also shifting the account model to pay on net, in other words, Sun paid on gross. So other reps were indifferent to whether a partner sold it or we sold it. And we've always paid on net, in other words, what we get after we paid the partner, and that tends to shift things pretty quickly.

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. But first, I'll comment about foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding Sun, the actual currency benefit we saw this quarter was less than our guidance by approximately 2% for both new license revenue and total revenue. However, even with currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were able to drive solid results this quarter as we beat our new license revenue guidance, beat our total revenue guidance, and we're at the high end of the EPS range, with record Q3 earnings per share. Q3 was a solid quarter. Before reviewing our income statement, I'd like to remind everyone that our guidance from last quarter excluded Sun. In discussing revenue, I will provide revenue results as reported. And for some key growth rates, I will exclude Sun revenue to align the results to our guidance from last quarter. In the third quarter, our new Software license revenues were $1.7 billion, including $46 million from Sun. New Software license revenues were up 13% and up 10% excluding Sun. This 10% growth beat the high end of our guidance range, calling for 9% growth. The Americas grew 22%, EMEA was up 3% and Asia was up 12%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business. And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually-large deals. Technology new license revenues were $1.2 billion, up 11%, as the Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 2%, and Asia was up 9%. Applications new license revenues were $477 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia was up 29%. Our Software license updates and product support revenues were $3.3 billion, including $25 million from Sun and up 12% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $273 million, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $224 million. Our Services revenues were $931 million, down 9% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Net total revenues were $6.5 billion, including $596 million from Sun. Total revenues for the quarter were up 18% and up 7% excluding Sun. Total revenues excluding Sun were at the high end of our guidance range even without the full benefit of currency tailwind included in our guidance. With some results now being included in our financial statements, non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 45%. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.9%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.38, at the high end of our Oracle-only EPS guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38. Earnings per share were up 9% from last year and include a $0.01 loss related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. In Q3, we repurchased 10.3 million shares at an average price of $24.28 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. Turning to the balance sheet, we have $17.5 billion in cash and investments. The days sales outstanding, excluding Sun, improved again to 47 days as compared to 49 days last year. Finally, we generated $8.0 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For star",731,"Thanks, Jeff. As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For starters, as Jeff mentioned, we exceeded the high point of our new license guidance with 10% growth in Software licenses excluding Sun. This clearly shows substantial strength in the Database, Middleware and Applications business. We also beat the high end of our total revenue guidance, with consistent strength in our Update and Support renewal.Results for our Application business were nothing short of stunning. We grew 21%, while SAP continues to shrink at a double-digit pace. Our Applications business is doing very well in all regions and in all verticals. And truly, no wonder, SAP is so unhappy. In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included, our operating margin was 45%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM. Our operating margin remains much higher than SAP's target, and we are now selling hardware. Regarding Sun, as you all know, the transaction closed at the end of January. So our Q3 results for Sun reflect a one month period, February, which would have been in the middle of their Q3. Sun's revenues for February were $596 million, which was far better than we expected and clearly demonstrates to us that customers are responding well to the acquisition. We believe the Oracle/Sun integration is off to a very strong start. We're moving forward quickly to implement the operational changes we described for you on January 27, and we continue to expect Sun to contribute $1.5 billion in non-GAAP operating income in fiscal year 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal year 2012. Now before I turn to guidance, let me just remind everyone that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. We will no longer be selling products at a loss as Sun did. As we promised in January, we've already ended or modified arrangements, where Sun resold other company's products at a loss. Just this change will immediately mean more profit on lower revenue. Second, we are now compensating our sales teams on margin, not just revenue. That has the effect of changing the sales mix from commodity system, where Sun lost money, to value-added systems, where Sun's differentiation clear to our customers. These two changes will baseline our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they will start to grow significantly next year. Now let me turn to guidance, which will include Sun. We believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. And the close rates I'm using for Software are more conservative than typical Q4 close rates for Software. For the coming quarter, assuming these exchange rates remain at current level, we expect there to be almost 3% positive currency effect on license growth rates and almost 4% effect on total revenue growth rates. With that, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 3% to 13%, up at current exchange rates and flat to up 10% in constant currency; Hardware product revenues are expected to range from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion at current exchange rates and actually at constant currency. Now these numbers exclude Hardware support revenues. These are just the Hardware product revenues.Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 36% to 41% at current exchange rates and 32% to 37% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 35% to 40% at current exchange rates and 31% to 36% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.52 to $0.56 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.46 last year and from $0.50 to $0.54 in constant currency. Now GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.37 to $0.41 using current exchange rates and $0.35 to $0.39 assuming constant currency. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for Q4, but may end up lower. Lastly, the Board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader.

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary competitor. Let me start with servers. Since we acquired Sun, we have embarked on putting together Cluster of Sun hardware running with our Database and Middleware software. That is, we have a collection of Sun machines interconnected by a modern InfiniBand network talking to storage also connected to the servers using a modern InfiniBand network. Actually, it is the best example of this clustered architecture, where we have collections of machines, storage and networks all built together with this offer in tuned for the software. What we've been able to do with Exadata -- and there will be other machines like our Clusters, like Exadata coming in out for Middleware applications, pretty much all the software that we sell. It's not uncommon for an Exadata benchmark when going up against a big IBM pSeries machine to beat them by a factor of 10. Because they just don't have a clustered architecture, they're stuck with kind of an old-fashioned SMP architecture for transaction processing. So we're taking advantage of new technologies, not just in InfiniBand, by the way, but Flash, very large scale memory, integrated memories. You'll see all of that has allowed us to deliver stunning performance using, if you will, commodity parts. And not only do we run much faster than the IBM pSeries, but also our architecture is clustered, there are multiple servers, multiple pieces of storage, it's full [indiscernible]. There's no single point of failure, so it's much more reliable while delivering this fantastic performance. And finally, it's much lower in cost, because the components themselves, if you will, are commodities. The components that we call it the disk drives and memory and processors, which we assemble with our software. So again we think, we can challenge IBM on the high end of the server market, better performance, lower cost and much more reliability. In Applications, SAP is the leader. But their Technology that they use for their applications is a proprietary technology, a German programming language called ABAP [Advanced Business Application Programming], where later this year, and that's a 25-year-old technology. But it's still the center of their architecture and strategy for applications going forward is ABAP. The center of our strategy going forward is Java, and a modern service-oriented architecture. And during this calendar year, we will deliver our Fusion Applications. We've been working on them for a while, but we have rewritten or written in Java, all of our accounting software, all of our supply chain software, all of our HR software, our sales automation, our service automation software, it's all been rewritten in Java with a modern service-oriented architecture. And we're going to go compete with SAP's 25-year-old technology. The interesting thing is we're competing quite well against SAP now. We think once we deliver Fusion, we're going to be well-positioned to challenge for the number one slot. One of the important things about our Fusion Applications is they're designed not simply to run on premise, which of course they do. But they're all on-demand or if you prefer, cloud-ready. So we'll be delivering those applications, both by selling the software directly, kind of the old way of doing it, which is still the most popular way, by the way. We'll be selling the Fusion Applications integrated with our hardware, our servers and our storage and our networks. And we'll be selling it on the cloud, all modern service-oriented 21st century stuff, competing against SAP. We think SAP is vulnerable. And we can take them on in a variety of industries. The other thing that we're doing, that SAP is not doing, is we're emphasizing industry functionality. So it's not just technology where we're competing with SAP, we're also competing with them in functionality. So we think we have much more functionality for a telco, a phone company, a large-scale retail operation, in insurance and in banking. We have industry-specific applications for a variety of industries. Healthcare, I could go on. So our strategy is to have a much better industry focus than SAP, in terms of functionality, and a much more modern technology underlying all of that functionality. Again it's a company that we think is vulnerable, and we think we have an excellent chance of becoming number one in Applications. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles."
22247,98978416,54845,"Oracle Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Mar-25-2010",2010-03-25,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry.

It's an organization I thought did a great job integrating the Sun reps quickly. They executed very well as you can see within days and in most weeks, we have the accounts and territories and comp plans all assigned. Reps quickly got back in front of customers and that was a key factor in the quarter. And they stayed focused and built pipelines, so a great job all the way around the world. All the customer data has been converted over to Oracle systems, and pipeline and forecasting processes have been standardized. On the customer side, I would say, customers, I think the best word is intrigued with our strategy. And a good example of that is we had a CIO Summit yesterday in Atlanta, that's a day and a half actually. We were expecting about 125 CIOs. We invited -- we got over 175. 85% of them traveled to get them from surrounding states and 91% of them were first-time attendees to this type of event. So again our competitors' customers do come and hear what we have to say. They just want to know what's happening. And I think they sense that there's some sort of transformation in the industry that's possible based on what we're doing, and they want to know exactly what we're planning. So we're going to do a lot more of that. We're just getting started. We have four more CIO summits and CFO Summit and a CSO Summit in the next three months. So I'll keep my frequent flyer miles in. But we need to take advantage of this while it's there because we can an audience with almost anyone right now. So that's the ones that are back in that respect. By product area, let me start off with Database. Exadata, as we've been talking about in recent quarters, the pipeline continues to grow significantly. And what's changing now is we're getting multiple orders, multiple machines in a single order. And about 40% of our customers purchase multiple systems in the past quarter. I think Exadata has also generally been responsible, partially responsible for generating a lot of the interest in our strategy because it's a good example of what can happen when you synchronize innovation across Hardware and Software, which is hard to do in this industry. Key database wins include live technologies. That was a ULA for a Database, Middleware apps, kind of wall-to-wall Oracle. And I have told them I would mention him because he negotiated the deal at the Sun's basketball game on a Friday night and still got it done. Turkcell, which was a telco in the Middle East. I mentioned them because this is another ULA for Database, Middleware, including Exadata, ERP and CRM. They've been also a good customer on the comp side of it. So they're as close to a telco in a box strategy that we're embarking on. As you can get, they pretty much do everything on Oracle now. And then Buenos Aires city government and I mentioned them because they migrated to Oracle database 11g for the first time. They were an Informix customer. So I just kind of like to remind people, there still a lot of legacy databases out there like Informix and Sybase and DB2 that we get customers from every quarter. And Buenos Aires city government said, they're getting 80% improvement in performance. They're running that on Oracle Unbreakable Linux. We had some good Linux wins in the quarter, including Victoria University, Telkom SA, Reuters and GE Security. Switching to Middleware, I just kind of like to remind people of the skill that we've achieved in Middleware with 90,000 customers now, and that's not including the 20,000 apps customers that run Middleware with our apps. And so that's going very well. The upgrade cycle from 11g, I talked about 11g lines for the last couple of quarters. On average, it's taking customers about four to eight months, so that upgrade cycle is continuing as we expected, actually a little better than the last cycle. And there are many customers who are already live on the product. There are some components that are yet to ship as part of 11g. Over the next 12 months, they will be coming out. The ones that are scheduled are business process management, Tuxedo, enterprise content management, imaging and process management, Oracle BI enterprise edition. That will generate more upgrades and more uptake of related components. Now also in past calls, I talked about how important it was to get the ISPs to support our Middleware stat. That's driving adoption as well. So in this past Q3, we had 18 key ISP partners. Select components, they're major components of our Middleware to standardize on. That included in the North America, Landmark Graphics, SunGard, Intuit, Cerner and EMEA IFS and LHS. So we have a partner technical services organization that's part of development and they've trained over 11,000 consultants globally and developers on 11g in the last nine months. And so that's a key part of getting that adoption. We're starting to see the benefit of that now. Key customer wins, Cox Communications, U.S. Department of Transportation selected us over WebCenter to do their portal for their hazardous materials information system. Kaiser Permanente chose us for BI over Cognos. In the EPM area, we had wins with Carlyle Group and Herbalife and then the management of standardizing University of Texas. In the Applications area, Larry mentioned our competition with SAP. I'm certainly seeing a shift there, where I would say two years ago, SAP was considered a safe choice even if the technology was a little bit old and complex to implement and all that. But that seems to be changed as customers appear more nervous about their technology and strategic directions and they're more open to discussing things with Oracle, even as SAP customers and their largest customers. So that's a change that we're seeing. And secondly, they didn't have anything new to talk about. It's the same product, same technology. And basically, they're focused on general ledger. And the industry gets moving broader than that to include industry applications and entire systems. So here are some key wins over SAP in the quarter: IBCO, a large privately held food and beverage company in the United Arab Emirates; D&A's Distribution, one of the nation's leading technology distributors; a really important one, NBN Co. and this is a new company and we don't get these often. But the government of Australia has a national initiative to build a national broadband network from scratch. This is a mandate by the government. It will be the single-largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australian history, and the Chief Operating Officer selected Oracle. He was just actually at our headquarters two weeks ago and he wants to go wall-to-wall Oracle and he selected us over SAP. We beat them at Genuine Parts, Nomura Holdings. We had a good quarter with PeopleSoft. PeapleSoft beat them at Carlyle Group, Alberta Health Services, UBS, Bank of America, Department of Energy and are holding many more here, too many to list. CRM on-demand, we had key wins against sales force at General Motors, SAIC, Broadcom, Merck, Avis and Starbucks and important wins for CRM on-premise at U.S. Immigration and Northwestern Mutual. The vertical Applications did well. They actually grew faster than the overall apps number, and we saw a rebound in the retail, GBU, a big one at our hold, and Communications GBU had wins, three each against the MDOCS converse and convergence rebuilding in the quarter. Financial Services has wins at Central Bank of UAE, Union Bank of Jordan and National Australia Bank. An important win in enterprise taxation product, we had the State of Nevada selected for unemployment insurance. And the way these deals work, they take one tax at a time. And if we do this well, which we plan to do, there'll be other taxes, they migrate to the platform and we charge for those as well. On the Hardware side of it, since we have started talking about that as well in these calls, we had a good win with Sun Ray. This is our thin client with one of the branches of the armed services, which I can't name. But they contracted to deploy a high-secure and multi-level security solution with our thin client device. And this is just the beginning. This is going to be scheduled across the distributed federal network. And they have a planned growth across other command in the architecture over time. We had a win at 1&1 Internet, the world's number one web hosting company based in Germany, and that was 6000 and 9000 SPARC Enterprise servers. MTN Group in Nigeria has 21 countries, 90 million subscribers of big telco and Sun SPARC Servers Enterprise (sic) [Enterprise Servers] T5000. And then we had a top 10 U.S. bank that replaced Tandem and HP; that was a replacement there. We had a major financial services company that liked our solid state disk and hybrid arrays, we replaced EMC there. In fact, they moved EMC from the supply list when they saw the performance. I said a lot of good wins right down on the server side of it, more on the way, the pipeline seems to be there. And lastly, I'll mention a large U.S. federal agency, which you can probably guess, that selected an M8000. And that one will support 5 million pages of handwritten census data that's been currently being collected probably in your mailbox right now, converted into digital format using OCR floating [ph] on Sun servers. So with that, we're pretty excited about the pipeline and what's happening, as you can see. Lots more out there. I'll turn it back over."

And just, operationally, the way we work with our customers has already changed. As you know, we've moved to a build-to-order model versus build-to-stock model. And we're not encouraging stocking in general even with our resellers, such that customers can order exactly the box they want. In that way, we can optimize through the time it takes to get them exactly that box. And that obviously also reduces any kind of obsolescence or inventory issues for us. That's really in place now for a while and really moving along very, very quickly. The regular contractual terms, et cetera, the way we're working with our partners, many of them recognize that the old model really didn't work for either them or for customers, and surely not for Sun, and are very, very open to readjusting those. And many of those have already been completely adjusted faster than I originally expected. As far as maintenance or our product support, it turns out that many of our customers are really in need of higher quality of support that really only Sun can give them and the Sun Oracle combination. And they are really looking to support, that is, both hardware and software integrated more and more. And so we're really moving ahead, both technically and operationally, to be able to deliver a more integrated support model for them. And we do expect that customers are very happy to purchase their support directly from Sun and not from others, simply because the level of support and engineering support that they need really can best, if not only, be done by us at Oracle. So we expect that to be very significant financially, ultimately, and that should start it, of course."

Any kind of breakout would be really an allocation of a lot of different things. And so I'll tell you the best way for you to judge what's going to happen is both to use our guidance and also to really look at what Q4 was. This Q3, if you think about it, it was a February. By the time everybody knew where the water fountain was, it was halfway through February would think. So there's no way to extrapolate from this Q3 anywhere. Breaking it out is really not possible, because you know us, we start integrating right away. Everybody is an Oracle employee as much as possible. So obviously, selling hardware has lower gross margins than selling software, regardless. There's just no way to compare it. So our expenses are not a big number in comparison to our revenues. So operating margins, at least, for a while, will be lower, and you can figure that out from the guidance. So expenses grow quickly, but our revenues are growing quickly also. And you'll be able to really better extrapolate after you see Q4, frankly."

Our intent is that the Exadata line challenge the biggest IBM pSeries machines and beats them badly in performance, reliability and cost. And we think we can do that in transaction processing, where we're twice as fast, and in data warehousing, we're 10 times as fast. Those are our goals, to be twice as fast as IBM's biggest best box and, again, at a dramatically lower price. And because our architecture is bolt-on [ph] (57:15), except -- the answer is, all database applications, ultimately, are better served when they run on an Exadata machine. Everything."

We're winning large deals in retail, large deals in banking, large deals in telecommunications. And that's dragging a lot of ERP and CRM applications with them. We're doing well in pharma, there are a bunch of industries, healthcare in general. There are a bunch of industries where we're very, very strong, and we have applications that SAP simply does not have. So one of our strategies was to beat SAP in CRM, which we do, and then beat SAP in industry-specific vertical applications. For example, the telecommunication company has applications to provision -- you call up AT&T and you turn on your iPhone and you want to turn on interactive TV, well, that provisioning software -- when you provision an application in a lot of telcos, when you provision an application, that's the Oracle software that's been automatically turning on those services for you. SAP has nothing like that. When you receive your bill, that's an Oracle application that's sending you the bill. SAP has nothing like that. When you deposit money in your savings account, that's an Oracle application that keeps track -- literally an Oracle-banking application that keeps track. SAP doesn't have that. And I can go on and on in a variety of industries where we have industry functionality that they don't have. So that gives us opportunities that are simply not available to them. We also -- we sell these applications a piece at a time, rather than a big rip-and-replace strategy. So what people aren't doing big ERP buys or big -- by the way, ERP is a rather mature market. We think we're competing very well in ERP, but it is a mature market. And SAP, it's to some degree, saturated. And SAP is not a diversified company in terms of their application suite. They don't have a lot of what you're calling edge applications, they don't have a lot of industry-specific applications and their technology is fraying around the edges. So some of it is our good execution, I think, and some of it is probably SAP. We were at [indiscernible] (1:00:14) setting -- we were up 26% in ERP. I suspect that that's a lot better than what SAP is seeing. So we're taking advantage of our strategy that we think is working. We're taking advantage of their weakness. And we think we're going to get stronger while they get weaker. I'm sorry to go on for so long, but let me say that their strategy right now is to try to sell ERP to customers that have less than 100 employees. That's their new strategy, business by design, which has been, I guess, three years late. And by the way, if it's successful, you can't make a lot of money selling ERP to companies with less than 100 people. So we think that's a strategy that goes nowhere. It's a different technology than they currently sell, it's a different sales force, it's  different customers than they currently sell to. We think it's a massive distraction for them. Where our strategy is not to find all new customers, it's to sell more to existing customers, sell industry-specific apps to existing customers, sell technology upgrades to existing customers. We think they've made a fundamental strategic mistake. We think they have kind of lost their way. And if they don't want to be number one, we sure do."

First of all, I want to make sure you understand that the Sun product line continues in its current form, so there is no cutting back on the Sun product line beyond where we're at. Those products are actually expanding. We've got some incredible products coming up. I mean, the focus of Oracle and the Oracle-Sun combination is on reselling our intellectual property. So if you understand that, then you realize that in most places, there are certain areas in which, obviously, we have components from third parties in our equipment and all that, but the real value is in our intellectual property, the way we bring it all together, et cetera. That's the focus of the company. Now we do resell some other folks' products, we do still are winding down the resale of the Hitachi storage servers, obviously, we're very focused on our customers and for those, there'll be very steady wind down period and we're managing those together with Hitachi. Hitachi is a very long-term partner of Oracle and Sun and things are going very well there. But the big focus of selling other people's -- those storage servers, that focus is really going to be going on to some of our own products, so we've talked about already. So that's already in place. There are few other, reselling other people software and things like that. And as you know, Heather, that's not what we focus on here in Oracle. So most of it is already disappearing outside of our sales. But again, don't extrapolate anything from a month of February.

Modern architecture, modern order orchestration, I can go on and on, but this is 21st century technology. It's really the only application suite. Even Salesforce.com was kind of late 20th century technology. So we think we're going to have huge competitive advantage. Customers like it very much because of the fact that it is so. So they can start using some of these buzzwords, they can use BPELs [Business Process Execution Languages] to link the different applications, the different Web services together. It isn't a rip-and-replace strategy. They can take parts of it at a time and gradually adopt Fusion. It has a modern Web 2.0 user interface. It's low cost to deploy because everything's written on this. It's one technology stack, Java technology stack, all in our Fusion Middleware. The customers that have seen it see a huge value in the built-in business intelligence. So BI is not an add-on to Fusion, BI is built into Fusion. The application that you install at your site is the same as the application you run on a cloud, our cloud or someone else's. So those generate a huge amount of enthusiasm.

So three or four-legged sales calls, as we call them, and shift away from fulfillment and expand the market. So we're going to direct them into the mid-market and into the areas where we don't have good coverage. We're hiring pretty aggressively right now on the high end to make sure we have our top 1,000 accounts serviced directly by Oracle reps and by Oracle support. And we're also shifting the account model to pay on net, in other words, Sun paid on gross. So other reps were indifferent to whether a partner sold it or we sold it. And we've always paid on net, in other words, what we get after we paid the partner, and that tends to shift things pretty quickly.

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. But first, I'll comment about foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding Sun, the actual currency benefit we saw this quarter was less than our guidance by approximately 2% for both new license revenue and total revenue. However, even with currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were able to drive solid results this quarter as we beat our new license revenue guidance, beat our total revenue guidance, and we're at the high end of the EPS range, with record Q3 earnings per share. Q3 was a solid quarter. Before reviewing our income statement, I'd like to remind everyone that our guidance from last quarter excluded Sun. In discussing revenue, I will provide revenue results as reported. And for some key growth rates, I will exclude Sun revenue to align the results to our guidance from last quarter. In the third quarter, our new Software license revenues were $1.7 billion, including $46 million from Sun. New Software license revenues were up 13% and up 10% excluding Sun. This 10% growth beat the high end of our guidance range, calling for 9% growth. The Americas grew 22%, EMEA was up 3% and Asia was up 12%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business. And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually-large deals. Technology new license revenues were $1.2 billion, up 11%, as the Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 2%, and Asia was up 9%. Applications new license revenues were $477 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia was up 29%. Our Software license updates and product support revenues were $3.3 billion, including $25 million from Sun and up 12% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $273 million, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $224 million. Our Services revenues were $931 million, down 9% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Net total revenues were $6.5 billion, including $596 million from Sun. Total revenues for the quarter were up 18% and up 7% excluding Sun. Total revenues excluding Sun were at the high end of our guidance range even without the full benefit of currency tailwind included in our guidance. With some results now being included in our financial statements, non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 45%. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.9%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.38, at the high end of our Oracle-only EPS guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38. Earnings per share were up 9% from last year and include a $0.01 loss related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. In Q3, we repurchased 10.3 million shares at an average price of $24.28 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. Turning to the balance sheet, we have $17.5 billion in cash and investments. The days sales outstanding, excluding Sun, improved again to 47 days as compared to 49 days last year. Finally, we generated $8.0 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For star",731,"Thanks, Jeff. As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For starters, as Jeff mentioned, we exceeded the high point of our new license guidance with 10% growth in Software licenses excluding Sun. This clearly shows substantial strength in the Database, Middleware and Applications business. We also beat the high end of our total revenue guidance, with consistent strength in our Update and Support renewal.Results for our Application business were nothing short of stunning. We grew 21%, while SAP continues to shrink at a double-digit pace. Our Applications business is doing very well in all regions and in all verticals. And truly, no wonder, SAP is so unhappy. In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included, our operating margin was 45%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM. Our operating margin remains much higher than SAP's target, and we are now selling hardware. Regarding Sun, as you all know, the transaction closed at the end of January. So our Q3 results for Sun reflect a one month period, February, which would have been in the middle of their Q3. Sun's revenues for February were $596 million, which was far better than we expected and clearly demonstrates to us that customers are responding well to the acquisition. We believe the Oracle/Sun integration is off to a very strong start. We're moving forward quickly to implement the operational changes we described for you on January 27, and we continue to expect Sun to contribute $1.5 billion in non-GAAP operating income in fiscal year 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal year 2012. Now before I turn to guidance, let me just remind everyone that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. We will no longer be selling products at a loss as Sun did. As we promised in January, we've already ended or modified arrangements, where Sun resold other company's products at a loss. Just this change will immediately mean more profit on lower revenue. Second, we are now compensating our sales teams on margin, not just revenue. That has the effect of changing the sales mix from commodity system, where Sun lost money, to value-added systems, where Sun's differentiation clear to our customers. These two changes will baseline our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they will start to grow significantly next year. Now let me turn to guidance, which will include Sun. We believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. And the close rates I'm using for Software are more conservative than typical Q4 close rates for Software. For the coming quarter, assuming these exchange rates remain at current level, we expect there to be almost 3% positive currency effect on license growth rates and almost 4% effect on total revenue growth rates. With that, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 3% to 13%, up at current exchange rates and flat to up 10% in constant currency; Hardware product revenues are expected to range from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion at current exchange rates and actually at constant currency. Now these numbers exclude Hardware support revenues. These are just the Hardware product revenues.Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 36% to 41% at current exchange rates and 32% to 37% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 35% to 40% at current exchange rates and 31% to 36% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.52 to $0.56 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.46 last year and from $0.50 to $0.54 in constant currency. Now GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.37 to $0.41 using current exchange rates and $0.35 to $0.39 assuming constant currency. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for Q4, but may end up lower. Lastly, the Board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary com",760,"Thank you, Safra. I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary competitor. Let me start with servers. Since we acquired Sun, we have embarked on putting together Cluster of Sun hardware running with our Database and Middleware software. That is, we have a collection of Sun machines interconnected by a modern InfiniBand network talking to storage also connected to the servers using a modern InfiniBand network. Actually, it is the best example of this clustered architecture, where we have collections of machines, storage and networks all built together with this offer in tuned for the software. What we've been able to do with Exadata -- and there will be other machines like our Clusters, like Exadata coming in out for Middleware applications, pretty much all the software that we sell. It's not uncommon for an Exadata benchmark when going up against a big IBM pSeries machine to beat them by a factor of 10. Because they just don't have a clustered architecture, they're stuck with kind of an old-fashioned SMP architecture for transaction processing. So we're taking advantage of new technologies, not just in InfiniBand, by the way, but Flash, very large scale memory, integrated memories. You'll see all of that has allowed us to deliver stunning performance using, if you will, commodity parts. And not only do we run much faster than the IBM pSeries, but also our architecture is clustered, there are multiple servers, multiple pieces of storage, it's full [indiscernible]. There's no single point of failure, so it's much more reliable while delivering this fantastic performance. And finally, it's much lower in cost, because the components themselves, if you will, are commodities. The components that we call it the disk drives and memory and processors, which we assemble with our software. So again we think, we can challenge IBM on the high end of the server market, better performance, lower cost and much more reliability. In Applications, SAP is the leader. But their Technology that they use for their applications is a proprietary technology, a German programming language called ABAP [Advanced Business Application Programming], where later this year, and that's a 25-year-old technology. But it's still the center of their architecture and strategy for applications going forward is ABAP. The center of our strategy going forward is Java, and a modern service-oriented architecture. And during this calendar year, we will deliver our Fusion Applications. We've been working on them for a while, but we have rewritten or written in Java, all of our accounting software, all of our supply chain software, all of our HR software, our sales automation, our service automation software, it's all been rewritten in Java with a modern service-oriented architecture. And we're going to go compete with SAP's 25-year-old technology. The interesting thing is we're competing quite well against SAP now. We think once we deliver Fusion, we're going to be well-positioned to challenge for the number one slot. One of the important things about our Fusion Applications is they're designed not simply to run on premise, which of course they do. But they're all on-demand or if you prefer, cloud-ready. So we'll be delivering those applications, both by selling the software directly, kind of the old way of doing it, which is still the most popular way, by the way. We'll be selling the Fusion Applications integrated with our hardware, our servers and our storage and our networks. And we'll be selling it on the cloud, all modern service-oriented 21st century stuff, competing against SAP. We think SAP is vulnerable. And we can take them on in a variety of industries. The other thing that we're doing, that SAP is not doing, is we're emphasizing industry functionality. So it's not just technology where we're competing with SAP, we're also competing with them in functionality. So we think we have much more functionality for a telco, a phone company, a large-scale retail operation, in insurance and in banking. We have industry-specific applications for a variety of industries. Healthcare, I could go on. So our strategy is to have a much better industry focus than SAP, in terms of functionality, and a much more modern technology underlying all of that functionality. Again it's a company that we think is vulnerable, and we think we have an excellent chance of becoming number one in Applications. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles."

It's an organization I thought did a great job integrating the Sun reps quickly. They executed very well as you can see within days and in most weeks, we have the accounts and territories and comp plans all assigned. Reps quickly got back in front of customers and that was a key factor in the quarter. And they stayed focused and built pipelines, so a great job all the way around the world. All the customer data has been converted over to Oracle systems, and pipeline and forecasting processes have been standardized. On the customer side, I would say, customers, I think the best word is intrigued with our strategy. And a good example of that is we had a CIO Summit yesterday in Atlanta, that's a day and a half actually. We were expecting about 125 CIOs. We invited -- we got over 175. 85% of them traveled to get them from surrounding states and 91% of them were first-time attendees to this type of event. So again our competitors' customers do come and hear what we have to say. They just want to know what's happening. And I think they sense that there's some sort of transformation in the industry that's possible based on what we're doing, and they want to know exactly what we're planning. So we're going to do a lot more of that. We're just getting started. We have four more CIO summits and CFO Summit and a CSO Summit in the next three months. So I'll keep my frequent flyer miles in. But we need to take advantage of this while it's there because we can an audience with almost anyone right now. So that's the ones that are back in that respect. By product area, let me start off with Database. Exadata, as we've been talking about in recent quarters, the pipeline continues to grow significantly. And what's changing now is we're getting multiple orders, multiple machines in a single order. And about 40% of our customers purchase multiple systems in the past quarter. I think Exadata has also generally been responsible, partially responsible for generating a lot of the interest in our strategy because it's a good example of what can happen when you synchronize innovation across Hardware and Software, which is hard to do in this industry. Key database wins include live technologies. That was a ULA for a Database, Middleware apps, kind of wall-to-wall Oracle. And I have told them I would mention him because he negotiated the deal at the Sun's basketball game on a Friday night and still got it done. Turkcell, which was a telco in the Middle East. I mentioned them because this is another ULA for Database, Middleware, including Exadata, ERP and CRM. They've been also a good customer on the comp side of it. So they're as close to a telco in a box strategy that we're embarking on. As you can get, they pretty much do everything on Oracle now. And then Buenos Aires city government and I mentioned them because they migrated to Oracle database 11g for the first time. They were an Informix customer. So I just kind of like to remind people, there still a lot of legacy databases out there like Informix and Sybase and DB2 that we get customers from every quarter. And Buenos Aires city government said, they're getting 80% improvement in performance. They're running that on Oracle Unbreakable Linux. We had some good Linux wins in the quarter, including Victoria University, Telkom SA, Reuters and GE Security. Switching to Middleware, I just kind of like to remind people of the skill that we've achieved in Middleware with 90,000 customers now, and that's not including the 20,000 apps customers that run Middleware with our apps. And so that's going very well. The upgrade cycle from 11g, I talked about 11g lines for the last couple of quarters. On average, it's taking customers about four to eight months, so that upgrade cycle is continuing as we expected, actually a little better than the last cycle. And there are many customers who are already live on the product. There are some components that are yet to ship as part of 11g. Over the next 12 months, they will be coming out. The ones that are scheduled are business process management, Tuxedo, enterprise content management, imaging and process management, Oracle BI enterprise edition. That will generate more upgrades and more uptake of related components. Now also in past calls, I talked about how important it was to get the ISPs to support our Middleware stat. That's driving adoption as well. So in this past Q3, we had 18 key ISP partners. Select components, they're major components of our Middleware to standardize on. That included in the North America, Landmark Graphics, SunGard, Intuit, Cerner and EMEA IFS and LHS. So we have a partner technical services organization that's part of development and they've trained over 11,000 consultants globally and developers on 11g in the last nine months. And so that's a key part of getting that adoption. We're starting to see the benefit of that now. Key customer wins, Cox Communications, U.S. Department of Transportation selected us over WebCenter to do their portal for their hazardous materials information system. Kaiser Permanente chose us for BI over Cognos. In the EPM area, we had wins with Carlyle Group and Herbalife and then the management of standardizing University of Texas. In the Applications area, Larry mentioned our competition with SAP. I'm certainly seeing a shift there, where I would say two years ago, SAP was considered a safe choice even if the technology was a little bit old and complex to implement and all that. But that seems to be changed as customers appear more nervous about their technology and strategic directions and they're more open to discussing things with Oracle, even as SAP customers and their largest customers. So that's a change that we're seeing. And secondly, they didn't have anything new to talk about. It's the same product, same technology. And basically, they're focused on general ledger. And the industry gets moving broader than that to include industry applications and entire systems. So here are some key wins over SAP in the quarter: IBCO, a large privately held food and beverage company in the United Arab Emirates; D&A's Distribution, one of the nation's leading technology distributors; a really important one, NBN Co. and this is a new company and we don't get these often. But the government of Australia has a national initiative to build a national broadband network from scratch. This is a mandate by the government. It will be the single-largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australian history, and the Chief Operating Officer selected Oracle. He was just actually at our headquarters two weeks ago and he wants to go wall-to-wall Oracle and he selected us over SAP. We beat them at Genuine Parts, Nomura Holdings. We had a good quarter with PeopleSoft. PeapleSoft beat them at Carlyle Group, Alberta Health Services, UBS, Bank of America, Department of Energy and are holding many more here, too many to list. CRM on-demand, we had key wins against sales force at General Motors, SAIC, Broadcom, Merck, Avis and Starbucks and important wins for CRM on-premise at U.S. Immigration and Northwestern Mutual. The vertical Applications did well. They actually grew faster than the overall apps number, and we saw a rebound in the retail, GBU, a big one at our hold, and Communications GBU had wins, three each against the MDOCS converse and convergence rebuilding in the quarter. Financial Services has wins at Central Bank of UAE, Union Bank of Jordan and National Australia Bank. An important win in enterprise taxation product, we had the State of Nevada selected for unemployment insurance. And the way these deals work, they take one tax at a time. And if we do this well, which we plan to do, there'll be other taxes, they migrate to the platform and we charge for those as well. On the Hardware side of it, since we have started talking about that as well in these calls, we had a good win with Sun Ray. This is our thin client with one of the branches of the armed services, which I can't name. But they contracted to deploy a high-secure and multi-level security solution with our thin client device. And this is just the beginning. This is going to be scheduled across the distributed federal network. And they have a planned growth across other command in the architecture over time. We had a win at 1&1 Internet, the world's number one web hosting company based in Germany, and that was 6000 and 9000 SPARC Enterprise servers. MTN Group in Nigeria has 21 countries, 90 million subscribers of big telco and Sun SPARC Servers Enterprise (sic) [Enterprise Servers] T5000. And then we had a top 10 U.S. bank that replaced Tandem and HP; that was a replacement there. We had a major financial services company that liked our solid state disk and hybrid arrays, we replaced EMC there. In fact, they moved EMC from the supply list when they saw the performance. I said a lot of good wins right down on the server side of it, more on the way, the pipeline seems to be there. And lastly, I'll mention a large U.S. federal agency, which you can probably guess, that selected an M8000. And that one will support 5 million pages of handwritten census data that's been currently being collected probably in your mailbox right now, converted into digital format using OCR floating [ph] on Sun servers. So with that, we're pretty excited about the pipeline and what's happening, as you can see. Lots more out there. I'll turn it back over."

And just, operationally, the way we work with our customers has already changed. As you know, we've moved to a build-to-order model versus build-to-stock model. And we're not encouraging stocking in general even with our resellers, such that customers can order exactly the box they want. In that way, we can optimize through the time it takes to get them exactly that box. And that obviously also reduces any kind of obsolescence or inventory issues for us. That's really in place now for a while and really moving along very, very quickly. The regular contractual terms, et cetera, the way we're working with our partners, many of them recognize that the old model really didn't work for either them or for customers, and surely not for Sun, and are very, very open to readjusting those. And many of those have already been completely adjusted faster than I originally expected. As far as maintenance or our product support, it turns out that many of our customers are really in need of higher quality of support that really only Sun can give them and the Sun Oracle combination. And they are really looking to support, that is, both hardware and software integrated more and more. And so we're really moving ahead, both technically and operationally, to be able to deliver a more integrated support model for them. And we do expect that customers are very happy to purchase their support directly from Sun and not from others, simply because the level of support and engineering support that they need really can best, if not only, be done by us at Oracle. So we expect that to be very significant financially, ultimately, and that should start it, of course."

Breaking it out is really not possible, because you know us, we start integrating right away. Everybody is an Oracle employee as much as possible. So obviously, selling hardware has lower gross margins than selling software, regardless. There's just no way to compare it. So our expenses are not a big number in comparison to our revenues.

And that was Exadata Version 1. Exadata Version 2 handles not only data warehouses, but also handles transaction processing. We added a lot of flash memory into it. And we're going to have new Exadata models, I don't want to pre-announce anything, but we're going to get better and better at very large-scale transaction processing. Our intent is that the Exadata line challenge the biggest IBM pSeries machines and beats them badly in performance, reliability and cost. And we think we can do that in transaction processing, where we're twice as fast, and in data warehousing, we're 10 times as fast. Those are our goals, to be twice as fast as IBM's biggest best box and, again, at a dramatically lower price. And because our architecture is bolt-on [ph] (57:15), except -- the answer is, all database applications, ultimately, are better served when they run on an Exadata machine. Everything."

We're winning large deals in retail, large deals in banking, large deals in telecommunications. And that's dragging a lot of ERP and CRM applications with them. We're doing well in pharma, there are a bunch of industries, healthcare in general. There are a bunch of industries where we're very, very strong, and we have applications that SAP simply does not have. So one of our strategies was to beat SAP in CRM, which we do, and then beat SAP in industry-specific vertical applications. For example, the telecommunication company has applications to provision -- you call up AT&T and you turn on your iPhone and you want to turn on interactive TV, well, that provisioning software -- when you provision an application in a lot of telcos, when you provision an application, that's the Oracle software that's been automatically turning on those services for you. SAP has nothing like that. When you receive your bill, that's an Oracle application that's sending you the bill. SAP has nothing like that. When you deposit money in your savings account, that's an Oracle application that keeps track -- literally an Oracle-banking application that keeps track. SAP doesn't have that. And I can go on and on in a variety of industries where we have industry functionality that they don't have. So that gives us opportunities that are simply not available to them. We also -- we sell these applications a piece at a time, rather than a big rip-and-replace strategy. So what people aren't doing big ERP buys or big -- by the way, ERP is a rather mature market. We think we're competing very well in ERP, but it is a mature market. And SAP, it's to some degree, saturated. And SAP is not a diversified company in terms of their application suite. They don't have a lot of what you're calling edge applications, they don't have a lot of industry-specific applications and their technology is fraying around the edges. So some of it is our good execution, I think, and some of it is probably SAP. We were at [indiscernible] (1:00:14) setting -- we were up 26% in ERP. I suspect that that's a lot better than what SAP is seeing. So we're taking advantage of our strategy that we think is working. We're taking advantage of their weakness. And we think we're going to get stronger while they get weaker. I'm sorry to go on for so long, but let me say that their strategy right now is to try to sell ERP to customers that have less than 100 employees. That's their new strategy, business by design, which has been, I guess, three years late. And by the way, if it's successful, you can't make a lot of money selling ERP to companies with less than 100 people. So we think that's a strategy that goes nowhere. It's a different technology than they currently sell, it's a different sales force, it's  different customers than they currently sell to. We think it's a massive distraction for them. Where our strategy is not to find all new customers, it's to sell more to existing customers, sell industry-specific apps to existing customers, sell technology upgrades to existing customers. We think they've made a fundamental strategic mistake. We think they have kind of lost their way. And if they don't want to be number one, we sure do."

First of all, I want to make sure you understand that the Sun product line continues in its current form, so there is no cutting back on the Sun product line beyond where we're at. Those products are actually expanding. We've got some incredible products coming up. I mean, the focus of Oracle and the Oracle-Sun combination is on reselling our intellectual property. So if you understand that, then you realize that in most places, there are certain areas in which, obviously, we have components from third parties in our equipment and all that, but the real value is in our intellectual property, the way we bring it all together, et cetera. That's the focus of the company. Now we do resell some other folks' products, we do still are winding down the resale of the Hitachi storage servers, obviously, we're very focused on our customers and for those, there'll be very steady wind down period and we're managing those together with Hitachi. Hitachi is a very long-term partner of Oracle and Sun and things are going very well there. But the big focus of selling other people's -- those storage servers, that focus is really going to be going on to some of our own products, so we've talked about already. So that's already in place. There are few other, reselling other people software and things like that. And as you know, Heather, that's not what we focus on here in Oracle. So most of it is already disappearing outside of our sales. But again, don't extrapolate anything from a month of February.

Modern architecture, modern order orchestration, I can go on and on, but this is 21st century technology. It's really the only application suite. Even Salesforce.com was kind of late 20th century technology. So we think we're going to have huge competitive advantage. Customers like it very much because of the fact that it is so. So they can start using some of these buzzwords, they can use BPELs [Business Process Execution Languages] to link the different applications, the different Web services together. It isn't a rip-and-replace strategy. They can take parts of it at a time and gradually adopt Fusion. It has a modern Web 2.0 user interface. It's low cost to deploy because everything's written on this. It's one technology stack, Java technology stack, all in our Fusion Middleware. The customers that have seen it see a huge value in the built-in business intelligence. So BI is not an add-on to Fusion, BI is built into Fusion. The application that you install at your site is the same as the application you run on a cloud, our cloud or someone else's. So those generate a huge amount of enthusiasm.

So we're going to direct them into the mid-market and into the areas where we don't have good coverage. We're hiring pretty aggressively right now on the high end to make sure we have our top 1,000 accounts serviced directly by Oracle reps and by Oracle support. And we're also shifting the account model to pay on net, in other words, Sun paid on gross. So other reps were indifferent to whether a partner sold it or we sold it.

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. But first, I'll comment about foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding Sun, the actual currency benefit we saw this quarter was less than our guidance by approximately 2% for both new license revenue and total revenue. However, even with currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were able to drive solid results this quarter as we beat our new license revenue guidance, beat our total revenue guidance, and we're at the high end of the EPS range, with record Q3 earnings per share. Q3 was a solid quarter. Before reviewing our income statement, I'd like to remind everyone that our guidance from last quarter excluded Sun. In discussing revenue, I will provide revenue results as reported. And for some key growth rates, I will exclude Sun revenue to align the results to our guidance from last quarter. In the third quarter, our new Software license revenues were $1.7 billion, including $46 million from Sun. New Software license revenues were up 13% and up 10% excluding Sun. This 10% growth beat the high end of our guidance range, calling for 9% growth. The Americas grew 22%, EMEA was up 3% and Asia was up 12%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business. And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually-large deals. Technology new license revenues were $1.2 billion, up 11%, as the Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 2%, and Asia was up 9%. Applications new license revenues were $477 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia was up 29%. Our Software license updates and product support revenues were $3.3 billion, including $25 million from Sun and up 12% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $273 million, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $224 million. Our Services revenues were $931 million, down 9% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Net total revenues were $6.5 billion, including $596 million from Sun. Total revenues for the quarter were up 18% and up 7% excluding Sun. Total revenues excluding Sun were at the high end of our guidance range even without the full benefit of currency tailwind included in our guidance. With some results now being included in our financial statements, non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 45%. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.9%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.38, at the high end of our Oracle-only EPS guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38. Earnings per share were up 9% from last year and include a $0.01 loss related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. In Q3, we repurchased 10.3 million shares at an average price of $24.28 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. Turning to the balance sheet, we have $17.5 billion in cash and investments. The days sales outstanding, excluding Sun, improved again to 47 days as compared to 49 days last year. Finally, we generated $8.0 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

For star",731,"Thanks, Jeff. As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For starters, as Jeff mentioned, we exceeded the high point of our new license guidance with 10% growth in Software licenses excluding Sun. This clearly shows substantial strength in the Database, Middleware and Applications business. We also beat the high end of our total revenue guidance, with consistent strength in our Update and Support renewal.Results for our Application business were nothing short of stunning. We grew 21%, while SAP continues to shrink at a double-digit pace. Our Applications business is doing very well in all regions and in all verticals. And truly, no wonder, SAP is so unhappy. In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included, our operating margin was 45%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM. Our operating margin remains much higher than SAP's target, and we are now selling hardware. Regarding Sun, as you all know, the transaction closed at the end of January. So our Q3 results for Sun reflect a one month period, February, which would have been in the middle of their Q3. Sun's revenues for February were $596 million, which was far better than we expected and clearly demonstrates to us that customers are responding well to the acquisition. We believe the Oracle/Sun integration is off to a very strong start. We're moving forward quickly to implement the operational changes we described for you on January 27, and we continue to expect Sun to contribute $1.5 billion in non-GAAP operating income in fiscal year 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal year 2012. Now before I turn to guidance, let me just remind everyone that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. We will no longer be selling products at a loss as Sun did. As we promised in January, we've already ended or modified arrangements, where Sun resold other company's products at a loss. Just this change will immediately mean more profit on lower revenue. Second, we are now compensating our sales teams on margin, not just revenue. That has the effect of changing the sales mix from commodity system, where Sun lost money, to value-added systems, where Sun's differentiation clear to our customers. These two changes will baseline our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they will start to grow significantly next year. Now let me turn to guidance, which will include Sun. We believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. And the close rates I'm using for Software are more conservative than typical Q4 close rates for Software. For the coming quarter, assuming these exchange rates remain at current level, we expect there to be almost 3% positive currency effect on license growth rates and almost 4% effect on total revenue growth rates. With that, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 3% to 13%, up at current exchange rates and flat to up 10% in constant currency; Hardware product revenues are expected to range from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion at current exchange rates and actually at constant currency. Now these numbers exclude Hardware support revenues. These are just the Hardware product revenues.Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 36% to 41% at current exchange rates and 32% to 37% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 35% to 40% at current exchange rates and 31% to 36% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.52 to $0.56 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.46 last year and from $0.50 to $0.54 in constant currency. Now GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.37 to $0.41 using current exchange rates and $0.35 to $0.39 assuming constant currency. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for Q4, but may end up lower. Lastly, the Board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader.

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary competitor. Let me start with servers. Since we acquired Sun, we have embarked on putting together Cluster of Sun hardware running with our Database and Middleware software. That is, we have a collection of Sun machines interconnected by a modern InfiniBand network talking to storage also connected to the servers using a modern InfiniBand network. Actually, it is the best example of this clustered architecture, where we have collections of machines, storage and networks all built together with this offer in tuned for the software. What we've been able to do with Exadata -- and there will be other machines like our Clusters, like Exadata coming in out for Middleware applications, pretty much all the software that we sell. It's not uncommon for an Exadata benchmark when going up against a big IBM pSeries machine to beat them by a factor of 10. Because they just don't have a clustered architecture. They're stuck with kind of an old-fashioned SMP architecture for transaction processing. So we're taking advantage of new technologies, not just in InfiniBand, by the way, but Flash, very large-scale memory, integrated memories. You'll see all of that's allowed us to deliver stunning performance using, if you will, commodity parts. And not only do we run much faster than the IBM pSeries, but also our architecture is clustered. There are multiple servers, multiple pieces of storage. It's fault tolerant. There's no single point of failure, so it's much more reliable while delivering this fantastic performance. And finally, it's much lower in cost, because the components themselves, if you will, are commodities. The components that we call it the disk drives and memory and processors, which we assemble with our software. So again we think, we can challenge IBM on the high end of the server market, better performance, lower cost and much more reliability. In Applications, SAP is the leader. But their Technology that they use for their applications is a proprietary technology, a German programming language called ABAP [Advanced Business Application Programming], where later this year, and that's a 25-year-old technology. But it's still the center of their architecture and strategy for applications going forward is ABAP. The center of our strategy going forward is Java, and a modern service-oriented architecture. And during this calendar year, we will deliver our Fusion Applications. We've been working on them for a while, but we have rewritten or written in Java, all of our accounting software, all of our supply chain software, all of our HR software, our sales automation, our service automation software, it's all been rewritten in Java with a modern service-oriented architecture. And we're going to go compete with SAP's 25-year-old technology. The interesting thing is we're competing quite well against SAP now. We think once we deliver Fusion, we're going to be well-positioned to challenge for the number one slot. One of the important things about our Fusion Applications is they're designed not simply to run on premise, which of course they do. But they're all on-demand or if you prefer, cloud-ready. So we'll be delivering those applications, both by selling the software directly, kind of the old way of doing it, which is still the most popular way, by the way. We'll be selling the Fusion Applications integrated with our hardware, our servers and our storage and our networks. And we'll be selling it on the cloud, all modern service-oriented 21st century stuff, competing against SAP. We think SAP is vulnerable. And we can take them on in a variety of industries. The other thing that we're doing, that SAP is not doing, is we're emphasizing industry functionality. So it's not just technology where we're competing with SAP, we're also competing with them in functionality. So we think we have much more functionality for a telco, a phone company, a large-scale retail operation, in insurance and in banking. We have industry-specific applications for a variety of industries. Healthcare, I could go on. So our strategy is to have a much better industry focus than SAP, in terms of functionality, and a much more modern technology underlying all of that functionality. Again it's a company that we think is vulnerable, and we think we have an excellent chance of becoming number one in Applications. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles."

It's an organization I thought did a great job integrating the Sun reps quickly. They executed very well as you can see within days and in most weeks, we have the accounts and territories and comp plans all assigned. Reps quickly got back in front of customers and that was a key factor in the quarter. And they stayed focused and built pipelines, so a great job all the way around the world. All the customer data has been converted over to Oracle systems, and pipeline and forecasting processes have been standardized. On the customer side, I would say, customers, I think the best word is intrigued with our strategy. And a good example of that is we had a CIO Summit yesterday in Atlanta, that's a day and a half actually. We were expecting about 125 CIOs. We invited -- we got over 175. 85% of them traveled to get them from surrounding states and 91% of them were first-time attendees to this type of event. So again our competitors' customers do come and hear what we have to say. They just want to know what's happening. And I think they sense that there's some sort of transformation in the industry that's possible based on what we're doing, and they want to know exactly what we're planning. So we're going to do a lot more of that. We're just getting started. We have four more CIO summits and CFO Summit and a CSO Summit in the next three months. So I'll keep my frequent flyer miles in. But we need to take advantage of this while it's there because we can an audience with almost anyone right now. So that's the ones that are back in that respect. By product area, let me start off with Database. Exadata, as we've been talking about in recent quarters, the pipeline continues to grow significantly. And what's changing now is we're getting multiple orders, multiple machines in a single order. And about 40% of our customers purchase multiple systems in the past quarter. I think Exadata has also generally been responsible, partially responsible for generating a lot of the interest in our strategy because it's a good example of what can happen when you synchronize innovation across Hardware and Software, which is hard to do in this industry. Key database wins include live technologies. That was a ULA for a Database, Middleware apps, kind of wall-to-wall Oracle. And I have told them I would mention him because he negotiated the deal at the Sun's basketball game on a Friday night and still got it done. Turkcell, which was a telco in the Middle East. I mentioned them because this is another ULA for Database, Middleware, including Exadata, ERP and CRM. They've been also a good customer on the comp side of it. So they're as close to a telco in a box strategy that we're embarking on. As you can get, they pretty much do everything on Oracle now. And then Buenos Aires city government and I mentioned them because they migrated to Oracle database 11g for the first time. They were an Informix customer. So I just kind of like to remind people, there still a lot of legacy databases out there like Informix and Sybase and DB2 that we get customers from every quarter. And Buenos Aires city government said, they're getting 80% improvement in performance. They're running that on Oracle Unbreakable Linux. We had some good Linux wins in the quarter, including Victoria University, Telkom SA, Reuters and GE Security. Switching to Middleware, I just kind of like to remind people of the skill that we've achieved in Middleware with 90,000 customers now, and that's not including the 20,000 apps customers that run Middleware with our apps. And so that's going very well. The upgrade cycle from 11g, I talked about 11g lines for the last couple of quarters. On average, it's taking customers about four to eight months, so that upgrade cycle is continuing as we expected, actually a little better than the last cycle. And there are many customers who are already live on the product. There are some components that are yet to ship as part of 11g. Over the next 12 months, they will be coming out. The ones that are scheduled are business process management, Tuxedo, enterprise content management, imaging and process management, Oracle BI enterprise edition. That will generate more upgrades and more uptake of related components. Now also in past calls, I talked about how important it was to get the ISPs to support our Middleware stat. That's driving adoption as well. So in this past Q3, we had 18 key ISP partners. Select components, they're major components of our Middleware to standardize on. That included in the North America, Landmark Graphics, SunGard, Intuit, Cerner and EMEA IFS and LHS. So we have a partner technical services organization that's part of development and they've trained over 11,000 consultants globally and developers on 11g in the last nine months. And so that's a key part of getting that adoption. We're starting to see the benefit of that now. Key customer wins, Cox Communications, U.S. Department of Transportation selected us over WebCenter to do their portal for their hazardous materials information system. Kaiser Permanente chose us for BI over Cognos. In the EPM area, we had wins with Carlyle Group and Herbalife and then the management of standardizing University of Texas. In the Applications area, Larry mentioned our competition with SAP. I'm certainly seeing a shift there, where I would say two years ago, SAP was considered a safe choice even if the technology was a little bit old and complex to implement and all that. But that seems to be changed as customers appear more nervous about their technology and strategic directions and they're more open to discussing things with Oracle, even as SAP customers and their largest customers. So that's a change that we're seeing. And secondly, they didn't have anything new to talk about. It's the same product, same technology. And basically, they're focused on general ledger. And the industry gets moving broader than that to include industry applications and entire systems. So here are some key wins over SAP in the quarter: IBCO, a large privately held food and beverage company in the United Arab Emirates; D&A's Distribution, one of the nation's leading technology distributors; a really important one, NBN Co. and this is a new company and we don't get these often. But the government of Australia has a national initiative to build a national broadband network from scratch. This is a mandate by the government. It will be the single-largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australian history, and the Chief Operating Officer selected Oracle. He was just actually at our headquarters two weeks ago and he wants to go wall-to-wall Oracle and he selected us over SAP. We beat them at Genuine Parts, Nomura Holdings. We had a good quarter with PeopleSoft. PeapleSoft beat them at Carlyle Group, Alberta Health Services, UBS, Bank of America, Department of Energy and are holding many more here, too many to list. CRM on-demand, we had key wins against sales force at General Motors, SAIC, Broadcom, Merck, Avis and Starbucks and important wins for CRM on-premise at U.S. Immigration and Northwestern Mutual. The vertical Applications did well. They actually grew faster than the overall apps number, and we saw a rebound in the retail, GBU, a big one at our hold, and Communications GBU had wins, three each against the MDOCS converse and convergence rebuilding in the quarter. Financial Services has wins at Central Bank of UAE, Union Bank of Jordan and National Australia Bank. An important win in enterprise taxation product, we had the State of Nevada selected for unemployment insurance. And the way these deals work, they take one tax at a time. And if we do this well, which we plan to do, there'll be other taxes, they migrate to the platform and we charge for those as well. On the Hardware side of it, since we have started talking about that as well in these calls, we had a good win with Sun Ray. This is their our thin client, with one of the branches of the armed services, which I can't name. But they contracted to deploy a highly secure and multilevel security solution with our thin client device. And this is just the beginning. This is going to be scheduled across and distributed the federal network. And they have a planned growth across other commands in the architecture over time. We had a win at 1&1 Internet, the world's number one Web hosting company based in Germany. And that was six M9000 SPARC Enterprise Servers. MTN Group in Nigeria has 21 countries, 90 million subscribers of big telco and Sun SPARC Servers Enterprise (sic) [Enterprise Servers] T5000s. And then we had a top 10 U.S. bank that's replaced Tandem and HP. That was a replacement there. We had a major financial services company that liked our solid-state disk and hybrid arrays. We replaced EMC there. In fact, we moved EMC from the supply list when they saw the performance. So we had a lot of good wins like that on the server side of it, more on the way. The pipeline seems to be there. And lastly, I'll mention a large U.S. federal agency, which you can probably guess, that selected an M8000. And that one will support 5 million pages of handwritten census data that's been currently being collected probably in your mailbox right now; converted into digital format using OCR running on Sun servers. So with that, we're pretty excited about the pipeline and what's happening, as you can see. Lots more out there. I'll turn it back over."

And just, operationally, the way we work with our customers has already changed. As you know, we've moved to a build-to-order model versus build-to-stock model. And we're not encouraging stocking in general even with our resellers, such that customers can order exactly the box they want. In that way, we can optimize through the time it takes to get them exactly that box. And that obviously also reduces any kind of obsolescence or inventory issues for us. That's really in place now for a while and really moving along very, very quickly. The regular contractual terms, et cetera, the way we're working with our partners, many of them recognize that the old model really didn't work for either them or for customers and surely not for Sun, and are very, very open to readjusting those. And many of those have already been completely adjusted, faster than I originally expected. As far as maintenance or our product support, it turns out that many of our customers are really in need of a higher quality of support that really only Sun can give them and the Sun/Oracle combination. And they are really looking to support, that is, both hardware and software integrated more and more. And so we are really moving ahead, both technically and operationally, to be able to deliver a more integrated support model for them. And we do expect that customers are very happy to purchase their support directly from Sun and not from others, simply because the level of support and engineering support that they need really can best, if not only be done by us at Oracle. So we expect that to be very significant financially, ultimately. And that should start it, of course."

Breaking it out is really not possible, because you know us, we start integrating right away. Everybody's an Oracle employee as much as possible. So obviously, selling hardware has lower gross margins than selling software, regardless. There's just no way to compare it. So our expenses are not a big number in comparison to our revenues.

We're winning large deals in retail, large deals in banking, large deals in telecommunications. And that's dragging a lot of ERP and CRM applications with them. We're doing well in pharma, healthcare in general. There are a bunch of industries where we're very, very strong, and we have applications that SAP simply does not have. So one of our strategies was to beat SAP in CRM, which we do, and then beat SAP in industry-specific vertical applications. For example, a telecommunication company has applications to provision -- you call up AT&T and you turn on your iPhone and you want to turn on interactive TV. Well, that provisioning software -- when you provision an application, in a lot of telcos, when you provision an application, that's the Oracle software that's automatically turning on those services for you. SAP has nothing like that. And when you receive your bill, that's an Oracle application that's sending you the bill. SAP has nothing like that. When you deposit money in your savings account, that's an Oracle application that keeps track. Literally, an Oracle-banking application that keeps track. SAP doesn't have that. And I can go on and on in a variety of industries, where we have industry functionality that they don't have. So that gives us opportunities that are simply not available to them. We sell these applications a piece at a time, rather than a big rip-and-replace strategy. By the way, ERP is a rather mature market. We think we're competing very well in ERP, but it is a mature market. And SAP, it's to some degree, saturated. And SAP is not a diversified company in terms of their application suite. They don't have a lot of what you're calling edge applications. They don't have a lot of industry-specific applications, and their technology is fraying around the edges. So some of it is our good execution, I think, and some of it is probably SAP. We were up 26% in ERP. I suspect that's a lot better than what SAP is seeing. So we're taking advantage of our strategy that we think is working. We're taking advantage of their weakness. And we think we're going to get stronger while they get weaker. I'm sorry to go on for so long, but let me say this. Their strategy right now is to try to sell ERP to customers that have less than 100 employees. That's their new strategy, Business ByDesign, which has been, I guess, three years late. And by the way, if it's successful, you can't make a lot of money selling ERP to companies with less than 100 people. So we think that's a strategy that goes nowhere. It's a different technology than they currently sell. It's a different sales force. It's different customers than they currently sell to. We think it's a massive distraction for them. Where our strategy is not to find all new customers, it's to sell more to existing customers; sell industry-specific apps to existing customers, sell technology upgrades to existing customers. We think they have made a fundamental strategic mistake. We think they have kind of lost their way. And if they don't want to be number one, we sure do."

So there is no cutting back on the Sun product line beyond where we're at. Those products are actually expanding. We've got some incredible products coming up. I mean, the focus of Oracle and the Oracle/Sun combination is on reselling our intellectual property. So if you understand that, then you realize that in most places there are certain areas in which, obviously, we have components from third parties in our equipment and all that. But the real value is in our intellectual property, the way we bring it all together, et cetera. That's the focus of the company. Now we do resell some other folks' products. We do still are winding down the resale of the Hitachi storage servers. Obviously, we're very focused on our customers. And for those, there'll be a very steady wind down period. And we're managing those together with Hitachi. Hitachi's a very long-term partner of Oracle and Sun, and things are going very well there. But the big focus of selling other people's -- those storage servers, that focus is really going to be going on to some of our own products, so we've talked about already. So that's already in place. There are a few other reselling other people's software and things like that. And as you know, Heather, that's not what we focus on here in Oracle. So most of it is already disappearing outside of our sales. But again, don't extrapolate anything from a month of February.

Modern architecture, modern order orchestration, I can go on and on. But this is 21st century technology. It's really the only application suite. Even Salesforce.com was kind of late 20th century technology. So we think we're going to have huge competitive advantage. Customers like it very much, because of the fact that it is SOA [service-oriented architecture]. Sorry to use so many buzzwords. They can use BPELs [Business Process Execution Languages] to link the different applications, the different Web services together. It isn't a rip-and-replace strategy. They can take parts of it at a time and gradually adopt Fusion. It has a modern Web 2.0 user interface. It's low cost to deploy, because everything's written on this. It's one technology stack, Java technology stack, all in our Fusion Middleware. The customers that have seen it see huge value in the built-in business intelligence. So BI is not an add-on to Fusion. BI is built into Fusion. The application that you install at your site is the same as the application you run on a cloud, our cloud or someone else's. So those generate a huge amount of enthusiasm.

We want the partners to find new business and not show up in the same accounts with us all the time; so three or four-legged sales calls, as we call them, and shift away from fulfillment and expand the market. So we're going to direct them into the mid-market and into the areas where we don't have good coverage. We're hiring pretty aggressively right now on the high end to make sure we have our top 1,000 accounts serviced directly by Oracle reps and by Oracle support. And we're also shifting the comp model to pay on net, in other words, Sun paid on gross. So the reps were indifferent to whether a partner sold it or we sold it. And we've always paid on net, in other words, what we get after we paid the partner. And that tends to shift things pretty quickly. But the partners know that.

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. But first, I'll comment about foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding Sun, the actual currency benefit we saw this quarter was less than our guidance by approximately 2% for both new license revenue and total revenue. However, even with currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were able to drive solid results this quarter as we beat our new license revenue guidance, beat our total revenue guidance, and we're at the high end of the EPS range, with record Q3 earnings per share. Q3 was a solid quarter. Before reviewing our income statement, I'd like to remind everyone that our guidance from last quarter excluded Sun. In discussing revenue, I will provide revenue results as reported. And for some key growth rates, I will exclude Sun revenue to align the results to our guidance from last quarter. In the third quarter, our new Software license revenues were $1.7 billion, including $46 million from Sun. New Software license revenues were up 13% and up 10% excluding Sun. This 10% growth beat the high end of our guidance range, calling for 9% growth. The Americas grew 22%, EMEA was up 3% and Asia was up 12%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business. And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually-large deals. Technology new license revenues were $1.2 billion, up 11%, as the Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 2%, and Asia was up 9%. Applications new license revenues were $477 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia was up 29%. Our Software license updates and product support revenues were $3.3 billion, including $25 million from Sun and up 12% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $273 million, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $224 million. Our Services revenues were $931 million, down 9% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Net total revenues were $6.5 billion, including $596 million from Sun. Total revenues for the quarter were up 18% and up 7% excluding Sun. Total revenues excluding Sun were at the high end of our guidance range even without the full benefit of currency tailwind included in our guidance. With some results now being included in our financial statements, non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 45%. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.9%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.38, at the high end of our Oracle-only EPS guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38. Earnings per share were up 9% from last year and include a $0.01 loss related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. In Q3, we repurchased 10.3 million shares at an average price of $24.28 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. Turning to the balance sheet, we have $17.5 billion in cash and investments. The days sales outstanding, excluding Sun, improved again to 47 days as compared to 49 days last year. Finally, we generated $8.0 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For star",731,"Thanks, Jeff. As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For starters, as Jeff mentioned, we exceeded the high point of our new license guidance with 10% growth in Software licenses excluding Sun. This clearly shows substantial strength in the Database, Middleware and Applications business. We also beat the high end of our total revenue guidance, with consistent strength in our Update and Support renewal.Results for our Application business were nothing short of stunning. We grew 21%, while SAP continues to shrink at a double-digit pace. Our Applications business is doing very well in all regions and in all verticals. And truly, no wonder, SAP is so unhappy. In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included, our operating margin was 45%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM. Our operating margin remains much higher than SAP's target, and we are now selling hardware. Regarding Sun, as you all know, the transaction closed at the end of January. So our Q3 results for Sun reflect a one month period, February, which would have been in the middle of their Q3. Sun's revenues for February were $596 million, which was far better than we expected and clearly demonstrates to us that customers are responding well to the acquisition. We believe the Oracle/Sun integration is off to a very strong start. We're moving forward quickly to implement the operational changes we described for you on January 27, and we continue to expect Sun to contribute $1.5 billion in non-GAAP operating income in fiscal year 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal year 2012. Now before I turn to guidance, let me just remind everyone that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. We will no longer be selling products at a loss as Sun did. As we promised in January, we've already ended or modified arrangements, where Sun resold other company's products at a loss. Just this change will immediately mean more profit on lower revenue. Second, we are now compensating our sales teams on margin, not just revenue. That has the effect of changing the sales mix from commodity system, where Sun lost money, to value-added systems, where Sun's differentiation clear to our customers. These two changes will baseline our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they will start to grow significantly next year. Now let me turn to guidance, which will include Sun. We believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. And the close rates I'm using for Software are more conservative than typical Q4 close rates for Software. For the coming quarter, assuming these exchange rates remain at current level, we expect there to be almost 3% positive currency effect on license growth rates and almost 4% effect on total revenue growth rates. With that, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 3% to 13%, up at current exchange rates and flat to up 10% in constant currency; Hardware product revenues are expected to range from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion at current exchange rates and actually at constant currency. Now these numbers exclude Hardware support revenues. These are just the Hardware product revenues.Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 36% to 41% at current exchange rates and 32% to 37% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 35% to 40% at current exchange rates and 31% to 36% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.52 to $0.56 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.46 last year and from $0.50 to $0.54 in constant currency. Now GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.37 to $0.41 using current exchange rates and $0.35 to $0.39 assuming constant currency.

With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary com",758,"Thank you, Safra. I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary competitor. Let me start with servers. Since we acquired Sun, we have embarked on putting together Cluster of Sun hardware running with our Database and Middleware software. That is, we have a collection of Sun machines interconnected by a modern InfiniBand network talking to storage also connected to the servers using a modern InfiniBand network. Actually, it is the best example of this clustered architecture, where we have collections of machines, storage and networks all built together with this offer in tuned for the software. What we've been able to do with Exadata -- and there will be other machines like our Clusters, like Exadata coming in out for Middleware applications, pretty much all the software that we sell. It's not uncommon for an Exadata benchmark when going up against a big IBM pSeries machine to beat them by a factor of 10. Because they just don't have a clustered architecture. They're stuck with kind of an old-fashioned SMP architecture for transaction processing. So we're taking advantage of new technologies, not just in InfiniBand, by the way, but Flash, very large-scale memory, integrated memories. You'll see all of that's allowed us to deliver stunning performance using, if you will, commodity parts. And not only do we run much faster than the IBM pSeries, but also our architecture is clustered. There are multiple servers, multiple pieces of storage. It's fault tolerant. There's no single point of failure, so it's much more reliable while delivering this fantastic performance. And finally, it's much lower in cost, because the components themselves, if you will, are commodities. The components that we call it the disk drives and memory and processors, which we assemble with our software. So again we think, we can challenge IBM on the high end of the server market, better performance, lower cost and much more reliability. In Applications, SAP is the leader. But their Technology that they use for their applications is a proprietary technology, a German programming language called ABAP [Advanced Business Application Programming], where later this year, and that's a 25-year-old technology. But it's still the center of their architecture and strategy for applications going forward is ABAP. The center of our strategy going forward is Java, and a modern service-oriented architecture. And during this calendar year, we will deliver our Fusion Applications. We've been working on them for a while, but we have rewritten or written in Java, all of our accounting software, all of our supply chain software, all of our HR software, our sales automation, our service automation software, it's all been rewritten in Java with a modern service-oriented architecture. And we're going to go compete with SAP's 25-year-old technology. The interesting thing is we're competing quite well against SAP now. We think once we deliver Fusion, we're going to be well-positioned to challenge for the number one slot. One of the important things about our Fusion Applications is they're designed not simply to run on premise, which of course they do. But they're all on-demand or if you prefer, cloud-ready. So we'll be delivering those applications, both by selling the software directly, kind of the old way of doing it, which is still the most popular way, by the way. We'll be selling the Fusion Applications integrated with our hardware, our servers and our storage and our networks. And we'll be selling it on the cloud, all modern service-oriented 21st century stuff, competing against SAP. We think SAP is vulnerable. And we can take them on in a variety of industries. The other thing that we're doing, that SAP is not doing, is we're emphasizing industry functionality. So it's not just technology where we're competing with SAP, we're also competing with them in functionality. So we think we have much more functionality for a telco, a phone company, a large-scale retail operation, in insurance and in banking. We have industry-specific applications for a variety of industries. Healthcare, I could go on. So our strategy is to have a much better industry focus than SAP, in terms of functionality, and a much more modern technology underlying all of that functionality. Again it's a company that we think is vulnerable, and we think we have an excellent chance of becoming number one in Applications. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles."
22247,98978416,54865,"Oracle Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Mar-25-2010",2010-03-25,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry.

It's an organization I thought did a great job integrating the Sun reps quickly. They executed very well as you can see within days and in most weeks, we have the accounts and territories and comp plans all assigned. Reps quickly got back in front of customers and that was a key factor in the quarter. And they stayed focused and built pipelines, so a great job all the way around the world. All the customer data has been converted over to Oracle systems, and pipeline and forecasting processes have been standardized. On the customer side, I would say, customers, I think the best word is intrigued with our strategy. And a good example of that is we had a CIO Summit yesterday in Atlanta, that's a day and a half actually. We were expecting about 125 CIOs. We invited -- we got over 175. 85% of them traveled to get them from surrounding states and 91% of them were first-time attendees to this type of event. So again our competitors' customers do come and hear what we have to say. They just want to know what's happening. And I think they sense that there's some sort of transformation in the industry that's possible based on what we're doing, and they want to know exactly what we're planning. So we're going to do a lot more of that. We're just getting started. We have four more CIO summits and CFO Summit and a CSO Summit in the next three months. So I'll keep my frequent flyer miles in. But we need to take advantage of this while it's there because we can an audience with almost anyone right now. So that's the ones that are back in that respect. By product area, let me start off with Database. Exadata, as we've been talking about in recent quarters, the pipeline continues to grow significantly. And what's changing now is we're getting multiple orders, multiple machines in a single order. And about 40% of our customers purchase multiple systems in the past quarter. I think Exadata has also generally been responsible, partially responsible for generating a lot of the interest in our strategy because it's a good example of what can happen when you synchronize innovation across Hardware and Software, which is hard to do in this industry. Key database wins include live technologies. That was a ULA for a Database, Middleware apps, kind of wall-to-wall Oracle. And I have told them I would mention him because he negotiated the deal at the Sun's basketball game on a Friday night and still got it done. Turkcell, which was a telco in the Middle East. I mentioned them because this is another ULA for Database, Middleware, including Exadata, ERP and CRM. They've been also a good customer on the comp side of it. So they're as close to a telco in a box strategy that we're embarking on. As you can get, they pretty much do everything on Oracle now. And then Buenos Aires city government and I mentioned them because they migrated to Oracle database 11g for the first time. They were an Informix customer. So I just kind of like to remind people, there still a lot of legacy databases out there like Informix and Sybase and DB2 that we get customers from every quarter. And Buenos Aires city government said, they're getting 80% improvement in performance. They're running that on Oracle Unbreakable Linux. We had some good Linux wins in the quarter, including Victoria University, Telkom SA, Reuters and GE Security. Switching to Middleware, I just kind of like to remind people of the skill that we've achieved in Middleware with 90,000 customers now, and that's not including the 20,000 apps customers that run Middleware with our apps. And so that's going very well. The upgrade cycle from 11g, I talked about 11g lines for the last couple of quarters. On average, it's taking customers about four to eight months, so that upgrade cycle is continuing as we expected, actually a little better than the last cycle. And there are many customers who are already live on the product. There are some components that are yet to ship as part of 11g. Over the next 12 months, they will be coming out. The ones that are scheduled are business process management, Tuxedo, enterprise content management, imaging and process management, Oracle BI enterprise edition. That will generate more upgrades and more uptake of related components. Now also in past calls, I talked about how important it was to get the ISPs to support our Middleware stat. That's driving adoption as well. So in this past Q3, we had 18 key ISP partners. Select components, they're major components of our Middleware to standardize on. That included in the North America, Landmark Graphics, SunGard, Intuit, Cerner and EMEA IFS and LHS. So we have a partner technical services organization that's part of development and they've trained over 11,000 consultants globally and developers on 11g in the last nine months. And so that's a key part of getting that adoption. We're starting to see the benefit of that now. Key customer wins, Cox Communications, U.S. Department of Transportation selected us over WebCenter to do their portal for their hazardous materials information system. Kaiser Permanente chose us for BI over Cognos. In the EPM area, we had wins with Carlyle Group and Herbalife and then the management of standardizing University of Texas. In the Applications area, Larry mentioned our competition with SAP. I'm certainly seeing a shift there, where I would say two years ago, SAP was considered a safe choice even if the technology was a little bit old and complex to implement and all that. But that seems to be changed as customers appear more nervous about their technology and strategic directions and they're more open to discussing things with Oracle, even as SAP customers and their largest customers. So that's a change that we're seeing. And secondly, they didn't have anything new to talk about. It's the same product, same technology. And basically, they're focused on general ledger. And the industry gets moving broader than that to include industry applications and entire systems. So here are some key wins over SAP in the quarter: IBCO, a large privately held food and beverage company in the United Arab Emirates; D&A's Distribution, one of the nation's leading technology distributors; a really important one, NBN Co. and this is a new company and we don't get these often. But the government of Australia has a national initiative to build a national broadband network from scratch. This is a mandate by the government. It will be the single-largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australian history, and the Chief Operating Officer selected Oracle. He was just actually at our headquarters two weeks ago and he wants to go wall-to-wall Oracle and he selected us over SAP. We beat them at Genuine Parts, Nomura Holdings. We had a good quarter with PeopleSoft. PeapleSoft beat them at Carlyle Group, Alberta Health Services, UBS, Bank of America, Department of Energy and are holding [ph] many more here, too many to list. CRM On Demand, we had key wins against Salesforce, at General Motors, SAIC, Broadcom, Merck, Avis and Starbucks and important wins for CRM On Premise at U.S. Immigration and Northwestern Mutual. The vertical Applications did well. They actually grew faster than the overall apps number, and we had a solid rebound in the retail, GBU, a big one at our hold [ph] , and Communications GBU had wins, three each against Amdocs, Comverge and Convergence rebuilding in the quarter. Financial Services has wins at Central Bank of UAE, Union Bank of Jordan and National Australia Bank. An important win in Enterprise Taxation product, we had the State of Nevada select us for unemployment insurance. And the way these deals work, they take one tax at a time. And if we do this well, which we plan to do, there'll be other taxes, they migrate to the platform and we charge for those as well. On the Hardware side of it, since we have started talking about that as well in these calls, we had a good win with Sun Ray. This is their our thin client, with one of the branches of the armed services, which I can't name. But they contracted to deploy a highly secure and multilevel security solution with our thin-client device. And this is just the beginning. This is going to be scheduled across and distributed the federal network. And they have a planned growth across other commands in the architecture over time. We had a win at 1&1 Internet, the world's number one Web hosting company based in Germany. And that was six M9000 SPARC Enterprise Servers. MTN Group in Nigeria has 21 countries, 90 million subscribers of big telco and Sun SPARC Servers Enterprise (sic) [Enterprise Servers] T5000s. And then we had a top 10 U.S. bank that's replaced Tandem and HP. That was a replacement there. We had a major financial services company that liked our solid-state disk and hybrid arrays. We replaced EMC there. In fact, we moved EMC from the supply list when they saw the performance. So we had a lot of good wins like that on the server side of it, more on the way. The pipeline seems to be there. And lastly, I'll mention a large U.S. federal agency, which you can probably guess, that selected an M8000. And that one will support 5 million pages of handwritten census data that's been currently being collected probably in your mailbox right now; converted into digital format using OCR running on Sun servers. So with that, we're pretty excited about the pipeline and what's happening, as you can see. Lots more out there. I'll turn it back over."

And just, operationally, the way we work with our customers has already changed. As you know, we've moved to a build-to-order model versus build-to-stock model. And we're not encouraging stocking in general even with our resellers, such that customers can order exactly the box they want. In that way, we can optimize through the time it takes to get them exactly that box. And that obviously also reduces any kind of obsolescence or inventory issues for us. That's really in place now for a while and really moving along very, very quickly. The regular contractual terms, et cetera, the way we're working with our partners, many of them recognize that the old model really didn't work for either them or for customers and surely not for Sun, and are very, very open to readjusting those. And many of those have already been completely adjusted, faster than I originally expected. As far as maintenance or product support, it turns out that many of our customers are really in need of a higher quality of support that really only Sun can give them and the Sun/Oracle combination. And they are really looking to support, that is, both hardware and software integrated more and more. And so we are really moving ahead, both technically and operationally, to be able to deliver a more integrated support model for them. And we do expect that customers are very happy to purchase their support directly from Sun and not from others, simply because the level of support and engineering support that they need really can best, if not only be done by us at Oracle. So we expect that to be very significant financially, ultimately. And that should start it, of course."

So obviously, selling hardware has lower gross margins than selling software, regardless. There's just no way to compare it. So our expenses are not a big number in comparison to our revenues.

We're winning large deals in retail, large deals in banking, large deals in telecommunications. And that's dragging a lot of ERP and CRM applications with them. We're doing well in pharma, healthcare in general. There are a bunch of industries where we're very, very strong, and we have applications that SAP simply does not have. So one of our strategies was to beat SAP in CRM, which we do, and then beat SAP in industry-specific vertical applications. For example, a telecommunication company has applications to provision -- you call up AT&T and you turn on your iPhone and you want to turn on interactive TV. Well, that provisioning software -- when you provision an application, in a lot of telcos, when you provision an application, that's the Oracle software that's automatically turning on those services for you. SAP has nothing like that. And when you receive your bill, that's an Oracle application that's sending you the bill. SAP has nothing like that. When you deposit money in your savings account, that's an Oracle application that keeps track. Literally, an Oracle-banking application that keeps track. SAP doesn't have that. And I can go on and on in a variety of industries, where we have industry functionality that they don't have. So that gives us opportunities that are simply not available to them. We sell these applications a piece at a time, rather than a big rip-and-replace strategy. By the way, ERP is a rather mature market. We think we're competing very well in ERP, but it is a mature market. And SAP, it's to some degree, saturated. And SAP is not a diversified company in terms of their application suite. They don't have a lot of what you're calling edge applications. They don't have a lot of industry-specific applications, and their technology is fraying around the edges. So some of it is our good execution, I think, and some of it is probably SAP. We were up 26% in ERP. I suspect that's a lot better than what SAP is seeing. So we're taking advantage of our strategy that we think is working. We're taking advantage of their weakness. And we think we're going to get stronger while they get weaker. I'm sorry to go on for so long, but let me say this. Their strategy right now is to try to sell ERP to customers that have less than 100 employees. That's their new strategy, Business ByDesign, which has been, I guess, three years late. And by the way, if it's successful, you can't make a lot of money selling ERP to companies with less than 100 people. So we think that's a strategy that goes nowhere. It's a different technology than they currently sell. It's a different sales force. It's different customers than they currently sell to. We think it's a massive distraction for them. Where our strategy is not to find all new customers, it's to sell more to existing customers; sell industry-specific apps to existing customers, sell technology upgrades to existing customers. We think they have made a fundamental strategic mistake. We think they have kind of lost their way. And if they don't want to be number one, we sure do."

So there is no cutting back on the Sun product line beyond where we're at. Those products are actually expanding. We've got some incredible products coming up. I mean, the focus of Oracle and the Oracle/Sun combination is on reselling our intellectual property. So if you understand that, then you realize that in most places there are certain areas in which, obviously, we have components from third parties in our equipment and all that. But the real value is in our intellectual property, the way we bring it all together, et cetera. That's the focus of the company. Now we do resell some other folks' products. We do still are winding down the resale of the Hitachi storage servers. Obviously, we're very focused on our customers. And for those, there'll be a very steady wind down period. And we're managing those together with Hitachi. Hitachi's a very long-term partner of Oracle and Sun, and things are going very well there. But the big focus of selling other people's -- those storage servers, that focus is really going to be going on to some of our own products, so we've talked about already. So that's already in place. There are a few other reselling other people's software and things like that. And as you know, Heather, that's not what we focus on here in Oracle. So most of it is already disappearing outside of our sales. But again, don't extrapolate anything from a month of February.

Modern architecture, modern order orchestration, I can go on and on. But this is 21st century technology. It's really the only application suite. Even Salesforce.com was kind of late 20th century technology. So we think we're going to have huge competitive advantage. Customers like it very much, because of the fact that it is SOA [service-oriented architecture]. Sorry to use so many buzzwords. They can use BPELs [Business Process Execution Languages] to link the different applications, the different Web services together. It isn't a rip-and-replace strategy. They can take parts of it at a time and gradually adopt Fusion. It has a modern Web 2.0 user interface. It's low cost to deploy, because everything's written on this. It's one technology stack, Java technology stack, all in our Fusion Middleware. The customers that have seen it see huge value in the built-in business intelligence. So BI is not an add-on to Fusion. BI is built into Fusion. The application that you install at your site is the same as the application you run on a cloud, our cloud or someone else's. So those generate a huge amount of enthusiasm.

So we're going to direct them into the mid-market and into the areas where we don't have good coverage. We're hiring pretty aggressively right now on the high end to make sure we have our top 1,000 accounts serviced directly by Oracle reps and by Oracle support. And we're also shifting the comp model to pay on net, in other words, Sun paid on gross. So the reps were indifferent to whether a partner sold it or we sold it. And we've always paid on net, in other words, what we get after we paid the partner. And that tends to shift things pretty quickly. But the partners know that. The VADs [value-added distributors] know that. We've discussed this with them. They know the strategy, and so that will start to happen this quarter."

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated. But first, I'll comment about foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding Sun, the actual currency benefit we saw this quarter was less than our guidance by approximately 2% for both new license revenue and total revenue. However, even with currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were able to drive solid results this quarter as we beat our new license revenue guidance, beat our total revenue guidance, and we're at the high end of the EPS range, with record Q3 earnings per share. Q3 was a solid quarter. Before reviewing our income statement, I'd like to remind everyone that our guidance from last quarter excluded Sun. In discussing revenue, I will provide revenue results as reported. And for some key growth rates, I will exclude Sun revenue to align the results to our guidance from last quarter. In the third quarter, our new Software license revenues were $1.7 billion, including $46 million from Sun. New Software license revenues were up 13% and up 10% excluding Sun. This 10% growth beat the high end of our guidance range, calling for 9% growth. The Americas grew 22%, EMEA was up 3% and Asia was up 12%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business. And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually-large deals. Technology new license revenues were $1.2 billion, up 11%, as the Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 2%, and Asia was up 9%. Applications new license revenues were $477 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia was up 29%. Our Software license updates and product support revenues were $3.3 billion, including $25 million from Sun and up 12% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $273 million, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $224 million. Our Services revenues were $931 million, down 9% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Net total revenues were $6.5 billion, including $596 million from Sun. Total revenues for the quarter were up 18% and up 7% excluding Sun. Total revenues excluding Sun were at the high end of our guidance range even without the full benefit of currency tailwind included in our guidance. With some results now being included in our financial statements, non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 45%. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.9%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.38, at the high end of our Oracle-only EPS guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38. Earnings per share were up 9% from last year and include a $0.01 loss related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. In Q3, we repurchased 10.3 million shares at an average price of $24.28 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. Turning to the balance sheet, we have $17.5 billion in cash and investments. The days sales outstanding, excluding Sun, improved again to 47 days as compared to 49 days last year. Finally, we generated $8.0 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For star",731,"Thanks, Jeff. As you can all see, we had another fantastic quarter. I'd like to first address our performance excluding Sun as this relates directly to the guidance we've provided last quarter, and then I'll highlight a few points related to Sun. For starters, as Jeff mentioned, we exceeded the high point of our new license guidance with 10% growth in Software licenses excluding Sun. This clearly shows substantial strength in the Database, Middleware and Applications business. We also beat the high end of our total revenue guidance, with consistent strength in our Update and Support renewal.Results for our Application business were nothing short of stunning. We grew 21%, while SAP continues to shrink at a double-digit pace. Our Applications business is doing very well in all regions and in all verticals. And truly, no wonder, SAP is so unhappy. In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included, our operating margin was 45%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM. Our operating margin remains much higher than SAP's target, and we are now selling hardware. Regarding Sun, as you all know, the transaction closed at the end of January. So our Q3 results for Sun reflect a one month period, February, which would have been in the middle of their Q3. Sun's revenues for February were $596 million, which was far better than we expected and clearly demonstrates to us that customers are responding well to the acquisition. We believe the Oracle/Sun integration is off to a very strong start. We're moving forward quickly to implement the operational changes we described for you on January 27, and we continue to expect Sun to contribute $1.5 billion in non-GAAP operating income in fiscal year 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal year 2012. Now before I turn to guidance, let me just remind everyone that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. We will no longer be selling products at a loss as Sun did. As we promised in January, we've already ended or modified arrangements, where Sun resold other company's products at a loss. Just this change will immediately mean more profit on lower revenue. Second, we are now compensating our sales teams on margin, not just revenue. That has the effect of changing the sales mix from commodity system, where Sun lost money, to value-added systems, where Sun's differentiation clear to our customers. These two changes will baseline our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they will start to grow significantly next year. Now let me turn to guidance, which will include Sun. We believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. And the close rates I'm using for Software are more conservative than typical Q4 close rates for Software. For the coming quarter, assuming these exchange rates remain at current level, we expect there to be almost 3% positive currency effect on license growth rates and almost 4% effect on total revenue growth rates. With that, our guidance for Q4 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 3% to 13%, up at current exchange rates and flat to up 10% in constant currency; Hardware product revenues are expected to range from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion at current exchange rates and actually at constant currency. Now these numbers exclude Hardware support revenues. These are just the Hardware product revenues.Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 36% to 41% at current exchange rates and 32% to 37% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 35% to 40% at current exchange rates and 31% to 36% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.52 to $0.56 assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.46 last year and from $0.50 to $0.54 in constant currency. Now GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.37 to $0.41 using current exchange rates and $0.35 to $0.39 assuming constant currency. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for Q4, but may end up lower. Lastly, the Board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I thought I'd review our strategy in few markets where we are not currently the market leader. The first market is high-end servers, where IBM is our primary competitor and the other is Business Applications, where SAP is our primary competitor. Let me start with servers. Since we acquired Sun, we have embarked on putting together Cluster of Sun hardware running with our Database and Middleware software. That is, we have a collection of Sun machines interconnected by a modern InfiniBand network talking to storage also connected to the servers using a modern InfiniBand network. Actually, it is the best example of this clustered architecture, where we have collections of machines, storage and networks all built together with this offer in tuned for the software. What we've been able to do with Exadata -- and there will be other machines like our Clusters, like Exadata coming in out for Middleware applications, pretty much all the software that we sell. It's not uncommon for an Exadata benchmark when going up against a big IBM pSeries machine to beat them by a factor of 10. Because they just don't have a clustered architecture. They're stuck with kind of an old-fashioned SMP architecture for transaction processing. So we're taking advantage of new technologies, not just in InfiniBand, by the way, but Flash, very large-scale memory, integrated memories. You'll see all of that's allowed us to deliver stunning performance using, if you will, commodity parts. And not only do we run much faster than the IBM pSeries, but also our architecture is clustered. There are multiple servers, multiple pieces of storage. It's fault tolerant. There's no single point of failure, so it's much more reliable while delivering this fantastic performance. And finally, it's much lower in cost, because the components themselves, if you will, are commodities. The components that we call it the disk drives and memory and processors, which we assemble with our software. So again we think, we can challenge IBM on the high end of the server market, better performance, lower cost and much more reliability. In Applications, SAP is the leader. But their Technology that they use for their applications is a proprietary technology, a German programming language called ABAP [Advanced Business Application Programming], where later this year, and that's a 25-year-old technology. But it's still the center of their architecture and strategy for applications going forward is ABAP. The center of our strategy going forward is Java, and a modern service-oriented architecture. And during this calendar year, we will deliver our Fusion Applications. We've been working on them for a while, but we have rewritten or written in Java, all of our accounting software, all of our supply chain software, all of our HR software, our sales automation, our service automation software, it's all been rewritten in Java with a modern service-oriented architecture. And we're going to go compete with SAP's 25-year-old technology. The interesting thing is we're competing quite well against SAP now. We think once we deliver Fusion, we're going to be well-positioned to challenge for the number one slot. One of the important things about our Fusion Applications is they're designed not simply to run on premise, which of course they do. But they're all on-demand or if you prefer, cloud-ready. So we'll be delivering those applications, both by selling the software directly, kind of the old way of doing it, which is still the most popular way, by the way. We'll be selling the Fusion Applications integrated with our hardware, our servers and our storage and our networks. And we'll be selling it on the cloud, all modern service-oriented 21st century stuff, competing against SAP. We think SAP is vulnerable. And we can take them on in a variety of industries. The other thing that we're doing, that SAP is not doing, is we're emphasizing industry functionality. So it's not just technology where we're competing with SAP, we're also competing with them in functionality. So we think we have much more functionality for a telco, a phone company, a large-scale retail operation, in insurance and in banking. We have industry-specific applications for a variety of industries. Healthcare, I could go on. So our strategy is to have a much better industry focus than SAP, in terms of functionality, and a much more modern technology underlying all of that functionality. Again it's a company that we think is vulnerable, and we think we have an excellent chance of becoming number one in Applications. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles."

It's an organization I thought did a great job integrating the Sun reps quickly. They executed very well as you can see within days and in most weeks, we have the accounts and territories and comp plans all assigned. Reps quickly got back in front of customers and that was a key factor in the quarter. And they stayed focused and built pipelines, so a great job all the way around the world. All the customer data has been converted over to Oracle systems, and pipeline and forecasting processes have been standardized. On the customer side, I would say, customers, I think the best word is intrigued with our strategy. And a good example of that is we had a CIO Summit yesterday in Atlanta, that's a day and a half actually. We were expecting about 125 CIOs. We invited -- we got over 175. 85% of them traveled to get them from surrounding states and 91% of them were first-time attendees to this type of event. So again our competitors' customers do come and hear what we have to say. They just want to know what's happening. And I think they sense that there's some sort of transformation in the industry that's possible based on what we're doing, and they want to know exactly what we're planning. So we're going to do a lot more of that. We're just getting started. We have four more CIO summits and CFO Summit and a CSO Summit in the next three months. So I'll keep my frequent flyer miles in. But we need to take advantage of this while it's there because we can an audience with almost anyone right now. So that's the ones that are back in that respect. By product area, let me start off with Database. Exadata, as we've been talking about in recent quarters, the pipeline continues to grow significantly. And what's changing now is we're getting multiple orders, multiple machines in a single order. And about 40% of our customers purchase multiple systems in the past quarter. I think Exadata has also generally been responsible, partially responsible for generating a lot of the interest in our strategy because it's a good example of what can happen when you synchronize innovation across Hardware and Software, which is hard to do in this industry. Key database wins include live technologies. That was a ULA for a Database, Middleware apps, kind of wall-to-wall Oracle. And I have told them I would mention him because he negotiated the deal at the Sun's basketball game on a Friday night and still got it done. Turkcell, which was a telco in the Middle East. I mentioned them because this is another ULA for Database, Middleware, including Exadata, ERP and CRM. They've been also a good customer on the comp side of it. So they're as close to a telco in a box strategy that we're embarking on. As you can get, they pretty much do everything on Oracle now. And then Buenos Aires city government and I mentioned them because they migrated to Oracle database 11g for the first time. They were an Informix customer. So I just kind of like to remind people, there still a lot of legacy databases out there like Informix and Sybase and DB2 that we get customers from every quarter. And Buenos Aires city government said, they're getting 80% improvement in performance. They're running that on Oracle Unbreakable Linux. We had some good Linux wins in the quarter, including Victoria University, Telkom SA, Reuters and GE Security. Switching to Middleware, I just kind of like to remind people of the skill that we've achieved in Middleware with 90,000 customers now, and that's not including the 20,000 apps customers that run Middleware with our apps. And so that's going very well. The upgrade cycle from 11g, I talked about 11g lines for the last couple of quarters. On average, it's taking customers about four to eight months, so that upgrade cycle is continuing as we expected, actually a little better than the last cycle. And there are many customers who are already live on the product. There are some components that are yet to ship as part of 11g. Over the next 12 months, they will be coming out. The ones that are scheduled are business process management, Tuxedo, enterprise content management, imaging and process management, Oracle BI enterprise edition. That will generate more upgrades and more uptake of related components. Now also in past calls, I talked about how important it was to get the ISPs to support our Middleware stat. That's driving adoption as well. So in this past Q3, we had 18 key ISP partners. Select components, they're major components of our Middleware to standardize on. That included in the North America, Landmark Graphics, SunGard, Intuit, Cerner and EMEA IFS and LHS. So we have a partner technical services organization that's part of development and they've trained over 11,000 consultants globally and developers on 11g in the last nine months. And so that's a key part of getting that adoption. We're starting to see the benefit of that now. Key customer wins, Cox Communications, U.S. Department of Transportation selected us over WebCenter to do their portal for their hazardous materials information system. Kaiser Permanente chose us for BI over Cognos. In the EPM area, we had wins with Carlyle Group and Herbalife and then the management of standardizing University of Texas. In the Applications area, Larry mentioned our competition with SAP. I'm certainly seeing a shift there, where I would say two years ago, SAP was considered a safe choice even if the technology was a little bit old and complex to implement and all that. But that seems to be changed as customers appear more nervous about their technology and strategic directions and they're more open to discussing things with Oracle, even as SAP customers and their largest customers. So that's a change that we're seeing. And secondly, they didn't have anything new to talk about. It's the same product, same technology. And basically, they're focused on general ledger. And the industry gets moving broader than that to include industry applications and entire systems. So here are some key wins over SAP in the quarter: IBCO, a large privately held food and beverage company in the United Arab Emirates; D&A's Distribution, one of the nation's leading technology distributors; a really important one, NBN Co. and this is a new company and we don't get these often. But the government of Australia has a national initiative to build a national broadband network from scratch. This is a mandate by the government. It will be the single-largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australian history, and the Chief Operating Officer selected Oracle. He was just actually at our headquarters two weeks ago and he wants to go wall-to-wall Oracle and he selected us over SAP. We beat them at Genuine Parts, Nomura Holdings. We had a good quarter with PeopleSoft. PeapleSoft beat them at Carlyle Group, Alberta Health Services, UBS, Bank of America, Department of Energy and are holding [ph] many more here, too many to list. CRM On Demand, we had key wins against Salesforce, at General Motors, SAIC, Broadcom, Merck, Avis and Starbucks and important wins for CRM On Premise at U.S. Immigration and Northwestern Mutual. The vertical Applications did well. They actually grew faster than the overall apps number, and we had a solid rebound in the retail, GBU, a big one at our hold [ph] , and Communications GBU had wins, three each against Amdocs, Comverge and Convergence rebuilding in the quarter. Financial Services has wins at Central Bank of UAE, Union Bank of Jordan and National Australia Bank. An important win in Enterprise Taxation product, we had the State of Nevada select us for unemployment insurance. And the way these deals work, they take one tax at a time. And if we do this well, which we plan to do, there'll be other taxes, they migrate to the platform and we charge for those as well. On the Hardware side of it, since we have started talking about that as well in these calls, we had a good win with Sun Ray. This is their our thin client, with one of the branches of the armed services, which I can't name. But they contracted to deploy a highly secure and multilevel security solution with our thin-client device. And this is just the beginning. This is going to be scheduled across and distributed the federal network. And they have a planned growth across other commands in the architecture over time. We had a win at 1&1 Internet, the world's number one Web hosting company based in Germany. And that was six M9000 SPARC Enterprise Servers. MTN Group in Nigeria has 21 countries, 90 million subscribers of big telco and Sun SPARC Servers Enterprise (sic) [Enterprise Servers] T5000s. And then we had a top 10 U.S. bank that's replaced Tandem and HP. That was a replacement there. We had a major financial services company that liked our solid-state disk and hybrid arrays. We replaced EMC there. In fact, we moved EMC from the supply list when they saw the performance. So we had a lot of good wins like that on the server side of it, more on the way. The pipeline seems to be there. And lastly, I'll mention a large U.S. federal agency, which you can probably guess, that selected an M8000. And that one will support 5 million pages of handwritten census data that's been currently being collected probably in your mailbox right now; converted into digital format using OCR running on Sun servers. So with that, we're pretty excited about the pipeline and what's happening, as you can see. Lots more out there. I'll turn it back over."

And just, operationally, the way we work with our customers has already changed. As you know, we've moved to a build-to-order model versus build-to-stock model. And we're not encouraging stocking in general even with our resellers, such that customers can order exactly the box they want. In that way, we can optimize through the time it takes to get them exactly that box. And that obviously also reduces any kind of obsolescence or inventory issues for us. That's really in place now for a while and really moving along very, very quickly. The regular contractual terms, et cetera, the way we're working with our partners, many of them recognize that the old model really didn't work for either them or for customers and surely not for Sun, and are very, very open to readjusting those. And many of those have already been completely adjusted, faster than I originally expected. As far as maintenance or product support, it turns out that many of our customers are really in need of a higher quality of support that really only Sun can give them and the Sun/Oracle combination. And they are really looking to support, that is, both hardware and software integrated more and more. And so we are really moving ahead, both technically and operationally, to be able to deliver a more integrated support model for them. And we do expect that customers are very happy to purchase their support directly from Sun and not from others, simply because the level of support and engineering support that they need really can best, if not only be done by us at Oracle. So we expect that to be very significant financially, ultimately. And that should start it, of course."

Breaking it out is really not possible, because you know us, we start integrating right away. Everybody's an Oracle employee as much as possible. So obviously, selling hardware has lower gross margins than selling software, regardless. There's just no way to compare it. So our expenses are not a big number in comparison to our revenues. So operating margins, at least, for a while will be lower, and you can figure that out from the guidance. So expenses grow quickly, but our revenues are growing quickly also.

We're winning large deals in retail, large deals in banking, large deals in telecommunications. And that's dragging a lot of ERP and CRM applications with them. We're doing well in pharma, healthcare in general. There are a bunch of industries where we're very, very strong, and we have applications that SAP simply does not have. So one of our strategies was to beat SAP in CRM, which we do, and then beat SAP in industry-specific vertical applications. For example, a telecommunication company has applications to provision -- you call up AT&T and you turn on your iPhone and you want to turn on interactive TV. Well, that provisioning software -- when you provision an application, in a lot of telcos, when you provision an application, that's the Oracle software that's automatically turning on those services for you. SAP has nothing like that. And when you receive your bill, that's an Oracle application that's sending you the bill. SAP has nothing like that. When you deposit money in your savings account, that's an Oracle application that keeps track. Literally, an Oracle-banking application that keeps track of it. SAP doesn't have that. And I can go on and on in a variety of industries, where we have industry functionality that they don't have. So that gives us opportunities that are simply not available to them. We sell these applications a piece at a time, rather than a big rip-and-replace strategy. So when people aren't doing big ERP buys or big -- by the way, ERP is a rather mature market. We think we're competing very well in ERP, but it is a mature market. And SAP, it's to some degree, saturated. And SAP is not a diversified company in terms of their application suite. They don't have a lot of what you're calling edge applications. They don't have a lot of industry-specific applications, and their technology is fraying around the edges. So some of it is our good execution, I think, and some of it is probably SAP. We were up 26% in ERP. I suspect that's a lot better than what SAP is seeing. So we're taking advantage of our strategy that we think is working. We're taking advantage of their weakness. And we think we're going to get stronger while they get weaker. I'm sorry to go on for so long, but let me say this. Their strategy right now is to try to sell ERP to customers that have less than 100 employees. That's their new strategy, Business ByDesign, which has been, I guess, three years late. And by the way, if it's successful, you can't make a lot of money selling ERP to companies with less than 100 people. So we think that's a strategy that goes nowhere. It's a different technology than they currently sell. It's a different sales force. It's different customers than they currently sell to. We think it's a massive distraction for them. Where our strategy is not to find all new customers, it's to sell more to existing customers; sell industry-specific apps to existing customers, sell technology upgrades to existing customers. We think they have made a fundamental strategic mistake. We think they have kind of lost their way. And if they don't want to be number one, we sure do."

So there is no cutting back on the Sun product line beyond where we're at. Those products are actually expanding. We've got some incredible products coming up. I mean, the focus of Oracle and the Oracle/Sun combination is on reselling our intellectual property. So if you understand that, then you realize that in most places there are certain areas in which, obviously, we have components from third parties in our equipment and all that. But the real value is in our intellectual property, the way we bring it all together, et cetera. That's the focus of the company. Now we do resell some other folks' products. We do still are winding down the resale of the Hitachi storage servers. Obviously, we're very focused on our customers. And for those, there'll be a very steady wind down period. And we're managing those together with Hitachi. Hitachi's a very long-term partner of Oracle and Sun, and things are going very well there. But the big focus of selling other people's -- those storage servers, that focus is really going to be going on to some of our own products, so we've talked about already. So that's already in place. There are a few other reselling other people's software and things like that. And as you know, Heather, that's not what we focus on here in Oracle. So most of it is already disappearing outside of our sales. But again, don't extrapolate anything from a month of February. Really, we'll start to look at this more carefully and really spend some time. You're going to get a sense of what our business looks like after Q4."

Well, one thing we did not do, we did not make the mistake of trying to get this thing out early. Were we late with Fusion? Yes, we were late. I'd much rather be late than deliver a product that isn't extremely high quality. So customers have been looking at Fusion. We got a number of large customers lined up to take the product this calendar year. We are, again, this is years and years of effort. We put into writing all of this in Java. Modern architecture, modern order orchestration, I can go on and on. But this is 21st century technology. It's really the only application suite. Even Salesforce.com was kind of late 20th century technology. So we think we're going to have huge competitive advantage. Customers like it very much, because of the fact that it is SOA [service-oriented architecture]. Sorry to use so many buzzwords. They can use BPELs [Business Process Execution Languages] to link the different applications, the different Web services together. It isn't a rip-and-replace strategy. They can take parts of it at a time and gradually adopt Fusion. It has a modern Web 2.0 user interface. It's low cost to deploy, because everything's written on this. It's one technology stack, Java technology stack, all in our Fusion Middleware. The customers that have seen it see huge value in the built-in business intelligence. So BI is not an add-on to Fusion. BI is built into Fusion. The application that you install at your site is the same as the application you run on a cloud, our cloud or someone else's. So those generate a huge amount of enthusiasm. Customers are preparing their own adoption strategies, plans and schedules. And it's all going to happen second half of this year. Charles, on the direct versus indirect?"

We think they want and deserve a direct relationship with Oracle. And that's the best way we can provide the level of service that they would have been anticipating. So incrementally, starting this quarter, we'll be more direct. We want the partners to find new business and not show up in the same accounts with us all the time; so three or four-legged sales calls, as we call them, and shift away from fulfillment and expand the market. So we're going to direct them into the mid-market and into the areas where we don't have good coverage. We're hiring pretty aggressively right now on the high end to make sure we have our top 1,000 accounts serviced directly by Oracle reps and by Oracle support. And we're also shifting the comp model to pay on net, in other words, Sun paid on gross. So the reps were indifferent to whether a partner sold it or we sold it. And we've always paid on net, in other words, what we get after we paid the partner. And that tends to shift things pretty quickly. But the partners know that. The VADs [value-added distributors] know that. We've discussed this with them. They know the strategy, and so that will start to happen this quarter."

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rate unless otherwise stated. 
This quarter, foreign exchange rates were not much of a factor in our overall results compared to our guidance of a 3% benefit to new license revenue and a 4% benefit to total revenue. Even with the currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were at the high end of our guidance range for total revenue. And we beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue and EPS with record earnings per share this quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, we beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue, total revenue and earnings per share. In short, Q4 was an excellent quarter for Oracle. 
In the fourth quarter, new Software license revenues were $3.1 billion, up 14%. The Americas grew 28%. EMEA was down 3% in U.S. dollars and up 4% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 15%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business.And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. 
Technology new license revenues were $2.3 billion, up 18% as the Americas grew 34%. EMEA was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 6% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 19%. 
Applications new license revenues were $855 million, up 6% from last year. The Americas grew 16%, EMEA was down 7%, and Asia was up 2%. 
Our Software license Updates and product support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 13% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. 
Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $1.2 billion, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $688 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 4% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $9.6 billion, up 40% from last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 26%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 46% for the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27.3% as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.60, $0.04 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.52 to $0.56. Earnings per share were up 30% from last year. 
In Q4, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $24.94 per share for a total of $250 million. For the full year, we repurchased 43.3 million shares at an average price of $22.94 per share for total of $993 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate at our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. 
Now turning briefly to fiscal 2010 full year results. New Software license revenues was $7.5 billion, up 6% for the year. The Americas were up 15%, EMEA down 5% and Asia grew 4%. Technology new license revenues were $5.4 billion, up 6%, while Application New License revenues were $2.1 billion, also up 6%. Software license Update and product support revenues totaled $13.2 billion, up 10%. Our total revenues were $27.0 million, up 15%. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $12.5 billion, up 15%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 46%. Our fiscal 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.67, up 16% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet. We had $18.5 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 53 days compared to 58 days last year and as a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters, up 9% from last year. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

I'll then review guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry. Obviously, we're very pleased with our Q4 results and with our outstanding performance throughout the year. 
Our business is extremely healthy with substantial strength in Database, Middlewares, App and Hardware. Our Tech business, highlighted by database, was spectacular this quarter with growth of 18% including 34% growth in the Americas. 
Our Applications business was also strong with 5% growth over the last 12 months on a constant-dollar basis versus a negative 24% for SAP for our most recent quarter. 
Sun Hardware systems revenues came in well, taking into account the fact that we've already ended cents reselling of other companies products, which had historically accounted for hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales. This quarter, we saw sales growth for Sun Hardware products. 
In addition, our estimates for the Sun business contribution to operating income comes in at over $400 million for our first full quarter after the merger. This compares with the loss in Sun's quarter ending June of last year when Sun was an independent company. 
Now to get to that number, we've done some allocations for the quarter and because a lot of our back office and Software R&D Software sales operations have already been integrated with Oracle's pre-merger teams. Now in the coming quarter, some of the expense estimates may really be too difficult to make, but we will breakout the revenues and the segregated expenses whenever possible for the remainder of this year. Clearly, we continue to expect some contributions to meet or exceed $1.5 billion for non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal '12. 
We've also made excellent progress with our supply chain efficiency efforts as the non-GAAP gross margin's persistence was 46%, much, much higher than the 33% we recorded last quarter. And as a reminder, Sun's product gross margin, which included Software margins, was 38% last year. 
In addition to our Sun top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 46%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM and SAP. Our 46% operating margin remains much higher than SAPs even though we are also selling hardware. 
Fiscal 2010 again demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio, better-priced products, the breath and loyalty of our huge customer base, and the strength of our operating model. The fact is, we have a lot of company-specific momentum. We really executed well throughout the year and exceeded our own expectations quarter after quarter. 
Now before I turn the guidance for the upcoming year, let me just remind everyone that our plans for Sun is based on a more profit-aware model. As we've said a number of times, we're no longer selling products at a loss as Sun did. We're now compensating our sales teams on margin not just revenue. And this has the effect of changing the sales mix from systems where Sun lost money to value-added systems where Sun's differentiation is clear to our customers. These changes are allowing us to form a baseline for our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they can grow. 
So let's get to the guidance. And we do believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming the exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rate and a negative 3% effect on total growth or revenue growth rate.
With that, our guidance for Q1 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 14% in constant currency and 2% to 12% at current exchange rates; Hardware product revenues are expected to be around $1 billion in constant currency that doesn't include the Hardware support revenue; total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 44% to 48% in constant currency and 41% to 45% of current exchange change rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 42% to 46% in constant currency and 39% to 43% at current exchange rate. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.36 to $0.38 in constant currency, up from $0.30 last year and from $0.35 to $0.37 assuming current exchange rates. 
GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.18 to $0.19 assuming constant currency and $0.17 to $0.18 using current exchange rates. This guidance assumes that GAAP tax rate of 33½% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. 
And lastly, the board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

And our primary competitors were company's like pure Teradata Netezza. When we introduced Version 2 of our Exadata database machine in partnership with Sun and we bought Sun, we really focused not simply on data warehousing performance but also on online transaction processing. And our current version of the Sun Exadata database machine substantially outperforms IBM's fastest computer in both data warehousing transaction processing.
As a result in our previous quarter, Q4, some of IBM's largest customer began buying Exadata machines rather than big IBM servers. And the 2011 Exadata pipeline continues to grow and is now approaching $1 billion, making Exadata the fastest-growing new product in Oracle's history. 
Now back to Q4. Again, I said the competition has really shifted from companies like Teradata and Netezza to big IBM machines and the Q4 results for that out. We beat IBM 30 times in Q4. We beat Teradata nine times in Q4. And we beat Netezza seven times in Q4. And we sold the Exadata machines into some of IBM's largest and bluest accounts including Bank of America, Carrefour, the second largest retail in the world behind Wal-Mart, and Thompson Reuters.

And it was really a good quarter as you can see. North and Latin America were strong results. They exceeded plan as they have all year long. EMEA in particular did a great job with delivering results against the tough comparisons especially in the context of changing the U.K. government, financing a stability in Greece and Spain while integrating an acquisition. So with all those headwinds, they delivered good results. And Japan saw a rebound from a rough start to the beginning of the year. 
What I'm seeing in the field right now is we have many more touch points with our accounts. So our visibility and standing of our customer requirements is significantly improved. And right now, almost any decision they make in the data center could potentially involve Oracle now. So we have deployed a cadre of technical advisors that we call fine architects that essentially acting as dedicated CTOs for our large customers who want to stay tightly in lined with Oracle's strategy. And these plan architects are more in demand as we've come more important to customers. We advised the CIOs on how to invest and shape their architectures in concert with Oracle's investments. 
We're improving the attached rate on deals to direct along the multiple products, up and down the stack. And we should continue to get better as supplies get more integrated. We also felt partners, in particular the systems integrater with even some of the hardware companies, now make a concerted effort to reinvigorate their Oracle partnerships close to Sun acquisitions, which may be counterintuitive. But I think they'd see the momentum in the market and want to align themselves accordingly. 
It's also reflected in the amount of companies signing its sponsors through Oracle OpenWorld, by the way. So product comments, Fusion Middleware 11g, upgrades to 11g from 10g are off to a faster pace. Keep in mind that we already had most of the customer based on 10g 88% were in 10g, and now they're moving faster than the 10g customers' move. 
We have several new options around 11g, which means about 70% of installed base are candidate for add-on product modules once they upgrade. Western [ph] to within the Fusion Middleware suite did well in the quarter. Just want to point that out because with the enterprise support and content management under that product will replace SharePoint and Airbus and McAfee's. 
Also I wanted to note that one of the recent acquisitions, GoldenGate, which is the leader in data replication across heterogeneous databases, got off to extremely bad start with wins that some of the other large companies. But more importantly, it's getting us into accounts who are using non-Oracle databases since they're replicating across databases. 
During the quarter, we released Enterprise Linux version 5.5. We now have over 5,000 Linux customers on our Enterprise Linux, over 400 added in the quarter. 
We're making investments around the Oracle VM, our virtualization product, working on ways to leverage our virtualization across our entire product line. Just once small example, we're working on the Oracle VM machine. This is Sun server with an integrated networks switch storage of weight, Oracle VM manager will begin templates pre-configured and now ready to deploy graph [ph]. And so we can practice this technology in ways that most people can, and it adds a lot of value. Our competitors are trying to mimic it right now. 
We also released Enterprise Manager 11g, that's our systems management product. That's a milestone release because first, to mean it's applications down to storage, which is kind of what we've been talking about for quite a while, this single management platform to monitor that entire stack. 
In the applications area, we had a very strategic and large win at Merck across some multiple pillars. It also included some health sciences products from the vertical in that GBU. And then CRM, I've talked about ADP in the past, that they expanded their CRM footprint with both on premise and on-demand CRM with their standard there now. As of PLM, we had a large win at Foxconn, a large contract manufacture that makes the iPhone. Although they're using an SAP back end, they're using ADO now for product life cycle management. So our edge applications continue to do extremely well in SAP accounts. 
And then in financial services, we had a good win with our Mantas and Reveleus, our risk management and anti-money laundering solutions at PNC Financial Services Group. And we won two large banks in China with our FLEXCUBE core banking platform, and they're working with us to build up the localizations, which is important for future wins. 
And lastly, just let me give you a sense of the types of hardware purchases on the Sun's SPARC tech, the one we're seeing momentum there, as you saw in the numbers, types of companies that are committing to the M-series or the Q-series, international paper, Thompson Reuters, MTrack, Cummins, EMG, Procter & Gamble, Qualcomm, eBay, PayPal, all on this quarter left us a small sampling. And with that, I'll turn it back over."

And reason I'm giving you guys guidance, it's what we actually think we're going to do. But we will need a year to understand the amount of seasonality that there is in the Hardware business. We don't have a full visibility. And as I did mention, we are no longer reselling some products that were other people's products, which Sun sold for hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And so that has to be -- we need a year without that for you to get a baseline. But in general, we feel that we already see it. Customers are buying a lot of hardware now. They are very, very loyal to technology that they love. And now that they know that it has a future and that we are investing an enormous amount in continuing these lines and enhancing them, they're much more comfortable making those investments again. So as you can see, sequentially, we're not projecting a very large decline, which in our Software business, we usually are between Q4 and Q1 because we have some hardware-specific momentum we're very upbeat about. But we will need a year to understand pipelines and conversion rates, et cetera, and see how we come out as well as to be able to measure some of these new products and how they're taking off."

As long as we can demonstrate in benchmarks that we're a lot faster than IBM's fastest computer, the appliances particularly attractive than OLTP because sine OLTP is mission critical, and all these pieces stick together, our architecture is not only faster than IBM's. It's much more reliable. Exadata has a fault-tolerant architecture. There is no single point of failure, which is much more important in OLTP than it is in data warehousing. So we're faster and more reliable. Now we have -- people are skeptical about any new products. They buy a couple of machines and they test them and then they put them into production. And if we're successful, then they'd start making standardization decisions. But I think the combination of much better performance and the fact that it's appliance where all the pieces fit together, engineered to fit together and tested together. And the fact that it is a fall tall and our architecture gives us a huge advantage over IBM and the OLTP space. Though again, each customer will take their time in trying it and then making a decision. But we're making really good progress. I want to add on to what Safra said. She forecast Hardware at $1 billion for Q1. But the guidance is the guidance. However, you should know our plan is to dramatically grow the Sun sales organization and strongly grow the Sun business. Your early question, are we just focused on profitability? We are focused on growing the Sun business and growing it rapidly. We're being very conservative in our guidance as we should be, but we're adding a lot of salespeople. Maybe Charles can comment on just quickly -- it takes them a while to get productive. But maybe Charles can comment on just how quickly we are adding distribution capacity to the Sun sales organization so we can grow that business."

And we beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue and EPS with record earnings per share this quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, we beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue, total revenue and earnings per share. In short, Q4 was an excellent quarter for Oracle. 
In the fourth quarter, new Software license revenues were $3.1 billion, up 14%. The Americas grew 28%. EMEA was down 3% in U.S. dollars and up 4% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 15%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business.And the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. 
Technology new license revenues were $2.3 billion, up 18% as the Americas grew 34%. EMEA was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 6% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 19%. 
Applications new license revenues were $855 million, up 6% from last year. The Americas grew 16%, EMEA was down 7%, and Asia was up 2%. 
Our Software license Updates and product support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 13% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near-record levels. 
Revenues from our Hardware systems products were $1.2 billion, while revenues from Hardware systems support were $688 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 4% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $9.6 billion, up 40% from last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 26%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 46% for the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27.3% as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.60, $0.04 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.52 to $0.56. Earnings per share were up 30% from last year. 
In Q4, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $24.94 per share for a total of $250 million. For the full year, we repurchased 43.3 million shares at an average price of $22.94 per share for total of $993 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate at our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. 
Now turning briefly to fiscal 2010 full year results. New Software License revenues were $7.5 billion, up 6% for the year. The Americas were up 15%, EMEA down 5% and Asia grew 4%. Technology New License revenues were $5.4 billion, up 6%, while Applications New License revenues were $2.1 billion, also up 6%. Software License Updates and Product Support revenues totaled $13.2 billion, up 10%. Our total revenues were $27.0 million, up 15%. Non-GAAP operating income was $12.5 billion, up 15%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 46%. Our fiscal 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.67, up 16% from last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We had $18.5 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 53 days compared to 58 days last year and as a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters, up 9% from last year. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q4. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry. Obviously, we're very pleased with our Q4 results and with our outstanding performance throughout the year. Our business",818,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q4. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry. Obviously, we're very pleased with our Q4 results and with our outstanding performance throughout the year. 
Our business is extremely healthy with substantial strength in Database, Middlewares, App and Hardware. Our Tech business, highlighted by database, was spectacular this quarter with growth of 18%, including 34% growth in the Americas. Our Applications business was also strong with 5% growth over the last 12 months on a constant-dollar basis versus a negative 24% for SAP for our most recent quarter. 
Sun Hardware systems revenues came in well, taking into account the fact that we've already ended Sun's reselling of other companies' products, which had historically accounted for hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales. This quarter, we saw sales growth for Sun Hardware products. 
In addition, our estimates for the Sun business contribution to operating income comes in at over $400 million for our first full quarter after the merger. This compares with the loss in Sun's quarter ending June of last year when Sun was an independent company. 
Now to get to that number, we've done some allocations for the quarter and because a lot of our back office and Software R&D and Software sales operations have already been integrated with Oracle's pre-merger teams. Now in the coming quarter, some of the expense estimates may really be too difficult to make, but we will break out the revenues and the segregated expenses whenever possible for the remainder of this year. Clearly, we continue to expect some contributions to meet or exceed $1.5 billion for non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal '12. 
We've also made excellent progress with our supply chain efficiency efforts as the non-GAAP gross margins for systems was 46%, much, much higher than the 33% we recorded last quarter. And as a reminder, Sun's product gross margin, which included Software margins, was 38% last year. 
In addition to our Sun top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 46%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM and SAP. Our 46% operating margin remains much higher than SAPs even though we are also selling hardware. 
Fiscal 2010 again demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio, better-priced products, the breath and loyalty of our huge customer base, and the strength of our operating model. The fact is, we have a lot of company-specific momentum. We really executed well throughout the year and exceeded our own expectations quarter after quarter. 
Now before I turn the guidance for the upcoming year, let me just remind everyone that our plans for Sun is based on a more profit-aware model. As we've said a number of times, we're no longer selling products at a loss as Sun did. We're now compensating our sales teams on margin not just revenue. And this has the effect of changing the sales mix from systems where Sun lost money to value-added systems where Sun's differentiation is clear to our customers. These changes are allowing us to form a baseline for our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they can grow. 
So let's get to the guidance. And we do believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming the exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rate and a negative 3% effect on total growth or revenue growth rate.
With that, our guidance for Q1 is as follows: New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 14% in constant currency and 2% to 12% at current exchange rates; Hardware product revenues are expected to be around $1 billion in constant currency that doesn't include the Hardware support revenue; total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 44% to 48% in constant currency and 41% to 45% of current exchange change rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 42% to 46% in constant currency and 39% to 43% at current exchange rate. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.36 to $0.38 in constant currency, up from $0.30 last year and from $0.35 to $0.37 assuming current exchange rates. 
GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be $0.18 to $0.19 assuming constant currency and $0.17 to $0.18 using current exchange rates. This guidance assumes that GAAP tax rate of 33½% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. 
And lastly, the board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

And our primary competitors were company's like pure Teradata Netezza. When we introduced Version 2 of our Exadata database machine in partnership with Sun and we bought Sun, we really focused not simply on data warehousing performance but also on online transaction processing. And our current version of the Sun Exadata database machine substantially outperforms IBM's fastest computer in both data warehousing transaction processing.
As a result in our previous quarter, Q4, some of IBM's largest customer began buying Exadata machines rather than big IBM servers. And the 2011 Exadata pipeline continues to grow and is now approaching $1 billion, making Exadata the fastest-growing new product in Oracle's history. 
Now back to Q4. Again, I said the competition has really shifted from companies like Teradata and Netezza to big IBM machines and the Q4 results bore that out. We beat IBM 30 times in Q4. We beat Teradata nine times in Q4. And we beat Netezza seven times in Q4. And we sold the Exadata machines into some of IBM's largest and bluest accounts including Bank of America, Carrefour, the second largest retail in the world behind Wal-Mart, and Thompson Reuters. I'll turn it over to Charles who will give you a broader picture of how our other products did in Q4. Charles?"

We really had good teamwork across all of the account execs by products family. And it was really a good quarter as you can see. North and Latin America were strong results.

And it was really a good quarter as you can see. North and Latin America were strong results. They exceeded plan as they have all year long. EMEA in particular did a great job with delivering results against the tough comparisons especially in the context of change the U.K. government, financial instability in Greece and Spain while integrating an acquisition. So with all those headwinds, they delivered good results. And Japan saw a rebound from a rough start to the beginning of the year. 
What I'm seeing in the field right now is we have many more touch points with our accounts. So our visibility and understanding of customer requirements is significantly improved. And right now, almost any decision they make in the data center could potentially involve Oracle now. So we have deployed a cadre of technical advisors that we call client architects that essentially act as dedicated CTOs for our large customers who want to stay tightly aligned with Oracle's strategy. And these client architects are more in demand as we become more important to customers. They advise the CIOs on how to invest and shape their architectures in concert with Oracle's investments. 
We're improving the attach rate on deals to direct along the multiple products, up and down the stack. And we should continue to get better as supplies get more integrated. We also saw partners, in particular the systems integrator and even some of the hardware companies, now make a concerted effort to reinvigorate their Oracle partnerships close to Sun acquisitions, which may be counterintuitive. But I think they'd see the momentum in the market and want to align themselves accordingly. 
It's also reflected in the amount of companies signing up as sponsors for Oracle OpenWorld, by the way. So product comments, Fusion Middleware 11g, upgrades to 11g from 10g are off to a faster pace. Keep in mind that we already had most of the customer base on 10g, 88% were in 10g, and now they're moving faster than the 10g customers' move. 
We have several new options around 11g, which means about 70% of installed base are candidate for add-on product modules once they upgrade. Western [ph] to within the Fusion Middleware suite did well in the quarter. Just want to point that out because with the enterprise support and content management under that product will replace SharePoint and Airbus and McAfee. 
Also I wanted to note that one of the recent acquisitions, GoldenGate, which is the leader in data replication across heterogeneous databases, got off to extremely bad start with wins that some of the other large companies. But more importantly, it's getting us into accounts who are using non-Oracle databases since they're replicating across databases. 
During the quarter, we released Enterprise Linux version 5.5. We now have over 5,000 Linux customers on our Enterprise Linux, over 400 added in the quarter. 
We're making investments around the Oracle VM, our virtualization product, working on ways to leverage our virtualization across our entire product line. Just once small example, we're working on the Oracle VM machine. This is Sun server with an integrated networks switch storage of weight, Oracle VM manager will begin templates pre-configured and now ready to deploy graph [ph]. And so we can package this technology in ways that most people can, and it adds a lot of value. Our competitors are trying to mimic it right now. 
We also released Enterprise Manager 11g, that's our systems management product. That's a milestone release because first, to mean it's applications down to storage, which is kind of what we've been talking about for quite a while, this single management platform to monitor that entire stack. 
In the applications area, we had a very strategic and large win at Merck across some multiple pillars. It also included some health sciences products from the vertical in that GBU. And then CRM, I've talked about ADP in the past, that they expanded their CRM footprint with both on premise and on-demand CRM with their standard there now. As of PLM, we had a large win at Foxconn, a large contract manufacture that makes the iPhone. Although they're using an SAP back end, they're using ADO now for product life cycle management. So our edge applications continue to do extremely well in SAP accounts. 
And then in financial services, we had a good win with our Mantas and Reveleus, our risk management and anti-money laundering solutions at PNC Financial Services Group. And we won two large banks in China with our FLEXCUBE core banking platform, and they're working with us to build up the localizations, which is important for future wins. 
And lastly, just let me give you a sense of the types of hardware purchases on the Sun's SPARC tech, the one we're seeing momentum there, as you saw in the numbers, types of companies that are committing to the M-series or the Q-series, international paper, Thompson Reuters, MTrack, Cummins, EMG, Procter & Gamble, Qualcomm, eBay, PayPal, all on this quarter left us a small sampling. And with that, I'll turn it back over."

As long as we can demonstrate in benchmarks that we're a lot faster than IBM's fastest computer, the appliance is particularly attractive in OLTP because since OLTP is mission critical, and all these pieces stick together, our architecture is not only faster than IBM's. It's much more reliable. Exadata has a fault-tolerant architecture. There is no single point of failure, which is much more important in OLTP than it is in data warehousing. So we're faster and more reliable. Now we have -- people are skeptical about any new products. They buy a couple of machines and they test them and then they put them into production. And if we're successful, then they'd start making standardization decisions. But I think the combination of much better performance and the fact that it's appliance where all the pieces fit together, engineered to fit together and tested together. And the fact that it is a fall tall and our architecture gives us a huge advantage over IBM and the OLTP space. Though again, each customer will take their time in trying it and then making a decision. But we're making really good progress. I want to add on to what Safra said. She forecast Hardware at $1 billion for Q1. But the guidance is the guidance. However, you should know our plan is to dramatically grow the Sun sales organization and strongly grow the Sun business. Your early question, are we just focused on profitability? We are focused on growing the Sun business and growing it rapidly. We're being very conservative in our guidance as we should be, but we're adding a lot of salespeople. Maybe Charles can comment on just quickly -- it takes them a while to get productive.

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rate unless otherwise stated. 
This quarter, foreign exchange rates were not much of a factor in our overall results compared to our guidance of a 3% benefit to New License revenue and a 4% benefit to total revenue. Even with the currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were at the high end of our guidance range for total revenue, and we beat our guidance ranges for New License revenue and EPS, with record earnings per share this quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we beat our guidance ranges for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share. In short, Q4 was an excellent quarter for Oracle. 
In the fourth quarter, New Software License revenues were $3.1 billion, up 14%. The Americas grew 28%. EMEA was down 3% in U.S. dollars and up 4% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 15%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. 
Technology New License revenues were $2.3 billion, up 18% as the Americas grew 34%. EMEA was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 6% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 19%. Applications New License revenues were $855 million, up 6% from last year. The Americas grew 16%, EMEA was down 7% and Asia was up 2%. Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 13% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near record levels. 
Revenues from our Hardware Systems Products were $1.2 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support were $688 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 4% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $9.6 billion, up 40% from last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 26%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 46% for the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27.3% as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.60, $0.04 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.52 to $0.56. Earnings per share were up 30% from last year. 
In Q4, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $24.94 per share for a total of $250 million. For the full year, we repurchased 43.3 million shares at an average price of $22.94 per share for total of $993 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate at our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. 
Now turning briefly to fiscal 2010 full year results. New Software License revenues were $7.5 billion, up 6% for the year. The Americas were up 15%, EMEA down 5% and Asia grew 4%. Technology New License revenues were $5.4 billion, up 6%, while Applications New License revenues were $2.1 billion, also up 6%. Software License Updates and Product Support revenues totaled $13.2 billion, up 10%. Our total revenues were $27.0 million, up 15%. Non-GAAP operating income was $12.5 billion, up 15%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 46%. Our fiscal 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.67, up 16% from last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We had $18.5 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 53 days compared to 58 days last year and as a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters, up 9% from last year. Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."
22247,106856023,66583,"Oracle Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jun-24-2010",2010-06-24,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q4. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry. Obviously, we're very pleased with our Q4 results and with our outstanding performance throughout the year. Our business",818,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q4. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry. Obviously, we're very pleased with our Q4 results and with our outstanding performance throughout the year. 
Our business is extremely healthy with substantial strength in Database, Middlewares, App and Hardware. Our Tech business, highlighted by database, was spectacular this quarter with growth of 18%, including 34% growth in the Americas. Our Applications business was also strong with 5% growth over the last 12 months on a constant-dollar basis versus a negative 24% for SAP for our most recent quarter. 
Sun Hardware systems revenues came in well, taking into account the fact that we've already ended Sun's reselling of other companies' products, which had historically accounted for hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales. This quarter, we saw sales growth for Sun Hardware products. 
In addition, our estimates for the Sun business contribution to operating income comes in at over $400 million for our first full quarter after the merger. This compares with the loss in Sun's quarter ending June of last year when Sun was an independent company. 
Now to get to that number, we've done some allocations for the quarter and because a lot of our back office and Software R&D and Software sales operations have already been integrated with Oracle's pre-merger teams. Now in the coming quarter, some of the expense estimates may really be too difficult to make, but we will break out the revenues and the segregated expenses whenever possible for the remainder of this year. Clearly, we continue to expect some contributions to meet or exceed $1.5 billion for non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 and $2 billion in fiscal '12. 
We've also made excellent progress with our supply chain efficiency efforts as the non-GAAP gross margins for systems was 46%, much, much higher than the 33% we reported last quarter. And as a reminder, Sun's product gross margin, which included Software margin, was 38% last year. 
In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 46%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM and SAP. Our 46% operating margin remains much higher than SAP's, even though we are also selling hardware. 
Fiscal 2010 again demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio, better priced products, the breadth and loyalty of our huge customer base and the strength of our operating model. The fact is, we have a lot of company-specific momentum. We really executed well throughout the year and exceeded our own expectations quarter after quarter. 
Now before I turn to guidance for the upcoming year, let me just remind everyone that our plans for Sun is based on a more profit-aware model. As we've said a number of times, we are no longer selling products at a loss as Sun did. We are now compensating our sales teams on margins not just revenue. And this has the effect of changing the sales mix from systems where Sun lost money to value-added systems where Sun's differentiation is clear to our customers. These changes are allowing us to form a baseline for our Hardware revenues and profitability at a level from which they can grow. 
So let's get to the guidance. And we do believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming the exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rate and a negative 3% effect on total revenue growth rate.
With that, our guidance for Q1 is as follows: New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 14% in constant currency and 2% to 12% at current exchange rates. Hardware Product revenues are expected to be around $1 billion in constant currency. That doesn't include the Hardware Support revenue. Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 44% to 48% in constant currency and 41% to 45% at current exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 42% to 46% in constant currency and 39% to 43% at current exchange rate. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.36 to $0.38 in constant currency, up from $0.30 last year and from $0.35 to $0.37 assuming current exchange rates. 
GAAP EPS for the first quarter is expected to be $0.18 to $0.19 assuming constant currency and $0.17 to $0.18 using current exchange rates. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 33.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. And lastly, the board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

And our primary competitors were companies like Teradata and Netezza. When we introduced Version 2 of our Exadata Database Machine, in partnership with Sun and then we bought Sun, we really focused not simply on data warehousing performance but also on online transaction processing. And our current version of the Sun Exadata Database Machine substantially outperforms IBM's fastest computer in both data warehousing and transaction processing.
As a result in our previous quarter, in Q4, some of IBM's largest customer began buying Exadata machines rather than big IBM servers. And the 2011 Exadata pipeline continues to grow and is now approaching $1 billion, making Exadata the fastest-growing new product in Oracle's history. 
Now back to Q4. Again, I said the competition has really shifted from companies like Teradata and Netezza to big IBM machines and the Q4 results bore that out. We beat IBM 30 times in Q4. We beat Teradata nine times in Q4. And we beat Netezza seven times in Q4. And we sold the Exadata machines into some of IBM's largest and bluest accounts including Bank of America, Carrefour, the second largest retail in the world behind Wal-Mart, and Thomson Reuters. I'll turn it over to Charles who will give you a broader picture of how our other products did in Q4. Charles?"

We really had good teamwork across all of the account execs by products family. And it was really a good quarter as you can see. North and Latin America were strong results. They exceeded plan as they have all year long. EMEA in particular",859,"Thanks, Larry. We really had good teamwork across all of the account execs by products family. And it was really a good quarter as you can see. North and Latin America were strong results. They exceeded plan as they have all year long. EMEA in particular did a great job with delivering results against the tough comparisons especially in the context of change the U.K. government, financial instability in Greece and Spain while integrating an acquisition. So with all those headwinds, they delivered good results. And Japan saw a rebound from a rough start to the beginning of the year. 
What I'm seeing in the field right now is we have many more touch points with our accounts. So our visibility and understanding of customer requirements is significantly improved. And right now, almost any decision they make in the data center could potentially involve Oracle now. So we have deployed a cadre of technical advisors that we call client architects that essentially act as dedicated CTOs for our large customers who want to stay tightly aligned with Oracle's strategy. And these client architects are more in demand as we become more important to customers. They advise the CIOs on how to invest and shape their architectures in concert with Oracle's investments. 
We're improving the attach rate on deals to direct along the multiple products, up and down the stack. And we should continue to get better as supplies get more integrated. We also saw partners, in particular the systems integrator and even some of the hardware companies, now make a concerted effort to reinvigorate their Oracle partnerships close to Sun acquisitions, which may be counterintuitive. But I think they'd see the momentum in the market and want to align themselves accordingly. 
It's also reflected in the amount of companies signing up as sponsors for Oracle OpenWorld, by the way. So product comments, Fusion Middleware 11g, upgrades to 11g from 10g are off to a faster pace. Keep in mind that we already had most of the customer base on 10g, 88% were in 10g, and now they're moving faster than the 10g customers' move. 
We have several new options around 11g, which means about 70% of installed base are candidate for add-on product modules once they upgrade. WebCenter within the Fusion Middleware suite did well in the quarter. Just wanted to point that out because with the enterprise important content management under that product, we replaced SharePoint at Airbus and McAfee. Also, I wanted to note that one of the recent acquisitions, GoldenGate, which is the leader in data replication across heterogeneous databases, got off to an extremely bad start with wins at Sun and other large companies. But more importantly, it's getting us into accounts who are using non-Oracle databases since they're replicating across databases. 
During the quarter, we released the Enterprise Linux version 5.5. We now have over 5,000 Linux customers on our Enterprise Linux, over 400 added in the quarter. 
We're making investments around the Oracle VM, our virtualization product. We're working on ways to leverage our virtualization across our entire product line. Just one small example, we're working on the Oracle VM Machine. This is Sun server with an integrated network switch storage array. Oracle VM, VM Manager and VM Templates pre-configured and are ready-to-deploy rack. So we can package this technology in ways that most people can't. It adds a lot of value. Our competitors are trying to mimic it right now. 
We also released Enterprise Manager 11g in the quarter. That's our systems management product. That's a milestone release because first, I mean, it's applications down to storage, which is kind of what we're been talking about for quite a while, but this single management platform to monitor that entire stack. 
In the Applications area, we had a very strategic and large win at Merck across multiple pillars. It also included some health sciences products from the vertical -- in that GBU. And CRM, I've talked about ADP in the past. They expanded their CM footprint with both on-premise and on-demand CRM. We're their standard there now. As to PLM, we had a large win at Foxconn, a large contract manufacturer that makes the iPhone. Although they're using an SAP back end, they're using ADO now for product life cycle management. So our edge applications continue to do extremely well in SAP accounts. 
And then in financial services, we had a good win with Mantas and Reveleus, our risk management and anti-money laundering solutions at PNC Financial Services Group. And we won two large banks in China with our FLEXCUBE core banking platform, and they're working with us to build out the localizations, which is important for future wins. 
And lastly, just let me give you a sense of the types of Hardware purchases on the Sun's SPARC tech. While we're seeing momentum there as you saw in the numbers, types of companies that are committing to the M-series or the Q-series, International Paper, Thomson Reuters, MTrack, Cummins, EMG, Procter & Gamble, Qualcomm, eBay, PayPal, all in this quarter and that's just a small sampling. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over."

It's the reason I'm giving you guidance, it's what we actually think we're going to do. But we will need a year to understand the amount of seasonality that there is in the Hardware business. We don't have a full visibility. And as I did mention, we are no longer reselling some products that were other people's products, which Sun sold for hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And so that has to be -- we need a year without that for you to get a baseline. But in general, we feel that we already see it. Customers are buying a lot of hardware now. They are very, very loyal to technology that they love. And now that they know that it has a future and that we are investing an enormous amount in continuing these lines and enhancing them, they're much more comfortable making those investments again. So as you can see, sequentially, we're not projecting a very large decline, which in our Software business, we usually are between Q4 and Q1 because we have some hardware-specific momentum we're very upbeat about.

As long as we can demonstrate in benchmarks that we're a lot faster than IBM's fastest computer, the appliance is particularly attractive in OLTP because since OLTP is mission critical, and all these pieces stick together, our architecture is not only faster than IBM's, it's much more reliable. Exadata has a fault-tolerant architecture. There is no single point of failure, which is much more important in OLTP than it is in data warehousing. So we're faster and more reliable. Now we have -- people are skeptical about any new product. They buy a couple of machines and they test them and then they put them into production. And if we're successful, then they'd start making standardization decisions. But I think the combination of much better performance and the fact that it's appliance where all the pieces fit together, engineered to fit together and tested together. And the fact that this is a fall tall at our architecture gives us a huge advantage over IBM and the OLTP space. Though again, each customer will take their time in trying it and then making a decision. But we're making really good progress. I also want to add on to what Safra said. She forecast our Hardware at $1 billion for Q1. The guidance is the guidance. However, you should know our plan is to dramatically grow the Sun sales organization and strongly grow the Sun business. Your earlier question, are we just focused on profitability? We are focused on growing the Sun business and growing it rapidly. We're being very conservative in our guidance as we should be, but we are adding a lot of sales people. Maybe Charles can comment on just how quickly -- and it takes them a while to get productive. But maybe Charles can comment on just how quickly we are adding distribution capacity to the Sun sales organization so we can grow that business."

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates unless otherwise stated. 
This quarter, foreign exchange rates weren't much of a factor in our overall results, compared to our guidance of a negative 2% currency effect to New License revenue and a negative 3% currency effect to total revenue. We beat the high end of our guidance range for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share, with a record earnings per share for the first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we also beat our guidance ranges for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share. In short, Q1 was an excellent quarter for Oracle. 
In the first quarter, New License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 25%. The Americas grew 33%, EMEA was up 12% and Asia was up 26%. With each region up double digits on a constant dollar basis as well, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. Technology New License revenues were $937 million, up 32% as the Americas grew 44%, EMEA was up 25% and Asia was up 19%. Applications New License revenues were $349 million, up 10% from last year. The Americas grew 14%, EMEA was down 19% and Asia was up 54%. 
Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 11% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Revenues from our Hardware Systems Products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support were $680 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 18% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $7.6 billion, up 50% from last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 27%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 39% for the quarter. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 24.7% as we saw some onetime benefits to our tax rate. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.42, $0.05 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.35 to $0.37. Earnings per share were up 38% from last year. In Q1, we repurchased 10.8 million shares at an average price of $23.13 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking to account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet, we have $23.6 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 45 days compared to 46 days last year, and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters.

I'm going to just make a few brief comments on Q1, and then I'll review the guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark. Obviously, we're extremely pleased with our Q1 results, which follows a truly great FY 2010. Our Software License growth was, frankly, outstanding. It was more than double the high end of our guidance actually. And as I said in the past, what's really going on is we have a lot of company specific momentum in each line of business, both Software and Hardware Systems. Our customers are realizing that it's far better to buy open and integrated solutions from us rather than discrete components from half a dozen software vendors. 
Clearly, the benefits of engineered systems are obvious to them. We are just seeing more opportunities involving more of our products, and deals seem to be getting a little bigger. Customers are buying our applications, including industry-specific applications and of course, are deploying those applications on our Middleware suite, database and operating systems, both Solaris and Linux. And now they are seeing real benefit to deploying those applications and technologies on our optimized Hardware Systems. So discrete product competitors are just becoming less and less relevant. 
Our Hardware System revenue also came in, as you can see, better than we had expected, particularly since this is the first time the Sun guys have had an August close. Because I actually do read what you guys write, I want to repeat something I said on previous calls regarding Sun's Hardware business and how we changed it. First, we've ended numerous reselling agreements, accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars of Hardware revenue that usually came to Sun at little or no profit at all. 
Secondly, Sun lost a lot of money chasing commodity server share, but never really had the volume to actually compete effectively on price. We are not going to chase highly unprofitable revenue. And thirdly, we have redirected the Hardware business to the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage. 
Think Exadata. There's a reason we talk about it all the time. We're focused on the sweet spot of the market for us where we can deliver unique value for our customers. So comparing Hardware revenue to Sun's historical revenue is just not terribly meaningful. Now you can see all this show up in our gross margins for Systems, which was over 48%, higher than last quarter, which was 46%, when, even though our volumes are much lower in Q1. So in addition to our strong top line performance in both Hardware and Software, we delivered very strong operating margins as usual. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 39%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM and SAP. Actually, our 39% operating margin is 10% higher than SAP, even though we're also selling Hardware. 
So let me get to the guidance, and we do believe that the guidance I'm giving is realistic though conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 3% currency effect on license growth and a negative 4% on total revenue growth, with that our guidance for Q2 is as follows: New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 9% to 19% in constant currency, and 6% to 16% at current exchange rates. Hardware product revenues are expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in constant currency, or $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion at current exchange rates and that does not include the Hardware Support revenue. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 43% to 47% in constant currency, and 39% to 43% at current exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue at somewhere between 42% to 47% growth in constant currency, and 38% to 43% at current exchange rates. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.47 in constant currency, and $0.44 to $0.46, up from $0.39 last year, assuming current exchange rates. GAAP EPS for the second quarter is expected to be $0.28 to $0.30, assuming constant currency, $0.27 to $0.29 at current exchange rates. Now my guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%. Now of course, it may end up being different. And of course, our board again declared a dividend of $0.05. 
With that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Let's see. We have",1354,"Thank you, Safra. I know there's been a lot of concern about Oracle going into the Hardware business, and so I'm going to focus my comments about the Sun Hardware business, how we found it and what we've done to try to make it better. 
Let's see. We have two fundamental goals in the Sun Hardware business. First, to make it profitable, and quoting one of our great presidents, mission accomplished. We now have a very, very profitable Hardware business and made a substantial contribution to our overall profitability in Q1. We have a profitable business, and we think it's going to become more profitable throughout the fiscal year. But again, I want to emphasize the Sun Software business is clearly profitable. I'm going to focus on the Sun Hardware business. And so I'm saying it's already making a substantial contribution to our profitability. 
Since we took over Sun, we've improved the gross margins to 48.4%. That's up from a nadir of around 38% when Sun was running things. And we think there's more to go. I mean, I don't know if we can get to 60%, but 60% is kind of a target. It depends on our product mix, and it's not going to happen overnight. But again, I think we can very substantially improve those gross margins.
So again, we're profitable. We want to make it more profitable. Going to get better throughout the year. Once profitable, and we are profitable, we've got to grow the size of that business and we think we can double it. I mean, this could take some time. But again, we think we can double the size of that Hardware business, and we think we have to. We have to go out and aggressively take share from IBM and our other hardware competitors. 
All right. To make the Sun business more profitable, what have we done and what are we going to do? The first thing and easiest thing to do was to stop pursuing business that was not profitable as Safra pointed out. Let's stop chasing revenue and start chasing profit. So we're not selling Hitachi disks anymore. It's a terrific product, but we don't make any money reselling it. We're not selling Veritas NetBackup anymore. We're not pursuing these high-performance computing deals, which are big deals and very prestigious. But again, I don't know anyone who makes any money on these things. So we're out of those businesses, and that I think a lot of people are looking at our top line and saying that we're not growing. Our top line is growing, but that growth has been offset by kind of dumping these unprofitable lines of business. We filled in with other businesses which are more profitable. 
So that's done. We don't resell things that are unprofitable. We don't pursue business that's unprofitable. The other thing we're doing is try to optimize operations over there. We will be to a single integrated computer system for order management, for network support, for dispatch for field service. We'll have all of that done around January. So that's a pretty good record level. Oracle and Sun will be on a single unified global system in January, everything. HR, payroll, accounting, service, order management, inventory, everything is going to be in place in January. And that's going to be a big help. That will make our operations more efficient and more profitable.
And we're reducing the number of contract manufacturers, and reducing the number of contract manufacturer locations. So we're simplifying that. And by doing that, we're able to negotiate better deals with those contract manufacturers. We're directly shipping from those manufacturers to our customers, which we hadn't been doing before, which will lower our cost and get our customer their products sooner. We had I think seven or 11, I can't remember which, parts depot location in the Bay Area alone and reducing that to a couple. So we're simplifying and optimizing the operations. Again, we think this is going to have impact throughout this fiscal year. But we'll get in pretty good shape by the end of this fiscal year, and that's going to help the profitability of our business and the responsiveness of our business to our customers.
All right. The other thing, in terms of growing the top line on the Sun business, is we got to innovate in the area of interesting new products. And we inherited some new products from Sun, which are terrific with the ZFS Storage Appliance. And again, the unique thing about the ZFS Storage Appliance, it's a Solaris disk system that integrates hardware and software with the hardware and software engineered to fit together. So we love the product that was done at Sun. 
Of course, we had been working with Sun to do other engineered hardware-software combinations, Exadata being the best-known. My quote in the release was the Exadata pipeline for the full fiscal year is now up to $1.5 billion and growing rapidly. We think this is going to be huge business for us, and we're going to be introducing more hardware-software combinations at OpenWorld next week. That's a big focus for us, which is to leverage our advantage, which is being both a software company and a hardware company, engineering all the pieces so they fit together and work together well. And we think that's going to make customers' lives a lot easier, with systems that are easier to operate, more reliable and faster. That's certainly true of Exadata and will be true with the other products we announce in this area. 
We're upgrading our STAR and SPARC processors. We think we can build processors as fast as anybody else. I mean, IBM's got a terrific processor. Intel's got a terrific processor, and we think we will have a terrific processor. We got a way to go yet, but I think we're making really good progress building the team and building the next generation of SPARC processors.
Okay. That's kind of on the technology side of the Sun Hardware business, where I think we're making good progress and we will continue to invest in that area. 
The other thing is in distribution. Sun had been going from direct sales from the old Advanta [ph] days, if you remember that name, where Sun had one of the great sales forces in the industry, to virtually laying off the bulk of their sales force and going through partners. And that's not the kind of company we are. I mean, we sell directly to very large customers where we offer them technology and the services to exploit that technology effectively. And we already have those direct relationship with those big customers in Software, and we need the same relationships both on the sales side and on the service side in the Hardware part of the business. Because again, we see that as a unified business. There really is no such thing as the hardware business or the software business. The business that we're in is a systems business, and we have to provide support in the systems business. We have to sell systems. 
It's really one business. And since we're direct in software, we need to be direct in hardware. That's going to improve our margins. That's going to improve our penetration. That's going to increase our top line. We're adding about 2,000 salespeople, which include not just sales men, but also include sales engineers and service engineers. And we're doing that with basically no net increase in our overall Sun division headcount. I mean, we're eliminating or we have eliminated about 2,000 positions of non-revenue producing, nontechnical people, replacing them with revenue-producing people and technical people. 
So we expect we can grow that business. We can double that business. We can deliver better products and higher quality of services to our largest customers. We're very excited about this, and we fully expect to exceed that target of $1.5 billion in operating profit in the full fiscal year and $2 billion the following year. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark Hurd. And Mark, welcome aboard."

What led me come to join Oracl",823,"Thanks, Larry. It's great to be here with Larry and Safra. Over the last 25 years, I've competed against and partnered with Oracle and I can tell you that Oracle has the most enviable portfolio of technology in the industry. What led me come to join Oracle is not what Oracle has accomplished in the past, but the clear growth opportunities I see going forward. The company is well positioned for where the industry and where customers are headed. I don't believe there is any other company in the industry better positioned than Oracle.
Oracle's obviously the leading database and middleware company at a time when data and digitization are increasing exponentially. So we essentially get to monetize the growth in data accruing around the globe. Oracle is way ahead of the competition in engineered systems, and Exadata is really just the beginning. And Oracle is defining that market. The growth opportunities with highly optimized engineered systems are just starting, and there's really no one else in the market with the software and hardware assets that can match Oracle. 
In addition, I think there is a large unappreciated opportunity in industry verticals. Telecom, banking, utilities, insurance, life sciences and others. These industries can no longer afford to do their own software development. Many of these vertical markets individually are larger than ERP in its entirety. We have a huge lead in industry-specific applications with our Global Business Units, and the fact is no other large software company has even started addressing these markets. Last, Oracle is a large global platform at a time when much of the growth is going to occur outside of the United States, and we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth. 
What really gives me confidence in Oracle's growth is the sheer size of our R&D investments and our financial capacity to execute. We generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, and we expect that we will spend over $4 billion this year on R&D. And we are going to spend all next week at OpenWorld explaining just how we are spending that money. Without giving anything away, let me assure you it's well spent. So I'm going to speak quickly, I'm really excited about opportunities at which I've just touched with you. 
Let me turn to our Q1 results. I've been doing this a long time, 25% License growth in a company this size is a big number, especially for a company that closes in August. And again, I've been doing this a long time. I've been selling for over 30 years, but I personally never had to close the books in August. So the credit for this really has to go to the sales organization. This is a fantastic performance. 
This quarter, we had several end-to-end Oracle wins, which were sold products from applications to technology and systems. An example is Vivo, the largest mobile telephone operator in the southern hemisphere. We replaced their in-house legacy customer system with a Siebel system right on top of our Middleware, Database, operating system and Sun M9000 servers top to bottom Oracle technology. We had a particularly strong quarter in technology, both Database and Middleware, with growth of 32% and double-digit growth in every single region. 
In Database, we continue to see a strong migration of customers to 11gR2, which also benefits our Database options such as advanced compression and database vault. We have key Database win, along with Active Data Guard option at the New York Police Department to help with their counterterrorism efforts. 
In Middleware, our base of customers is now approaching 100,000. Fusion Middleware 11g, which we released last year, continues to do very well, with the fastest adoption curve we've seen over any of our previous releases. This quarter, we released a major new release of Oracle Business Intelligence 11g. While the product is very new, we've seen strong interest and had competitive wins, for example, at the Parliament of Victoria in Australia and at the state of Nevada.
On the Applications side, we had key wins against SAP at Mayan Resorts in Mexico and Molina Healthcare of California. Shifting to Systems, we saw growth again this quarter for the Sun products. On the high end, we saw great wins with the M9000 at Banco Itaú in Brazil against IBM, and also at Centrelink in Asia Pac where we beat IBM again with the M9000 systems. In the midrange, we beat IBM in winning a big deal with Telefónica in Spain in both an M2 and T Series products, and we had a significant win at NTT in Japan. In storage, we had a key win at Centrelink to modernize their TAPE Infrastructure. We also saw storage wins at Banco do Brasil, the state of New York and Branch Banking and Trust. 
Overall, a very strong quarter for Oracle. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And of course, it's a combined Hardware-Software sale. And whenever we sell Exadata, we sell database licenses unless the customer already has database licenses, and we sell storage server licenses. So for example, let me name my favorite Exadata sale, which was we put three Exadata racks into SOFTBANK and replaced 60, 6 - 0, Teradata racks. And about half of that sale was Hardware and half of that sale was Software. But that was a -- imagine 60 19-inch rack in a room full of gear, Teradata database machine out of coast [ph] and SOFTBANK is Teradata's biggest customer in Japan and in goes three Exadata machines. By the way, the three Exadata machines way outperformed those 60 Teradata racks. And a sale like that is reflected in both our Hardware line and our Software line. And I think Exadata really is helping our technology software growth substantially."

We really look at IBM as our number one competitor, and we're thrilled that they look at us as their number one competitor now. And we're going to work -- we know we have to work very hard to be successful in the competition. IBM's services business seems to be the dominant part of their business, and their product business is important but secondary to the services business, if you will. We look at it just reverse. We look at our products being the dominant part of our business. And one of the things we're trying to do with our products is obviate the need for services. So we do a very good job of integrating our applications together and making them easier to install and easier to upgrade you don't need as much service. So our goal -- again, if we engineer these hardware-software systems together like Exadata, where the storage and the network and the servers and the operating system, the database and all the stuff is in one box, you don't need as much integration services. So we're trying to attack -- it's reduced the amount of services required to take advantage of these systems. Having said that, our customers, especially in the big verticals, which Mark mentioned, in banking, we've got big banks going through transformations. We can't limit all the services, that's a fantasy. We can eliminate some of the stuff. But we're going to -- I think you'll see us engaging with our customers and providing services because they want us to. But we also have to be prepared to partner with other service line companies, and one of which is IBM. We've actually got a very good relationship with IBM in services, which we're trying to expand, let's say, in banking. IBM's got a terrific presence in banking. We've got some great banking products. IBM doesn't sell banking software, and we'd love for IBM to become expert in using our software to transform banks. And so again, our partnership with these service companies is actually critical.

When you automate a process, you not only reduce the labor, you actually eliminate the labor. And you actually raise the service level simultaneously, so the R&D that we have in fact is a supplement, if you will, to the services capability. And as we get to more of these engineered systems, where we can build something once, sell it many, many times and do that work remote and do it in an automated way, it is, frankly, a replacement for what you think is very labor-based services. I think as a product company, we want to be supporting those labor-based service companies though, and partner with them when it makes sense. So I think our strategy is to do both, to automate those processes, to be able to sell those automated capabilities and then to partner with the services companies as it makes sense."

And just curious what you're seeing in this region. And I'm not just the Apps license number was down year-over-year, but that's not different from what we're seeing from other companies. So I'm not picking on that all. But just trying -- we cover a lot of companies, right? Jason was trying to get to that. But what are you seeing in that region, and how did that affect your guidance this quarter?"

But to us, Europe, Middle East and Africa, is a lot of countries. There's a lot of potential there for us. And our overall license in constant currency was 18% growth, which I think most folks would have thought is impossible. And yet what's really happening is the same momentum we have in other geographies we have. Is it true that somebody's government is struggling and then if they weren't, we'd sell even more? Absolutely, of course. But as it is, we have so many products, and we have so much still opportunity. And I'll tell you in addition, I think our competitors are absolutely falling out of bed. So as a result, we are both the safe choice and we are the obvious choice. And to the extent that they have budgets, they use it with us. And secondly, I mean, the truth of the matter is these companies cannot just stop and these governments cannot just stop buying our software. They need it. They use it, and they ultimately have to go ahead and buy it and they are doing that. So it's true, 18% growth in this kind of a quarter in the summer in Europe, I'd say that's pretty darn good. And we expect -- actually in Europe, even the Apps number you mentioned, they actually had a very tough compare compared to everybody else. And I expect all around, I expect some very reasonable numbers, very good numbers out of Europe."

Austria, I mean, they have a virtual monopoly. They're closing in on 100% share in those countries, which make it very difficult. We're up to about 60% of the size of SAP in Europe now in Applications. And that's the toughest market, and we are bigger than they are in North America, for example, which is our home territory. So we think things are going pretty well in Applications in Europe, albeit it can be a bit lumpy. Q1 is our smallest License quarter, and you pointed out that -- we've got this one deal closed the first day of this quarter or Q1 apps would have looked a lot better in Europe. But we think overall, over the last four quarters, we've done very well in Europe against SAP, taking share from SAP in their home markets. We have a number of deals, especially in the books, which I think Mark rightly emphasized. We are a large software company, and we have a lot of software that industry-specific for retail, for telecommunication. We're winning all of the retail deals in Germany against SAP. All of them. Let me repeat that. 100% of them. So we're very happy on how things are going overall, looking back over the last four quarters with our most important software competitor in Europe, which is SAP."

And I always -- I guess the word Mike will use is dismissive of SAP's in memory database. And SAP took that, and Hasso Plattner did a movie where he interviewed himself. If you haven't seen it, it's on SAP's website. It's really worth watching, and he interviews himself. He plays two characters, and he talks about the SAP in-memory database. Now I never said we didn't believe in-memory databases. I said I thought it was peculiar that SAP would choose to compete with us in the arena of database technology. I mean, they compete with us in ERP and they've got their first take. They're ahead of us, and they've done quite well and they're the leaders there. But to compete with us in database just seem like a peculiar choice, especially if all of you can recall NetWeaver with their attempt to compete in Middleware. So they try to compete with us in Middleware, and we're not very successful and they hardly ever talk about NetWeaver. So after a failure in Middleware, sort of them to immediately move onto, ""Well, let's go tackle them in database with a two-pronged strategy. Let's buy Sybase,"" which did not run SAP. ""And then let's build on in-memory database technology kind of trumping Oracle in R&D and getting to market before them."" Let me announce today, I'll make the announcement now, that Oracle has had under development for some time in in-memory database, that's a part of the Oracle Database. And we will deliver that to the market before SAP delivers theirs. So we'll be out in the market with our technology. This is not radically a new technology. There are a number of university projects. There are tons of research papers. We've been following this for very, very long time. We don't live under a rock. We've been working on this for a very, very long time, and we'll deliver our product well in advance of their product. At least I believe that Oracle will do a better job delivering in-memory database technology, which is primarily the query optimization and it's based on a broadly different kinds of compression. And it's basically columnar -- it's Hybrid Columnar Compression. I'm not going with [ph] all the technology is, but we've been working on it for a long time. We'll be in the market before SAP, and I believe just like we beat them badly in Middleware, where Fusion Middleware beat NetWeaver, they had even less of a chance to beat us in database technology than they had to beat us in Middleware technology. I just think it was a colossal mistake to take us on in Middleware. It's a bigger mistake to take us on in database. And in the meantime, they've got this all new product called Business ByDesign, which is aimed at, I don't know, companies with four people, between four and 100 people or something like that, which is floundering horribly. And they've done nothing new in their core ERP business for 25 years. They still build an ABAP. So I guess this would come as a surprise to nobody. So after five years of development, NetSuite and Oracle OpenWorld will be announcing our Fusion Application suite, all the ERP products, all of the CRM products, all the HRMS products that been redone 100% in Java, all with integrated social networking Web 2.0 interface, brand-new stuff from the ground up. And SAP is going to go and compete with us using their 25-year-old technology. And it's a rather than focusing on their applications and upgrading their applications like we did with Fusion, they said, ""Oh, no, I have a better idea. You got to watch the video where Hasso interviews Hasso."" It's called ""Hasso Asks Hasso"" or something like that. You got to watch it. Instead of competing with us in applications and modernizing their applications, they say ""Oh, no, let's go kill Oracle in database technology."" Good luck. Operator?"

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates unless otherwise stated. 
This quarter, foreign exchange rates weren't much of a factor in our overall results, compared to our guidance of a negative 2% currency effect to New License revenue and a negative 3% currency effect to total revenue. We beat the high end of our guidance range for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share, with a record earnings per share for the first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we also beat our guidance ranges for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share. In short, Q1 was an excellent quarter for Oracle. 
In the first quarter, New License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 25%. The Americas grew 33%, EMEA was up 12% and Asia was up 26%. With each region up double digits on a constant dollar basis as well, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. Technology New License revenues were $937 million, up 32% as the Americas grew 44%, EMEA was up 25% and Asia was up 19%. Applications New License revenues were $349 million, up 10% from last year. The Americas grew 14%, EMEA was down 19% and Asia was up 54%. 
Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 11% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Revenues from our Hardware Systems Products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support were $680 million. Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 18% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $7.6 billion, up 50% from last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 27%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 39% for the quarter. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 24.7% as we saw some onetime benefits to our tax rate. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.42, $0.05 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.35 to $0.37. Earnings per share were up 38% from last year. In Q1, we repurchased 10.8 million shares at an average price of $23.13 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking to account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we have $23.6 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 45 days compared to 46 days last year, and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters.

I'm going to just make a few brief comments on Q1, and then I'll review the guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark. Obviously, we're extremely pleased with our Q1 results, which follows a truly great FY 2010. Our Software License growth was, frankly, outstanding. It was more than double the high end of our guidance actually. And as I said in the past, what's really going on is we have a lot of company specific momentum in each line of business, both Software and Hardware Systems. Our customers are realizing that it's far better to buy open and integrated solutions from us rather than discrete components from half a dozen software vendors. 
Clearly, the benefits of engineered systems are obvious to them. We are just seeing more opportunities involving more of our products, and deals seem to be getting a little bigger. Customers are buying our applications, including industry-specific applications and of course, are deploying those applications on our Middleware suite, database and operating systems, both Solaris and Linux. And now they are seeing real benefit to deploying those applications and technologies on our optimized Hardware Systems. So discrete product competitors are just becoming less and less relevant. 
Our Hardware System revenue also came in, as you can see, better than we had expected, particularly since this is the first time the Sun guys have had an August close. Because I actually do read what you guys write, I want to repeat something I said on previous calls regarding Sun's Hardware business and how we changed it. First, we've ended numerous reselling agreements, accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars of Hardware revenue that usually came to Sun at little or no profit at all. 
Secondly, Sun lost a lot of money chasing commodity server share, but never really had the volume to actually compete effectively on price. We are not going to chase highly unprofitable revenue. And thirdly, we have redirected the Hardware business to the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage.  
Think Exadata. There's a reason we talk about it all the time. We're focused on the sweet spot of the market for us where we can deliver unique value for our customers. So comparing Hardware revenue to Sun's historical revenue is just not terribly meaningful. Now you can see all this show up in our gross margins for Systems, which was over 48%, higher than last quarter, which was 46%, when, even though our volumes are much lower in Q1. So in addition to our strong top line performance in both Hardware and Software, we delivered very strong operating margins as usual. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 39%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM and SAP. Actually, our 39% operating margin is 10% higher than SAP, even though we're also selling Hardware. 
So let me get to the guidance, and we do believe that the guidance I'm giving is realistic though conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both Software and Hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 3% currency effect on license growth and a negative 4% on total revenue growth, with that our guidance for Q2 is as follows: New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 9% to 19% in constant currency, and 6% to 16% at current exchange rates. Hardware product revenues are expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in constant currency, or $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion at current exchange rates and that does not include the Hardware Support revenue. 
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 43% to 47% in constant currency, and 39% to 43% at current exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue at somewhere between 42% to 47% growth in constant currency, and 38% to 43% at current exchange rates. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.47 in constant currency, and $0.44 to $0.46, up from $0.39 last year, assuming current exchange rates. GAAP EPS for the second quarter is expected to be $0.28 to $0.30, assuming constant currency, $0.27 to $0.29 at current exchange rates. Now my guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%. Now of course, it may end up being different. And of course, our board again declared a dividend of $0.05. 
With that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments."

I know there's been a lot of concern about Oracle going into the Hardware business, and so I'm going to focus my comments about the Sun Hardware business, how we found it and what we've done to try to make it better. 
Let's see. We have two fundamental goals in the Sun Hardware business. First, to make it profitable, and quoting one of our great presidents, mission accomplished. We now have a very, very profitable Hardware business and made a substantial contribution to our overall profitability in Q1. We have a profitable business, and we think it's going to become more profitable throughout the fiscal year. But again, I want to emphasize the Sun Software business is clearly profitable. I'm going to focus on the Sun Hardware business. And so I'm saying it's already making a substantial contribution to our profitability. 
Since we took over Sun, we've improved the gross margins to 48.4%. That's up from a nadir of around 38% when Sun was running things. And we think there's more to go. I mean, I don't know if we can get to 60%, but 60% is kind of a target. It depends on our product mix, and it's not going to happen overnight. But again, I think we can very substantially improve those gross margins. 
So again, we're profitable. We want to make it more profitable. Going to get better throughout the year. Once profitable, and we are profitable, we've got to grow the size of that business and we think we can double it. I mean, this could take some time. But again, we think we can double the size of that Hardware business, and we think we have to. We have to go out and aggressively take share from IBM and our other hardware competitors. 
All right. To make the Sun business more profitable, what have we done and what are we going to do? The first thing and easiest thing to do was to stop pursuing business that was not profitable as Safra pointed out. Let's stop chasing revenue and start chasing profit. So we're not selling Hitachi disks anymore. It's a terrific product, but we don't make any money reselling it. We're not selling Veritas NetBackup anymore. We're not pursuing these high-performance computing deals, which are big deals and very prestigious. But again, I don't know anyone who makes any money on these things. So we're out of those businesses, and that I think a lot of people are looking at our top line and saying that we're not growing. Our top line is growing, but that growth has been offset by kind of dumping these unprofitable lines of business. We filled in with other businesses which are more profitable. 
So that's done. We don't resell things that are unprofitable. We don't pursue business that's unprofitable. The other thing we're doing is try to optimize operations over there. We will be to a single integrated computer system for order management, for network support, for dispatch for field service. We'll have all of that done around January. So that's a pretty good record level. Oracle and Sun will be on a single unified global system in January, everything. HR, payroll, accounting, service, order management, inventory, everything is going to be in place in January. And that's going to be a big help. That will make our operations more efficient and more profitable. 
And we're reducing the number of contract manufacturers, and reducing the number of contract manufacturer locations. So we're simplifying that. And by doing that, we're able to negotiate better deals with those contract manufacturers. We're directly shipping from those manufacturers to our customers, which we hadn't been doing before, which will lower our cost and get our customer their products sooner. We had I think seven or 11, I can't remember which, parts depot location in the Bay Area alone and reducing that to a couple. So we're simplifying and optimizing the operations. Again, we think this is going to have impact throughout this fiscal year. But we'll get in pretty good shape by the end of this fiscal year, and that's going to help the profitability of our business and the responsiveness of our business to our customers. 
All right. The other thing, in terms of growing the top line on the Sun business, is we got to innovate in the area of interesting new products. And we inherited some new products from Sun, which are terrific with the ZFS Storage Appliance. And again, the unique thing about the ZFS Storage Appliance, it's a Solaris disk system that integrates hardware and software with the hardware and software engineered to fit together. So we love the product that was done at Sun. 
Of course, we had been working with Sun to do other engineered hardware-software combinations, Exadata being the best-known. My quote in the release was the Exadata pipeline for the full fiscal year is now up to $1.5 billion and growing rapidly. We think this is going to be huge business for us, and we're going to be introducing more hardware-software combinations at OpenWorld next week. That's a big focus for us, which is to leverage our advantage, which is being both a software company and a hardware company, engineering all the pieces so they fit together and work together well. And we think that's going to make customers' lives a lot easier, with systems that are easier to operate, more reliable and faster. That's certainly true of Exadata and will be true with the other products we announce in this area.  
We're upgrading our STAR and SPARC processors. We think we can build processors as fast as anybody else. I mean, IBM's got a terrific processor. Intel's got a terrific processor, and we think we will have a terrific processor. We got a way to go yet, but I think we're making really good progress building the team and building the next generation of SPARC processors. 
Okay. That's kind of on the technology side of the Sun Hardware business, where I think we're making good progress and we will continue to invest in that area. 
The other thing is in distribution. Sun had been going from direct sales from the old Advanta [ph] days, if you remember that name, where Sun had one of the great sales forces in the industry, to virtually laying off the bulk of their sales force and going through partners. And that's not the kind of company we are. I mean, we sell directly to very large customers where we offer them technology and the services to exploit that technology effectively. And we already have those direct relationship with those big customers in Software, and we need the same relationships both on the sales side and on the service side in the Hardware part of the business. Because again, we see that as a unified business. There really is no such thing as the hardware business or the software business. The business that we're in is a systems business, and we have to provide support in the systems business. We have to sell systems. 
 
It's really one business. And since we're direct in software, we need to be direct in hardware. That's going to improve our margins. That's going to improve our penetration. That's going to increase our top line. We're adding about 2,000 salespeople, which include not just sales men, but also include sales engineers and service engineers. And we're doing that with basically no net increase in our overall Sun division headcount. I mean, we're eliminating or we have eliminated about 2,000 positions of non-revenue producing, nontechnical people, replacing them with revenue-producing people and technical people. 
So we expect we can grow that business. We can double that business. We can deliver better products and higher quality of services to our largest customers. We're very excited about this, and we fully expect to exceed that target of $1.5 billion in operating profit in the full fiscal year and $2 billion the following year. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark Hurd. And Mark, welcome aboard."

What led me come to join Oracl",821,"Thanks, Larry. It's great to be here with Larry and Safra. Over the last 25 years, I've competed against and partnered with Oracle and I can tell you that Oracle has the most enviable portfolio of technology in the industry. What led me come to join Oracle is not what Oracle has accomplished in the past, but the clear growth opportunities I see going forward. The company is well positioned for where the industry and where customers are headed. I don't believe there is any other company in the industry better positioned than Oracle. 
Oracle's obviously the leading database and middleware company at a time when data and digitization are increasing exponentially. So we essentially get to monetize the growth in data accruing around the globe. Oracle is way ahead of the competition in engineered systems, and Exadata is really just the beginning. And Oracle is defining that market. The growth opportunities with highly optimized engineered systems are just starting, and there's really no one else in the market with the software and hardware assets that can match Oracle. 
In addition, I think there is a large unappreciated opportunity in industry verticals. Telecom, banking, utilities, insurance, life sciences and others. These industries can no longer afford to do their own software development. Many of these vertical markets individually are larger than ERP in its entirety. We have a huge lead in industry-specific applications with our Global Business Units, and the fact is no other large software company has even started addressing these markets. Last, Oracle is a large global platform at a time when much of the growth is going to occur outside of the United States, and we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth.  
What really gives me confidence in Oracle's growth is the sheer size of our R&D investments and our financial capacity to execute. We generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, and we expect that we will spend over $4 billion this year on R&D. And we are going to spend all next week at OpenWorld explaining just how we are spending that money. Without giving anything away, let me assure you it's well spent. So I'm going to speak quickly, I'm really excited about opportunities at which I've just touched with you. 
Let me turn to our Q1 results. I've been doing this a long time, 25% License growth in a company this size is a big number, especially for a company that closes in August. And again, I've been doing this a long time. I've been selling for over 30 years, but I personally never had to close the books in August. So the credit for this really has to go to the sales organization. This is a fantastic performance.  
This quarter, we had several end-to-end Oracle wins, which were sold products from applications to technology and systems. An example is Vivo, the largest mobile telephone operator in the southern hemisphere. We replaced their in-house legacy customer system with a Siebel system right on top of our Middleware, Database, operating system and Sun M9000 servers top to bottom Oracle technology. We had a particularly strong quarter in technology, both Database and Middleware, with growth of 32% and double-digit growth in every single region. 
In Database, we continue to see a strong migration of customers to 11gR2, which also benefits our Database options such as advanced compression and database vault. We have key Database win, along with Active Data Guard option at the New York Police Department to help with their counterterrorism efforts. 
In Middleware, our base of customers is now approaching 100,000. Fusion Middleware 11g, which we released last year, continues to do very well, with the fastest adoption curve we've seen over any of our previous releases. This quarter, we released a major new release of Oracle Business Intelligence 11g. While the product is very new, we've seen strong interest and had competitive wins, for example, at the Parliament of Victoria in Australia and at the state of Nevada. 
On the Applications side, we had key wins against SAP at Mayan Resorts in Mexico and Molina Healthcare of California. Shifting to Systems, we saw growth again this quarter for the Sun products. On the high end, we saw great wins with the M9000 at Banco Itaú in Brazil against IBM, and also at Centrelink in Asia Pac where we beat IBM again with the M9000 systems. In the midrange, we beat IBM in winning a big deal with Telefónica in Spain in both an M2 and T Series products, and we had a significant win at NTT in Japan. In storage, we had a key win at Centrelink to modernize their TAPE Infrastructure. We also saw storage wins at Banco do Brasil, the state of New York and Branch Banking and Trust. 
Overall, a very strong quarter for Oracle. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And of course, it's a combined Hardware-Software sale. And whenever we sell Exadata, we sell database licenses unless the customer already has database licenses, and we sell storage server licenses. So for example, let me name my favorite Exadata sale, which was we put three Exadata racks into SOFTBANK and replaced 60, 6 - 0, Teradata racks. And about half of that sale was Hardware and half of that sale was Software. But that was a -- imagine 60 19-inch rack in a room full of gear, Teradata database machine, out it goes, and SOFTBANK is Teradata's biggest customer in Japan and in goes three Exadata machines. By the way, the three Exadata machines way outperformed those 60 Teradata racks. And a sale like that is reflected in both our Hardware line and our Software line. And I think Exadata really is helping our technology software growth substantially."

We really look at IBM as our number one competitor, and we're thrilled that they look at us as their number one competitor now. And we're going to work -- we know we have to work very hard to be successful in the competition. IBM's services business seems to be the dominant part of their business, and their product business is important but secondary to the services business, if you will. We look at it just reverse. We look at our products being the dominant part of our business. And one of the things we're trying to do with our products is obviate the need for services. So we do a very good job of integrating our applications together and making them easier to install and easier to upgrade; you don't need as much service. So our goal -- again, if we engineer these hardware-software systems together like Exadata, where the storage and the network and the servers and the operating system, the database and all the stuff is in one box, you don't need as much integration services. So we're trying to attack -- it's reduced the amount of services required to take advantage of these systems. Having said that, our customers, especially in the big verticals, which Mark mentioned, in banking, we've got big banks going through transformations. We can't limit all the services, that's a fantasy. We can eliminate some of the stuff. But we're going to -- I think you'll see us engaging with our customers and providing services because they want us to. But we also have to be prepared to partner with other service-oriented companies, and one of which is IBM. We've actually got a very good relationship with IBM in services, which we're trying to expand, let's say, in banking. IBM's got a terrific presence in banking. We've got some great banking products. IBM doesn't sell banking software, and we'd love for IBM to become expert in using our software to transform banks. And so again, our partnership with these service companies is absolutely critical.

When you automate a process, you not only reduce the labor, you actually eliminate the labor. And you actually raise the service level simultaneously, so the R&D that we have in fact is a supplement, if you will, to the services capability. And as we get to more of these engineered systems, where we can build something once and sell it many, many times and do that work remote and do it in an automated way, it is, frankly, a replacement for what you think is very labor-based services. I think as a product company, we want to be supporting those labor-based service companies though, and partner with them, and it makes sense. So I think our strategy is to do both, to automate those processes, to be able to sell those automated capabilities and then to partner with the services companies as it makes sense."

Q1 is our smallest License quarter, and you pointed out that -- we've got this one deal closed the first day of this quarter or Q1 apps would have looked a lot better in Europe.

And I always -- I guess the word Mike will use is dismissive of SAP's in memory database. And SAP took that, and Hasso Plattner did a movie where he interviewed himself. If you haven't seen it, it's on SAP's website. It's really worth watching, and he interviews himself. He plays two characters, and he talks about the SAP in-memory database. Now I never said we didn't believe in-memory databases. I said I thought it was peculiar that SAP would choose to compete with us in the arena of database technology. I mean, they compete with us in ERP and they've got their first take. They're ahead of us, and they've done quite well and they're the leaders there. But to compete with us in database just seem like a peculiar choice, especially if all of you can recall NetWeaver with their attempt to compete in Middleware. So they try to compete with us in Middleware, and we're not very successful and they hardly ever talk about NetWeaver. So after a failure in Middleware, for them to immediately move onto, ""Well, let's go tackle them in database with a two-pronged strategy. Let's buy Sybase,"" which did not run SAP. ""And then let's build on in-memory database technology kind of trumping Oracle in R&D and getting to market before them."" Let me announce today, I'll make the announcement now, that Oracle has had under development for some time an in-memory database, that's a part of the Oracle Database. And we will deliver that to the market before SAP delivers theirs. So we'll be out in the market with our technology. This is not radically a new technology. There are a number of university projects. There are tons of research papers. We've been following this for very, very long time. We don't live under a rock. We've been working on this for a very, very long time, and we'll deliver our product well in advance of their product. At least I believe that Oracle will do a better job delivering in-memory database technology, which is primarily the query optimization and it's based on a broadly different kinds of compression. And it's basically columnar -- it's Hybrid Columnar Compression. I'm not going with [ph] all the technology is, but we've been working on it for a long time. We'll be in the market before SAP, and I believe just like we beat them badly in Middleware, where Fusion Middleware beat NetWeaver, they had even less of a chance to beat us in database technology than they had to beat us in Middleware technology. I just think it was a colossal mistake to take us on in Middleware. It's a bigger mistake to take us on in database. And in the meantime, they've got this all new product called Business ByDesign, which is aimed at, I don't know, companies with four people, between four and 100 people or something like that, which is floundering horribly. And they've done nothing new in their core ERP business for 25 years. They still build an ABAP. So I guess this would come as a surprise to nobody. So after five years of development, NetSuite and Oracle OpenWorld will be announcing our Fusion Application suite, all the ERP products, all of the CRM products, all the HRMS products that been redone 100% in Java, all with integrated social networking Web 2.0 interface, brand-new stuff from the ground up. And SAP is going to go and compete with us using their 25-year-old technology. And it's a rather than focusing on their applications and upgrading their applications like we did with Fusion, they said, ""Oh, no, I have a better idea. You got to watch the video where Hasso interviews Hasso."" It's called ""Hasso Asks Hasso"" or something like that. You got to watch it. Instead of competing with us in applications and modernizing their applications, they say ""Oh, no, let's go kill Oracle in database technology."" Good luck. Operator?"

I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates unless otherwise stated. This quarter, foreign exchange rates weren't much of a factor in our overall results compared to our guidance of a negative 2% currency effect to new license revenue, and a negative 3% currency effect to total revenue.
We beat the high end of our guidance range for new license revenue, total revenue, and earnings per share with record earnings per share for the first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we also beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue, total revenue, and earnings per share. In short, Q1 was an excellent quarter for Oracle.
In the first quarter, new license revenues were $1.3 billion, up 25%. The Americas grew 33%, EMEA was up 12%, and Asia was up 26%. With each region up double digits on a constant dollar basis as well, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals.
Technology new license revenues were $937 million, up 32% as the Americas grew 44%, EMEA was up 25%, and Asia was up 19%. Applications new license revenues were $349 million, up 10% from last year. The Americas grew 14%, EMEA was down 19%, and Asia was up 54%.
Our software license updates and product support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 11% from last year. Customer support attached and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Revenues from our hardware systems products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from hardware system support were $680 million. Our services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 18% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $7.6 billion, up 50% from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, up 27%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 39% for the quarter. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 24.7% as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.42, $0.05 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.35 to $0.37. Earnings per share were up 38% from last year.
In Q1, we repurchased 10.8 million shares at an average price of $23.13 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet, we have $23.6 billion in cash and investments. Our day sales outstanding improved again to 45 days compared to 46 days last year and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters.

Our software",770,"Thanks, Jeff. I'm going to just make a few brief comments on Q1 and then I'll review the guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark.
Obviously, we are extremely pleased with our Q1 result, which follows a really great FY 2010. Our software license growth was frankly outstanding. It was more than double the high end of our guidance actually. And as I said in the past, what's really going on is we have a lot of company-specific momentum in each line of business, both software and hardware systems. Our customers are realizing that it's far better to buy open and integrated solutions from us rather than discrete components from half a dozen separate vendors. Clearly, the benefits of engineered systems are obvious to them.
We are just seeing more opportunities involving more of our products and deals seem to be getting a little bigger. Customers are buying our applications including industry-specific applications and of course they are deploying those applications on our Middleware suite, database and operating systems, both Solaris and Linux, and now they are seeing real benefit to deploying those applications and technologies on our optimized hardware systems. So, discrete product competitors are just becoming less and less relevant.
Our hardware system revenue also came in, as you can see, better than we had expected, particularly since this is the first time the Sun guys have had an August close. Because I actually do read what you guys write, I want to repeat something I've said on previous calls regarding Sun's hardware business and how we changed it.
First, we have ended numerous reselling agreements, accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware revenue that usually came to Sun at little or no profit at all. Secondly, Sun lost a lot of money chasing commodity server share, but never really had the volume to actually compete effectively on price. We are not going to chase highly unprofitable revenues.
Thirdly, we have redirected the hardware business to the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage. Think Exadata, there is a reason we talk about it all the time. We are focused on a sweet spot of the market for us where we can deliver unique value for our customers. So, comparing hardware revenue to Sun's historical revenue is just not terribly meaningful.
Now, you can see all this show up in our gross margins for systems, which was over 48%, higher than last quarter which was 46%, when even though our volumes are much lower in Q1.
So, in addition to our strong top line performance in both hardware and software, we delivered very strong operating margins as usual. With Sun included for the full quarter; our operating margin was 39%, substantially higher than our peers, including IBM and SAP. Actually, our 39% operating margin is 10% higher than SAP, even though we are also selling hardware.
So, let me get to the guidance, and we do believe that the guidance I'm giving is realistic though conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both software and hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 3% currency effect on license growth and a negative 4% on total revenue growth, with that our guidance for Q2 is as follows.
New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 9% to 19% in constant currency, and 6% to 16% at current exchange rates. Hardware product revenues are expected to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in constant currency or $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion at current exchange rate, and that does not include the hardware support revenue.
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 43% to 47% in constant currency and 39% to 43% at current exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue at somewhere between 42% to 47% growth in constant currency, and 38% to 43% at current exchange rates.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.47 in constant currency, and $0.44 to $0.46, up from $0.39 last year, assuming current exchange rates. GAAP EPS for the second quarter is expected to be $0.28 to $0.30 assuming constant currency, $0.27 to $0.29 at current exchange rates.
Now, my guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 30.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%. Now, of course, it may end up being different. And of course, our Board again declared a dividend of $0.05.
With that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments.

I know there has been a lot of concern about Oracle going into the hardware business, and so I'm going to focus my comments about the Sun hardware business, how we found it, and what we have done to try to make it better.Let's see. We",1444,"Thank you, Safra. I know there has been a lot of concern about Oracle going into the hardware business, and so I'm going to focus my comments about the Sun hardware business, how we found it, and what we have done to try to make it better.
Let's see. We have two fundamental goals in the Sun hardware business. First, to make it profitable and quoting one of our great Presidents, mission accomplished. We have - now have a very, very profitable hardware business that made a substantial contribution to our overall profitability in Q1. We have a profitable business, and we think it's going to become more profitable throughout the fiscal year.
Again, I want to emphasize, the Sun software business is clearly profitable. I'm going to focus on the Sun hardware business, and I'm saying, it's already making a substantial contribution to our profitability. Since we took over Sun, we have improved the gross margins to 48.4%. That's up from (inaudible) of around 38% when Sun was running things. And we think there is more to go. I mean, I don't know if we can get to 60%, but 60% is kind of a target. It depends on our product mix and it's not going to happen overnight, but again, I think we can very substantially improve those gross margins. So again, we are profitable; we want to make it more profitable, going to get better throughout the year.
Once profitable, and we are profitable, we have got to grow the size of that business, and we think we can double it. I mean, again, it's going to take some time, but again, we think we can double the size of that hardware business and we think we have to. We have to go out and aggressively take share from IBM and our other hardware competitors.
All right. To make Sun - the Sun business more profitable, what have we done and what are we going to do? The first thing and easiest thing to do was to stop pursuing business that was not profitable, as Safra pointed out. Let's stop chasing revenue and start chasing profits. So we are not selling Hitachi disks anymore. I mean, it's a terrific product, but we don't make any money reselling it. We are not selling VERITAS NetBackup anymore. We are not selling - we are not pursuing these high-performance computing deals which are big deals and very prestigious, but again I don't know anyone makes any money on these things.
So, we are out of those businesses and that - I think a lot of people will be looking at our top line and saying that we are not growing. Our top line is growing, but that growth has been offset by kind of dumping this unprofitable - these unprofitable lines of business. We have filled in with other businesses which are more profitable.
The other thing we are - so that's done. We don't resell things that are unprofitable. We don't pursue business that’s unprofitable. The other thing we are doing is trying to optimize operations over there. We will be to a single integrated computer system for order management, for support, for dispatch, for field service; we will have all of that done around January. So that's a pretty good record level. Oracle and Sun will be on a single unified global system in January, everything - HR, payroll, accounting, service, order management, inventory, everything is going to be in place in January and that's going to be a big help. That will make our operations more efficient and more profitable.
And we are reducing the number of contract manufacturers and reducing the number of contract manufacturer locations. So, we are simplifying that, and by doing that we are able to negotiate better deals with those contract manufacturers. We are directly shipping from those manufacturers to our customers, which we hadn't been doing before, which is - which will lower our costs and get our customers their products sooner.
We had I think seven - seven or 11, I can’t remember which, parts of depot locations in the Bay area alone and we are reducing that to a couple. So, we are simplifying and optimizing the operations. Again, we think this is going to have impact throughout this fiscal year but we will be in pretty good shape by the end of this fiscal year and that's going to help the profitability of our business and the responsiveness of our business to our customers.
All right. The other thing in terms of growing the top line of Sun business is we have got to innovative in the area of interesting new products and we inherited some new products from Sun which are terrific like the ZFS Storage Appliance and again the unique thing about ZFS Storage Appliance, it's a Solaris disk system that integrates hardware and software, with the hardware and software is engineered to fit together. So we love their product that was done at Sun.
We are working - of course we have been working with Sun to do other engineered hardware-software combinations, Exadata being the best known. My quote in the release was the Exadata pipeline for the full fiscal year is now up to $1.5 billion and growing rapidly.
We think this is going to be a huge business for us and we are going to be introducing more hardware-software combinations at OpenWorld next week. That's a big focus for us, which is to leverage our advantage which is being both a software company and a hardware company, engineering all the pieces so they fit together, and work together well. And we think that's going to make customers life a lot easier. They will get systems that are easier to operate, more reliable, and faster. That's certainly true of Exadata and it will be true with the other products we announced in this area.
We are upgrading our starter SPARC processors. We are on - we think we can build processors as faster as anybody else. I mean we think IBM has got a perfect processor, Intel has got a perfect processor, and we think we will have terrific processor. We got a way to go yet, but I think we are making really good progress building the team and building the next-generation SPARC processors.
Okay, that's kind of on the technology side of the Sun hardware business, where I think we are making good progress and we will continue to invest in that area. The other thing is in distribution. Sun had been going from direct sales from the old Advanta days, if you remember that name, where Sun had one of the great sales forces in the industry, to virtually laying off both of their sales force and going through partners and that’s not the kind of company we are.
I mean, we sell directly to very large customers, where we offer them technology and the service - and the services to exploit that technology effectively and we have those - we already have those direct relationship with the big customers in software and we need the same - those same relationships both on the sales side and on the service side in the hardware part of the business, because again, we see that as a unified business.
There is no - there really is no such thing as the hardware business or the software business. The business that we are in is a systems business and we have to provide support in the systems business. We have to sell systems. So it's really one business and since we are direct in software, we need to be direct in hardware; that's going to improve our margins, that's going to increase our penetration, that's going to increase our top line. We are adding about 2,000 sales people and - but - which includes not just salesmen, but also includes sales engineers and service engineers.
And - well, we are doing that with basically no net increase in overall Sun division headcount, and we are eliminating or have eliminated about 2,000 positions of non-revenue producing, non-technical people, replacing them with revenue producing people and technical people.
So we expect we can grow that business. We can double that business. We can deliver better products at higher quality of services to our largest customers. We are very excited about this and we fully expect to exceed that target of $1.5 billion in operating profit in the full fiscal year and $2 billion the following year.
With that, I will turn it over to Mark Hurd. And Mark, welcome aboard.

Over the last 25 years, I have competed against and partnered with Oracle and I can tell you that Oracle has amassed the most enviable portfolio of technology in the industry.What led me to com",833,"Thanks, Larry. It is great to be here with Larry and Safra. Over the last 25 years, I have competed against and partnered with Oracle and I can tell you that Oracle has amassed the most enviable portfolio of technology in the industry.
What led me to come to join Oracle is not what Oracle has accomplished in the past, but the clear growth opportunities I see going forward. The company is well-positioned to where the industry and where customers are headed. I don't believe there is any other company in the industry better positioned than Oracle. Oracle is obviously the leading database and middleware company at a time when data and digitization are increasing exponentially. So we essentially get to monetize the growth in data occurring around the globe.
Oracle is way ahead of the competition in engineered systems and Exadata is really just the beginning, and Oracle is defining that market. The growth opportunities with highly optimized engineered systems are just starting and there is really no one else in the market with the software and hardware assets that can match Oracle.
In addition, I think there is a large unappreciated opportunity in industry verticals, telecom, banking, utilities, insurance, life sciences, and others. These industries can no longer afford to do their own software development. Many of these vertical markets individually are larger than ERP in its entirety. We have a huge lead in industry-specific applications with our global business units, and the fact is no other large software company has even started addressing these markets.
Last, Oracle is a large global platform in a time when much of the growth is going to occur outside of United States and we are well-positioned to take advantage of that growth. What really gives me confidence in Oracle's growth is the sheer size of our R&D investments and our financial capacity to execute.
We generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, and we expect that we will spend over $4 billion this year on R&D. And we are going to spend all next week at OpenWorld explaining just how we are spending that money. Without giving anything away, let me assure you, it's well spent.
So I'm going to speak quickly. I'm really excited about the opportunities, of which I have just touched a few. Let me turn to our Q1 results. Listen, I've been doing this for a long time. 25% license growth in a company of this size is a big number, especially for a company that closes in August. And again, I have been doing this for a long time. I have been selling for over 30 years, but I personally never had to close the books in August. So the credit for this really has to go to the sales organization. This is a fantastic performance.
This quarter, we had several end-to-end Oracle wins, which were, sold products from applications to technology and systems. An example is Vivo, the largest mobile telephone operator in the Southern Hemisphere. We replaced their in-house legacy customer system with the Siebel system, running on top of our middleware database operating system in Sun M9000 servers, top to bottom Oracle technology.
We had a particularly strong quarter in technology, both database and middleware, with growth of 32% and double-digit growth in every single region. In database, we continue to see a strong migration of customers to 11gR2, which also benefits our database options such as Advanced Compression and Database Vault, where key database went along with Active Data Guard Option at the New York Police Department to help with their counter-terrorism efforts.
In middleware, our basic customers is now approaching 100,000. Fusion Middleware 11g, which we released last year, continues to do very well, with the fastest adoption curve we have seen over any of our previous releases.
This quarter, we released a major new release of Oracle Business Intelligence 11g. While the product is very new, we are seeing strong interest and had competitive wins for example, at the Parliament of Victoria in Australia and at the State of Nevada. On the application side, we had key wins against SAP at Mayan Resorts in Mexico and Molina Healthcare of California.
Shifting to systems, we saw growth again this quarter for the Sun products. On the high end, we saw great wins with the M9000 at Banco Itau in Brazil against IBM and also at Centrelink in Asia-Pac, where we beat IBM again with the M9000 systems. In the mid range, we beat IBM in winning the big deal of Telefonica in Spain in both M and T-Series products and we had a significant win at NTT in Japan.
In storage, we had a key win at Centrelink to modernize their TAPE Infrastructure. We also saw storage wins at Banco do Brasil, the State of New York, and Branch Banking & Trust. Overall, a very strong quarter for Oracle.
And with that, I will turn it back to Ken.

Well, I think Exadata - I mean, people think of Exadata as a hardware sale and of course it’s a combined hardware-software sale, and whenever we sell Exadata, we sell database licenses unless the customers already has database licenses and we sell storage server licenses.
So, for example, let me name my favorite Exadata sale which was, we put three Exadata racks into SoftBank and replaced 60 Teradata racks. And about half of that sale was hardware and half of that sale was software, but that was a - imagine this, 60 19-inch rack, kind of a room full of gear. Their Teradata machine out it goes, but SoftBank is Teradata’s biggest customer in Japan and in goes three Exadata machines. By the way, the three Exadata machines way outperform those 60 Teradata racks.
And that - and a sale like that is reflected in both our hardware line and our software line. And so we are - and that really - I think Exadata really is helping our technology software growth substantially.

But I think 60% is absolutely reasonable in gross margin, and can we do better? It depends on the product mix, I mean how many Exadata and how their engineered systems, ZFS Storage Appliance versus some of the other systems that are - T-Series, which is a little bit lower margin. But I think depending on the mix, we can get to 60% or better and I think we can just as importantly double the top line. So we can dramatically improve margins and double the top line.

I think Oracle is flattered, we have worked very hard. We look at IBM as our number one competitor and we are thrilled that they look at us as their number one competitor now and we are going to work - we know we have to work very hard to be successful in the competition.
IBM’s services business seems to be the dominant part of their business and the product business is important but secondary to the services business, if you will. We look at it just reverse. We look at our products being the dominant part of our business, and one of the things we are trying to do with our products is obviate the need for services. So if we do a very good job of integrating our applications together and making them easier to install and easier to upgrade, you don't need as much servicing.
So our goal - again, if we engineer these hardware, software systems together like Exadata where the storage and the network and the servers and the operating system, the database and all those stuff is in one box, you don't need as much integration services. So we are trying to attack the - to reduce the amount of services required to take advantage of these systems.
Having said that, our customers, especially in the big verticals, which Mark mentioned - in banking, we got big banks going through transformations and so this is a - we can't eliminate all the services, that's a fantasy. We can eliminate some of the stuff, but we are going to - I think you will see us engaging with our customers and providing services because they want us to. But we also have to be prepared to partner with other service oriented companies and - but - one of which is IBM.
We have actually got a very good relationship with IBM in services, which we are trying to expand, let's say in banking. IBM got a terrific presence in banking. We have got some great banking products. IBM doesn’t sell banking software and we look for IBM to become expert in using our software to transform banks.
And so - again, our partnership with these service companies is absolutely critical. The American companies, Accenture's, the IBM's, the Indian companies the work process - I', going to let - Mark knows lot more about this than I do. So, I'm going to let him comment.

I mean, listen, when you are running a big services company, the biggest issue is labor and you have got a lot of incidents that occur and you got a lot of labor trying to deal with those incidents of customers. And the secret to services in the future is the way to automate those incidents and you automate them through software.
So the future of services is software. When you automate a process, you not only reduce the labor, you actually eliminate the labor, and you actually raise the service level simultaneously. So the R&D that we have in fact isn't really - it's a supplement, if you will, to the services capability, and as we get to more of these engineered systems, where we can build something once and sell it many, many times, and do that work remote and do it in an automated way, it is frankly a replacement for what you today think of as very labor-based services.
I think as a product company, we want to be supporting those labor-based service companies though, and partner with them when it makes sense. So I think our strategy is to do both, to automate those processes, to be able to sell those automated capabilities, and then to partner with the services companies as it makes sense.

Customers are looking at us as their - really frankly, their most important vendor.

This is both sort of intuitively appealing, and obvious to our customers who otherwise have to run very, very complex systems, and that's why our deals, though we had no mega deals in the quarter or anything like that, but just deals are getting a little bit bigger, a little bit more products in every case.

I'm just curious of what you are seeing in this region.

Absolutely, of course. But as it is, we have so many products and we have so much still opportunity. And I'll tell you in addition, I think our competitors are absolutely falling out of that.
So as a result, we are both the safe choice and we are the obvious choice. And to the extent that they have got - that they have budget, they use it with us. And secondly, I mean, the truth of the matter is these companies cannot just stop and these governments cannot just stop buying our software. They need it, they use it, and they ultimately have to go ahead and buy it, and they are doing that.
So it's true, 18% growth in this kind of a quarter in the summer in Europe, I would say that's pretty darn good.

We are up to about 60% of the size of SAP in Europe now in applications. And that's the toughest market, and we are bigger than they are in North America, for example, which is our home territory. So we think things are going pretty well in applications in Europe, albeit, it can be a bit lumpy; Q1 is our smallest license quarter, and you point out that this is - the one deal - we have kind of missed one deal closed the first day of this quarter or Q1 apps would have looked a lot better in Europe.
But we think overall, over last - over the last four quarters, we have done very well in Europe against SAP, taking share from SAP in their home markets. We have a number of deals, especially, say in the books, which I think Mark rightly emphasizes. We are a large software company and we have a lot of software that we - that’s industry-specific for retail, for telecommunications. We are winning all of the retail deals in Germany against SAP, all of them. Let me repeat that, 100% of them.

And with other things, we have to have very substantial performance advantages, reliability advantages, security advantages, and cost advantages to go out and compete and - but - if we have those advantages - we have very highly differentiated engineered products to combine hardware and software. We think we can improve our margins and grow our share dramatically.
Rather than mucking around kind of trying to sell low end - a low-end server on price against Dell, we are partnering with Dell. We think Dell is a great company and we love partnering with them, but we don't want to compete in that space. They are very good at that. Mark?

In terms of database technology announcements, Greenplum, SAP in-memory and those things, we are pretty good at this database side. And I was - I guess the word I might - was used was dismissive of SAP's in-memory database and SAP took that and Hasso Plattner ran - did a movie, where he interviewed himself. If you haven't seen it, it's on SAP's website, it's really worth watching. And he interviews himself, he has played two characters, and he talked about the SAP in-memory database.
Now, I never said we didn't believe in in-memory databases. I said, I thought it was peculiar that SAP would choose to compete with us in the arena of database technology. I mean they compete with us in ERP and they got there first, they were ahead of us, and they have done quite well and they are the leaders there.
But to compete with us in database just seemed like a peculiar choice, especially, if all of you can recall NetWeaver with their attempt to compete in middleware. So they tried to compete with us in middleware and were not very successful and they hardly ever talk about NetWeaver.
So after a failure in middleware, for them to immediately move on to - well, let's go tackle them in database, and with a two-prong strategy let's buy Sybase, which does not run SAP, and then let's build our own in-memory database technology kind of trumping Oracle in R&D and getting to Oracle market before them.
Let me announce today - I'll make the announcement now that Oracle has had under development for sometime an in-memory database that's part of the Oracle database, and we will deliver that to the market before SAP delivers theirs. So we will be out in the market with our technology. This is not radically new technology, there are number of university projects, there are tons of research papers, we have been following this for a very, very long time. We don't live under a rock. We have been working on this for a very, very long time and we will deliver our product well in advance to their product.
Now, we have - I believe that Oracle will do a better job of delivering in-memory database technology, which is primarily for query optimization and it's based on a variety of different kinds of compression and it's basically columnar - it's hybrid columnar compression. I'm not going to go out [ph] with what the technology is, but we have been working on it for a long time. We will be in the market before SAP.
And I believe just like we beat them badly in middleware where Fusion Middleware beat NetWeaver, they have even less of a chance to beat us in database technology than they had to beat us in middleware technology. And I just think that was a colossal mistake to take us on in middleware. It's a bigger mistake to take us on in database.
In the meantime, they have got this all new product called Business ByDesign, which is aimed at, I don't know, companies of four people, between four and a hundred people or something like that, which is floundering horribly and they have done nothing new in their core ERP business for 25 years. They still (inaudible).
So this, I guess, which will come as surprise to nobody - so after five years of development, next week in Oracle OpenWorld, we will be announcing our Fusion application suite, all the ERP products, all the CRM products, all the HRMS products have been redone 100% in JAVA, all with integrated social networking Web 2.0 interface, brand new stuff from the ground up, and SAP is going to go and compete with us using their 25-year old technology.
And so rather than focusing on their applications and upgrading their applications like we did with Fusion, they said, oh no, I have a better idea. You got to watch the video where hostile interviews - or it's called hostile acts hostile [ph] or something like that. You got to watch it. Instead of competing with us in applications and modernizing their applications, they say, ""Oh, no, let's go kill Oracle and database technology."" Good luck.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates unless otherwise stated.
This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a negative 2% currency effect to both New License revenue and total revenue. In spite of this headwind, in both U.S. dollars and dollars, we beat the high end of our guidance range for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share. With record earnings per share for the second quarter.
In short, Q2 was another excellent quarter for Oracle.
In the second quarter, New Software License revenues were $2.0 billion, up 21%. The Americas grew 32% in U.S. dollars. EMEA was up 5% and Asia was up 21%. With each region up double digits on a constant dollar basis, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. Technology and license revenues were $1.4 billion, up 21%, as the Americas grew 36%, EMEA was down 1% in U.S. dollars, but up 7% in constant dollars and Asia was up 27%. Applications New License revenues were $579 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 23% and Asia was down 1%.
Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.7 billion, up 12% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Revenues from our Hardware Systems products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems support were $686 million. Our Services revenues were $1.2 billion, up 24% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $8.6 billion, up 47% from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 million, up 33%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 44% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 28.5%. Our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, $0.05 above the high-end of our EPS guidance range of $0.44 to $0.46. Earnings per share were up 33% from last year. In Q2, we repurchased 9.1 million shares at an average price of $27.35 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $24.8 billion in cash and investments. Our Days Sales Outstanding improved again to 46 days, compared to 47 days last year, and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.7 billion in free cash flow and a record $9.1 billion in operating cash flow during the last four quarters.
Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

I'll first comment on our non-GAAP results for Q2 and I'll then review the guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark. If you can see, we had another excellent quarter on top of the truly amazing Q1, we, as Jeff mentioned, exceeded the high point of our New License guidance, we beat the high end of our total revenue guidance and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by 5/10. Even excluding the payment from legal fees, we beat the high end of our EPS guidance 4/10. The strength in the quarter was  very broad based as you can see with technology grow 23% and app growing 22% in constant dollars. And all geographies really reported double-digit growth for New License sales. The Americas in particular reported spectacular results for 32% growth, highlighted by a 36% growth in technology with Fusion Middleware sales leading the way. Europe was great as well with 31% Apps growth.
You can see our momentum in our applications results as we continue to take share from SAP, their most New License revenues was actually down 14% from two years ago, while ours has grown 23% over that same period.
Sun Hardware Systems was within our guidance and you see this quarter, we saw sales growth for Sun Hardware product, as well as higher gross margins, which were 53% for the quarter. In addition to our strong, top line performance, we also delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 44%, substantially higher than our peers. Actually, our margins are 1,500 basis points higher than SAP Software operating margin, even though we are also selling hardware. At this week, we could benefit free Sun operating margins quite quickly.
Before I turn to guidance for the upcoming quarter, let me just remind everyone once again, that our plans for Sun business are based on more model. Once we reached the one-year anniversary, we would be able to see the hardware growth of more meaningful baseline. So with that, assuming exchange rates remain current levels, which right now is a positive 1% currency effect on license growth and 1% positive on total revenue growth, our guidance for Q3 is as follows. New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20% at current exchange rate and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware products revenues are expected to be around $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and that the does not include the Hardware support revenue.
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 31% to 35% at current exchange rate and 30% to 34% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 32% to 36% at current exchange rates, 31% to 35% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.48 and $0.50, assuming current exchange rates up from $0.38 last year and $0.48 to $0.50 in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the third quarter is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36 assuming current exchange rates and $0.34 to $0.36 in constant currency. This assumes a tax rate of 30.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. And the board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share.
Now before I turn the call over to Larry, I want to congratulate him for driving the sales both to a first ranking overall for the year. And with that, it's your turn, Larry."

And I'll talk about our strategy in our business specifically. Our goal is to become number one in the high end Services business for both the line transaction processing and the data warehousing, both of those segments. We are not interested in the low margin commodity segment as Services business was focused on high end OLTP, high data warehousing where the margins are good and we can highly differentiated products. Right now, our Sun behind IBM and HP and high end service. We think IBM's Hardware, Software technologies is quite competitive. While HP's big servers are slow, expensive and have little or no software value at. That makes HP extremely vulnerable to market share losses in the coming year.
Over the last year or so, we've introduced three new families of high-end servers, Exadata, Exalogic and this current quarter SPARC's super clusters. All these new high end engineered put our database and Middleware Software much faster than anything from either IBM or HP.
For example, this past quarter, our new SPARC's super cluster technology the industry benchmark to for online transaction processing called the TPCC benchmark. Our SPARC's super clusters run that industry standard OLTP benchmark at 30 million transactions per minute, shadowing IBM's old record, which is three of their back at 10 million transactions per minute. So let me just make this clear.
Sun, Oracle, 30 million transactions per minute. With HP, 10 million transactions per minute. With HP ever performance at 4 million transactions per minute. In dataware it's not uncommon for our Exadata machines to be 10x faster than the best of the competition. And IBM's purchase of that data in Greenplum technology is not likely to threaten the Exadata sales for lots of reasons, but mainly because Exadata is much faster than either those two technologies. And both of the Exadata and in the case of Greenplum, the customer have to rewrite their application to run on those machines.
So Exadata plus line is actually continues to grow rapidly even though know IBM is in season. And the Exadata pipeline is now approaching $2 billion. We expect overall that our new generation of Sun machines, Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC super clusters will enable us to win significant  in the high end server market and put us into the number two position to behind IBM very, very soon the middle put it up for IBM to number one spot.

You put all of these things in perspective, Exadata is Oracle super database machine that once the database and incredibly fast.

Our SPARC super cluster got a new generation earnings per share appeared, featuring SPARC and Solaris. It runs everything, database, Middleware, all of your applications -- migrate. All of those machines are designing to scale up and be used, gigantic clouds. Whether the top private or public. And I have a deep into it -- scalability. The other is we have to have built in fault tolerant. You can imagine disappointed people get when it's a cloud stops working. And all these people just can't get the data. So one thing that's common across Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC super clusters is the visible architecture. So one can everything else keeps running. That gives us not only scalability which we normally talk about, but also gives us this third key element, which is full tolerance, which HP doesn't have and IBM doesn't have because they don't really have parallel architectures for online transaction processing. I can't help but argue that it's also the cost of the scale that's a big benefit with Exadata. You get in traditional data warehouses. The way you try performance per traditional big Teradata warehouse is. So use trend at all this data come a lot of this coming from a lot of those against the trend -- Exadata is bringing the smarts to do data as what to do data smarts and it's changes. That's why -- this 15x to 50x improvements, these are huge because you can take that performance or you can take in lower cost like you do what everything Larry just sad. It's again, change."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates unless otherwise stated.
This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a negative 2% currency effect to both new license revenue and total revenue. In spite of this headwind in both U.S. dollars and constant dollars, we beat the high end of our guidance range for new license revenue, total revenue, and earnings per share with record earnings per share for the second quarter. In short, Q2 was another excellent quarter for Oracle.
In the second quarter, new software license revenues were $2.0 billion, up 21%. The Americas grew 32% in U.S. dollars, EMEA was up 5%, and Asia was up 21%. With each region up double digits on a constant dollar basis, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals.
Technology new license revenues were $1.4 billion, up 21% as the Americas grew 36%, EMEA was down 1% in U.S. dollars, but up 7% in constant dollars; and Asia was up 27%. Applications new license revenues were $579 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 23%, and Asia was down 1%.
Our software license updates and product support revenues were $3.7 billion, up 12% from last year. Customer support attached and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Revenues from our hardware systems products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from hardware system support were $686 million. Our services revenues were $1.2 billion, up 24% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $8.6 billion, up 47% from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 33%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 44% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the secpmd quarter was 28.5%. Our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, $0.05 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.44 to $0.46. Earnings per share were up 33% from last year.
In Q2, we repurchased 9.1 million shares at an average price of $27.35 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet, we have $24.8 billion in cash and investments. Our day sales outstanding improved again to 46 days, compared to 47 days last year. And is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.7 billion in free cash flow and a record $9.1 billion in operating cash flow during the last four quarters.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Safra.

As you can see we had another excellent quarter on top of the truly amazing Q1. We, as Jeff mentioned, exceeded the high point of our new license guidance. We beat the high-end of our total revenue guidance and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance to (03:00:08) $0.56, even excluding a payment for legal fees, we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.54.
The strength in the quarter was very broad based, as you can see with technology growing 23% and apps growing 22% in constant dollars. And all geographies really reported double digit growth for new license sales. The Americas in particular reported spectacular results with 32% growth, highlighted by a 36% growth in technology with Fusion Middleware sales leading the way. Europe was great as well, with 31% apps growth.
You can really see our momentum in our applications results as we continue to take share from SAP. Their most recent new license revenue is actually down 14% from two years ago, while ours has grown 23% over that same period. Sun Hardware Systems was within our guidance, and this quarter we saw sales growth for Sun hardware products as well as higher gross margins, which were 53% for the quarter.
In addition to our strong top-line performance, we also delivered very strong operating margin. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 44%, substantially higher than our peers. Actually, our margins are 1500 basis points higher than SAP's operating margins even though we are (03.01:37) (up in) hardware. At this rate we could be back at pre-start operating margins quite quickly.
Before we turn to guidance for the upcoming quarter, let me just remind everyone once again that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. Once we reach the one year anniversary, you wouldn't be able to see the hardware growth off a more meaningful baseline. So with that, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a positive 1% currency effect on license growth and 1% positive on total revenue growth, our guidance for Q3 is as follows. New Software license revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20% at current exchange rate and 9% to 19% in constant currency.
Hardware products' revenues are expected to be around $1.1 to $1.2 billion and that does not include the hardware support revenue. Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 31% to 35% at current exchange rate and 30 to 34% in constant currency.
On a GAAP basis we expect total revenue from 32% to 36% at current exchange rate and 31% to 35% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.48 and $0.50 assuming current exchange rate, up from $0.38 last year, and 48% to 50% in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the third quarter is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36 assuming current exchange rate and 34% to 36% in constant currency. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 30.5% and a Non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5. Of course, it may end up being different. And the Board again declared a dividend of $0.5 per share.
Now before I turn the call over to Larry, I want to congratulate him for driving his sail boat to a front place ranking overall for the year.
And with that it's your turn, Larry.

And I'd like to talk about our strategy and our server business specifically. Our goal is to become number one in the high-end server business for both Online Transaction Processing and Data Warehousing, both of those segments. We are not interested in the low margins commodity segment of the server base; we are focused on high-end OLTP, high end data warehousing, where the margins are good and we can have a highly differentiated product.
Right now our Sun servers, our number's really behind IBM and HP and our high-end server business. We think IBM's hardware and software technology is quite competitive, while HP's big servers are slow, expensive and have little or no software value add. That makes HP extremely vulnerable to market share losses in the coming year.
Over the last year or so, we've introduced three new families of high-end servers; Exadata, Exalogic, and this past quarter SPARC Superclusters. All these new high-end servers are engineered to run our database and middleware software much faster than anything from either IBM or HP. For example, this past quarter our new SPARC Supercluster technology ran the industry standard benchmark for online transaction processing called the TPCC benchmark. Our SPARC Superclusters ran that industry standard OLTP benchmark at 3 million transactions per minute, shadowing IBM's old record which they set on their fastest P7 and passed three of their fastest P7s at 10 million transactions per minute.
So let me make this clear; Sun Oracle, 30 million transactions per minute; three of those P7s, 10 million transactions per minute. With HPs best ever, it did the best performance a distant third at 4 million transactions per minute. And given where (4:2:58) it's not uncommon for our Exadata Machine to be ten times faster than the best of the competition.
And IBMs purchase of Netezza and EMCs purchase of Greenplum Technology is not likely to threaten Exadata sales for lots of reasons, but mainly because Exadata is much faster than either of those two technologies. And both in the case of Exadata and in the case of Greenplum, the customer has to rewrite their applications to run on those machines.
So Exadata pipeline continues to grow rapidly, even though IBM brought Netezza and EMC has launched Greenplum. And the Exadata pipeline is now approaching $2 billion.
We expect overall that our new generation of Sun machines, Exadata, Exalogic, and SPARC Superclusters will enable us to win significant share in the high-end server market and put it into the number two position behind IBM very, very soon. Then we'll fight it out with IBM for the number one spot.
And I'll turn it over to Mark.

It's taking place really as we say, where there are 13,000 customers attending. In total we had nearly 60,000 customers at these three shows.
Q3 was a great quarter for us because our customer base is very enthusiastic about the direction of Oracle's product portfolio. Earnings grew 33% this quarter and our margin performance made clear there's a ton of leverage in this business. I want to focus on our opportunities to grow revenue significantly over the next couple of years.
You can see our top-line momentum, 21% new software license revenue. We had a great quarter across the board. Technology and applications was excellent, more than 20%. All geographies had double digit growth in constant dollar, and our industry-focused businesses were up triple digits.
The deal volume was spread across companies of all sizes and we had a very healthy number of customer wins in the public sector as well. The strength in the quarter was very broad based.

We made more announcements relating to Sun's (core) technologies, specifically Solaris and SPARC. As an early indicator, we entered the quarter with a record hardware backlog.

With that I'll turn it back to Ken.

And we are beginning to see some significant re-buys, and a lot more customers translating their interest into purchases. And I think we are going to sell a lot more Exadata in Q3 than in Q2.
I think in terms of the halo effect, it's a general recognition now that you buy these high-end servers, you usually buy them to run specific software. And we believe that we do a good job of engineering the software and the server at the same time to make sure they work well together.
We have a huge competitive advantage over HP and IBM. Now, IBM does have a lot of software; HP does not. That makes them particularly vulnerable. But the notion of engineered systems, hardware and software that works together, I believe is going to dominate the high end of the business. By the way, it's already dominating the low end of the business, because I suspect you use either an Apple iPhone, an iPad or an Android, where specifically in the case of iPad and iPhone, they were engineered to work together, the Android not so.

We had made middleware acquisitions. We weren't satisfied just to resell what we bought. We actually rewrote a lot of what we bought.
So we had a unified architecture where we have a single common metadata repository for all the components of our middleware. And whether this is SOA Suite or for that matter BI, Business Intelligence, it's all Java-based. It's all rewritten. It's a single integrated suite where you can buy a piece at a time, but all the pieces fit together. You will hear that theme over and over again.
With Release 11 of our Middleware, everything has now been rewritten. All the pieces operate off a single metadata library. It's a much better user experience, because you can attach our entire Middleware suite with a single file. Versus, if you take IBM WebSphere, IBM WebSphere is literally dozens, if not more than a 100 separate products all with separate patching technologies.
So we think the fact that we have an integrated suite gives us a huge competitive advantage over IBM, and we are winning share there very, very rapidly. We'd expect the advantage we have in database, you will see over the next five years also moving to Middleware.

You put all of these things in perspective. Exadata is an Oracle-specific database machine that runs the database incredibly fast, and it includes obviously the servers, very, very fast network and (zapping) specific storage.
Exalogic is really designed to run our middleware and very specifically modern middleware java incredibly fast. And then our SPARC Supercluster is our new generation of general purpose computing, featuring SPARC and Solaris, it runs everything, data base, middleware, all of your applications. All this app you've got running on existing SPARC servers you can migrate to SPARC Superclusters.
All of those machines are designed to scale up and be used, if you will, in gigantic clouds whether they are private or public. And I'll handle petabytes of data, but handling petabytes to data is two-fold. One is you have to have scalability. The other is you have to have built-in fault tolerance. When you're running one of these big clouds, you can imagine how disappointing people get, when the cloud stops working. And all of these people just can't get their data.
So one thing that's common across Exadata, Exalogic, and SPARC Superclusters is that its a fault tolerant parallel architecture. So one component sales, everything else keeps running. That gives us not only scalability and performance, which we not only talk about, but also gives us the third key element, which is full tolerance, which HP doesn't have and IBM doesn't have, because they don't really have parallel architectures for online transaction processing.

These are huge, because you can take that either in performance or you can take it in the lower cost, while you do everything Larry just said. It's again changing.

In data base, and in middleware, and as far as applications, I want to go through here, but we think there are lots of reasons why we're continuing to gain share every quarter over the last few years, against SAP.
And I outlined kind of our three way strategy, to have inventory specific applications, where in a lot of cases Telco is running pretty much only Oracle software. And we're seeing some banks now making those kind of commitments to Oracle's offer up and down the stack. You know, SAP just doesn't have these applications.
Next is our commitment to protecting customer's investment in their existing Oracle technology, whether it's PeopleSoft, Siebel, JD Edwards, or E-Business Suite, and then make this huge investment. I think they're coming down very quickly in next calendar year. We're going to be talking a lot about fusion. We've got this new generation of applications by the way that runs on premise, add in the public cloud. Those private clouds on premise or publicly, nobody has this.
SAP business by design runs just in the cloud. SAP's traditional applications run just on premise. Fusion runs both places. You decide where you want to put this. You can't do that with Salesforce.com. You can't do that with Workday, a lot of these guys. So we got this brand new extremely modern java-based suite of applications called Fusion that runs in the cloud, runs on premises, going to dramatically strengthen our position against our cloud based competitors like Salesforce and Workday, and our traditional competitor SAP. So we think, you're just seeing the beginning of us gaining share applications. That's going to really take off next year.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated.
This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a negative 2% currency effect to both New License revenue and total revenue. In spite of this headwind, in both U.S. dollars and constant dollars, we beat the high end of our guidance range for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share, with record earnings per share for the second quarter. In short, Q2 was another excellent quarter for Oracle.
In the second quarter, New Software License revenues were $2.0 billion, up 21%. The Americas grew 32% in U.S. dollars. EMEA was up 5% and Asia was up 21%. With each region up double-digits on a constant-dollar basis, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. Technology New License revenues were $1.4 billion, up 21%. As the Americas grew 36%, EMEA was down 1% in U.S. dollars, but up 7% in constant dollars and Asia was up 27%. Applications New License revenues were $579 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 23% and Asia was down 1%.
Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.7 billion, up 12% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Revenues from our Hardware Systems products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support were $686 million. Our Services revenues were $1.2 billion, up 24%, as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $8.6 billion, up 47% from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 33%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 44% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 28.5%. Our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, $0.05 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.44 to $0.46. Earnings per share were up 33% from last year. In Q2, we repurchased 9.1 million shares at an average price of $27.35 per share for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $24.8 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 46 days, compared to 47 days last year, and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.7 billion in free cash flow and a record $9.1 billion in operating cash flow during the last four quarters.
Now I'll turn the call over to Safra."

I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q2, and I'll then review the guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter on top of a truly amazing Q1, we, as Jeff mentioned, exceeded the high point of our New License guidance, we beat the high end of our total revenue guidance and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.05. Even excluding a payment for legal fees, we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.04. The strength in the quarter was very broad-based as you can see, with Technology grow 23% and Apps growing 22% in constant dollars. And all geographies really reported double-digit growth for New License sales. The Americas, in particular, reported spectacular results with 32% growth, highlighted by a 36% growth in Technology with Fusion Middleware sales leading the way. Europe was great as well with 31% Apps growth.
You can literally see our momentum in our Applications results as we continue to take share from SAP. Their most recent New License revenue is actually down to 14% from two years ago, while ours has grown 23% over that same period.
Sun's hardware systems was within our guidance, and  you see this quarter, we saw sales growth for Sun hardware products, as well as higher gross margins, which were 53% for the quarter. In addition to our strong top line performance, we also delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 44%, substantially higher than our peers. Actually, our margins are 1,500 basis points higher than SAP's operating margins, even though we are also selling hardware. At this rate, we could be back at pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly.
Before I turn to guidance for the upcoming quarter, let me just remind everyone once again that our plans for Sun's business are based on more profit-aware model. Once we reached the one-year anniversary, we would be able to see the hardware growth off a more meaningful baseline. So with that, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now has a positive 1% currency effect on license growth and 1% positive on total revenue growth, our guidance for Q3 is as follows. New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20% at current exchange rate and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware products revenues are expected to be around $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and that does not include the Hardware Support revenue.
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 31% to 35% at current exchange rates and 30% to 34% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 32% to 36% at current exchange rates, 31% to 35% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.48 and $0.50, assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.38 last year and $0.48 to $0.50 in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the third quarter is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36, assuming current exchange rates, and $0.34 to $0.36 in constant currency. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 30.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. And the board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share.
Now before I turn the call over to Larry, I want to congratulate him for driving his sailboat to a first ranking overall for the year. And with that, it's your turn, Larry."

And I'm going to talk about our strategy in our server business specifically. Our goal is to become number one in the high-end server business for both online transaction processing and the data warehousing, both of those segments. We are not interested in the low-margin commodity segment of the server business. We're focused on high-end OLTP, high-end data warehousing, where the margins are good and we can have a highly differentiated product. Right now, our Sun servers are number three behind IBM and HP in the high-end server business. We think IBM's hardware and software technology is quite competitive, while HP's blade servers are slow, expensive and have little or no software value add. That makes HP extremely vulnerable to market share losses in the coming year.
Over the last year or so, we've introduced three new families of high-end servers, Exadata, Exalogic and this past quarter's SPARC Superclusters. All these new high-end servers are engineered to run our Database and Middleware software much faster than anything from either IBM or HP.
For example, this past quarter, our new SPARC Supercluster technology ran the industry standard benchmark for online transaction processing called the TPC-C benchmark. Our SPARC Superclusters ran that industry standard OLTP benchmark at 30 million transactions per minute, shadowing IBM's old record, which they set on their back [ph], this P7 [POWER7] -- in fact, three on their backs [ph] are P7s at 10 million transactions per minute. So let me, just as quick, make this clear.
Sun, Oracle, 30 million transactions per minute. Three of those P7s, 10 million transactions per minute. With HP's best ever database performance, a distant third at 4 million transactions per minute. In data warehousing, it's not uncommon for our Exadata machines to be 10x faster than the best of the competition. And IBM's purchase of Netezza and EMC's purchase Greenplum technology is not likely to threaten the Exadata sales for lots of reasons, but mainly because Exadata is much faster than either of those two technologies. And both in the case of Exadata and in the case of Greenplum, the customer has to rewrite their applications to run on those machines.
So Exadata pipeline is actually -- continues to grow rapidly, even though IBM bought Netezza and EMC have launched Greenplum. And the Exadata pipeline is now approaching $2 billion. We expect overall that our new generation of Sun machines, Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Superclusters, will enable us to win significant share in the high-end server market and put us into the number two position behind IBM very, very soon, then we'll slug it out with IBM for the number one spot. And I'll turn it over to Mark."

In total, we've had nearly 60,000 customers at these three shows. 2Q is a great quarter for us because our customer base is very enthusiastic about the direction of Oracle's product portfolio. Our earnings growth,  33% this quarter, and our margin performance made clear that there's a ton of leverage in this business. I want to focus on our opportunities to grow revenue significantly over the next couple of years.
You can see our top line momentum, 21%, New Software License revenue. We had a great quarter across-the-board. Technology and Applications were both up more than 20%, all geographies had double-digit growth in constant dollar and our industry-focused businesses were up triple digits.
The deal volume was spread across companies of all sizes, and we had a very healthy number of customer wins in the public sector as well. The strength in the quarter was very broad-based. Our customers are reacting to the fact that we're delivering game-changing technology that matters to our customers now. Exadata and Exalogic are creating tremendous buzz in the industry and among our customers. All of our competitors, as Larry mentioned, are reacting to us, others are trying to build, buy, partner their way into integrated systems. With 295,000 database customers that can run their Oracle workload order of magnitudes faster by the point of Exadata. Exadata customers are experiencing an immediate performance increase, measured in multiples, not percentages. Customers could gain 15x to 50x the improvement with Exadata. We have seen a lot of enthusiasm that's being to build to order backlog for Exalogic, which will be available next quarter in both Intel and SPARC versions. There are 150,000 Middleware customers. Next year, they'll be using our market-leading WebLogic apps server. All of them are prospects for Exalogic. 
We've made more announcements relating to Sun's core technologies, specifically Solaris and SPARC. As an early indicator, we ended the quarter with a record hardware backlog. Last, our industry-focused  businesses are creating strategic advantage for Oracle because no other large vendor is doing prepackaged industry-specific solutions.

And we are beginning to see some significant rebuys and a lot more customers translating their interest into purchases. I think we're going to sell a lot of Exadata in Q3 than in Q2.  I think in terms of the halo effect, it's a general recognition now that when you buy these high-end servers, you usually buy them to run specific software. And we believe that if we do a good job of engineering the software and the server at the same time and make sure that they work well together, we have a huge competitive advantage over HP and IBM. Now IBM does have a lot of software, HP does not, which again I emphasize, that makes them particularly vulnerable. But the notion of engineered systems, hardware and software that works together, I believe, is going to dominate the high end of the business. By the way, it's already dominating the low end of the business because I suspect if you use either an Apple iPhone and iPad or an Android, where specifically, in the case of iPad and iPhone, they were engineered to work together. The Android is not so. And you decide which is delivering a better overall user experience between those two products in the low end."

So we think the fact that we have an integrated suite gives us a huge competitive advantage over IBM. And we're winning share there very, very rapidly. And we'd expect that the advantage we have in database, you will see over the next five years also move into Middleware."

And I'm not sure if that's an Oracle thing or if that's just Europe maybe isn't as bad as it sounds like it can get. But my question has more to do with the Apps business, and that was really strong. Granted it was a relatively easy comp, but that was still a really strong number, and especially when you look at your competitors there. And you've been gaining share against SAP, and that's been showing up in the numbers over the last, I guess, a couple of years even. But this almost seems like it's an acceleration of that.

It was not singular to a country. It was pretty broad-based against the countries where we have been gaining share, frankly, over the past several years. So when you make the comment, you guys want to make sure it's clear, this has been a really steady progression. As I've looked back the story of Oracle gains and apps in Europe, it's been sort of one quarter after another in a pretty steady beat. And I would say this was a continuation of that. And again, across countries, across Apps, we had some very nice help from our industry GBUs in the quarter in Europe that helped as well."

You put all of these things in perspective, Exadata is an Oracle-specific database machine that runs the database incredibly fast. And it includes obviously the servers and a very, very fast network and database-specific storage. Exalogic is really designed to run our middleware and very specifically modern middleware Java incredibly fast. Our SPARC Supercluster is kind of new generation of general-purpose computing, featuring SPARC and Solaris. It runs everything, database, middleware, all of your applications, all the subjects out running on existing SPARC servers, you can migrate to the SPARC Superclusters. All of those machines are designed to scale up and be used in gigantic clouds, whether they're private or public, and handle terabytes of data and do it -- and by the way, handling terabytes of data is two-fold. One is you have to have scalability. The other is you have to have built-in fault tolerance. When you're running one of these big clouds, you can imagine how disappointed people get when it's the cloud stops working. And all these people just can't get their data. So one thing that's common across Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Superclusters is it's a fault-tolerant parallel architecture. So one can run the runs, everything else keeps running. That gives us not only scalability and performance, which we normally talk about, but it also gives us this third key element, which is fault tolerance, which HP doesn't have and IBM doesn't have because they don't really have parallel architectures for online transaction processing."

The secret sauce in Exadata is bringing the smarts to the data as opposed to the data to the smarts. And it's changes. That's why I made the comments about these 15x to 50x improvements. These are huge because you can take that either in performance or you can take in lower cost while you do everything what Larry just said. It's a gamechanger."

And as far as in applications, we think -- I mean, and I'm not sure you want to go with me here, but we think there are lots of reasons why we're continuing to gain share every quarter over the last few years against SAP. And I kind of outlined kind of our three-way strategy. To have industry-specific applications, where in a lot of cases, the telco is running pretty much only Oracle software. And we're seeing some banks now kind of making those kind of commitments to Oracle software up and down the stack. I think they [ph] just doesn't have these applications. Next is our commitment to protect the customers' investment in their existing Oracle technology, whether it's PeopleSoft, Siebel, JD Edwards or the E-Business Suite, and then make this huge investment. And I think coming down the runway very quickly, next calendar year, we're going to be talking a lot about Fusion, how we've got this new generation of applications, by the way, that runs on premise and in the cloud, in the public cloud, as well as private clouds on premise or public -- nobody has this. I mean, SAP, a difference by design, runs just in the clouds. SAP's traditional applications run just on premise. Fusion runs both places. You decide where you want to put this. You can't do that with Salesforce.com. You can't do that with Workday, a lot of these guys. So we've got this brand-new, extremely modern, Java-based suite of applications called Fusion. And it runs in the cloud, runs on premise, is going to dramatically strengthen our position against our cloud-based competitors like Salesforce and Workday, and our traditional competitor, SAP. So we think you're just seeing the beginning of us gaining share in applications. That's going to really take off next year."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on U.S. dollar growth rates, unless otherwise stated.
This quarter, foreign exchange rates resulted in a negative 2% currency effect to both New License revenue and total revenue. In spite of this headwind, in both U.S. dollars and constant dollars, we beat the high end of our guidance range for New License revenue, total revenue and earnings per share, with record earnings per share for the second quarter. In short, Q2 was another excellent quarter for Oracle.
In the second quarter, New Software License revenues were $2.0 billion, up 21%. The Americas grew 32% in U.S. dollars. EMEA was up 5% and Asia was up 21%. With each region up double digits on a constant-dollar basis, our results continue to underscore the strength and diversity of our business, and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals. Technology New License revenues were $1.4 billion, up 21%. As the Americas grew 36%, EMEA was down 1% in U.S. dollars but up 7% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 27%. Applications New License revenues were $579 million, up 21% from last year. The Americas grew 26%, EMEA was up 23% and Asia was down 1%.
Our Software License Updates and Product Support revenues were $3.7 billion, up 12% from last year. Customer support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels. Revenues from our Hardware Systems products were $1.1 billion, while revenues from Hardware Systems Support were $686 million. Our Services revenues were $1.2 billion, up 24%, as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins. Our total revenues were $8.6 billion, up 47% from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 33%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 44% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 28.5%. Our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, $0.05 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of $0.44 to $0.46. Earnings per share were up 33% from last year. In Q2, we repurchased 9.1 million shares at an average price of $27.35 per share, for a total of $250 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $24.8 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 46 days, compared to 47 days last year, and is a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.7 billion in free cash flow and a record $9.1 billion in operating cash flow during the last four quarters.

On top of a truly amazing Q1, we, as Jeff mentioned, exceeded the high point of our New License guidance, we beat the high end of our total revenue guidance and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.05. Even excluding a payment for legal fees, we beat the high end of our EPS guidance by $0.04. The strength in the quarter was very broad-based, as you can see, with Technology grow 23% and Apps growing 22% in constant dollars. And all geographies really reported double-digit growth for New License sales. The Americas in particular reported spectacular results with 32% growth, highlighted by 36% growth in Technology, with Fusion Middleware sales leading the way. Europe was great as well, with 31% Apps growth.
You can really see our momentum in our Applications results as we continue to take share from SAP. Their most recent New License revenue is actually down 14% from two years ago, while ours has grown 23% over that same period.
Sun's hardware systems was within our guidance, and  this quarter, we saw sales growth for Sun hardware products as well as higher gross margins, which were 53% for the quarter. In addition to our strong top line performance, we also delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 44%, substantially higher than our peers. Actually, our margins are 1,500 basis points higher than SAP's operating margins, even though we are also selling hardware. At this rate, we could be back at pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly.
Before I turn to guidance for the upcoming quarter, let me just remind everyone once again that our plans for the Sun business are based on a more profit-aware model. Once we reached the one-year anniversary, we would be able to see the hardware growth off a more meaningful baseline. So with that, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now has a positive 1% currency effect on license growth and 1% positive on total revenue growth, our guidance for Q3 is as follows:  New Software License revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20% at current exchange rate and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware products revenues are expected to be around $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and that does not include the Hardware Support revenue.
Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 31% to 35% at current exchange rates and 30% to 34% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 32% to 36% at current exchange rates, 31% to 35% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.48 and $0.50, assuming current exchange rates, up from $0.38 last year and $0.48 to $0.50 in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the third quarter is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36, assuming current exchange rates, and $0.34 to $0.36 in constant currency. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 30.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. Of course, it may end up being different. And the board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share.
Now before I turn the call over to Larry, I want to congratulate him for driving his sailboat to a first-place ranking overall for the year. And with that, it's your turn, Larry."

And I'm going to talk about our strategy in our server business specifically. Our goal is to become number one in the high-end server business for both online transaction processing and data warehousing, both of those segments. We are not interested in the low-margin commodity segment of the server business. We're focused on high-end OLTP, high-end data warehousing, where the margins are good and we can have a highly differentiated product. Right now, our Sun servers are number three behind IBM and HP in that high-end server business. We think IBM's hardware and software technology is quite competitive, while HP's big servers are slow, expensive and have little or no software value-add. That makes HP extremely vulnerable to market share losses in the coming year.
Over the last year or so, we've introduced three new families of high-end servers:  Exadata, Exalogic and this past quarter's SPARC Superclusters. All these new high-end servers are engineered to run our Database and Middleware software much faster than anything from either IBM or HP.
For example, this past quarter, our new SPARC Supercluster technology ran the industry standard benchmark for online transaction processing, called the TPC-C benchmark. Our SPARC Superclusters ran that industry standard OLTP benchmark at 30 million transactions per minute, shattering IBM's old record, which they set on their fastest P7 [POWER7], in fact, three of their fastest P7s, at 10 million transactions per minute. So let me just make this clear.
Sun, Oracle, 30 million transactions per minute. Three of those P7s, 10 million transactions per minute. With HP's best-ever database performance a distant third at 4 million transactions per minute. In data warehousing, it's not uncommon for our Exadata machines to be 10x faster than the best of the competition. And IBM's purchase of Netezza and EMC's purchase of Greenplum technology is not likely to threaten Exadata sales for lots of reasons, but mainly because Exadata is much faster than either of those two technologies. And both in the case of Exadata and in the case of Greenplum, the customer has to rewrite their applications to run on those machines.
So Exadata pipeline is actually -- continues to grow rapidly, even though IBM bought Netezza and EMC launched Greenplum. And the Exadata pipeline is now approaching $2 billion. We expect overall that our new generation of Sun machines, Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Superclusters, will enable us to win significant share in the high-end server market and put us into the number-two position behind IBM very, very soon.  Then we'll slug it out with IBM for the number one spot. And I'll turn it over to Mark."

I spent the last three months mingling with customers. I started Oracle mania a week before Oracle OpenWorld. And I just returned last week from Brazil from Oracle OpenWorld Latin America, where we had 12,000 customers in attendance. This week, we had Oracle OpenWorld Beijing, it's taking place, really, as we speak, where there's 13,000 customers attended. In total, we've had nearly 60,000 customers at these three shows. 2Q is a great quarter for us because our customer base is very enthusiastic about the direction of Oracle's product portfolio. Our earnings growth,  33% this quarter, and our margin performance make clear that there's a ton of leverage in this business. I want to focus on our opportunities to grow revenue significantly over the next couple of years.
You can see our top line momentum, 21%, New Software License revenue. We had a great quarter across-the-board. Technology and Applications were both up more than 20%, all geographies had double-digit growth in constant dollar and our industry-focused businesses were up triple digits.
The deal volume was spread across companies of all sizes, and we had a very healthy number of customer wins in the public sector as well. The strength in the quarter was very broad-based. Our customers are reacting to the fact that we're delivering game-changing technology that matter to our customers now. Exadata and Exalogic are creating tremendous buzz in the industry and among our customers. All of our competitors, as Larry mentioned, are reacting to us.  They're trying to build, buy, partner their way into integrated systems. With 295,000 database customers that can run their Oracle workload order of magnitudes faster by deploying Exadata. Exadata customers are experiencing immediate performance increase, measured in multiples, not percentages. Customers could gain 15x to 50x the improvement with Exadata. We have seen a lot of enthusiasm, beginning to build an order backlog for Exalogic, which will be available next quarter in both Intel and SPARC versions. There are 150,000 Middleware customers. Next year, they'll be using our market-leading WebLogic apps server. All of them are prospects for Exalogic. 
We've made more announcements relating to Sun's core technologies, specifically Solaris and SPARC. As an early indicator, we ended the quarter with a record hardware backlog. Last, our industry-focused  businesses are creating strategic advantage for Oracle, because no other large vendor is doing prepackaged industry-specific solutions. With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And I think you're going to see a significant jump in Exadata sales going from Q2 to Q3. So we're watching on -- this pipeline grew very, very rapidly, and I guess there's a lot of buzz and a lot of interest. But because it's a new product, people were running a lot of benchmarks, they were trying it, they'd buy a small machine first. And we are beginning to see some significant rebuys and a lot more customers translating their interest into purchases. I think we're going to sell a lot of Exadata in Q3 than in Q2.  I think in terms of the halo effect, it's a general recognition now that when you buy these high-end servers, you usually buy them to run specific software. And we believe that if we do a good job of engineering the software and the server at the same time and make sure they work well together, we have a huge competitive advantage over HP and IBM. Now IBM does have a lot of software.  HP does not, which, again, I emphasize, that makes them particularly vulnerable. But the notion of engineered systems, hardware and software that works together, I believe, is going to dominate the high end of the business. By the way, it's already dominating the low end of the business, because I suspect you use either an Apple iPhone and iPad or an Android, where specifically, in the case of iPad and iPhone, they were engineered to work together. The Android is not so. And you decide which is delivering a better overall user experience between those two products in the low end."

Where we had made Middleware acquisitions, we weren't satisfied just to resell what we bought. We actually rewrote a lot of what we bought. So we had a unified architecture where we have a single, a common  metadata repository for all the components of our Middleware, whether it's a SOA suite or, for that matter, BI, Business Intelligence. It's all Java-based. It's all rewritten, it's a single integrated suite where you can buy it a piece at a time, but all of the pieces fit together. You'll hear that theme over and over again. 
Well, with release 11 of our Middleware, everything has now been rewritten. All the pieces operate off a  single metadata library. I think it's a much better user experience, because you can patch our current Middleware suite with a single file, versus you take IBM WebSEAL, where IBM WebSEAL is literally dozens, if not more than a hundred separate products, all with separate patching technologies. So we think the fact that we have an integrated suite gives us a huge competitive advantage over IBM. And we're winning share there very, very rapidly. And we'd expect that the advantage we have in database you will see over the next five years also move into Middleware."

It runs everything, database, middleware, all of your applications, all the stuff you've got running on existing SPARC servers you can migrate to the SPARC Superclusters. All of those machines are designed to scale up and be used in gigantic clouds, whether they're private or public, and handle petabytes of data and do it -- and by the way, handling petabytes of data is twofold. One is you have to have scalability. The other is you have to have built-in fault tolerance. When you're running one of these big clouds, you can't imagine how disappointed people get when the cloud stops working. And all these people just can't get at their data. So one thing that's common across Exadata, Exalogic and SPARC Superclusters is it's a fault-tolerant parallel architecture. So one component fails, everything else keeps running. That gives us not only scalability and performance, which we normally talk about, but also gives us this third key element which is fault tolerance, which HP doesn't have and IBM doesn't have, because they don't really have parallel architectures for online transaction processing."

You get in traditional data warehouses, the way you drive performance in traditional big petabyte data warehouses is you throw a lot of technology at it. So you string out all this data on lots of disks and then you put a lot of nodes against it, trying to get at the data. The secret sauce in Exadata is bringing the smarts to the data as opposed to the data to the smarts. And it changes. That's why I make the comments about these 15x to 50x improvements. These are huge, because you can take that either in performance or you can take in lower cost while you do everything that Larry just said. It's a game-changer."

So we think that it would be differentiation. The differentiation we have in scalability, in performance, in security, in reliability and in cost puts us in a much stronger position when we're competing with IBM at the high end and Microsoft in the low end, in database and in middleware. And as far as in applications, we think -- I mean, and I'm not sure you want me to go through it here, but we think there are lots of reasons why we're continuing to gain share every quarter over the last few years against SAP. And I kind of outlined kind of our three-way strategy. To have industry-specific applications where, in a lot of cases, a telco is running pretty much only Oracle software. And we're seeing some banks now kind of making those kind of commitments to Oracle software up and down the stack. SAP just doesn't have these applications. Next is our commitment to protect a customers' investment in their existing Oracle technology, whether it's PeopleSoft, Siebel, JD Edwards or the E-Business Suite, and then make this huge investment. And I think coming down the road very quickly, next calendar year, we're going to be talking a lot about Fusion, how we've got this new generation of applications, by the way, that runs on premise and in the cloud, in the public cloud as well as private clouds on premise or public -- nobody has this. I mean, SAP, Business ByDesign, runs just in the cloud.  SAP's traditional applications run just on premise. Fusion runs both places. You decide where you want to put this. You can't do that with Salesforce.com. You can't do that with Workday.  A lot of these guys. So we've got this brand-new, extremely modern, Java-based suite of applications called Fusion. And it runs in the cloud, runs on premise, is going to dramatically strengthen our position against our cloud-based competitors, like Salesforce and Workday, and our traditional competitor, SAP. So we think you're just seeing the beginning of us gaining share in applications. That's going to really take off next year."
