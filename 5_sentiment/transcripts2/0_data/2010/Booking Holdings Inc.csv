I'm here with Priceline CFO, Dan Finnegan; and Matt Tynan, Senior Vice President of Finance. I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $2.3 billion, up 53% year-over-year. Pro forma net income was $102 million or $1.99 per share, up $0.54 versus the prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $1.68 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Top line growth for the international business has accelerated, as we compare to weak results in last year's fourth quarter due to the global recession. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $9.3 billion, up 26% from 2008 and pro forma net income per share of $8.52, a 43% increase over 2008.Growth rates for our international business increased during the quarter with 70% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rates benefited from weak comps and stabilizing ADR trends and cancellation trends. International gross bookings benefited from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply and results from Agoda. Booking.com's worldwide hotel supply platform is now approximately 78,000 hotels in 76 countries. During 2009, we've made substantial investments and distribution in our online channels, while maintaining reasonable efficiencies. Agoda also reported improving growth rates, resulting in improved merchant growth rates on a consolidated basis.We have also continued to work on sharing supply, customers and best practices among our brands around the world. For example, Booking.com supply has been the primary source of European hotels for priceline.com customers for sometime. And we recently began to test showing Booking.com North American hotels to priceline.com customers as well.Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 21% in the fourth quarter, due primarily to growth in sales of opaque and retail hotel room rate reservations, retail airline tickets and vacation packages. Domestic merchant gross bookings, which include opaque services and retail merchant hotels, continue to grow at attractive rates, despite year-over-year declines in opaque airline tickets and rental car days, tied primarily to declining capacity. Opaque and retail hotel room night reservations growth continued in an impressive rates as our hotel partners continue to use promotional pricing to drive demand in retail channels and use our opaque services to bolster occupancy.In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010. As we highlighted when we announced our third quarter results, the latter half of 2008 was significantly impacted by weakening global economic conditions. And as a result, our comps were easier for the latter half of 2009. These easier comps helped us deliver sequential increases in our quarterly growth rates, in gross booking dollars and hotel room nights for each of the second, third and fourth quarter's of 2009, as compared to the prior year. The easier comp for fourth quarter 2009 resulted in strong unit growth rates, favorable FX impact and more moderate ADR decreases versus earlier periods of 2009. During our Q3 earnings call, we highlighted our assumption that the latter half of Q4 2009 would be more challenging since we've seen a marked improvement in our business fundamentals during the latter half of Q4 2008, which would therefore result in a tougher comp. Our performance in the latter half of 2009 exceeded our assumptions, propelled particularly by outstanding performance for our international business.Hotel room nights booked grew by 60% in the fourth quarter versus last year. Gross booking dollars grew by 53% for the fourth quarter, after applying the negative impact of lower average prices and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. ADRs for our international hotel service were down by about 1% versus Q4 2008, and were down by about 7% for our domestic hotel service. Although still a headwind, the ADR trends have improved from the decreases that were posted earlier in 2009. FX rates were basically in line with the assumption used for guidance.However, when comparing our results to the prior year, FX rates provided a favorable impact for the first time since Q3 2008. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were up by 12% and 4%, respectively in fourth quarter of 2009 versus fourth quarter 2008. In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for the guidance resulting in performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance in all key operating metrics from gross bookings to EPS. Gross profit was $313 million and grew 53% as compared to prior year. Our Domestic business generated gross profit of $91 million which represented 16% growth versus prior year. Gross profit for our international operations amounted to $222 million and grew by 75% as compared to the prior year.Total operating expenses were favorable to guidance as expenses for personnel, G&A and sales and marketing came in below our estimates. The variances for personnel and G&A relate mainly to the timing of hiring for our international business. The variance in sales and marketing is the result of lower than assumed bad debt expense, driven by continued improvement in collection results for Booking.com.  On a year-over-year basis, we increased pro forma operating expenses by 32%, as we continue to invest in marketing, people and new offices to support the growth of our business. We recorded below the line expenses in the quarter of about $2.5 million, which is in line with our guidance.In summary, pro forma EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $133 million, which exceeded our forecast of $98 million to $108 million and represent 75% growth versus prior year. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $146 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2009, which represent an 82% increase versus prior year. We spent about $5 million on CapEx in the quarter and repaid $75 million of convertible debt principal, bringing us to an outstanding debt balance of $196 million at year-end. This leaves us at year-end with cash and marketable securities of about $604 million, in excess of our outstanding debt balance. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012. We received conversion notices during first quarter 2010 for an additional $98 million of principal amount of convertible debt. After processing these conversions in the first quarter of 2010, we will be left with outstanding convertible debt of about $98 million. As we've highlighted in the past, our fully diluted share count, particularly as it relates to equivalent shares outstanding for our convertible debt, tends to vary based upon our average stock price. We include equivalent shares in our fully diluted share count, for the theoretical number of shares that would be issued for our outstanding convertible notes were actually converted. Since our avenues stock price of substantially higher in the fourth quarter of 2009 than in the same period in 2008, our diluted share count is also higher in Q4 2009 versus the prior year. For the first quarter 2010 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 42% to 48%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 10% to 15%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 65% to 73%, as compared to last year, and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 56% to 64%.We expect our bookings growth rate versus prior year to continue to be hampered by decreases in ADRs.  Our first quarter guidance is based on an assumption that the rate of decline in our ADRs will be flat to slightly improved versus the rate of decline that we saw in Q4. Our forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.38 per euro and $1.58 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates. This would yield euro and pound average FX rates for the first quarter that are up by approximately 7% and 11%, respectively as compared to the prior year. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter net earnings from any deterioration in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges did not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 23% to 27%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 50%. For Q1 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $118 million to $121 million, with approximately 90% of that amount being spent for online advertising. We expect sales and marketing expenses of between $22 million and $25 million. We expect personnel costs excluding stock-based compensation to come in between $38 million to $40 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $16 million to $18 million. We expect Information Technology costs of approximately $6 million and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization of approximately $4.5 million. We expect total below the line negative impacts of approximately $500,000, which is comprised primarily of foreign exchange hedging expense and net interest expense. Pro forma EBITDA is expected to range between $97 million and $107 million, and we are targeting pro forma fully diluted EPS of approximately $1.54 to $1.64 per share, which represents 46% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. Our pro forma EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $17 million to $20 million, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax in the U.S. Our pro forma EPS guidance was based upon our pro forma diluted share count of approximately 51 million shares, which is based on yesterday's closing stock price of $211.21 per share. This is significantly higher than our share count of 47.2 million shares in Q1 2009 due to year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count, resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year, and also due to the impact of higher share prices on fully-diluted shares related to our convertible notes.As a result of those early conversions, the difference between primary and fully diluted share count has been narrowing. Given the reduction in our outstanding convertible debt balance I just discussed, our fully diluted share count will be less impacted by changes in our stock price going forward. As per expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS of $1.04 to $1.14 per share. The difference between our GAAP and pro forma results is driven by pro forma adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to debt conversions and certain income tax expenses, all of which are non-cash in nature to arrive at pro forma earnings. We also intend to adjust pro forma results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements. Although we are not providing guidance beyond Q1 2010, I would like to highlight that the strong results and sequential unit growth we have achieved for the past several quarters, is to some extent, driven by the relatively easy comps cost by the impact of the global recession on the prior year periods. We believe that our comps become progressively more challenging throughout each quarter of 2010. We have seen deceleration in unit growth rates thus far in Q1 2010 as compared to Q4, both domestically and internationally. And this deceleration is factored into the guidance we just gave. More difficult comps in tandem with the sheer size of the business, make it highly likely that we will return to a pattern of decelerating unit growth rates. Our guidance assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market, in particular, remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

We are pleased with the performance of our global business in 2009. Despite a very difficult economic and competitive environment, we were able to make significant investments in building our business, while delivering earnings growth to our shareholders. Moreover, growth rates improved during the year as we began to comp against weak year ago results. We enter 2010 with more stability in unit pricing but with continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Economic growth has returned in many regions, but unemployment remains high and ballooning government deficits threaten to destabilize currencies and rekindle inflation. We believe our growth rates in those of our industry will decelerate as the year proceeds and we begin to compare against improved 2009 results, particularly in the second half. Our competition will also anniversary the conversion benefit of last year's fee cuts and the earnings benefits associated with cuts to their marketing spends as the year proceeds.  We believe our businesses are well-positioned to continue building our brands and offerings and to compete effectively in our global markets. We will now take your questions."

It represents, I think, the kind of deceleration that you would expect to see given the size of the business and given the industry growth rates and at least what the one competitor who has reported has been saying. So I think there's no one timer there and I mentioned that growth rates are expected to decelerate going into the year and so to me, that's all fairly consistent. With respect to the marketing spend, the step up is essentially seasonal in nature. The businesses tend to spend, particularly in online channels, an advance of the major booking upticks that you see in the spring and in the summer, so that's really more seasonal than anything else."

So that obviously, is a headwind in terms of overall ticket growth. With respect to international hotels getting more aggressive in competing for keywords, I would expect over time, that hotels will get more involved in trying to directly market their properties over the Internet, and that's something certainly that's happened in the United States and I would expect that to happen elsewhere. But for a small independent hotels that make up the majority of the international markets in which we do business, they just don't have the resources and the expertise to aggressively market in a lot of different channels. It's very hard for them to get distribution through affiliates. It's very hard for them to do search marketing in multiple languages. So I think there's a very significant limit to how aggressive they can be in trying to market directly in online channels."

It's very hard to scale a business when you've got a limited time sale on four or five hotels.

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After prepared portion, we will take questions.
The Group consisting primarily of Booking.com, priceline.com and Agoda.com reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $3 billion, up 53% year-over-year. Pro forma net income was $87.2 million or $1.70 per share versus a $1.09 the prior year. First quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $1.66 per share and the high end of our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night sales were $20 million for the quarter, up 57% year-over-year. We are pleased the growth in room nights continue at high levels, showing only modest sequential deceleration, while gross bookings growth rates were flat with Q4, reflecting improved international room rates and favorable currency exchange rates.
Our International business performed well with 73% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, a slight increase from 70% in the prior quarter. International gross bookings benefited from geographic expansion, growth in hotel inventory and growth in new markets, including results from Agoda and from a slight year-over-year improvement in hotel ADRs. 
Booking.com continues to build its supply platform worldwide with a hotel count of approximately 86,000 hotels in over 80 countries. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and is contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting.
Priceline.com's Domestic gross bookings grew 16% in the first quarter, slightly above the high end of our range of guidance, aided by strong hotel results and a significant year-over-year increase in the airline ticket prices. Merchant gross bookings increased 25% as merchant hotel gross bookings, both at priceline and Agoda, offset year-over-year decreases in opaque airline ticket and rental car sales, where reduced industry capacity squeezed inventory available for opaque discounting.
While consolidated operating margins improved during the quarter, domestic margins were pressured as airfare increases drive bookings growth but not revenue growth. The mix of online ad spend increased and advertising revenue declined year-over-year. 
I wanted to comment on a few macro externalities facing the business. Number one, as you all know, the eruption of the Iceland volcano severely disrupted travel in Europe in April and is still causing limited airspace closures. With widespread flight cancellations, Booking.com's call centers were flooded with requests for cancellations, changes and the like. Dan will discuss the estimated impact of this incident on our second quarter forecast. While current booking trends remain solid, future material airspace closures could adversely impact results going forward.
Number two, civil unrest has re-emerged in Thailand, severely disrupting certain sections of Bangkok and forcing Agoda's team to relocate to temporary offices. As a result, business for Bangkok in other Thai destinations is under pressure for both Agoda and Booking.com. Nevertheless, both businesses continue to grow their overall Asia and Pacific businesses at impressive rates.
Finally, while global economic conditions have improved, concern about the weaker sovereign credits in the euro zone has intensified with downgrades of Portugal, Greece and Spain. To date, we have not noticed an impact on demand tied to these concerns but the weakening of the euro creates a headwind for the coming quarters and any destabilizing of the common currency or the broader European economies would clearly create challenges for the business. 
All that said, the business performed well in the first quarter and is showing demand in pricing trends consistent with improving economic conditions. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2010.Gross booking dollars grew by 53% for the first quarter, essentially maintaining the year-on-y",1930,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2010.
Gross booking dollars grew by 53% for the first quarter, essentially maintaining the year-on-year growth rate achieved in Q4. Hotel room nights books grew by 57% in the first quarter versus last year, which represents a modest level of sequential deceleration compared to the 60% growth rate that we reported in Q4 2009. ADRs or average daily rates for Q1 2010 compared to the prior year first quarter were up by about 2% for our International hotel service and were down by about 2% for our Domestic hotel service. 
The prevailing exchange rates when we reported our Q1 guidance on February 17 of $1.38 per euro and $1.58 per British pound formed the basis for our forecast for the remainder of the quarter. Actual FX rates for the remainder of the first quarter were slightly unfavorable for those rates. However, when comparing our first quarter results to the prior year, FX rates provided a favorable impact. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were up by 6% and 9%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2010 versus first quarter 2009, which contribute to our year-on-year growth rates.
Airline tickets booked were up by 3% and rental car days booked were down by 1% versus first quarter 2009. As Jeff mentioned, our opaque rental car and air gross bookings were down year-on-year, due to supplier capacity reductions impacting inventory availability. 
In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for guidance, resulting in performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance in all key operating metrics from gross bookings to EPS.
Gross profit was $319 million and grew 53% as compared to prior year. Our Domestic business generated gross profit of $104 million, which represented 10% growth versus prior year. Gross profit for our International operations amounted to $215 million and grew by 89% as compared to the prior year. Total operating expenses were generally in line with guidance. 
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit increased versus the first quarter of 2009, principally due to mix, as our International business, which relies primarily on online advertising, grew at a faster pace than the Domestic business; and the online channel in the Domestic business also grew relative to the offline channel. On a year-over-year basis, we increased pro forma operating expenses by 43% as we continue to invest in marketing, people and new offices to support the growth of our business. 
We recorded below-the-line income in the quarter of about $1.4 million which is favorable to the expense of $500,000 that we had assumed in our guidance. The variance relates to FX hedging gains resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro from the date we gave guidance through the end of the quarter. 
In summary, pro forma EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $112 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $97 million to $107 million and represents 75% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit expanded by 440 basis points in the quarter. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $105 million of cash from operations during first quarter 2010, which represents a 41% increase versus prior year. We spent about $5 million on CapEx in the quarter. 
As we announced in March, we completed a $575 million convertible debt offering during the first quarter. We believe this represents attractive financing for the company with a coupon interest rate of 1.25% and a conversion price of $303 per share. The debt has a five-year maturity date and generally cannot be converted prior to maturity unless our stock trade's above $455 per share. 
We used $100 million of the proceeds to repurchase shares of priceline common stock concurrent with the offering. The remaining proceeds as well as our other cash and investments totaling $1.2 billion are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. We repaid $98 million of principal in the quarter, related to convergence of other previously outstanding convertible debt tranches, which leaves us at quarter end with about $98 million outstanding from those convertible bonds. We received conversion notices to date for an additional $17 million principal amount of convertible debt that will be processed in second quarter 2010. 
As of March 31, our cash and investments exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $563 million. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012. Our pro forma fully diluted share count was 4.2 million shares higher than first quarter 2009 due to a year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count, resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year, and also due to the impact of higher share prices on fully diluted shares related to our in-the-money convertible notes.
Now for second quarter 2010 guidance. As Jeff mentioned, our Q2 guidance is significantly impacted by two negative external factors. First, due to sovereign debt concerns, we've seen a significant devaluation in the euro and British pound relative to the dollar, compared to the $1.38 per euro and $1.58 per British pound exchange rates that prevailed when we last reported earnings on February 17. Our forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.275 per euro and $1.48 per British pound as Friday's closing rates. 
At or near these rates, exchange rates will have an adverse impact on our year-over-year financial results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Specifically, euro and pound average FX rates for the second quarter would be down by approximately 5% and 3%, respectively, as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit. 
The second external factor that negatively impacted our guidance for Q2 was the volcano in Iceland, which caused numerous flight cancellations. As a result, we experience the significant uptick in hotel room cancellations, no-shows and other related costs in April. Our Q2 forecast includes an estimate of these costs resulting in a $10 million reduction to pro forma EBITDA. Our estimate does not include foregone bookings and our guidance assumes that there will not be any further significant volcano-related travel disruptions. Obviously, this is a changeable situation and it is impossible to predict what the impact of the volcano will be throughout the remainder of the quarter.
That said, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 32.5% to 37.5%, with Domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 15% to 20%. We expect International gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 45% to 50% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 55% to 60%. Our second quarter guidance assumes a similar rate of increase to Q1 for International hotel ADRs and an improvement to year-over-year increase for our Domestic business. 
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 18% to 23%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 34% to 39%. For Q2 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $141 million to $146 million, with approximately $10 million of that amount being spent for offline advertising.
The deleverage in online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit as compared to prior year Q2 is caused mainly by the same business mix factors I mentioned while discussing Q1 results. In addition, the increase in cancellations related to the volcano has a negative impact on this metric. 
We expect sales and marketing expense of between $28 million and $31 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $43 million and $46 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $19 million to $21 million. We expect information technology costs of approximately $6 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of approximately $4 million. 
We expect total below-the-line negative impact of approximately $1 million, which is comprised primarily of net interest expense, partly offset by foreign exchange hedging income. Pro forma EBITDA is expected to range between $170 million and $180 million, which represents 39% growth versus prior year Q2 at the midpoint. We are targeting pro forma fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.50 to $2.70 per share, which represents 29% growth year-over-year at the midpoint.
Our pro forma EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $35 million comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax in the U.S. Our pro forma tax rate is increasing as compared to prior year, due to more significant growth in International earnings as compared to Domestic earnings. 
Our pro forma EPS guidance is based upon a pro forma diluted share count of approximately 51.2 million shares, which is based on Friday's closing stock price of $225.39 per share. This is higher than our share count of 49 million in Q2 2009, due to a year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count, resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year and also due to the impact of higher share prices on fully diluted shares related to our in-the-money convertible notes. 
As a result of those early conversions, the difference between primary and fully diluted share count has been narrowing, and our fully diluted share count will be less impacted by changes in our stock price going forward. No shares will be included in our fully diluted share count related to our recently issued 1.25% convertible debt unless our stock price exceeds $303 per share. 
As for expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS of $1.87 to $2.07 per share. The difference between our GAAP and pro forma results is driven by pro forma adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, including amortization of debt discount from our convertible debt issued in March, non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions and certain income tax expenses, all of which are non-cash in nature to arrive at pro forma earnings. We also intend to adjust pro forma results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements. 
As we've highlighted in recent quarterly earnings releases, the strong results in unit growth we have achieved for the past several quarters, to some extent, helped by relatively easy comps caused by the impact of the global recession on the prior year periods. More difficult comps in tandem with the sheer size of the business, make it highly likely that we will see a pattern of decelerating unit growth rates. 
We believe that our comps become progressively more challenging throughout each quarter of 2010 and therefore, our unit growth rates will sequentially decelerate in each quarter. We have seen deceleration in hotel unit growth rates thus far in Q2 2010 as compared to Q1, and our guidance assumes that this trend will continue throughout the remainder of the quarter. Our guidance assumes that macro economic conditions in general in conditions in the consumer travel market in particular remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

I think Dan mentioned the most significant trend in terms of our overall business, which is that the International business continues to grow more rapidly than the U.S. business, and that's generally been the case for the last several years. And as a result, online marketing costs become a larger portion of our total marketing spend, and that just -- because that's, in a sense, a variable cost that has an impact on your marketing efficiencies expressed as gross profit dollars and the percentage of marketing cost as a percent of gross profit dollars. The same thing is happening in terms of the mix in the U.S. business. We're having greater growth in online marketing in the United States than the growth in offline marketing. Offline has been pretty steady, so there is a little pressure on margins from that mix. With respect to ADRs, I can't comment on what some of our competition have said, but to the extent that you're seeing a difference, obviously, the mix of our business geographically is very, very different from the mix of business that our competition has, and that always has an impact on ADRs because they vary by region and sometimes, very significantly. And secondly, our competition typically has a much higher mix of business travel and so their ADRs may be reflecting an improvement in the business environment that we're not really participating in, because we're mostly a leisure business. With respect to cancel bookings coming back, that's not something that we're particularly counting on.

And I'll also add that the Booking.com business is growing, again, as I said in my prepared remarks, an impressive rates in Asia. So Thailand is certainly having an impact but the business is diverse within the region, and the region is having very strong growth for us just in general. With respect to access to inventory, I think one of the principal reasons that we've had shortages of inventory in rental car and opaque air is because the suppliers in both those industries have done a very good job of dramatically downsizing their fleets. And in the case of airline capacity, you had three solid years of capacity cuts in the last couple of years now being aided by merger and acquisition activity and those capacity cuts do have an impact. Even though there's still available seats on the aircraft, it has an impact on the margin. The same thing has happened, there's been consolidation in the Rental Car business, you've seen fleets downsized and I think they're being very careful in upfleeting to take into account the fact that business is picking up a little bit. The Hotel business is different. It's not easy to downsize available hotel capacity and you just don't have that same dynamic of inventory being constrained by reduced capacity. That being said, there's no question that occupancy is up and yields are moving up. And I think what that means over time is you probably have less promotional pricing and discounting to a certain degree, but on the other hand, you have increased pricing, so that the units you do sell are being sold at higher gross bookings and bringing higher gross profit dollars, because it's a percentage of the booking price. So those are sort of the two offsetting factors."

With respect to our principal couple of competitors, I still think we've maintained a fairly significant lead in terms of year-over-year growth. And one point that I would make is that we're operating on a business that's really quite a bit larger at least in the first quarter than either of the businesses. We did 20 million room nights worldwide in the first quarter and I think our nearest competitor is 16 million. And Orbitz had some very impressive growth rates for ebookers but if you do the math on the numbers that they reported there, they're growing on what's a very, very small base compared to the size of our business or Expedia's business.

I think that the couple of dynamics that I would mention, and I hope this is responsive to your question, is that hotels have a couple of different ways that they can discount in the marketplace. In the United States, during the recession, when fundamental demand was very, very weak, there was a lot of published promotional discounting that's available in the hotel's website and that's available across OTA channels as well, and that's buy three nights and get one free, 20% off for certain stays at certain times. There was a lot of discounting out there over time. And I think as business improves and as prices move up, those kinds of published discounts are reduced and you don't see as much of that, they definitely are stimulative of demand. In the United States, the hotels have the opaque channel as an alternative and that's a channel they can use even as business improves and they're raising their prices, they can push prices up and provide discounts in an opaque channel, which is unpublished, doesn't have an impact on their published pricing and it just allows them another revenue management tool to try to push up yields, while at the same time, protecting occupancy gains. In Europe, there definitely has been some promotional pricing in discounting in published channels throughout the recession. And I think you're seeing and we'll see less of that. But in general, and I think this was part of the premise of your question, it's a very, very fragmented market. And the hotels, many of them, are not using highly sophisticated system-driven revenue management models and it's really a question of working with distributors that can drive demand to them, allow them to control their own rates and so forth, and I think that's the service that we provide to hoteliers. And I think we'll be well-positioned to continue to participate in online reservations there, even if the level of discounting is significantly reduced compared to what it was last year."

With respect to sharing supply, we now have on priceline.com, Booking.com inventory available not only in Europe but also in North America, and Agoda has been selling for several quarters inventory of Booking.com to its customers in Asia. I think that we've made very good progress in getting that integration up and running, and we believe it's been additive to the business. The next phase of that is really one of optimization to make sure that we're able to display the inventory in a way that is additive to the group as a whole and to understand the relationships between how various inventory performs in different marketing channels. It's not a trivial exercise, but in our view, we've got plenty of time to get it just right because as we optimize over time, it will be beneficial to our results. So we're encouraged by our progress on that front but there's plenty of work left to do in that regard. With respect to opaque business and how we can, in effect, try to support it and build it during times of improving occupancy and yields, there are a number of things that we traditionally have done and can do and will do. Importantly, while we have a lot of hotels in our opaque inventory, we don't have all of them and we certainly don't have all that we want, so we're continuously trying to increase the number of hotels that are participating, independent hotels, secondary and other destinations, and that's important and it drives the business. We can demonstrate that adding hotels to our inventory helps us grow the business. And the second thing is related, which is to make sure that we're doing the best possible job of communicating with the hotels where the demand opportunities are, so that they're actively managing their inventory and pricing and making the most out of conversion from the suppliers standpoint. We're also continually working on our advertising, both offline and online, to drive awareness of the deals that are available through priceline and then obviously, the blocking and tackling of website conversion, making sure that our presentation to the consumers are optimized. So the level of work going on here that build the business is unchanged. Depending on whether the economy is where we're at all the time and we think we've got a lot of good things that we're working on now, and we think that every year and hopefully we're right."

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
The group, consisting primarily of Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com and now TravelJigsaw, reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $3.4 billion, up 43% year-over-year. Pro forma net income was $158.2 million or $3.09 per share versus the $2.02 the prior year. Second quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $2.65 per share and the high end of our guidance for the quarter. 
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 23.2 million for the quarter, up 48% year-over-year. We are pleased with the level of growth in room night reservations in the quarter and with the degree of sequential deceleration as we start to comp against improving performance last year.
Our International business performed well, with 67% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, a decrease from 73% in the prior quarter. International gross bookings benefited from strong transaction growth in the back half of the quarter following the disruption caused by the Iceland volcano and an improvement in average daily rates. This strength continues to date in Q3, and together with the recent strengthening in the euro and pound, results in a solid outlook for Q3. Geographic expansion, growth in hotel inventory, growth in new markets and adding results from Agoda and partial quarter results from TravelJigsaw also helped drive strong top line growth in the second quarter.
Booking.com continues to build its supply platform worldwide, with a hotel count of approximately 96,000 hotels in over 87 countries. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and reported its fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. I am particularly impressed with and grateful for the performance of the Agoda team, given the civil unrest in Bangkok, which caused the temporary closure of our office and squelched demand for Thailand, Agoda's most demanded destination. 
TravelJigsaw joined our group in the wake of dealing with the disruption created by the Iceland volcano. Nevertheless, the business delivered solid growth in the quarter, and the group now has a foundation of business in Europe and North America from which to build a global franchise in the rental car business.
Priceline.com's domestic gross bookings grew 20% in the second quarter, aided by strong hotel results and a significant year-over-year increase in airline ticket prices. Merchant gross bookings increased 31%, as merchant hotel gross bookings, both at Priceline and Agoda, and the addition of merchant rental car bookings from TravelJigsaw offset year-over-year decreases in opaque airline tickets and rental car sales, where reduced industry capacity continued to pressure inventory available for opaque discounting.
For the group, consolidated operating margins improved during the quarter due to improvement in the International business. As in Q1, domestic margins were pressured, as airfare increases drove bookings growth but not revenue growth, and marketing spend increased faster than gross profit dollars.
Global economic uncertainty continues to create volatility in financial markets, and currency fluctuation continues to produce volatility in our translated results. The widespread concern that a sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone would lead to falloff in travel demand has not yet materialized, and business results to date are encouraging. That said, we remain concerned that government deficits and consequent austerity measures could impact economic recovery and travel demand in the future. 
In summary, the business performed well in the second quarter and is showing demand and pricing trends consistent with improving economic conditions. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,109704662,71852,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2010.Gross booking dollars grew by 43% for Q2 compared to the prior year, driven by strong unit grow",2273,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2010.
Gross booking dollars grew by 43% for Q2 compared to the prior year, driven by strong unit growth and higher average daily rates for our global hotel reservation service. Hotel room nights booked grew by 48% in the second quarter versus last year. This represented deceleration from the unit growth rate of 57% that we posted in the first quarter. 
However, we were pleased with the way the business rebounded after the disruption in the early part of the quarter from the volcano. We saw sustained strength for our International business in the latter half of the quarter, which exceeded the level of room night growth we had assumed for Q2 guidance, and that momentum has continued so far into Q3, as we will see in a moment when we get to Q3 guidance. 
ADRs were also an important driver of our overperformance. ADRs were up by about 2% to 3% for both our international and domestic hotel services for Q2 2010, compared to the prior year second quarter.
The prevailing exchange rates when we reported our Q2 guidance on May 10 of $1.28 per euro and $1.48 per British pound formed the basis for our forecast for the remainder of the quarter. Actual FX rates for the remainder of the second quarter were unfavorable to those rates. FX rates for the second quarter were also unfavorable to prior year rates, and therefore, adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 7% and 4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2009. 
Our International gross bookings grew by 59% and by 67% on a local currency basis for Q2 2010, compared to the prior year Q2. Airline tickets booked were up by 4% in the quarter. Rental car days booked were up 32% versus second quarter 2009, reflecting the impact of TravelJigsaw. 
TravelJigsaw, a U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service, also contributed $43.9 million in gross bookings in Q2 since we acquired it on May 18. We expect to continue to report gross bookings for TravelJigsaw separately for one year from acquisition to highlight the impact of its addition to the consolidated results. Our opaque rental car days and air tickets booked were down year-on-year due to supplier capacity reductions impacting inventory availability.
In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for guidance, resulting in performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance in all key operating metrics, from gross bookings to EPS.
Gross profit was $445 million and grew 46% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $322 million and grew by 64%, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our Domestic business amounted to $123 million, which represented a 14% growth versus prior year. 
Total operating expenses were generally in line with guidance. Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, was in line with the second quarter of 2009 and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by better-than-assumed overall advertising efficiency.
We recorded below-the-line income in the quarter of about $1.7 million which is favorable to the expense of $1 million we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to FX hedging gains, resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro from the date we gave guidance through the end of the quarter. 
In summary, pro forma EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $204 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $170 million to $180 million, and represents 62% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage, or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, expanded by 440 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q2. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $187 million of cash from operations during the second quarter 2010, which represents a 99% increase versus prior year. We spent about $5 million on CapEx in the quarter and approximately $109 million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of TravelJigsaw.
Certain members of the TravelJigsaw and Booking.com management teams continued to hold a minority interest in the TravelJigsaw business. The minority shares are subject to put and call provisions that will likely lead to them being purchased by Priceline.com over the next three years. 
We spent about $6 million in Q2 to repurchase shares of Priceline common stock. We also expended cash in the second quarter of $75 million, related to conversions of convertible debt. This amount was comprised of $47 million of cash to repay debt principal and cash delivered of about $28 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. 
Thus far in Q3, we settled conversion notices with cash of $19 million for principal and elected to use cash of $72 million to settle the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. By settling the conversion premium in cash, we avoid dilution that would otherwise occur upon issuing shares of common stock. 
In addition, we have recently received conversion notices for $30.9 million principal amount of convertible debt, representing substantially the entire remaining outstanding balance of our older convertible bonds. Therefore, at the end of Q3, we were essentially left with only the $575 million of convertible debt issued in March of this year remaining outstanding.
As of June 30, our cash and investments exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $595 million. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012. Our pro forma fully diluted share count was 2.3 million shares higher than second quarter 2009 due to a year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count, resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year and also due to the impact of higher share prices on fully diluted shares related to our in-the-money convertible notes. The increase was partly offset by year-to-date repurchases of common stock in the amount of $125 million and the use of cash rather than shares to settle conversion premium on converted bonds that I just discussed. 
Now for third quarter 2010 guidance. Our forecast reflects the strong performance in hotel room nights booked that we have seen thus far through Q3 and also includes a full quarter for TravelJigsaw. Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.32 per euro and $1.59 per British pound as Monday's closing rates. At or near these levels, exchange rates will have an adverse impact on our year-over-year financial results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Specifically, euro and pound average FX rates for the third quarter would be down approximately 9% and 4%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or the pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
It is worth highlighting that the exchange rates we're using as the basis for our Q3 guidance are significantly stronger than the FX rates that were in effect when most analysts issued their forecasts that were the basis for the consensus estimate for Q3. FX rates when most analysts’ forecasts were last updated were in the vicinity of $1.20 per euro and $1.40 per pound. Therefore, the relative strength in our guidance for the quarter versus analyst consensus, while certainly driven by expected continued strength in the fundamental performance of the business, is also driven by the stronger currency trends that have emerged in the past several weeks. This also emphasizes how much of an impact foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside our control and not indicative of the core operating results of our business, can have on our results, expressed in U.S. dollars.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 33% to 38%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 46% to 51% as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 57.5% to 62.5%. 
Our third quarter guidance assumes a similar rate of year-over-year increase for international hotel ADRs and further improvement in ADRs for our Domestic business as compared to the year-over-year ADR increases we experienced in Q2. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 29% to 34% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 43% to 48%. For Q3 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $174 million to $179 million, with about $8 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising.
Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, is essentially in line with the prior year Q3. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $31 million and $34 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $56 million and $59 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $21 million to $24 million. We expect information technology costs of about $6 million and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $4.5 million.
We expect total below-the-line negative impact of approximately $10.5 million, which is comprised primarily of net interest expense, foreign exchange hedging loss and the charge for pro forma net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts, since the FX rates assumed for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rates that prevailed at the time we entered most of our hedge contracts. 
Pro forma EBITDA is expected to range between $327 million and $337 million, which represents 48% growth versus prior year Q3 at the midpoint. We are targeting pro forma fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.78 to $4.98 per share, which represents 41% growth over prior year at the midpoint.
Our pro forma EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $74 million, comprised of international income taxes and Alternative Minimum Tax in the U.S., where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. Our pro forma tax rate is increasing as compared to prior year due to more significant growth in International earnings as compared to Domestic earnings. 
We expect TravelJigsaw to be slightly accretive to pro forma EBITDA and EPS for Q3 and in the second half of the year. TravelJigsaw recognizes a significant portion of its annual pro forma EBITDA and net income in Q3 as revenues earned upon completion of high season summer travel. Accretion to second half earnings on a GAAP basis will likely be immaterial due to the impact of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets.
Our pro forma EPS guidance is based upon a pro forma diluted share count of approximately 50.9 million shares, which is based on Monday's closing stock price of $227.38 per share. This is higher than our pro forma share count of 50.2 million in Q3 2009 due to a year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count, resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year, partly offset by year-to-date repurchases of common stock and the use of cash rather than shares to settle conversion premium on converted bonds that I discussed a little while ago.
As a result of those early conversions, the difference between our primary and fully diluted share count has been narrowing, and our fully diluted share count will be less impacted by changes in our stock price going forward. No shares will be included in our fully diluted share count related to our 1.25% convertible debt issued earlier this year unless our stock price exceeds $303 per share, and these bonds are generally not convertible prior to maturity unless our stock price exceeds $455 per share.
As for expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS of $4.06 to $4.26 per share. The difference between our GAAP and pro forma results is driven by pro forma adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, including amortization related to the acquisition of TravelJigsaw, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain non-cash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of certain of the aforementioned pro forma adjustments to arrive at pro forma earnings. We also intend to adjust pro forma results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements.
As we have highlighted in recent quarterly earnings releases, the strong results in the unit growth rates we have achieved for the past several quarters were to some extent helped by the impact of the global recession on the prior year periods. More difficult comps, in tandem with the sheer size of the business, make it highly likely that the recent pattern we have seen in the first two quarters of 2010 of decelerating unit growth rates will continue. We believe that our comps become progressively more challenging throughout each quarter of 2010, and therefore, our unit growth rates will sequentially decelerate in each quarter. Our guidance assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market, in particular, remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

With respect to the Opaque business, the Opaque Hotel business had good growth in the quarter. The Air and Rental Car businesses are impacted by supply, and we're starting to see enough of an improvement in the broad markets for airline tickets and for rental cars that certainly, capacity reductions year-over-year are waning fairly dramatically, and in some cases, rental car companies are adding fleet for peak demand periods. So I think that the improving conditions in the economy certainly could mitigate the capacity issues that we've been dealing with to a significant degree over the last couple of years."

And we certainly don't have any quantification of the impact of the World Cup. I think we're lucky to have a very diverse business, not just a nice business growing in Asia, but also a big business in North America. And I think that having broader geographic distribution and customer diversity would tend to reduce the impact of more localized events, like travel disruption from the volcano and maybe even, to a degree, the World Cup.

And I might add that there's more competition in that space right now with Travelocity and Expedia now showing opaque pricing on their principal websites. Having said that, we still have a very solid conversion for our hotel products here in the United States and very good support for that product from the chains, although conversion in hotels is slightly down, and you may have heard some comments to that effect in the Expedia conference call, but still very strong in our case. With respect to Europe, the chains are not as important a lever in Europe, and in fact, we believe and hope they represent an opportunity for Booking.com, who built its business over the years without material participation from the major U.S. chains and has been able to, over the last couple of years, sign agreements with the major chains and start to bring their inventory online. It's published price inventory. It's not opaque. We're not offering opaque product on Booking.com. But I think the chain participation internationally is growing, not shrinking, and represents an opportunity for us over the next year or so. With respect to Google travel search, they've been experimenting with vertical search in non-travel products and more recently in travel products with an experiment they're doing at hotels. And obviously, their proposed purchase of ITA shows what their intention is in airline tickets. If you look at the statements that Google has made in connection with the ITA announcement and other public statements on their behalf, they characterized the effort as a way to improve the user experience and potentially deliver a more qualified customer to their advertising partners. And in the travel space, the online travel agents like ourselves, are some of their principal customers. So at least, by their words, they intend to build a better user experience so that they can deliver a more qualified customer to OTAs and suppliers. So if that's how things shake out, I think it could be a win for Google, as well as a win for the online travel agents. You’ve heard a lot of other people in the space express a concern that Google might someday sell tickets on their own or that they might start to not renew ITA's agreements with some other third parties out there. Google has expressed, has denied that, that's their intention, and we take them at their word. I think that over time, it could possibly represent a competitive threat, but that's not how they're characterizing it at this time."

I think a lot of them have been reporting a significant growth from obviously a very small base in business that's coming from iPhone applications. With respect to the type of business that you're getting from those devices, I think that is very often driven by the functionality that you provide in the application. So if, for example, your application is driven at last-minute and geographically targeted business, for example, the way Priceline's iPhone app is, then you see a lot more last-minute business, you see a lot more local business. And because our app is pointed primarily at our Name Your Own Price product, we see a bigger mix of Name Your Own Price business. So it's turned out to be a useful tool in trying to drive particular businesses, if that's consistent with how people are using the native functionality of the device. I think that, that will continue to be a growing part of the business. The Android platform has got very wide distribution, and is still in the very early days of really getting the number and the use of its applications out there, but we think that's pretty good. Now with respect to opaque inventory and whether we're seeing an impact of that, I don’t -- first of all, the competitive efforts are principally in the area of Hotel, and Travelocity's Top Secret Hotel offering is pretty new, and we believe at this point in time pretty small, based on what we're seeing. And Expedia is essentially putting Hotwire on Expedia.com, and they've done that with different types of integration with links and so forth in the past. And so it's not dramatically apparent to us that in terms of what we're seeing in the business at this point that we're losing a lot of business to those, but obviously, it's a concern for the future."

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
The group, consisting primarily of Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com and now TravelJigsaw, reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $3.4 billion, up 43% year-over-year. Pro forma net income was $158.2 million or $3.09 per share versus the $2.02 the prior year. Second quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $2.65 per share and the high end of our guidance for the quarter. 
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 23.2 million for the quarter, up 48% year-over-year. We are pleased with the level of growth in room night reservations in the quarter and with the degree of sequential deceleration as we start to comp against improving performance last year.
Our International business performed well, with 67% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, a decrease from 73% in the prior quarter. International gross bookings benefited from strong transaction growth in the back half of the quarter following the disruption caused by the Iceland volcano and an improvement in average daily rates. This strength continues to date in Q3, and together with the recent strengthening in the euro and pound, results in a solid outlook for Q3. Geographic expansion, growth in hotel inventory, growth in new markets and adding results from Agoda and partial quarter results from TravelJigsaw also helped drive strong top line growth in the second quarter.
Booking.com continues to build its supply platform worldwide, with a hotel count of approximately 96,000 hotels in over 87 countries. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and reported its fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. I am particularly impressed with and grateful for the performance of the Agoda team, given the civil unrest in Bangkok, which caused the temporary closure of our office and squelched demand for Thailand, Agoda's most demanded destination. 
TravelJigsaw joined our group in the wake of dealing with the disruption created by the Iceland volcano. Nevertheless, the business delivered solid growth in the quarter, and the group now has a foundation of business in Europe and North America from which to build a global franchise in the rental car business.
Priceline.com's domestic gross bookings grew 20% in the second quarter, aided by strong hotel results and a significant year-over-year increase in airline ticket prices. Merchant gross bookings increased 31%, as merchant hotel gross bookings, both at Priceline and Agoda, and the addition of merchant rental car bookings from TravelJigsaw offset year-over-year decreases in opaque airline tickets and rental car sales, where reduced industry capacity continued to pressure inventory available for opaque discounting.
For the group, consolidated operating margins improved during the quarter due to improvement in the International business. As in Q1, domestic margins were pressured, as airfare increases drove bookings growth but not revenue growth, and marketing spend increased faster than gross profit dollars.
Global economic uncertainty continues to create volatility in financial markets, and currency fluctuation continues to produce volatility in our translated results. The widespread concern that a sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone would lead to falloff in travel demand has not yet materialized, and business results to date are encouraging. That said, we remain concerned that government deficits and consequent austerity measures could impact economic recovery and travel demand in the future. 
In summary, the business performed well in the second quarter and is showing demand and pricing trends consistent with improving economic conditions. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,109704662,72098,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2010.Gross booking dollars grew by 43% for Q2 compared to the prior year, driven by strong unit grow",2273,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2010.
Gross booking dollars grew by 43% for Q2 compared to the prior year, driven by strong unit growth and higher average daily rates for our global hotel reservation service. Hotel room nights booked grew by 48% in the second quarter versus last year. This represented deceleration from the unit growth rate of 57% that we posted in the first quarter. 
However, we were pleased with the way the business rebounded after the disruption in the early part of the quarter from the volcano. We saw sustained strength for our International business in the latter half of the quarter, which exceeded the level of room night growth we had assumed for Q2 guidance, and that momentum has continued so far into Q3, as we will see in a moment when we get to Q3 guidance.  ADRs were also an important driver of our overperformance. ADRs were up by about 2% to 3% for both our international and domestic hotel services for Q2 2010 compared to the prior year second quarter.
The prevailing exchange rates when we reported our Q2 guidance on May 10 of $1.28 per euro and $1.48 per British pound formed the basis for our forecast for the remainder of the quarter. Actual FX rates for the remainder of the second quarter were unfavorable to those rates. FX rates for the second quarter were also unfavorable to prior year rates, and therefore, adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 7% and 4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter of 2009. 
Our International gross bookings grew by 59% and by 67% on a local currency basis for Q2 2010 compared to the prior year Q2. Airline tickets booked were up by 4% in the quarter. Rental car days booked were up 32% versus second quarter 2009, reflecting the impact of TravelJigsaw. TravelJigsaw, a U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service, also contributed $43.9 million in gross bookings in Q2 since we acquired it on May 18. We expect to continue to report gross bookings for TravelJigsaw separately for one year from acquisition to highlight the impact of its addition to the consolidated results. Our opaque rental car days and air tickets booked were down year-on-year due to supplier capacity reductions impacting inventory availability.
In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for guidance, resulting in performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance in all key operating metrics, from gross bookings to EPS. Gross profit was $445 million and grew 46% as compared to prior year. Our International operations generated gross profit of $322 million and grew by 64%, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our Domestic business amounted to $123 million, which represented a 14% growth versus prior year. 
Total operating expenses were generally in line with guidance. Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, was in line with the second quarter of 2009 and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by better-than-assumed overall advertising efficiency. We recorded below-the-line income in the quarter of about $1.7 million, which is favorable to the expense of $1 million we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to FX hedging gains, resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro from the date we gave guidance through the end of the quarter. 
In summary, pro forma EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $204 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $170 million to $180 million, and represents 62% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage, or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, expanded by 440 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q2. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $187 million of cash from operations during the second quarter 2010, which represents a 99% increase versus prior year. We spent about $5 million on CapEx in the quarter and approximately $109 million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of TravelJigsaw.
Certain members of the TravelJigsaw and Booking.com management teams continued to hold a minority interest in the TravelJigsaw business. The minority shares are subject to put and call provisions that will likely lead to them being purchased by Priceline.com over the next three years. 
We spent about $6 million in Q2 to repurchase shares of Priceline common stock. We also expended cash in the second quarter of $75 million, related to conversions of convertible debt. This amount was comprised of $47 million of cash to repay debt principal and cash delivered of about $28 million in satisfaction of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. 
Thus far in Q3, we settled conversion notices with cash of $19 million for principal and elected to use cash of $72 million to settle the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. By settling the conversion premium in cash, we avoid dilution that would otherwise occur upon issuing shares of common stock. 
In addition, we have recently received conversion notices for $30.9 million principal amount of convertible debt, representing substantially the entire remaining outstanding balance of our older convertible bonds. Therefore, at the end of Q3, we were essentially left with only the $575 million of convertible debt issued in March of this year remaining outstanding.
As of June 30, our cash and investments exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $595 million. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012. Our pro forma fully diluted share count was 2.3 million shares higher than second quarter 2009 due to a year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count, resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year and also due to the impact of higher share prices on fully diluted shares related to our in-the-money convertible notes. The increase was partly offset by year-to-date repurchases of common stock in the amount of $125 million and the use of cash rather than shares to settle conversion premium on converted bonds that I just discussed. 
Now for third quarter 2010 guidance. Our forecast reflects the strong performance in hotel room nights booked that we have seen thus far through Q3 and also includes a full quarter for TravelJigsaw. Our forecast also assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.32 per euro and $1.59 per British pound as Monday's closing rates. At or near these levels, exchange rates will have an adverse impact on our year-over-year financial results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Specifically, euro and pound average FX rates for the third quarter would be down approximately 9% and 4%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or the pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
It is worth highlighting that the exchange rates we're using as the basis for our Q3 guidance are significantly stronger than the FX rates that were in effect when most analysts issued their forecasts that were the basis for the consensus estimate for Q3. FX rates when most analysts’ forecasts were last updated were in the vicinity of $1.20 per euro and $1.40 per pound. Therefore, the relative strength in our guidance for the quarter versus analyst consensus, while certainly driven by expected continued strength in the fundamental performance of the business, is also driven by the stronger currency trends that have emerged in the past several weeks. This also emphasizes how much of an impact foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside our control and not indicative of the core operating results of our business, can have on our results, expressed in U.S. dollars.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 33% to 38%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 13%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 46% to 51% as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 57.5% to 62.5%. 
Our third quarter guidance assumes a similar rate of year-over-year increase for international hotel ADRs and further improvement in ADRs for our Domestic business as compared to the year-over-year ADR increases we experienced in Q2. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 29% to 34% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 43% to 48%. For Q3 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $174 million to $179 million, with about $8 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising.
Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, is essentially in line with the prior year Q3. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $31 million and $34 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $56 million and $59 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $21 million to $24 million. We expect information technology costs of about $6 million and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $4.5 million.
We expect total below-the-line negative impact of approximately $10.5 million, which is comprised primarily of net interest expense, foreign exchange hedging loss and the charge for pro forma net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts, since the FX rates assumed for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rates that prevailed at the time we entered most of our hedge contracts. 
Pro forma EBITDA is expected to range between $327 million and $337 million, which represents 48% growth versus prior year Q3 at the midpoint. We are targeting pro forma fully diluted EPS of approximately $4.78 to $4.98 per share, which represents 41% growth over prior year at the midpoint.
Our pro forma EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $74 million, comprised of international income taxes and Alternative Minimum Tax in the U.S., where we have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. Our pro forma tax rate is increasing as compared to prior year due to more significant growth in International earnings as compared to Domestic earnings. 
We expect TravelJigsaw to be slightly accretive to pro forma EBITDA and EPS for Q3 and in the second half of the year. TravelJigsaw recognizes a significant portion of its annual pro forma EBITDA and net income in Q3 as revenues earned upon completion of high season summer travel. Accretion to second half earnings on a GAAP basis will likely be immaterial due to the impact of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets.
Our pro forma EPS guidance is based upon a pro forma diluted share count of approximately 50.9 million shares, which is based on Monday's closing stock price of $227.38 per share. This is higher than our pro forma share count of 50.2 million in Q3 2009 due to a year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count, resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year, partly offset by year-to-date repurchases of common stock and the use of cash rather than shares to settle conversion premium on converted bonds that I discussed a little while ago.
As a result of those early conversions, the difference between our primary and fully diluted share count has been narrowing, and our fully diluted share count will be less impacted by changes in our stock price going forward. No shares will be included in our fully diluted share count related to our 1.25% convertible debt issued earlier this year unless our stock price exceeds $303 per share, and these bonds are generally not convertible prior to maturity unless our stock price exceeds $455 per share.
As for expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS of $4.06 to $4.26 per share. The difference between our GAAP and pro forma results is driven by pro forma adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, including amortization related to the acquisition of TravelJigsaw, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain non-cash income tax expenses and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of certain of the aforementioned pro forma adjustments to arrive at pro forma earnings. We also intend to adjust pro forma results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements.
As we have highlighted in recent quarterly earnings releases, the strong results in the unit growth rates we have achieved for the past several quarters were to some extent helped by the impact of the global recession on the prior year periods. More difficult comps, in tandem with the sheer size of the business, make it highly likely that the recent pattern we have seen in the first two quarters of 2010 of decelerating unit growth rates will continue. We believe that our comps become progressively more challenging throughout each quarter of 2010, and therefore, our unit growth rates will sequentially decelerate in each quarter. Our guidance assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market, in particular, remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

The Air and Rental Car businesses are impacted by supply, and we're starting to see enough of an improvement in the broad markets for airline tickets and for rental cars that certainly, capacity reductions year-over-year are waning fairly dramatically, and in some cases, rental car companies are adding fleet for peak demand periods.

With respect to TravelJigsaw, we are going to work with that business in the same way that we've worked with Booking.com and Agoda. They are -- they have a fair degree of operational independence. We work with them to figure out specific areas where we might have some business processes or some intellectual property or some knowledge that could help them build their business and generate more growth and be more efficient in things like IT purchasing and that sort of thing. Over time, we will look for opportunities for advertising their product on some of our other websites around the world. But that's not the principal driver of this transaction. The principal driver is for TravelJigsaw to build upon and expand its international franchise in rental cars and to build its own brand and its own direct customer flows, but we’ll obviously take advantage of any business that we can move back and forth."

And we certainly don't have any quantification of the impact of the World Cup. I think we're lucky to have a very diverse business, not just a nice business growing in Asia, but also a big business in North America. And I think that having broader geographic distribution and customer diversity would tend to reduce the impact of more localized events, like travel disruption from the volcano and maybe even, to a degree, the World Cup. I wouldn't say that there's any particular inflection point in Asia. As we've said in prior earnings calls, we've been performing well there for some time.

And I might add that there's more competition in that space right now with Travelocity and Expedia now showing opaque pricing on their principal websites. Having said that, we still have a very solid conversion for our hotel products here in the United States and very good support for that product from the chains, although conversion in hotels is slightly down, and you may have heard some comments to that effect in the Expedia conference call, but still very strong in our case. With respect to Europe, the chains are not as important a lever in Europe, and in fact, we believe and hope they represent an opportunity for Booking.com, who built its business over the years without material participation from the major U.S. chains and has been able to, over the last couple of years, sign agreements with the major chains and start to bring their inventory online. It's published price inventory. It's not opaque. We're not offering opaque product on Booking.com. But I think the chain participation internationally is growing, not shrinking, and represents an opportunity for us over the next year or so. With respect to Google travel search, they've been experimenting with vertical search in non-travel products and more recently in travel products with an experiment they're doing at hotels. And obviously, their proposed purchase of ITA shows what their intention is in airline tickets. If you look at the statements that Google has made in connection with the ITA announcement and other public statements on their behalf, they characterized the effort as a way to improve the user experience and potentially deliver a more qualified customer to their advertising partners. And in the travel space, the online travel agents like ourselves, are some of their principal customers. So at least, by their words, they intend to build a better user experience so that they can deliver a more qualified customer to OTAs and suppliers. So if that's how things shake out, I think it could be a win for Google, as well as a win for the online travel agents. You’ve heard a lot of other people in the space express a concern that Google might someday sell tickets on their own or that they might start to not renew ITA's agreements with some other third parties out there. Google has expressed, has denied that, that's their intention, and we take them at their word. I think that over time, it could possibly represent a competitive threat, but that's not how they're characterizing it at this time."

I think a lot of them have been reporting a significant growth from obviously a very small base in business that's coming from iPhone applications. With respect to the type of business that you're getting from those devices, I think that is very often driven by the functionality that you provide in the application. So if, for example, your application is driven at last-minute and geographically targeted business, for example, the way Priceline's iPhone app is, then you see a lot more last-minute business, you see a lot more local business. And because our app is pointed primarily at our Name Your Own Price product, we see a bigger mix of Name Your Own Price business. So it's turned out to be a useful tool in trying to drive particular businesses, if that's consistent with how people are using the native functionality of the device. I think that, that will continue to be a growing part of the business. The Android platform has got very wide distribution, and is still in the very early days of really getting the number and the use of its applications out there, but we think that's pretty good. Now with respect to opaque inventory and whether we're seeing an impact of that, I don’t -- first of all, the competitive efforts are principally in the area of Hotel, and Travelocity's Top Secret Hotel offering is pretty new, and we believe at this point in time pretty small, based on what we're seeing. And Expedia is essentially putting Hotwire on Expedia.com, and they've done that with different types of integration with links and so forth in the past. And so it's not dramatically apparent to us that in terms of what we're seeing in the business at this point that we're losing a lot of business to those, but obviously, it's a concern for the future."

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions. 
The Priceline Group, consisting primarily of Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com and TravelJigsaw, reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $4 billion, up 47% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $272 million or $5.33 per share, versus $3.45 the prior year. Third quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $4.97 per share and the high end of our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 27.5 million for the quarter, up 54% year-over-year.
Growth in room night reservations for the International business exceeded our expectations, driving 78% international gross bookings growth on local currency basis, a sequential increase from 67% in the prior quarter. International gross bookings benefited from strong transaction growth in core Western European and North American markets, an improvement in average daily rates and increasing contribution from high-growth new markets.
I want to provide, on a onetime basis, some data on our progress in new markets to help size their contribution to our international results. Booking.com and Agoda have made excellent progress in building the group's business in the Asia-Pacific region. The combined business of Agoda plus Booking.com's business for APAC destinations was approximately $780 million for the 12 months ended September 30 and the third quarter growth rate for that business was just shy of 150%. 
Booking.com has also made substantial progress in South America. Gross bookings for South American destinations were $96 million for the trailing 12 months, and the third quarter growth rate was in excess of 300%. Further in both markets, our brands are building point-of-sale businesses, which are comparable size and growing at impressive rates as well.
For example, Booking.com's point-of-sale business in South America for the same period was $265 million in gross bookings and growing at 133% in Q3. When comparing these results to other online travel agents in the region, keep in mind that these are only hotel reservations, where others may have substantial lower margin Airline Ticket business in their gross bookings figures. In addition to geographic expansion, growth in hotel inventory and adding results from TravelJigsaw also helped drive strong top line growth in the third quarter.
Booking.com continues to build its supply platform worldwide, with a hotel count of approximately 105,000 hotels in 92 countries. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region, and again reported triple-digit year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. The business has performed well following civil unrest in Thailand and is well positioned for its seasonally important fourth quarter. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter, and the sharing of best practices and other integration steps are proceeding well.
Priceline.com's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the third quarter, aided by strong hotel results and a turnaround in the opaque Rental Car business. The U.S. hotel business benefited from availability of promotional inventory and expansion of Booking.com inventory made available on Priceline.com. When this growth is combined with North American business booked directly on Booking.com, which is a great site for domestic travelers to book international destinations, our North American business is one of the group's fastest-growing core markets.  
Merchant gross bookings increased 41%, as merchant hotel gross bookings, both at Priceline and Agoda and the addition of merchant rental car bookings from TravelJigsaw, offset year-over-year decreases in opaque airline ticket sales, where reduced industry capacity continue to pressure inventory available for opaque discounting. For the group, consolidated operating margins improved during the quarter due to advertising and operating expense efficiencies.
The Priceline Group has sustained high levels of gross bookings growth for the first nine months of this year. We believe the scale of our international hotel network is allowing us to achieve high levels of growth in both core markets, which benefit from our growing ability to tap worldwide demand and in new markets, where growing hotel inventory is booked by both local and international travelers.  
Cyclical improvements in travel demand, evidenced by growing ADRs, has also helped. Finally but importantly, we believe hard work and execution by our teams in building supply and content, website innovation, distribution and integration benefits have helped to deliver market-leading growth. 
In summary, the business performed well in the third quarter and continues to show solid demand and pricing trends. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,114994000,86477,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2010",2010-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010. We were presently surprised by our top line results in the quarter, as room night growth acce",1878,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
We were presently surprised by our top line results in the quarter, as room night growth accelerated after we reported our Q3 guidance in early August. Hotel room nights booked grew by 54% in the third quarter versus last year, as compared to the unit growth rate of 48% that we posted in the second quarter.  
The acceleration growth rate in Q3 is certainly somewhat attributable to the negative impact on gross bookings in Q2 caused by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland. We saw strong performance in our key European markets that was likely, to some degree, also helped by diminished concerns over sovereign debt issues. Our continued efforts to improve the user expense on our websites are also a contributing factor. 
Lastly, as Jeff highlighted, our newer markets like Asia Pacific and South America, continue to grow as a percentage of our business and are therefore having a more pronounced impact on our total growth rate. These markets are growing both from a destination and point-of-sale perspective, as we add new hotels and customers to our network. 
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were also favorable to our assumption for guidance. ADRs were up by about 4% for our International Hotel service and by over 5% for our domestic hotel service for Q3 2010 compared to prior year third quarter. The strong performance from a unit growth and ADR perspective drove total gross booking dollars to grow by 47% for Q3 compared to prior year.
FX rates for the third quarter were unfavorable to prior year rates and therefore adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 10% and 6% respectively in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009.
Our International gross bookings grew by 67% and by 78% on a local currency basis for Q3 2010 compared to the prior year of Q3. The local currency growth rate of 78% compares favorably to the 67% local currency growth rate for Q2. TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010, contributed $85.8 million in gross bookings in Q3, which is its peak seasonal travel quarter. 
Rental car days booked were up by 97% versus third quarter 2009, including the impact of TravelJigsaw.  Our U.S. rental car service also had a good quarter, with a 23% increase in rental car days helped by continued strong demand and better access to supply for opaque rates.
Airline tickets booked were down by 5% in the quarter, and average airfares weren't up as much as we assumed when we gave guidance. As a result, domestic gross bookings growth of 12% was slightly below our guidance, but the impact on gross profit was negligible. 
In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for guidance, resulting in earnings performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance. Gross profit was $666 million and grew 54% as compared to prior year. 
Our International operations generated gross profit of $530 million and grew by 68% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our Domestic business amounted to $136 million, which represented 16% growth versus prior year and acceleration compared to 14% growth posted in Q2. Total operating expenses were generally in line with guidance. 
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit, was favorable to the third quarter of 2009, and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by improved advertising efficiency. We recorded below-the-line expense in the quarter of about $11.7 million, which is higher than the $10.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to FX hedging losses. 
In summary, non-GAAP EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $363 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $327 million to $337 million, and represents 61% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage, or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, expanded by 260 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q3. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $305 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2010, which represents a 57% increase versus prior year. We spent about $4 million on CapEx in the quarter. We issued $122 million of cash in the third quarter to settle debt conversions. This amount was comprised of $50 million of cash to repay debt principal and cash delivered of about $72 million in satisfaction of the conversion premium on the bonds. 
On a year-to-date basis through September 30, the group has generated almost $600 million in cash from operations and raised $575 million of cash from issuing convertible debt in March. We have put over $500 million of this cash to work during the year-to-date period. We used $108 million for acquisitions, including the acquisition of TravelJigsaw. We bought back about $126 million worth of our common stock and used $295 million to retire substantially all of our remaining convertible debt issued in prior years. This included about $100 million paid in cash rather than by issuing common stock to settle conversion premium in excess of principal value. 
As of September 30, our cash and investments of $1.5 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $900 million. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012. We were pleased to receive an investment-grade rating in October from Standard & Poor's on our 2015 bonds. The rating reflects the company's consistent track record of strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet with reasonable leverage and excellent liquidity. 
Now for fourth quarter 2010 guidance. Our forecast reflects the continued strong performance in hotel room nights booked that we have seen thus far through Q4, and also includes TravelJigsaw. Our forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.40 per euro and $1.62 per British pound as Friday's closing rates. At or near these levels, exchange rates will have an adverse impact on our year-over-year financial results expressed in U.S. dollars.  
Specifically, euro and pound average FX rates for the fourth quarter would be down by approximately 5% and 2% respectively as compared to the prior year. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
I highlight that the euro exchange rate we are using as the basis for our Q4 guidance is stronger than the rate of $1.32 per euro that was in effect, when most analysts issued their forecast that are the basis for the consensus estimate for Q4. This move in exchange rates, together with continued strength in the fundamental performance of the business, result in guidance that exceeds analysts' consensus forecast for Q4. 
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 36% to 41%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 5% to 10%. This domestic forecast assumes flat gross bookings for air and double-digit growth for hotel gross bookings. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 54% to 59%, as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 58% to 63%. 
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for international and domestic hotel ADRs will improve further compared to the increases we experienced in Q3. We expect the Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 31% to 36% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 49% to 54%. 
For Q4 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $141 million to $146 million, with about $6 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising.  Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, is assumed to be essentially in line with prior year Q4. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $29 million and $32 million, we expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $60.5 million and $63.5 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $21 million to $24 million. We expect information technology costs of about $7 million and depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million. 
We expect total below-the-line negative impact of approximately $6.5 million, which is comprised primarily of foreign exchange hedging loss, net interest expense and a charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to noncontrolling interest. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts, since the FX rates assumed for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rate that prevailed earlier in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $200 million and $210 million, which at the midpoint represents 54% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.91 to $3.06 per share, which at the midpoint represents 50% growth year-over-year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $43.5 million, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. will be at a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. Our non-GAAP tax rate is increasing as compared to prior year, due to more significant growth in international earnings as compared to domestic earnings.  Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes fully diluted share count of 51.4 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $388.87.
We expect TravelJigsaw to be very slightly accretive to non-GAAP EBITDA and EPS for Q4. Q3 is TravelJigsaw's most significant seasonal quarter from a P&L perspective, as revenue is earned upon completion of summer travel. As for expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS $2.29 to $2.44 per share.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization, including amortization related to the acquisition of TravelJigsaw, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions, certain non-cash income tax expenses, and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements. 
As we have emphasized in recent quarterly earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps, as economic conditions continue to gradually improve. Our Q4 guidance reflects the deceleration we have experienced thus far in the quarter and assumes that we will encounter further deceleration in growth rates as we proceed through the quarter. Our guidance assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general, and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

And so it's really a question of determining to what extent your earnings are derived from innovation, and then there's a phase-in period as well in terms of how long the full impact of that innovation is attributed to your earnings. And as Dan said, those discussions are ongoing."

That is a similar sort of organic strategy that Agoda and Booking.com have followed in other markets. And we're satisfied with the results of that effort so far, and hotel development efforts continue. With respect to the U.S. business, we are very pleased with how our U.S. business is performing. And when you think about the gross bookings growth rates, the principal difference between I think the business that we reported today and some of the results that you may have heard from some of our competition is that our Airline Ticket business, probably has not performed as well as perhaps some of our competition. And we are very disciplined about the extent to which we invest in marketing in that business, because the returns on it are so much less than the other merchant businesses we have. And I think our air team is doing a great job running the business. But we're probably not as aggressive as some of our competition might be in investing in marketing in that business, because it's just much more important for us to drive the Hotel business, and the U.S. Hotel business is doing quite well."

As we look at the gross profit generated by our entire Airline Ticket business, and that includes opaque and retail, and the opaque contributes a lot more gross profit dollars than the retail does, because of the long sustained growth in our Hotel business and our International business, that's really become just a much, much smaller part of total gross profit dollars. And so if the gist of the first question is would that somehow be material to us in the financial sense as classically defined by the accountants, the answer to that is clearly no. Having said that, we have -- we believe, very good relationships with the airlines, and we certainly have the ability to do innovative things in our connections with the airlines. And I think we provide the airlines the lowest-cost distribution that they have out there. And I don't believe that operating expense is required to continue to connect with them in ways that are acceptable to the airlines, that going to have any significant impact on our CapEx or anything of that nature. There's an opportunity cost there because as the IT resources, we have dedicated to that product, they're working on things like back office connections, they're not working on innovation that customers are facing could ultimately help drive the business to grow faster."

The European market is characterized, especially in Western Europe by a very large and relatively affluent middle class that spends disposable income on travel. And as a result, that has allowed the businesses we operate in Europe to grow at high rates and become big in a reasonably short period of time. In Asia, the population is huge, much bigger than Europe, if you include China for sure, and the levels of general economic growth are much higher than the general macroeconomic growth in the European markets. So you have the benefit of growing economies. And you also have the benefit of travel market that's probably growing faster than it is in general in Europe or in North America. I think the destinations are getting more travel from international travelers. And I think that Asian people are traveling more as they become more affluent, as they get jobs in cities and in the case of China, as it becomes legally permissible to do so when you're able to get a visa, the destinations that are allowable for visas is expanding for the Chinese. And I think that represents a pent-up market demand that over time, should be very bullish for people in the travel industry in general. So those are all the good things about the Asian market that are a little bit different from Europe. The one thing that I will say about Asia, and this is true for South America as well, as that you don't yet have the emergence of the very, very large affluent middle-class. That's a trend that will happen over many, many years. But it's not there right now. So while the numbers that we gave out earlier in this call are demonstrative of a very attractive business environment in those markets, I don't think that they have the potential to grow as big, as quickly as the European markets and North American markets did in online travel. But they do have, at least in our estimation, the capability of growing to be very large over a long period of time."

So that today, the search engines have the ability to show a consumer almost every hotel in the world basically. That's the nature of how they work. So the question really is not whether the search engines are going to have access to those hotels, it's really a question of how it's displayed and what the model is for advertising. And I think it's certainly possible over time that the search engines could display more information, more content and even try to display current pricing. And I think people on this call know that there are steps being taken by Google to experiment with that. And so the question is how much content do they show and how do they display it? And then how do they use it to support advertising revenues on their websites. And we certainly think that one of the predominant ways that they're doing it today and they'll do in the foreseeable future is to take advertising from online travel agents and use the ability that we have to have superior conversion of that lead, which allows us to pay an attractive price for it will represent an attractive model for the search engines for some time to come."

And I think that is more representative of the fact that our competition is now fully anniversary the benefits they got from cutting processing fees and the growth rates are stepping down a little bit, or it's requiring more investment to maintain higher growth rates. I think that things like airline capacity, which is still under very sort of strict control in terms of growth, has something to do with that. And high airline ticket prices, especially compared to last year also has an impact on leisure demand. I think all of those factors I just mentioned could be a reason why you've seen a little bit of pressure on airline ticket growth rates. But having said that, I still view and we still view that demand for leisure travel has been reasonably robust and people get the results of our non-air businesses, they seem to be evidence of that."

And I think they have mixed policies about to what degree that they're willing to pay. The second thing is that it's still, we believe, is the case that for any given lead that's generated on the metasearch site, it's got a better chance of converting at an online travel agent that has a full selection of hotels, great content, things like user reviews that really aren't available on supplier websites and customers like shopping and booking on the online travel sites.

With respect to hotel counts, our Booking.com and Agoda continue to aggressively sign up new hotels. I think for both businesses, a lot of those hotels are in new markets.

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions. 
The Priceline Group, consisting primarily of Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com and TravelJigsaw, reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $4 billion, up 47% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $272 million or $5.33 per share, versus $3.45 the prior year. Third quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $4.97 per share and the high end of our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 27.5 million for the quarter, up 54% year-over-year.
Growth in room night reservations for the International business exceeded our expectations, driving 78% international gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, a sequential increase from 67% in the prior quarter. International gross bookings benefited from strong transaction growth in core Western European and North American markets, an improvement in average daily rates and increasing contribution from high-growth new markets.
I want to provide, on a onetime basis, some data on our progress in new markets to help size their contribution to our international results. Booking.com and Agoda have made excellent progress in building the group's business in the Asia-Pacific region. The combined business of Agoda plus Booking.com's business for APAC destinations was approximately $780 million for the 12 months ended September 30 and the third quarter growth rate for that business was just shy of 150%. 
Booking.com has also made substantial progress in South America. Gross bookings for South American destinations were $96 million for the trailing 12 months, and the third quarter growth rate was in excess of 300%. Further, in both markets, our brands are building point-of-sale businesses, which are of comparable size and growing at impressive rates as well.
For example, Booking.com's point-of-sale business in South America for the same period was $265 million in gross bookings and growing at 133% in Q3. When comparing these results to other online travel agents in the region, keep in mind that these are only hotel reservations, where others may have substantial lower margin airline ticket business in their gross bookings figures. In addition to geographic expansion, growth in hotel inventory and adding results from TravelJigsaw also helped drive strong top line growth in the third quarter.
Booking.com continues to build its supply platform worldwide, with a hotel count of approximately 105,000 hotels in 92 countries. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region, and again reported triple-digit year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. The business has performed well following civil unrest in Thailand and is well positioned for its seasonally important fourth quarter. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter, and the sharing of best practices and other integration steps are proceeding well.
Priceline.com's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the third quarter, aided by strong hotel results and a turnaround in the opaque rental car business. The U.S. hotel business benefited from availability of promotional inventory and expansion of Booking.com inventory made available on Priceline.com. When this growth is combined with North American business booked directly on Booking.com, which is a great site for domestic travelers to book international destinations, our North American business is one of the group's fastest-growing core markets.  
Merchant gross bookings increased 41%, as merchant hotel gross bookings, both at Priceline and Agoda and the addition of merchant rental car bookings from TravelJigsaw, offset year-over-year decreases in opaque airline ticket sales, where reduced industry capacity continued to pressure inventory available for opaque discounting. For the group, consolidated operating margins improved during the quarter due to advertising and operating expense efficiencies.
The Priceline Group has sustained high levels of gross bookings growth for the first nine months of this year. We believe the scale of our international hotel network is allowing us to achieve high levels of growth in both core markets, which benefit from our growing ability to tap worldwide demand, and in new markets, where growing hotel inventory is booked by both local and international travelers.  Cyclical improvements in travel demand, evidenced by growing ADRs, has also helped. 
Finally but importantly, we believe hard work and execution by our teams in building supply and content, website innovation, distribution and integration benefits have helped to deliver market-leading growth. 
In summary, the business performed well in the third quarter and continues to show solid demand and pricing trends. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,114994000,86524,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2010",2010-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010. We were presently surprised by our top line results in the quarter, as room night growth acce",1875,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
We were presently surprised by our top line results in the quarter, as room night growth accelerated after we reported our Q3 guidance in early August. Hotel room nights booked grew by 54% in the third quarter versus last year, as compared to the unit growth rate of 48% that we posted in the second quarter.  
The acceleration growth rate in Q3 is certainly somewhat attributable to the negative impact on gross bookings in Q2 caused by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland. We saw strong performance in our key European markets that was likely, to some degree, also helped by diminished concerns over sovereign debt issues. Our continued efforts to improve the user experience on our websites are also a contributing factor. 
Lastly, as Jeff highlighted, our newer markets, like Asia Pacific and South America, continued to grow as a percentage of our business and are therefore having a more pronounced impact on our total growth rate. These markets are growing both from a destination and point-of-sale perspective, as we add new hotels and customers to our network. 
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were also favorable to our assumption for guidance. ADRs were up by about 4% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our domestic hotel service for Q3 2010 compared to prior year third quarter. The strong performance from a unit growth and ADR perspective drove total gross booking dollars to grow by 47% for Q3 compared to prior year.
FX rates for the third quarter were unfavorable to prior year rates and therefore adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 10% and 6% respectively in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009.
Our International gross bookings grew by 67% and by 78% on a local currency basis for Q3 2010 compared to the prior year Q3. The local currency growth rate of 78% compares favorably to the 67% local currency growth rate for Q2. TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010, contributed $85.8 million in gross bookings in Q3, which is its peak seasonal travel quarter. 
Rental car days booked were up by 97% versus third quarter 2009, including the impact of TravelJigsaw.  Our U.S. rental car service also had a good quarter, with a 23% increase in rental car days helped by continued strong demand and better access to supply for opaque rates.
Airline tickets booked were down by 5% in the quarter, and average airfares weren't up as much as we assumed when we gave guidance. As a result, domestic gross bookings growth of 12% was slightly below our guidance, but the impact on gross profit was negligible. 
In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for guidance, resulting in earnings performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance. Gross profit was $666 million and grew 54% as compared to prior year. 
Our International operations generated gross profit of $530 million and grew by 68% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our domestic business amounted to $136 million, which represented 16% growth versus prior year and acceleration compared to 14% growth posted in Q2. Total operating expenses were generally in line with guidance. 
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was favorable to the third quarter of 2009, and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by improved advertising efficiency. We recorded below-the-line expense in the quarter of about $11.7 million, which is higher than the $10.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to FX hedging losses. 
In summary, non-GAAP EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $363 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $327 million to $337 million, and represents 61% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage, or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, expanded by 260 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q3. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $305 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2010, which represents a 57% increase versus prior year. We spent about $4 million on CapEx in the quarter. We issued $122 million of cash in the third quarter to settle debt conversions. This amount was comprised of $50 million of cash to repay debt principal and cash delivered of about $72 million in satisfaction of the conversion premium on the bonds. 
On a year-to-date basis through September 30, the group has generated almost $600 million in cash from operations and raised $575 million of cash from issuing convertible debt in March. We have put over $500 million of this cash to work during the year-to-date period. We used $108 million for acquisitions, including the acquisition of TravelJigsaw. We bought back about $126 million worth of our common stock and used $295 million to retire substantially all of our remaining convertible debt issued in prior years. This included about $100 million paid in cash rather than by issuing common stock to settle conversion premium in excess of principal value. 
As of September 30, our cash and investments of $1.5 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $900 million. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012. We were pleased to receive an investment-grade rating in October from Standard & Poor's on our 2015 bonds. The rating reflects the company's consistent track record of strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet with reasonable leverage and excellent liquidity. 
Now for fourth quarter 2010 guidance. Our forecast reflects the continued strong performance in hotel room nights booked that we have seen thus far through Q4, and also includes TravelJigsaw. Our forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.40 per euro and $1.62 per British pound as Friday's closing rates. At or near these levels, exchange rates will have an adverse impact on our year-over-year financial results expressed in U.S. dollars.  
Specifically, euro and pound average FX rates for the fourth quarter would be down by approximately 5% and 2% respectively as compared to the prior year. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
I highlight that the euro exchange rate we are using as the basis for our Q4 guidance is stronger than the rate of $1.32 per euro that was in effect when most analysts issued their forecasts that are the basis for the consensus estimate for Q4. This move in exchange rates, together with continued strength in the fundamental performance of the business, result in guidance that exceeds analysts' consensus forecast for Q4. 
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 36% to 41%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 5% to 10%. This domestic forecast assumes flat gross bookings for air and double-digit growth for hotel gross bookings. We expect international gross bookings, expressed in U.S. dollars, to grow by 54% to 59%, as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 58% to 63%. 
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for international and domestic hotel ADRs will improve further compared to the increases we experienced in Q3. We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 31% to 36% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 49% to 54%. 
For Q4 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $141 million to $146 million, with about $6 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising.  Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, is assumed to be essentially in line with prior year Q4. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $29 million and $32 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $60.5 million and $63.5 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $21 million to $24 million. We expect information technology costs of about $7 million and depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million. 
We expect total below-the-line negative impact of approximately $6.5 million, which is comprised primarily of foreign exchange hedging loss, net interest expense and a charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts, since the FX rates assumed for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rates that prevailed earlier in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $200 million and $210 million, which at the midpoint represents 54% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.91 to $3.06 per share, which at the midpoint represents 50% growth year-over-year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $43.5 million, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. Our non-GAAP tax rate is increasing as compared to prior year, due to more significant growth in international earnings as compared to domestic earnings.  Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes fully diluted share count of 51.4 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $388.87.
We expect TravelJigsaw to be very slightly accretive to non-GAAP EBITDA and EPS for Q4. Q3 is TravelJigsaw's most significant seasonal quarter from a P&L perspective, as revenue is earned upon completion of summer travel. As for expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS $2.29 to $2.44 per share.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation; acquisition-related amortization, including amortization related to the acquisition of TravelJigsaw; non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount; non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions; certain non-cash income tax expenses; and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements. 
As we have emphasized in recent quarterly earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps, as economic conditions continue to gradually improve. Our Q4 guidance reflects the deceleration we have experienced thus far in the quarter and assumes that we will encounter further deceleration in growth rates as we proceed through the quarter. Our guidance assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general, and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

As we look at the gross profit generated by our entire Airline Ticket business -- and that includes opaque and retail, and the opaque contributes a lot more gross profit dollars than the retail does -- because of the long sustained growth in our hotel business and our international business, that's really become just a much, much smaller part of total gross profit dollars. And so if the gist of the first question is would that somehow be material to us in the financial sense as classically defined by the accountants, the answer to that is clearly no. Having said that, we have, we believe, very good relationships with the airlines, and we certainly have the ability to do innovative things in our connections with the airlines. And I think we provide to the airlines the lowest-cost distribution that they have out there. And I don't believe that operating expense is required to continue to connect with them in ways that are acceptable to the airlines that is going to have any significant impact on our CapEx or anything of that nature. There's an opportunity cost there because, as the IT resources we have dedicated to that product are working on things like back office connections, they're not working on innovation that's customer facing and could ultimately help drive the business to grow faster."

The European market is characterized, especially in Western Europe, by a very large and relatively affluent middle class that spends disposable income on travel. And as a result, that has allowed the businesses we operate in Europe to grow at high rates and become big in a reasonably short period of time. In Asia, the population is huge, much bigger than Europe, if you include China for sure, and the levels of general economic growth are much higher than the general macroeconomic growth in the European markets. So you have the benefit of growing economies. And you also have the benefit of a travel market that's probably growing faster than it is in general in Europe or in North America. I think the destinations are getting more travel from international travelers. And I think that Asian people are traveling more as they become more affluent, as they get jobs in cities and, in the case of China, as it becomes legally permissible to do so when you're able to get a visa. The destinations that are allowable for visas is expanding for the Chinese. And I think that represents a pent-up market demand that, over time, should be very bullish for people in the travel industry in general. So those are all the good things about the Asian market that are a little bit different from Europe. The one thing that I will say about Asia, and this is true for South America as well, is that you don't yet have the emergence of the very, very large affluent middle-class. That's a trend that will happen over many, many years. But it's not there right now. So while the numbers that we gave out earlier in this call are demonstrative of a very attractive business environment in those markets, I don't think that they have the potential to grow as big, as quickly as the European markets and North American markets did in online travel. But they do have, at least in our estimation, the capability of growing to be very large over a long period of time."

So that today, the search engines have the ability to show a consumer almost every hotel in the world basically. That's the nature of how they work. So the question really is not whether the search engines are going to have access to those hotels. It's really a question of how it's displayed and what the model is for advertising. And I think it's certainly possible over time that the search engines could display more information, more content and even try to display current pricing. And I think people on this call know that there are steps being taken by Google to experiment with that. And so the question is how much content do they show and how do they display it? And then how do they use it to support advertising revenues on their websites. And we certainly think that one of the predominant ways that they're doing it today and they'll do in the foreseeable future is to take advertising from online travel agents and use the ability that we have to have superior conversion of that lead, which allows us to pay an attractive price for it, will represent an attractive model for the search engines for some time to come."

And I think that is more representative of the fact that our competition has now fully anniversaried the benefits they got from cutting processing fees, and the growth rates are stepping down a little bit, or it's requiring more investment to maintain higher growth rates. I think that things like airline capacity, which is still under very sort of strict control in terms of growth, has something to do with that. And high airline ticket prices, especially compared to last year, also has an impact on leisure demand. I think all of those factors I just mentioned could be a reason why you've seen a little bit of pressure on airline ticket growth rates. But having said that, I still view and we still view that demand for leisure travel has been reasonably robust.

With respect to hotel counts, Booking.com and Agoda continue to aggressively sign up new hotels. I think for both businesses, a lot of those hotels are in new markets.

I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detailed financial review and then I will sum up. After the prepared portion, we will take questions. 
The Priceline Group, consisting primarily of Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com and TravelJigsaw, reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $4 billion, up 47% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $272 million or $5.33 per share, versus $3.45 the prior year. Third quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $4.97 per share and the high end of our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 27.5 million for the quarter, up 54% year-over-year.
Growth in room night reservations for the International business exceeded our expectations, driving 78% international gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, a sequential increase from 67% in the prior quarter. International gross bookings benefited from strong transaction growth in core Western European and North American markets, an improvement in average daily rates and increasing contribution from high-growth new markets.
I want to provide, on a onetime basis, some data on our progress in new markets to help size their contribution to our international results. Booking.com and Agoda have made excellent progress in building the group's business in the Asia-Pacific region. The combined business of Agoda plus Booking.com's business for APAC destinations was approximately $780 million for the 12 months ended September 30 and the third quarter growth rate for that business was just shy of 150%. 
Booking.com has also made substantial progress in South America. Gross bookings for South American destinations were $96 million for the trailing 12 months, and the third quarter growth rate was in excess of 300%. Further, in both markets, our brands are building point-of-sale businesses, which are of comparable size and growing at impressive rates as well.
For example, Booking.com's point-of-sale business in South America for the same period was $265 million in gross bookings and growing at 133% in Q3. When comparing these results to other online travel agents in the region, keep in mind that these are only hotel reservations, where others may have substantial lower margin airline ticket business in their gross bookings figures. In addition to geographic expansion, growth in hotel inventory and adding results from TravelJigsaw also helped drive strong top line growth in the third quarter.
Booking.com continues to build its supply platform worldwide, with a hotel count of approximately 105,000 hotels in 92 countries. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region, and again reported triple-digit year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. The business has performed well following civil unrest in Thailand and is well positioned for its seasonally important fourth quarter. TravelJigsaw delivered solid growth in rental car unit sales in the quarter, and the sharing of best practices and other integration steps are proceeding well.
Priceline.com's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the third quarter, aided by strong hotel results and a turnaround in the opaque rental car business. The U.S. hotel business benefited from availability of promotional inventory and expansion of Booking.com inventory made available on Priceline.com. When this growth is combined with North American business booked directly on Booking.com, which is a great site for domestic travelers to book international destinations, our North American business is one of the group's fastest-growing core markets.  
Merchant gross bookings increased 41%, as merchant hotel gross bookings, both at Priceline and Agoda and the addition of merchant rental car bookings from TravelJigsaw, offset year-over-year decreases in opaque airline ticket sales, where reduced industry capacity continued to pressure inventory available for opaque discounting. For the group, consolidated operating margins improved during the quarter due to advertising and operating expense efficiencies.
The Priceline Group has sustained high levels of gross bookings growth for the first nine months of this year. We believe the scale of our international hotel network is allowing us to achieve high levels of growth in both core markets, which benefit from our growing ability to tap worldwide demand, and in new markets, where growing hotel inventory is booked by both local and international travelers.  Cyclical improvements in travel demand, evidenced by growing ADRs, has also helped. 
Finally but importantly, we believe hard work and execution by our teams in building supply and content, website innovation, distribution and integration benefits have helped to deliver market-leading growth. 
In summary, the business performed well in the third quarter and continues to show solid demand and pricing trends. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,114994000,86525,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2010",2010-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010. We were presently surprised by our top line results in the quarter, as room night growth acce",1875,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
We were presently surprised by our top line results in the quarter, as room night growth accelerated after we reported our Q3 guidance in early August. Hotel room nights booked grew by 54% in the third quarter versus last year, as compared to the unit growth rate of 48% that we posted in the second quarter.  
The acceleration growth rate in Q3 is certainly somewhat attributable to the negative impact on gross bookings in Q2 caused by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland. We saw strong performance in our key European markets that was likely, to some degree, also helped by diminished concerns over sovereign debt issues. Our continued efforts to improve the user experience on our websites are also a contributing factor. 
Lastly, as Jeff highlighted, our newer markets, like Asia Pacific and South America, continued to grow as a percentage of our business and are therefore having a more pronounced impact on our total growth rate. These markets are growing both from a destination and point-of-sale perspective, as we add new hotels and customers to our network. 
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were also favorable to our assumption for guidance. ADRs were up by about 4% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our domestic hotel service for Q3 2010 compared to prior year third quarter. The strong performance from a unit growth and ADR perspective drove total gross booking dollars to grow by 47% for Q3 compared to prior year.
FX rates for the third quarter were unfavorable to prior year rates and therefore adversely impacted our gross bookings growth expressed in U.S. dollars. The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were down by 10% and 6% respectively in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009.
Our International gross bookings grew by 67% and by 78% on a local currency basis for Q3 2010 compared to the prior year Q3. The local currency growth rate of 78% compares favorably to the 67% local currency growth rate for Q2. TravelJigsaw, the U.K.-based merchant rental car reservation service we acquired in May 2010, contributed $85.8 million in gross bookings in Q3, which is its peak seasonal travel quarter. 
Rental car days booked were up by 97% versus third quarter 2009, including the impact of TravelJigsaw.  Our U.S. rental car service also had a good quarter, with a 23% increase in rental car days helped by continued strong demand and better access to supply for opaque rates.
Airline tickets booked were down by 5% in the quarter, and average airfares weren't up as much as we assumed when we gave guidance. As a result, domestic gross bookings growth of 12% was slightly below our guidance, but the impact on gross profit was negligible. 
In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for guidance, resulting in earnings performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance. Gross profit was $666 million and grew 54% as compared to prior year. 
Our International operations generated gross profit of $530 million and grew by 68% as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our domestic business amounted to $136 million, which represented 16% growth versus prior year and acceleration compared to 14% growth posted in Q2. Total operating expenses were generally in line with guidance. 
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was favorable to the third quarter of 2009, and came in favorable to our guidance, driven by improved advertising efficiency. We recorded below-the-line expense in the quarter of about $11.7 million, which is higher than the $10.5 million of expense we assumed in our guidance. The variance relates mainly to FX hedging losses. 
In summary, non-GAAP EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $363 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $327 million to $337 million, and represents 61% growth versus prior year. EBITDA leverage, or EBITDA expressed as a percentage of gross profit, expanded by 260 basis points in the quarter versus prior year Q3. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $305 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2010, which represents a 57% increase versus prior year. We spent about $4 million on CapEx in the quarter. We issued $122 million of cash in the third quarter to settle debt conversions. This amount was comprised of $50 million of cash to repay debt principal and cash delivered of about $72 million in satisfaction of the conversion premium on the bonds. 
On a year-to-date basis through September 30, the group has generated almost $600 million in cash from operations and raised $575 million of cash from issuing convertible debt in March. We have put over $500 million of this cash to work during the year-to-date period. We used $108 million for acquisitions, including the acquisition of TravelJigsaw. We bought back about $126 million worth of our common stock and used $295 million to retire substantially all of our remaining convertible debt issued in prior years. This included about $100 million paid in cash rather than by issuing common stock to settle conversion premium in excess of principal value. 
As of September 30, our cash and investments of $1.5 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $900 million. We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012. We were pleased to receive an investment-grade rating in October from Standard & Poor's on our 2015 bonds. The rating reflects the company's consistent track record of strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet with reasonable leverage and excellent liquidity. 
Now for fourth quarter 2010 guidance. Our forecast reflects the continued strong performance in hotel room nights booked that we have seen thus far through Q4, and also includes TravelJigsaw. Our forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.40 per euro and $1.62 per British pound as Friday's closing rates. At or near these levels, exchange rates will have an adverse impact on our year-over-year financial results expressed in U.S. dollars.  
Specifically, euro and pound average FX rates for the fourth quarter would be down by approximately 5% and 2% respectively as compared to the prior year. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter net earnings from any further deterioration in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.
I highlight that the euro exchange rate we are using as the basis for our Q4 guidance is stronger than the rate of $1.32 per euro that was in effect when most analysts issued their forecasts that are the basis for the consensus estimate for Q4. This move in exchange rates, together with continued strength in the fundamental performance of the business, result in guidance that exceeds analysts' consensus forecast for Q4. 
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 36% to 41%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 5% to 10%. This domestic forecast assumes flat gross bookings for air and double-digit growth for hotel gross bookings. We expect international gross bookings, expressed in U.S. dollars, to grow by 54% to 59%, as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 58% to 63%. 
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that the rate of year-over-year increase for international and domestic hotel ADRs will improve further compared to the increases we experienced in Q3. We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 31% to 36% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 49% to 54%. 
For Q4 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $141 million to $146 million, with about $6 million of that amount being spent for off-line advertising.  Online advertising expense, as a percentage of gross profit, is assumed to be essentially in line with prior year Q4. We expect sales and marketing expense of between $29 million and $32 million. We expect personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation, to come in between $60.5 million and $63.5 million. We expect G&A expenses of approximately $21 million to $24 million. We expect information technology costs of about $7 million and depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition amortization, of about $5 million. 
We expect total below-the-line negative impact of approximately $6.5 million, which is comprised primarily of foreign exchange hedging loss, net interest expense and a charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to noncontrolling interests. We assume that losses will be incurred on our hedge contracts, since the FX rates assumed for guidance reflect a stronger euro than the rates that prevailed earlier in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP EBITDA is expected to range between $200 million and $210 million, which at the midpoint represents 54% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $2.91 to $3.06 per share, which at the midpoint represents 50% growth year-over-year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately $43.5 million, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We have a sizable NOL to reduce our cash tax liability. Our non-GAAP tax rate is increasing as compared to prior year, due to more significant growth in international earnings as compared to domestic earnings.  Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes fully diluted share count of 51.4 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $388.87.
We expect TravelJigsaw to be very slightly accretive to non-GAAP EBITDA and EPS for Q4. Q3 is TravelJigsaw's most significant seasonal quarter from a P&L perspective, as revenue is earned upon completion of summer travel. As for expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS $2.29 to $2.44 per share.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation; acquisition-related amortization, including amortization related to the acquisition of TravelJigsaw; non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount; non-cash gains or losses related to early debt conversions; certain non-cash income tax expenses; and to include the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. We also intend to adjust non-GAAP results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements. 
As we have emphasized in recent quarterly earnings releases, we believe it is highly likely that we will experience sequential deceleration in quarterly year-on-year unit growth rates in the future due to the sheer size of the business and progressively more difficult comps, as economic conditions continue to gradually improve. Our Q4 guidance reflects the deceleration we have experienced thus far in the quarter and assumes that we will encounter further deceleration in growth rates as we proceed through the quarter. Our guidance assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general, and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments."

And so if the gist of the first question is would that somehow be material to us in the financial sense as classically defined by the accountants, the answer to that is clearly no. Having said that, we have, we believe, very good relationships with the airlines, and we certainly have the ability to do innovative things in our connections with the airlines. And I think we provide to the airlines the lowest-cost distribution that they have out there. And I don't believe that operating expense is required to continue to connect with them in ways that are acceptable to the airlines that is going to have any significant impact on our CapEx or anything of that nature. There's an opportunity cost there because, as the IT resources we have dedicated to that product are working on things like back office connections, they're not working on innovation that's customer facing and could ultimately help drive the business to grow faster."

The European market is characterized, especially in Western Europe, by a very large and relatively affluent middle class that spends disposable income on travel. And as a result, that has allowed the businesses we operate in Europe to grow at high rates and become big in a reasonably short period of time. In Asia, the population is huge, much bigger than Europe, if you include China for sure, and the levels of general economic growth are much higher than the general macroeconomic growth in the European markets. So you have the benefit of growing economies. And you also have the benefit of a travel market that's probably growing faster than it is in general in Europe or in North America. I think the destinations are getting more travel from international travelers. And I think that Asian people are traveling more as they become more affluent, as they get jobs in cities and, in the case of China, as it becomes legally permissible to do so when you're able to get a visa. The destinations that are allowable for visas is expanding for the Chinese. And I think that represents a pent-up market demand that, over time, should be very bullish for people in the travel industry in general. So those are all the good things about the Asian market that are a little bit different from Europe. The one thing that I will say about Asia, and this is true for South America as well, is that you don't yet have the emergence of the very, very large affluent middle-class. That's a trend that will happen over many, many years. But it's not there right now. So while the numbers that we gave out earlier in this call are demonstrative of a very attractive business environment in those markets, I don't think that they have the potential to grow as big, as quickly as the European markets and North American markets did in online travel. But they do have, at least in our estimation, the capability of growing to be very large over a long period of time."

So that today, the search engines have the ability to show a consumer almost every hotel in the world basically. That's the nature of how they work. So the question really is not whether the search engines are going to have access to those hotels. It's really a question of how it's displayed and what the model is for advertising. And I think it's certainly possible over time that the search engines could display more information, more content and even try to display current pricing. And I think people on this call know that there are steps being taken by Google to experiment with that. And so the question is how much content do they show and how do they display it? And then how do they use it to support advertising revenues on their websites. And we certainly think that one of the predominant ways that they're doing it today and they'll do in the foreseeable future is to take advertising from online travel agents and use the ability that we have to have superior conversion of that lead, which allows us to pay an attractive price for it, will represent an attractive model for the search engines for some time to come."

And I think that is more representative of the fact that our competition has now fully anniversaried the benefits they got from cutting processing fees, and the growth rates are stepping down a little bit, or it's requiring more investment to maintain higher growth rates. I think that things like airline capacity, which is still under very sort of strict control in terms of growth, has something to do with that. And high airline ticket prices, especially compared to last year, also has an impact on leisure demand. I think all of those factors I just mentioned could be a reason why you've seen a little bit of pressure on airline ticket growth rates. But having said that, I still view and we still view that demand for leisure travel has been reasonably robust. And if you look at the results of our non-air businesses, they seem to be evidence of that."

I think they have a mixed commitment of resources to try and put their best content forward on metasearch sites. And I think they have mixed policies about to what degree that they're willing to pay. The second thing is that it's still, we believe, is the case that for any given lead that's generated on the metasearch site, it's got a better chance of converting at an online travel agent that has a full selection of hotels, great content, things like user reviews that really aren't available on supplier websites, and customers like shopping and booking on the online travel sites. And I think all of those factors would support a continued significant flow of leads to the online travel sites. Kayak has been very successful in building its metasearch business for airline tickets.

As European occupancy rates keep marching toward historic peak levels, are you seeing any evidence or do you have any concerns that hotels will increasingly be able to take back share of their own inventory with respect to how it's sold? The second question is again on Western Europe. Anecdotally, we look at Booking.com hotel counts versus the competition, and there seems to be a modest growth over the last couple of months. Are you where you want to be in Western Europe with respect to number of hotels signed? And therefore, growth comes from taking more inventory?

And I think our teams around the world do a very good job of that. I've said before, typically as business improves, the hotels continue to try to maximize the scope of their distribution so they can raise rates as aggressively as possible. And we think we have very cost-effective distribution. And we want to have rooms available if there are any rooms available. And I think we do a pretty good job of that. With respect to hotel counts, Booking.com and Agoda continue to aggressively sign up new hotels. I think for both businesses, a lot of those hotels are in new markets. And so if you are looking at the balance of hotels that are being brought online, you might see more coming on in Asia than in the more well-established capital cities and European destinations, where you're getting closer to having most of the hotels that typically would be bookable. Although there's always opportunities to increase your inventory even in markets that are fairly well penetrated. But the company certainly is intending to continue to aggressively sign up hotels.
