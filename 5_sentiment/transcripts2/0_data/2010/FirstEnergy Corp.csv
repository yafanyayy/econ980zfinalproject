I’ll then turn the call over to Anthony for an update on regulatory and operational activities. As I review our results it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community we issued this morning. 
Excluding special items, normalized non-GAAP earnings were $0.81 per share compared to $1.02 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Despite the continued impact of the depressed economic activity and generally milder weather across our region these results are in line with our first quarter expectations. On a GAAP basis earnings were $0.51 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2009. As detailed on page 12 of the consolidated report six special items decreased this year’s GAAP earnings by a total of $0.30 per share. In the first quarter of 2009 a comparable net impact from special items was $0.63 per share. 
I will address the first quarter 2010 special items from largest to smallest. The first of these is a charge of $0.11 per share related to power contract mark to market adjustments. In December we announced we would market certain Ohio Legacy purchase power contracts for 2010 and 2011. For the first quarter of 2010 the adjustment is a charge of $0.09 per share. The additional $0.02 per share relates to a contract with Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council (NOPEC) which was signed after our December analyst meeting. This contract made FES the generation supplier for customers in 123 northeast Ohio communities. As part of that contract, FES agreed to purchase the existing supply for calendar year 2010 from NOPECs former suppliers. 
The second special item in the quarter is $0.08 per share for regulatory charges. We are recognizing a charge for MISO exit fees associated with the move to PJM and also some additional costs the Ohio companies have committed to in the electric security plan stipulation which is currently before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. 
  The third item is the result of an income tax change related to the new healthcare law that is affecting many other U.S. corporations. The law eliminates the deductibility of retiree healthcare costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors. For us, this results in a one-time charge of $0.04 per share. 
Fourth is $0.03 per share related to costs associated with the Allegheny Energy merger. These costs will be expensed as incurred and will continue through the closing of the merger. 
The fifth item is $0.02 per share related to non-core asset sales or impairments which includes charges related to the impairment of gas drilling participation rights associated with certain previously owned Ohio properties and the divestiture of the Sumpter plant in Michigan. The last special item is $0.02 per share impairment associated with nuclear decommissioning trust securities. 
Before I move onto the drivers of this year’s operating results I will provide an overview of distribution deliveries and generation output. While the overall impact on earnings was flat, total distribution deliveries increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher demand in the industrial sector. Higher usage by steel and automotive customers drove a 7% increase in industrial distribution sales. The trough in our industrial sales occurred in May 2009 and through the end of the first quarter sales have continued to trend upward. 
On the residential and commercial side deliveries decreased by 3% and 1% respectively due to mild temperatures. 80 degree days in the first quarter were 7% below last year and 3% below normal. With regard to generation our output was 17.5 million megawatt hours, a reduction of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2009. While nuclear output was up modestly fossil generation was lower due to scheduled outages and the scheduled tie ins from the Sammis air quality control project. 
On page 1 of the consolidated report we highlight the drivers of first quarter results. I will walk through these starting with the positives. First, the net benefit of cost control measures across our business units was $0.06 per share. This resulted from our continued efforts to reduce labor costs and general company-wide cost control measures. Since early last year we have achieved O&M savings of more than $370 million. 
Next, the impact of changes to Ohio rates was $0.08 per share. This includes $0.05 per share from the Ohio Delivery Service improvement rider which into effect in April of 2009 and $0.03 per share related to the distribution rate increase for Ohio Utilities. New rates of Ohio Edison and Toledo Edison were effective on January 23, 2009 while the increase at CEI did not go into effect until May 1, 2009. 
Lower expenses for other post-employment benefits increased earnings by $0.04 per share. We expect to see a reduced benefit to earnings as we move through the remainder of this year. Our pension costs remained essentially flat year-over-year. This is primarily due to a combination of pension contribution and investment returns offset by a reduction in the discount rate. 
Finally, two tax items increased earnings by a total of $0.02 per share. We had lower general taxes primarily related to lower payroll and Ohio kilowatt hour taxes, and a lower effective tax rate reflecting a decrease in after-tax interest expense in 2010 related to uncertain tax positions. 
Now I will move next to commodity margin which reduced earnings by $0.25 per share during the quarter. As I walk through the components of commodity margin it may be helpful for you to refer to the detailed summary of this on page 11 of the consolidated report. That summary provides additional details on megawatt hour volumes that contribute to this earnings driver and hopefully will make the discussion easier to follow. 
The three positive drivers of commodity margin were higher capacity revenues, lower net congestion and transmission line loss expenses at PJM and finally increased FES generation sales which reflects a change in the composition of sales since the first quarter of 2009. Specifically, the higher volume of FES competitive sales along with the sale of renewable energy credits offset a decrease in power sales to our Ohio affiliated utilities. The change in sales mix is consistent with our overall retail strategy. 
Commodity margin was negatively impacted by; lower wholesale sales volume, higher capacity expenses for FES, Met-Ed and Penelec, higher purchase power prices driven by an increase in spot purchases at PJM and increased fuel expenses primarily related to higher prices for nuclear fuel. 
There are three additional items that had a negative impact on first quarter earnings. CEI’s reduced transmission cost recovery margin decreased earnings by a total of $0.12 per share as a result of lower revenues and higher transition cost amortization. Recovery of transitioned revenues for CEI will end in December of 2010. Net financing costs reduced first quarter earnings by $0.02 per share as higher expenses related to our financing activity in the second half of 2009 were partially offset by higher capitalized interest related to construction programs at Sammis and Freemont. Finally, higher depreciation expenses related to incremental property additions decreased earnings by $0.01 per share. 
Despite these negatives and the impact of the soft economy and the mild weather experienced in our region we achieved first quarter results in line with our expectations. With regard to our sales forecast we are taking a conservative outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are revising downward our distribution sales forecast from 110 million megawatt hours to 106 million megawatt hours and are revising our generation output forecast from 80.9 million megawatt hours to 77.1 million megawatt hours. 
As Tony will discuss in more detail we are taking steps early in the year to offset the effects of our revised forecast and as a result of these steps we are affirming our 2010 non-GAAP guidance of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. As we move through the year we expect the distribution of earnings to fall into a more normal annual pattern with stronger year-over results in the third and fourth quarter as compared to the first half. 
Now I will turn it over to Tony.

I will begin with a regulatory update starting with our filing on March 23 at the [PECO] of a stipulated Electric Security Plan (ESP). It was filed as a stipulation of a recommendation and represents a diverse interest of many signatory parties including the staff of the Commission. All public and evidentiary hearings have been completed. 
The new ESP would again use a competitive bidding process to establish generation supply and pricing for the period between June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014 for customers who do not choose alternative suppliers. There would be four separate biding sessions; one each in July of 2010, October 2010, July 2011 and July 2012 combining different contract lengths and customer load amounts. 
While the Commission has indicated it will take additional time to review the filing we are proceeding with preparations for the competitive bidding process as outlined in our filing in anticipation of a decision. The plan also calls for base distribution rates to remain in place through May 31, 2014 and provides for the utilities to recover necessary investments made in the delivery system. This cost recovery mechanism would begin January 1, 2012 when the existing delivery service improvement rider expires. 
On the whole, we believe the plan will result in more certain rate levels for customers and provide for timely recovery of authorized charges while also promoting energy efficiency and economic development and providing support for low income customers. As I mentioned, if we receive approval for the ESP in the near-term the first auction would be held in July of this year. 
Respecting Pennsylvania, in January and March the first two auctions were held to procure power supply for Met-Ed and Penelec’s default service requirements beginning January 2, 2011. The auction secured approximately one-half of the company’s default service requirements for the first five months of that year. The next procurement is planned for May 24th and the fourth auction will be in October. 
The five month generation price for customers will be determined by blending the results of these first four auctions. The May and October auctions will also include deliveries for future periods. FirstEnergy Solutions participated in the January and March auctions and also plans to bid in future procurements. 
In February Penn Power filed for approval of its default service program which details how the company will secure power for delivery to customers from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2013. This will be Penn Power’s third default service program. Under the plan the company will purchase electricity in 50 megawatt tranches for residential and commercial customers beginning in 2011 and continuing through May 2013. The tranches will be purchased for various lengths of time with generation prices calculated based on a blended average by customer class. In addition, 5% of the electricity for residential customers will be purchased on the spot market. 
Industrial customers who chose not to shop will receive an hourly priced service based upon PJM real time energy markets in addition a fixed component for other charges such as for capacity and ancillary services. We expect the Pennsylvania PUC to rule on the plan by November. 
We are also moving forward with the transition of our [Assi] transmission assets into PJM. As we have mentioned the integration into PJM is expected to be complete on June 1, 2011 to coincide with delivery of power under the next competitive generation procurement process for FirstEnergy’s Ohio utility companies and Penn Power. 
We took another step towards integration in March with the successful completion by the Ohio utilities of two fixed resource requirement integration auctions to secure capacity for the period June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2013. The results reflect the market value of capacity resources in the [Assi] footprint starting June 1, 2011. FES sold approximately 9,400 megawatts of capacity in the 2011/2012 auction at a clearing price of about $109 per megawatt day and sold about 9,200 megawatts in the 2012/2013 auction at just over $20 per megawatt day. This week FES will participate in PJM’s annual base residual capacity auction for the period of 2013 and 2014 planning year. 
Moving now to a merger update, as you know we filed our S4 registration statement with the SEC in late March. We are working to finalize our applications for federal regulatory approval in addition to state filings for Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia and expect to make the filings this month. We plan to file with Virginia’s State Corporation Commission later in the second quarter after a decision has been reached regarding the pending sale of Allegheny’s distribution operations in that state. 
Also last month FirstEnergy and Allegheny Energy merger integration teams kicked off their work to determine how best to combine the company’s operations following the completion of the merger. The teams are focused on ensuring a smooth transition and identifying best practices going forward. 
We are pleased with our progress so far and believe we are on target to complete the merger during the first half of 2011. We believe there are important long-term strategic advantages to this merger including the enhanced environmental performance of our combined generating facilities and the potential for earnings growth, a more competitive cost structure and reduced risk. I firmly believe this transaction makes sense for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
With respect to Davis-Besse as you know from our news release yesterday additional testing on the control rod drive mechanism nozzles was completed over the weekend. In total we have identified 24 of 69 nozzles that require modification. The work on 10 of these nozzles is nearing completion while modifications to the remaining 14 are now underway. We expect this work to take several weeks. We will then test the modifications and complete refueling work. The plan is expected to be ready for restart in July. 
On the sales side of our business our retail program remains solidly on track. FirstEnergy solutions has achieved so far 98% of its planned sales  for 2010 and 51% for 2011. We expect 2011 will be filled as future auctions are completed in Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
While we met our first quarter earnings target, 2010 is shaping up to be another challenging year. Although we are pleased to see industrial demand increasing we are not yet seeing the full effects of a robust economic recovery. I have challenged our executive team to continue finding ways to aggressively address the challenges facing the company this year including the extended Davis-Besse outage, lower planned generation output for the year and weaker distribution sales. 
As a part of that effort we will more aggressively restrict hiring and continue to replace external contracts with our own employees where appropriate. Additionally we will continue to realign our capital structure with our financial strategy which includes completing some fixed to variable interest rate swaps. As in the past we intend to continue to seek ways to improve our performance and control our costs as we work through and address the continued impact of the sluggish economy and other challenges on our company. 
We remain committed, however, to successfully executing our strategy and meeting shareholder’s expectations. Now we would be happy to take your questions.

I noticed the increase in volume of your competitive retail sales contributed $1.23 to earnings versus $0.79 corrosion in earnings as a result of the loss in volume in polar sales. The implication seems to be as you have mentioned you are generating a significantly higher margin on the competitive retail sales. I wonder if you could expand on that a little bit because I tend to think of your competitive resale sales as being offered at a discount to the auction price but here you are generating a higher margin apparently.

The Davis-Besse outage for the first quarter was just a scheduled refueling outage. The unexpected outage didn’t occur until April after the quarter. So nuclear generation was actually higher resulting in the higher fuel expense as well as the nuclear rate is higher reflecting the legacy fuel contracts being taken out of or being rolled over to market. 
On the purchase power expense the increase was really attributable to what I call balancing energy purchases in the PJM market. As dilution assumed 100% of the Met-Ed, Penelec polar requirement for this year they had a higher balancing in energy for that higher load obligation as well as their retail activity in the PJM market resulted in higher balancing purchases for the retail load.

I'll start today's call with a review of first quarter results. I'll then turn the call over to Tony for an update on regulatory and operational activities.
As I review our results, it maybe helpful for you to refer to the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community we issued this morning. Excluding special items, normalized non-GAAP earnings were $0.81 per share compared to $1.02 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Despite the continued impact of the depressed economic activity and generally milder weather across our region, these results are in line with our first quarter expectations. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.51 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
As detailed on Page 12 of the consolidated report, six special items decreased this year's GAAP earnings by a total of $0.30 per share. In the first quarter of 2009, the comparable net impact from special items was $0.63 per share. I'll address the first quarter 2010 special items from largest to smallest.
The first of these is a charge of $0.11 per share related to power contract mark-to-market adjustments. In December, we announced that we would be making market certain Ohio legacy purchased power contracts for 2010 and '11. For the first quarter of 2010, the adjustment is a charge of $0.09 per share. The additional $0.02 per share relates to a contract with Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council or NOPEC, which was signed after our December analyst meeting. This contract made FES the generation supplier for customers in 123 Northeast Ohio communities. As part of that contract, FES agreed to purchase the existing supply for calendar year 2010 from NOPEC's former supplier. 
The second special item in the quarter is $0.08 per share for regulatory charges. We are recognizing a charge for MISO exit fees associated with the move to PJM and also some additional cost the Ohio companies have committed to in the Electric Security Plan stipulation, which is currently before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. 
The third item is the result of an income tax change related to the new healthcare law that is affecting many other U.S. corporations. The law eliminates the deductibility of retiree health care cost to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors. For us, this results in a one-time charge of $0.04 per share. 
Fourth is $0.03 per share related to costs associated with the Allegheny Energy merger. These costs will be expensed as incurred and will continue through the closing of the merger. 
The fifth item is $0.02 per share related to non-core asset sales or impairments, which includes charges related to the impairment of gas drilling participation rights associated with certain previously-owned Ohio properties as a divestiture of the Sumpter Plant in Michigan. 
And the last special item is $0.02 per share impairment associated with nuclear decommissioning trust securities.
Before I move on to the drivers of this year's operating results, I'll provide an overview of distribution deliveries and generation output. While the overall impact on earnings was flat, total distribution deliveries increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher demand in the industrial sector. Higher usage by steel and automotive customers drove a 7% increase in Industrial Distribution sales. The trough in our industrial sales occurred in May of 2009 and through the end of the first quarter, sales have continued to trend upward. On the Residential and Commercial side, deliveries decreased by 3% and 1%, respectively, due to mild temperatures. Heating degree days in the first quarter were 7% below last year and 3% below normal.
With regard to generation, our output was 17.5 million MWH [megawatt-hours], a reduction of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2009. While nuclear output was up modestly, fossil generation was lower due to scheduled outages and the scheduled tie-ins for the Sammis air quality control project. 
On Page 1 of the consolidated report, we highlight the drivers of first quarter results. I'll walk through these starting with the positives.
First, the net benefit of cost control measures across our business units was $0.06 per share. This resulted from our continued efforts to reduce labor cost and general company-wide cost control measures. Since early last year, we have achieved O&M savings of more than $370 million. 
Next, the net impact of changes to Ohio rates was $0.08 per share. This includes $0.05 per share from the Ohio delivery service improvement rider, which went into effect in April of 2009 and $0.03 per share related to the distribution rate increase for Ohio utilities. New rates for Ohio Edison and Toledo Edison were effective on January 23, 2009, while the increase at CEI did not go into effect until May 1, 2009.
Lower expenses for other post-employment benefits increased earnings by $0.04 per share. We expect to see a reduced benefit to earnings as we move through the remainder of this year. Our pension costs remain essentially flat year-over-year. This is primarily due to a combination of pension contribution and investment returns, offset by a reduction in the discount rate. 
And finally, two tax items increased earnings by a total of $0.02 per share. We had lower general taxes primarily related to lower payroll and Ohio KWH [kilowatt-hour] taxes and a lower effective tax rate reflecting a decrease in after-tax interest expense in 2010 related to uncertain tax positions.
Now I'll move next to commodity margin, which reduced earnings by $0.25 per share during the quarter. As I walk through the components of commodity margin, it maybe helpful for you to refer to the detailed summary of this on Page 11 of the consolidated report. That summary provides additional details on megawatt-hour volumes that contribute to this earnings driver and hopefully will make the discussion easier to follow. 
The three positive drivers of commodity margin were: higher capacity revenues, lower net congestion and transmission line loss expenses in PJM and finally, increased FES generation sales, which reflects a change in the composition of sales since the first quarter of 2009. Specifically, the higher volume of FES competitive sales, along with the sale of renewable energy credits, offsets a decrease in POLR sales to our Ohio-affiliated utilities. The change in sales mix is consistent with our overall retail strategy.
Commodity margin was negatively impacted by lower wholesale sales volume; higher capacity expenses for FES, Met-Ed [Metropolitan Edison Company] and Penelec [Pennsylvania Edison Company]; higher purchase power prices driven by an increase in spot purchases in PJM; and increased fuel expenses primarily related to higher prices for nuclear fuel. 
There are three additional items that had a negative impact on first quarter earnings. CEI's reduced transmission cost recovery margin decreased earnings by a total of $0.12 per share as a result of lower revenues and higher transition cost amortization. Recovery of transition revenues for CEI will end in December of 2010. Net financing cost reduced first quarter earnings by $0.02 per share as higher expenses related to our financing activity in the second half of 2009 were partially offset by higher capitalized interest related to construction programs at Sammis and Fremont. And finally, higher depreciation expenses related to incremental property additions decreased earnings by $0.01 per share. 
Despite these negatives and the impact of the soft economy, and the mild weather experienced in our region, we achieved first quarter results in line with our expectation. With regard to our sales forecast, we are taking a conservative outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are revising downward our distribution sales forecast from 110 million MWH to 106 million MWH and revising our generation output forecast from 80.9 megawatt-hours to 77.1 million-megawatt hours.
As Tony will discuss in more detail, we are taking steps early in the year to offset the effects of our revised forecast. And as a result of these steps, we are affirming our 2010 non-GAAP guidance of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. As we move through the year, we expect the distribution of earnings to fall into a more normal annual pattern with stronger year-over results in the third and fourth quarter as compared to the first half. Now I'll turn it over to Tony."

I'll begin with a regulatory update starting with our filing on March 23 at the PECO of a stipulated Electric Security Plan or ESP. It was filed as a stipulation of a recommendation and represents a diverse interest of many signatory parties including the staff of the commission. All public and evidentiary hearings have been completed. The newest ESP would again use a competitive bidding process to establish generation supply and pricing for the period between June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014 for customers who do not choose alternative suppliers. There would be four separate bidding sessions. One each in July of 2010, October 2010, July 2011 and July 2012, combining different contract lengths and customer load amounts.
While the commission has indicated it will take additional time to review the filing, we are proceeding with preparations for the competitive bidding process as outlined in our filing in anticipation of a decision. The plan also calls for base distribution rates to remain in place through May 31, 2014 and provides for the utilities to recover necessary investments made in the delivery system. This cost recovery mechanism would begin January 1, 2012 when the existing delivery service improvement rider expires.
On the whole, we believe the plan will real result in more certain rate levels for customers and provide for timely recovery of authorized charges. We're also promoting energy efficiency and economic development and providing support for low-income customers. As I mentioned, if we receive approval for the ESP in the near term, the first option would be held in July of this year. 
Respecting Pennsylvania, in January and March, the first two auctions were held to procure power supply for Met-Ed and Penelec's default service requirements beginning January 1, 2011. The auction secured approximately one half of the company's default service requirements for the first five months of that year. The next procurement is planned for May 24 and the fourth auction will be in October. The five-month generation price for customers will be determined by blending the results of these first four auctions. The May and October auctions will also include deliveries for future periods.
FirstEnergy Solutions participated in the January and March auctions and also plans to bid in future procurements. In February, Penn Power filed for approval of its Default Service Program, which details how the company will secure power for delivery to customers from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2013. This will be Penn Power's third default service program. Under the plan, the company will purchase electricity in 50 MW [megawatt] tranches for residential and commercial customers beginning in January 2011 and continuing through May 2013. The tranches will be purchased for various lengths of time with generation prices calculated based on a blended average by customer class. In addition, 5% of the electricity for residential customers will be purchased on the spot market.
Industrial customers who choose not to shop would receive an hourly priced service based upon PJM realtime energy markets in addition to a fixed component for other charges, such as for capacity and ancillary services. We expect the Pennsylvania PUC [Public Utility Commission] to rule on the plan by November.
We are also moving forward with the transition of our ATSI transmission assets into PJM. As we've mentioned, the integration into PJM is expected to be complete on June 4, 2011, to coincide with delivery of power under the next competitive generation procurement process for FirstEnergy's Ohio utility companies and Penn Power. We took another step towards integration in March with the successful completion by the Ohio utilities of two fixed-resource requirement integration auctions to secure capacity for the period June 1, 2011, through May 31, 2013. The results reflect the market value of capacity resources in the ATSI footprint starting June 1 of '11. FES sold approximately 9,400 MW of capacity in the 2011-2012 auction at a clearing price of about $109 per MW day and sold about 9,200 MW in the 2012-2013 auction at just over $20 per MW day. This week, FES will participate in PJM's annual base residual capacity auction for the period 2013 and '14 planning year.
Moving now to a merger update. As you know, we filed our S-4 registration statement with the SEC in late March. We are working to finalize our applications for federal regulatory approval, in addition to state filings for Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia and expect to make the filings this month. We plan to file with Virginia State Corporation Commission later in the second quarter after a decision has been reached regarding the pending sale of Allegheny's distribution operations in that state. 
Also last month, FirstEnergy and Allegheny Energy merger integration teams kicked off their work to determine how best to combine the company's operations following completion of the merger. Teams are focused on ensuring a smooth transition and identifying best practices going forward. We are pleased with our progress so far and believe we are on target to complete the merger during the first half of 2011. We believe there are important long-term strategic advantages to this merger including the enhanced environmental performance of our combined generating facilities and the potential for earnings growth, a more competitive cost structure and reduced risk. I firmly believe this transaction makes sense for our shareholders, customers and employees.
With respect to Davis-Besse, as you know from our news release yesterday, additional testing on the control rod drive mechanism nozzles was completed over the weekend. In total, we have identified 24 of 69 nozzles that require a modification. The work on 10 of these nozzles is nearing completion while modifications to the remaining 14 are now underway. We expect this work to take several weeks. We will then test the modifications and complete refueling work. The plan is expected to be ready for restart in July.
On the Sales side of our business, our retail program remains solidly on track. FirstEnergy Solutions has achieved so far 98% of its planned sales for 2010 and 51% for 2011. We expect 2011 will be filled as future auctions are completed in Pennsylvania and Ohio. While we met our first quarter earnings target, 2010 is shaping up to be another challenging year. Although we are pleased to see industrial demand increasing, we are not yet seeing the full effects of a robust economic recovery. I've challenged our executive team to continue finding ways to aggressively address the challenges facing the company this year, including the extended Davis-Besse outage, lower planned generation output for the year and weaker distribution sales. As a part of that effort, we will more aggressively restrict hiring and continue to replace external contracts with our own employees where appropriate. 
Additionally, we will continue to realign our capital structure with our financial strategy, which includes completing some fixed to variable interest rate swaps. As in the past, we intend to continue to seek ways to improve our performance and control our costs as we work through and address the continued impact of the sluggish economy and other challenges on our company. We remain committed however to successfully executing our strategy and meeting shareholders' expectations. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions."

The Davis-Besse outage for the first quarter was just a scheduled refueling outage. The unexpected outage didn't occur until in April after the quarter. So nuclear generation was actually higher resulting in the higher fuel expense as well as the nuclear rate is higher, reflecting the legacy fuel contracts being taken out of quarter or being rolled over to market. On the purchased power expense, the increase was really attributable to what I call balancing energy purchases in the PJM market as dilutions assumed 100% on the Met-Ed, Penelec, POLR requirements for this year. They had a higher balancing energy for that higher load obligation, as well as their retail activity in the PJM market resulted in higher balancing purchases for the retail load."

This morning we reported solid second quarter results. We are particularly encouraged to see steadily improving economic activity particularly with regard to industrial deliveries and strong results in our retail",1772,"Thanks, Irene and good afternoon everyone. This morning we reported solid second quarter results. We are particularly encouraged to see steadily improving economic activity particularly with regard to industrial deliveries and strong results in our retail business, which are exceeding our expectations.
As I walk through our results it maybe helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community we issued this morning. Later Tony will provide information about regulatory and operational activities as well as an update on the Allegheny Energy merger.
Excluding special items, normalized non-GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share, compared to $0.87 per share in the second quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, this quarter’s earnings were $0.87 per share compared to $1.36 per share last year.
As detailed on page 16 of the consolidated report, four special items increased this quarter’s GAAP earnings by a total of $0.05 per share. By comparison, special items added $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
The first of the 2010 special items was a gain of $0.07 per share related to power contract, mark-to-market adjustments of certain legacy purchase power contracts. These contracts representing a total of 500 megawatts were entered into in 2008 for delivering in Ohio in 2010 and 2011. They were mark-to-market beginning in December of 2009.
Last month, FirstEnergy Solutions entered into offsetting financial transactions to these contracts. The new transactions will eliminate the volatility in GAAP earnings associated with marking these contracts to market through the end of 2011.
The second special item was $0.01 per share benefit as a result of court approval of the labor settlement for JCP&L dating back to 2002. The third special item was $0.02 per share impairment associated with nuclear decommissioning trusts securities. Finally, we had a charge of $0.01 per share related to costs associated with the Allegheny Energy merger. Similar to the first quarter, merger-related costs will continue to be expensed as incurred.
On page one of the consolidated report, we highlight the major drivers of second quarter results. I’ll walk through these starting with the positives. First, an 8% increase in distribution deliveries benefited earnings by $0.07 per share. The majority of this increase reflects the stronger economy with warmer weather providing a moderate uplift.
In the industrial sector, distribution deliveries increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2009 largely due to higher usage by steel and automotive customers. Through the first six months of 2010, industrial deliveries were 10% higher than the first half of 2009.
This positive trend continued in July with industrial kilowatt-hour deliveries up 16% compared to the same period of 2009. This represents the fifth consecutive month of double-digit industrial sales growth on a year-over-year basis. While we are encouraged by this steady monthly growth, it is important to note that industrial deliveries remained about 10% below 2008 pre-recession levels, although this gap continues to decline.
Residential deliveries increased by 7% in the quarter and commercial deliveries were up 5%. Cooling degree days were up this quarter compared to the extremely mild weather experienced in the second quarter of 2009 and up versus normal. Heating degree days early in the quarter were below normal, so somewhat of a mixed bag with respect to weather.
On our first quarter call, I indicated that we were taking a conservative outlook on our distribution sales forecast for the remainder of 2010. Through the end of the second quarter, we were slightly ahead of that lower revised target, thanks in large part to the continuing industrial recovery in the past months, particularly in Ohio.
The second positive earnings driver this quarter was a lower effect of income tax rate that increased earnings by $0.05 per share, a result of favorably resolving former uncertain legacy tax positions.
Third, an increase in capitalized interest related to construction programs increased earnings by $0.01 per share. As you know, our $1.8 billion AQC environmental construction program at our Sammis Plant is winding down at the end of this year, as is construction at our Fremont facility, and the invested dollars will be transferred to plant and service. With the completion of this project, the capitalized interest benefit will end and depreciation will begin.
Interest expense in the second quarter of 2010 was essentially flat compared to the same period last year. Higher interest costs associated with our financing activities in the second half of 2009 were offset by lower short-term debt expense and the favorable impacts from interest rate swap transactions we executed during the second quarter. The interest rate swaps outstanding at the end of the quarter were terminated in early July.
Finally, three items each increased earnings by $0.01 per share. The CEI distribution rate increase, which was implemented on May 1, 2009, higher nuclear decommissioning trust income and lower general taxes primarily due to recent settlement of tax issues in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Moving to items that had a negative impact on second quarter earnings. Lower transition cost recovery margin in CEI reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. Transition recovery for CEI will end in December.
Higher O&M expenses reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. This consists of several plusses and minuses. Starting with the negative; there was an impact to general O&M of $0.12 per share principally from two items related to employee benefits.
First, in 2009, second quarter O&M expenses benefited from reduced liabilities associated with changes to an employee non-health care benefit program. Second, we recorded a higher level of accruals for performance incentives this quarter, which were not achieved through the second quarter of 2009.
If we fall below our financial and operational targets later this year, some or all of these accruals will be reversed in the second half of 2010. Partially offsetting these negative factors were lower nuclear O&M expense was $0.06 per share. We had one outage in the second quarter of 2010 compared to two refueling outages during the same period last year.
While there was an extended outage at Davis-Besse about $40 million of the costs related to reactor head modifications were recorded as capital with the second quarter O&M impact of $5 million. The cost of the Davis-Besse outages really show up us as an opportunity cost and lost wholesale opportunities reflected in our commodity margin, which I will discuss in a moment.
Finally, pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits increased earnings by $0.04 per share. This is primarily related to changes we made last year to our healthcare plan; we expect a slightly smaller comparative earnings impact in both the third and the fourth quarter.
I’d like to now turn to commodity margin, which reduced second quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. I’ll note that the extended Davis-Besse outage accounted for approximately $0.07 per share of the $0.09. This includes the impact of lost wholesale opportunities and increased fuel expenses related to higher utilization of our fossil plants.
A detailed summary of this item appears on the first three pages of the consolidated report, including additional information of megawatt hour volumes in prices. The good news within the commodity margin story is the FES generation sales were up 20% compared to last year, as we continue to implement our retail strategy and in Ohio, shifted customers into longer-term contracts.
These direct sales and government aggregation efforts in Ohio have achieved strong results. As we switch customers over to these two channels, our overall POLR obligation and shopping risk is reduced. In addition, we posted solid results from our direct sales efforts and we are ahead of our goals in all of the new market sales territories we’ve targeted.
Year-over-year, excluding sales to our Ohio affiliates, our retail sales have more than doubled on an annualized basis. For 2010, this represents approximately 12 million megawatt-hours in direct sales. Generation output for the quarter was up more than 2,500 megawatts for our fossil fleet and nearly 450 megawatt-hours for our nuclear fleets.
As I mentioned previously, we had two nuclear outages in the second quarter last year, so even with the extended outage work at Davis-Besse this year, nuclear output increased year-over-year. The negative drivers of commodity margin included higher fuel expenses related to the overall increase in generation output, as well as nuclear fuel prices.
Higher capacity expenses for FES, Met-Ed and Penelec associated with serving the Med-Ed and Penelec POLR load during this last year was their transition period.
Lower FES wholesale sales volumes and an increase in purchase power prices, primarily in the PJM spot market, which offset an overall reduction in power purchases. Again, the extended Davis-Besse outage accounted for approximately $0.07 per share of the $0.09 decrease in commodity margin.
Overall, our second quarter results were in line with our expectations and our plan for earnings and free cash flows remain on track for the remainder of the year. We were conservative with our distribution sales outlook in May. However, during the last few months, we have run slightly ahead of that revised lower forecast due to stronger than expected industrial sales recovery, solid results from our retail group.
Additionally, we’ve benefited from lower interest rate expense and the resolution of some outstanding tax issues, as well as our continued success with holding down O&M costs. As you would expect, there are a myriad of items that may influence the second half of this year. Before I start the second half of this year, we’ll be much more comparable to the second half of 2009 with the transition in Ohio starting essentially on June 1, 2009.
Back to 2010 second half; the largest drivers are likely to include increased opportunity sales with our base-load generating fleet at full strength particularly our nuclear units. In addition, recent wholesale market conditions have been favorable and we expect year-over-year improvements in price. We also anticipate a continuation of the strong results from our retail team.
Other factors include our expectations that interest rates will remain low for the balance of the year, and that we will receive a slight benefit from pension and OPEB. Of course, we will continue our concerted efforts to resolve tax issues where appropriate. Finally, we will continue to be opportunistic with the management of our O&M expense. For example, limiting any staff increases in the anticipation of the merger.
Taking into account our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our 2010 non-GAAP guidance to the upper end of our previous range from $3.50 per share to $3.70 per share and we are changing that to $3.60 per share to $3.70 per share.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Tony.

293515,109950301,71826,"FirstEnergy Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","FirstEnergy Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon. Let me start by saying that I am pleased with the overall results of the Company during the second quarter and through the first half of this year. Our transition to the competitive generation market is on track and we ar",1202,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon. Let me start by saying that I am pleased with the overall results of the Company during the second quarter and through the first half of this year. Our transition to the competitive generation market is on track and we are building a strong base to grow this business in the future.
Our generation and utility operations remain solid, and even though we faced some issues with our generation fleet, I am very proud of the team’s performance and their ability to address and deal with the challenges we faced.
I’m also pleased with the progress we’ve made on the Electric Security Plan in Ohio and on the Allegheny merger. In both cases, we are positioning the Company to be successful in the future and more capable of delivering increased shareholder value.
While this year is certainly without its challenges, especially from the continuing impact of the economy within our service area, we are seeing improvements that will allow for greater opportunities in the future.
Now let me move on to an update on the Electric Security Plan that we filed on March 23. Since our original filing, our Ohio electric utility distribution companies have submitted two Supplemental Stipulations, adding the support of additional parties, including the City of Akron and the Council of Smaller Enterprises, as well as NOPEC and NOAC, the electric aggregation groups here in the State of Ohio.
These governmental aggregation groups represent nearly 600,000 customers of our utility companies. These parties joined the original 15 signatory parties that supported the ESP, including the City of Cleveland, the Staff of the PUCO, and a number of manufacturing, education, hospital and consumer groups.
The proposed ESP would again use a competitive bidding process to establish generation supply and pricing for the period from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014 for customers who do not choose alternative suppliers. Depending on when we receive approval we can conduct the initial auction as early as October.
We continue to believe the plan will result in more certain rate levels for customers and provide for timely recovery of authorized charges. At the same time, it would promote energy efficiency and economic development and provide support for low-income customers. It’s a good overall plan, and we anticipate a PUCO decision in the near term.
Respecting the Met-Ed and Penelec procurement process, in May we participated in the third of four procurements from Met-Ed and Penelec Default Power Supply for the five-month period beginning January 1, 2011. The fourth auction is scheduled for October.
The May procurement was also the first of four auctions to procure 24-month residential and 12-month commercial default service requirements for the period beginning June 1 of 2011. The remaining three auctions for these products will be conducted this October and in January and March of 2011.
FES participated in each of the three auctions and also plans to participate in the remaining procurements as we continue to fill our book of business for 2011 and beyond.
On the operation side of the house, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant returned to service on June 29, following an outage that included work to modify a number of control rod drive nozzles, to ensure there are structural integrity and the continued safe and reliable operations of the plant.
Davis-Besse’s next plant outage is scheduled for the fall of 2011 when we plan to install a new reactor head and an integrated head upgrade, including new control rod drive mechanisms. The new head has been manufactured with nozzles made of materials less susceptible to primary water stress corrosion cracking and is expected to arrive at Davis-Besse later this year. It will then undergo preparation for installation, including a series of pre-service inspections.
Turning now to environmental matters, as you know, the USEPA last month issued a proposed rule to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule with the new rule with an implementation date starting January of 2012. We also understand that the EPA expects to issue proposed rules addressing mercury and other power plant emissions in the near future.
We are currently accessing the impact of these and other factors may have on our facilities, particularly the operation of our smaller non-supercritical units. For example, we may decide to idle certain of these units or operate them on a seasonal basis until we have greater clarity concerning the full extent of our environmental requirements.
Finally, I’d like to spend a few moments on our merger with Allegheny Energy. As you know, our S4 registration statement was declared effective by the SEC last month. Shareholders of both FirstEnergy and Allegheny Energy will have the opportunity to vote on the merger at separate special meetings scheduled for September 14.
On the regulatory front, we have filed our applications with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state commissions in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. Procedural schedules have been established for each of these state proceedings.
For example, the Pennsylvania PUC is holding its public hearings today. And even though the Department of Justice has requested more information related to our Hart-Scott-Rodino filings, which will extend the HRS at waiting period, we remain on track to complete the merger during the first half of 2011.
The FirstEnergy and Allegheny merger integration teams are also continuing their work to determine how to best combine the Company’s operations following completion of the merger. Their efforts are laying the groundwork for how the combine company will operate on its first day as a new FirstEnergy, how the integration will proceed in the first 100 days thereafter, and what the company will look like in the long-term. The teams are focused on ensuring a smooth transition and identifying best practices going forward.
We continue to believe that the benefits of this combination will be realized and expect the merger to be accretive to earnings in the first full year after closing. But there is still much work to do. I’d like to spend a few moments providing a few detailed examples.
On the operational side, our teams have identified numerous post-merger opportunities to increase the utilization of Allegheny’s supercritical fleet and we are confident in our ability to capitalize on FirstEnergy’s operational excellence and our experience in competitive markets to create value within an optimized combined fleet.
We’ve also developed a greater appreciation for the value of Allegheny’s transmission system and the opportunities for growth in the transmission business.
In addition, the sheer size of the combined generation fleet, which would nearly double our annual coal procurement requirements, will enable us to take advantage of economies of scale and the increased fuel-blending opportunities across the combined fleet to further create value.
I want to emphasize that the benefits of this merger are real. Now I am committed to achieving the value that this natural combination has the potential to bring for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
As I said earlier, the shareholder vote on the merger is scheduled for next month. I am asking for your continued support in helping us build a stronger Company and one better positioned for success in the future.
Now, I’ll be happy to take your questions.

Another item embedded in the commodity margin is the capacity expense associated with solutions providing capacity and energy to Met-Ed and Penelec during the last year of the transition period at those two companies and there was a price increase, June 1 I believe, the capacity prices changed, which was the negative contributor to the commodity margins.

We’ve put these on before and we’ve typically led them run their course. However, we have a pretty robust policy here where when the market starts moving, Bill Byrd and I and Mark look at that very closely and it was our determination when these swaps move very economically in our favor. We thought it would be best to take them off, take the cash and realize that economic benefit over the underlying swaps.
We did that the first time and then the market moved back pretty much where we were when we originally put on the first swaps. So we decided to do it again and we went through our same process and the market moved down rather quickly and we made the same decision to take that economic benefit, take the cash and amortize that gain over the life of the underlying swap.

So the first competitive and largest competitive advantage we have is just simply the fact that we can source it from our generation plants. Second is that we can tailor the contract pretty much to the term that the customer wants. We’re not dependent on the wholesale market to do that. The last advantage that we have is that we have long-term relationships with these customers particularly in Ohio and they have been good relationships.

This morning we reported strong third quarter results that on a non-GAAP basis represented an increase over the third quarter of 2009. Like many of our peers in the region, unusually warm weather and the corresponding higher distribution deliveries had a positive impact on third quarter results.
However, as we review the numbers, the biggest driver of our strong quarter was the success of our retail strategy, as we continued to move competitive customers away from POLR and into direct sales and government aggregation channels. We are not just selling more megawatt hours but reducing shopping risk, as well as enhancing our flexibility to structure favorable contracts and our opportunity to maximize our margins.
As I walk through our results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community we issued this morning. Later, Tony will update you on the merger, the status of the recent POLR auction in Ohio, and outline information on some of the factors that we expect to impact earnings in 2011.
Excluding special items, normalized non-GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.28 per share compared to $1.11 per share in the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, this quarter’s earnings were $0.59 per share compared to $0.77 per share last year.
As detailed on page 16 of the consolidated report, four special items decreased this quarter’s GAAP earnings by a total of $0.69 per share. By comparison, special items reduced GAAP earnings by $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
The first of the 2010 special items was $0.60 per share impairment as a result of the operational changes we recently announced regarding several of our smaller coal-fired plants. These changes will provide us with operational flexibility and cost savings that we expect to bring long-term benefits. The second special item was $0.04 per share charge related to merger transaction cost.
As in prior quarter, these costs will continue to be expensed as incurred. Third was $0.03 per share charge related to power contract mark-to-market adjustments of certain wholesale power contracts. Finally, $0.02 per share related to charges resulting from our new stipulated electric security plan in Ohio.
I’d like to quickly outline the key drivers of our third quarter non-GAAP results, starting with the positives. First, a 12% increase in overall distribution deliveries benefited earnings by $0.17 per share. Residential usage was at its highest level in nearly a decade and 19% above the third quarter of 2009, a quarter with record low usage dating back to 2002. This significant increase was largely related to warmer than normal summer temperatures across our service area and the resulting higher air conditioning usage.
Industrial deliveries were up 11%, primarily related to higher usage by steel and automotive manufacturers, many of which had idle facilities for some portion of the third quarter last year. With this result, our industrial customer sector has recorded year-to-date double-digit sales increases for the entire nine-month period of 2010.
Commercial deliveries were 5% higher than the previous period. Year-to-date, we remain slightly ahead of our 2010 forecast of 106 million megawatt hours. While these results are an encouraging sign that the economy continues to recover, we expect overall distribution deliveries to remain below 2007 and 2008 levels at least through next year.
The second positive earnings driver this quarter was commodity margin, which increased earnings by $0.19 per share. A detailed summary of this item appears on the first three pages of the consolidated report, including additional information on megawatt hour volumes and prices.
As I mentioned, our competitive sales strategy focuses on direct sales and government aggregation and our efforts in these areas continue to drive our success. For the quarter, sales by our FirstEnergy Solutions subsidiary were 6.3 million megawatt hours above last year’s period, a 45% increase.
About one-third of our growth in the third quarter came from sales outside our utility service territories and nearly half of our direct sales came from outside our Ohio franchise area. We are encouraged by these signs, their continued positive direction and the overall strong performance of our retail group.
FES also has been successfully adding retail generation customers inside FirstEnergy’s utility service territories, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in wholesale sales. Again, we want to put less emphasis on POLR sales and focus more on direct and government aggregation channels where there is lower risk, flexibility to stagger contracts and greater potential to maximize our margins.
We’re continuing to expand into new markets outside our traditional utility service territories and have acquired customers in Southern Ohio as well as markets opening up in Pennsylvania.
For the quarter, wholesale business was down 1 million megawatt hours or 26%. Generation output for the quarter was 19% above the prior year quarter or 3.4 million megawatt hours. The majority of this increase came from our fossil units. With increased generation output and higher sales levels, we also incurred higher fuel and purchase power expenses.
The third key driver to earnings this quarter was $0.12 per share shift in benefit related to lower operation and maintenance costs. This reflects changes in employee benefit costs, including additional cost recognized for incentive compensation and salary restoration in the third quarter of 2009, collectively resulting in a $0.10 per share increased earnings.
It is important to note that while there was an earnings benefit related to timing differences for incentive compensation accruals this quarter compared with 2009, on a year-to-date basis, these costs are not significantly different. Similar to 2009, these accruals will be reversed if incentive targets are not met.
Reduced operating expenses, primarily at our utilities, contributed an additional $0.02 per share to earnings in the third quarter of 2010. Finally, net financing cost reductions increased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Moving to the items that had a negative impact on the third quarter earnings comparison, lower investment income from nuclear decommissioning trusts reduced earnings by $0.25 per share compared with the prior year quarter. When we realized a significant gain from the sale of securities held in trust, these sales facilitated our strategy to re-position our assets to limit volatility risk.
A higher effective income tax rate decreased earnings by $0.06 per share and higher kilowatt hour excise and gross receipt taxes this year reduced earnings by $0.03 per share.
As you can see, while weather certainly benefit our earnings for the third quarter of 2010, this positive was more than offset by reductions related to non-operational items, such as nuclear decommissioning trust and taxes.
As I mentioned at the start, our strong third quarter results reflect the gains we’ve seen from our competitive retail sales efforts with their continued expansion in the non-franchise areas as well as the shift of their customers from POLR to direct sales in aggregation.
Finally, our available liquidity of $2.8 billion is approximately $500 million higher than this time last year. Taken together, our results continue to track our expectations. As a result, we are affirming out 2010 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 per share.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Tony.

Thank you for joining us today. I’d like to provide an update on the progress of our proposed merger with Allegheny Energy and some of the auction activities we’ve seen over the past few weeks.
Because we expect our merger to close in the first half of 2011, we will not be providing earnings guidance in December as has been our past practice. To help in your analysis in the meantime, we have included a list of key earning drivers for 2011 beginning on page 17 of today’s consolidated report, and I will also discuss those as well.
We will have additional information at next week’s EEI Financial Conference. Once the merger closes, we will schedule a meeting to discuss 2011, as well as more details on projected merger synergies and then issue expectations for 2012.
Let’s start with our merger update. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making towards completion of the merger. Since our last call, we reached a settlement agreement with 18 parties to our Pennsylvania proceeding. This agreement provides additional benefits related to jobs, competition, service reliability, and renewable energy.
We are pleased to have addressed all of the issues raised by these interveners and as a result have their support for our transaction. The settlement is subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Commission, which continues its review of the case.
Maryland begins its merger hearings next week and West Virginia, the following week. While these are the only states where regulatory approval is required, Ohio has agreed as a part of our ESP order that it will not assert jurisdiction over the merger process. We continue to provide information to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to keep them updated.
On the federal side, we provided the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with additional information for their review and continue to provide information to the Department of Justice. We expect these reviews to be completed in sufficient time to meet the anticipated merger closing schedule.
As you know, the merger has received overwhelming support of both companies’ shareholders. We believe our progress in securing the necessary approvals underscores the value this merger can deliver to our shareholders and other stakeholders.
As we worked through the merger approval process, teams of employees from both companies continue working to outline how our two organizations will come together. Through this integration process, we will identify best practices for the new organization and develop the implementation plans to capture the benefits of the merger.
Some examples include, consolidation of contractor services and material purchases, operating a single IT infrastructure and data center, and other economies of scale, particularly in our generating fleet that could produce new revenue opportunities as well. The merger process remains on track and we continue to expect to close in the first-half of 2011.
As I mentioned, we received approval in August from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for our stipulated electric security plan. The plan was supported by more than 20 different parties representing customers and communities in our service territory.
We’re pleased to have the ESP finalized and are working to implement its terms, including the competitive bidding process. Last week, our Ohio utilities conducted the first in a series of auctions to secure generation for the 2011 through 2014 timeframe.
As you may know, the PUCL released the results on Friday. FirstEnergy Solutions was one of four successful bidders for a total of 20 out of 50 tranches across the three different auction products.
FES won 10 one-year tranches, seven two-year tranches and three three-year tranches. Overall, we’re pleased with these results. Another auction will be held in January and the results of that auction will be blended with those from last week’s auction to determine retail generation service prices for June 1, 2011, through May 31, 2012.
From a competitive generation standpoint, we are on a very different situation today then we were in the spring of 2009 when our generation position was fully opened beginning June 1. We won 51% of the tranches in that auction and today serve directly or indirectly an additional 26% of the auction load. Since then, we have continued executing our competitive strategy and lining up customers for our generating capacity. Currently, FirstEnergy Solutions has 1.2 million retail customers.
Going into last week’s procurement we had more than 76% of our 2011 generation output committed to direct sales, government aggregation, and POLR auctions.
Also, as Mark outlined, we continue to make progress securing customers in non-franchise areas, and importantly, moving customers from POLR service to direct sales. As a result, FirstEnergy Solutions is considerably less sensitive to the Ohio POLR procurement process and continues to participate in other auctions taking place in the region, further increasing opportunities to sell its power.
Most importantly, with the Ohio transition completed, we have built a strong foundation for our competitive retail business, and this includes out focus on direct sales and government aggregation.
Last week, we also completed the default service process to establish prices for Med-Ed and Penelec customers for the first five months of next year. Prices from the final bidding process will be blended with the results of previous auctions and establish the default service price beginning January 1, 2011.
As I mentioned earlier, we will not be providing 2011 earnings guidance until after the merger with Allegheny Energy closes. However, I’d like to provide some thoughts on several key earnings drivers for next year. It may be helpful to refer to pages 17 through 19 in the consolidated record as I go through these.
As I look at 2011, it’s important to recognize that the company is still in the transition to competitive markets in building its retail platform. While there are a lot of moving parts, there’s a major change in our business next year as a result of the POLR obligation in Pennsylvania being replaced with the competitive market.
So, in order to get a baseline, we started by isolating the Pennsylvania POLR sales of about 29 million megawatt hours in 2010 and the PJM purchases made to support those sales about 20 million megawatt hours, which will no longer be a part of our cost structure starting in 2011. And then we looked at the drivers of 2011 performance without those sales and costs.
As you can see, we expect our retail sales to improve as a result of expected continued growth in this part of our business and somewhat higher pricing in 2011. This will be offset by expected higher RTO cost and higher retail expenses, which are primarily related to increases in our sales force and back office expenditures.
Additionally, we expect higher purchased power costs in 2011, primarily for balancing and to cover a portion of the reduced generation from our own fleet. Fuel costs are expected to be slightly positive, again, due to the reduced generation, even though we will experience some price adjustments. We also expect that Signal Peak may provide some uplift in 2011 to offset what otherwise would be additional costs.
Our plans for next year, as I’ve indicated, assume that generation output will be about 70.2 million megawatt hours, which is down about 6% from our 2010 forecast of 74.6 million megawatt hours. This reduction is partly driven by the outage scheduled at Davis-Besse as well as changes to the in-service date at Fremont and the operations of our older coal-fired fleet, which we anticipate to be in a seasonal or idle status during the year.
This drop in production essentially impacts each of the drivers I’ve mentioned, either positively through lower fuel costs, or negatively through lower sales. However, since we have the ability to increase production, if economic conditions or additional sales warrant, we are positioned to take advantage of those opportunities should they arise.
On the distribution side of our business, we are forecasting 2011 distribution deliveries at about 107 million megawatt hours. This takes into account normal weather, but we’ve also provided a range that reflects different levels of economic recovery.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which is significantly below the current year, as we wind down our large construction projects at Sammis and Fremont. Of course, we already have incurred most of the capital costs for the Fremont project, the extended completion is not expected to add significantly to the capital budget.
The capital plan reflects about $100 million for mandatory transmission in energy efficiency project and costs related to the accelerated replacement of the Davis-Besse reactor head, which will add approximately $90 million to the budget.
Based on our current estimates for 2011, we expect to deliver free cash flow of more than $500 million. As you know, our Board of Directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis. It is our expectation and goal to maintain the dividend at its current level. Following the closing of the merger; we plan to develop a more formal dividend policy that will provide stability, sustainability and growth for shareholders in all market conditions.
I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI Financial Conference. Now, we’ll be happy to take your questions.

So, that’s a piece we have less control over.
Of course, the third piece is, where we may have a particular large project come into play, and as you know, we elected to move the Davis-Besse head replacement forward. We think that was a prudent thing to do. So, on a core basis, it’s somewhere between $1 billion and $1.2 billion and then depending on what the states want to do, depends on what we may do with the particular project, you could be little plus or minus around that, but certainly going forward, I think $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion would certainly be at the high end with the base period about 1 to 1.2.

This morning, we reported strong third quarter results that on a non-GAAP basis represented an increase over the third quarter of 2009. Like many of our peers in the region, unusually warm weather and the corresponding higher distribution deliveries had a positive impact on third quarter results. However, as we review the numbers, the biggest driver of our strong quarter was the success of our retail strategy as we continue to move competitive customers away from POLR and into direct sales and government aggregation channels. We are not just selling more megawatt hours, but reducing shopping risk, as well as enhancing our flexibility to structure favorable contracts and our opportunity to maximize our margins.
As I walk through our results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community we issued this morning. Later, Tony will update you on the merger, the status of the recent POLR auction in Ohio and outline information on some of the factors that we expect to impact earnings in 2011. 
Excluding special items, normalized non-GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.28 per share compared to $1.11 per share in the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, this quarter's earnings were $0.59 per share compared to $0.70, $0.77 per share last year. As detailed on Page 16 of the consolidated report, 4 special items decreased this quarter's GAAP earnings by a total of $0.69 per share. By comparison, special items reduced GAAP earnings by $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2009. The first of the 2010 special items was $0.60 per share impairment as a result of the operational changes we recently announced regarding several of our smaller coal-fired plants. These changes will provide us with operational flexibility and cost savings that we expect to bring long-term benefits.
The second special item was $0.04 per share charge related to merger transaction costs. As in prior quarter, these costs continue to be expensed as incurred. Third was a $0.03 per share charge related to power contract market-to-market adjustments of certain wholesale power contracts. And finally, $0.02 per share related to charges resulting from our new stipulated electric security plant in Ohio.
I'd like to quickly highlight our key drivers of our third quarter non-GAAP results, starting with the positives. First, a 12% increase in overall distribution deliveries benefited earnings by $0.17 per share. Residential usage was at its highest level in nearly a decade and a 19% above the third quarter of 2009, the quarter with record low usage dating back to 2002. This significant increase was largely related to warmer-than-normal summer temperatures across our service area and the resulting higher air conditioning usage. 
Industrial deliveries were up 11%, primarily related to higher usage by steel and automotive manufacturers, many of which had idle facilities for some portion of the third quarter last year. With this result, our industrial customer sector has recorded year-to-date double-digit sales increases for the entire 9-month period of 2010. Commercial deliveries were 5% higher than the previous period.
Year-to-date, we remain slightly ahead of our 2010 forecast of 106 million megawatt hours.
While these results are an encouraging sign of that the economy continues to recover, we expect overall distribution deliveries to remain below 2007 and 2008 levels at least through next year. The second positive earnings driver this quarter was commodity margins, which increased earnings by $0.19 per share. A detailed summary of this item appears on the first 3 pages of the consolidated report, including additional information on megawatt hour volumes and prices.
As I mentioned, our competitive sales strategy focuses on direct sales and government aggregation, and our efforts in these areas continue to drive our success. For the quarter, sales by our FirstEnergy Solutions subsidiary were 6.3 million-megawatt hours above last year's period, a 45% increase. About 1/3 of our growth in the third quarter came from sales outside our utility service territories and nearly half of our direct sales came from outside our Ohio franchise area. We are encouraged by these signs, their continued positive direction and the overall strong performance of our retail group.
FES also has been successfully adding retail generation customers inside FirstEnergy's utility service territories, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in wholesale sales. Again, we want to put less emphasis on POLR sales and focus more on direct and government aggregation channels, where there is lower risk, flexibility to stagger contracts and greater potential to maximize our margins. We're continuing to expand in the new markets outside our traditional utility service territories and have acquired customers in Southern Ohio, as well as markets opening up in Pennsylvania.
For the quarter, Wholesale business was down 1 million-megawatt hours or 26%. Generation output for the quarter was 19% above the prior year quarter or 3.4 million-megawatt hours. The majority of this increase came from our fossil units. With increased generation output and higher sales levels, we also incurred higher fuel and purchase power expenses.
The third key driver to earnings this quarter was $0.12 earnings per share shift in benefit related to lower operation and maintenance costs. This reflects changes in employee benefit costs including additional cost recognized for incentive compensation and stellar restoration in the third quarter of 2009, collectively resulting in a $0.10 per share increased earnings. It is important to note that while there is an earnings benefit related to timing differences for incentive compensation accruals this quarter compared with 2009, on a year-to-date basis, these costs are not significantly different. Similar to 2009, these accruals will be reversed if incentive targets are not met. Reduced operating expenses, primarily at our utilities, contributed an additional $0.02 per share to earnings in the third quarter of 2010.
Finally, net financing cost reductions increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Moving to the items that had a negative impact on the third quarter earnings comparison. Lower investment income from nuclear decommissioning trust reduced earnings by $0.05 per share compared to the prior-year quarter. When we realized the significant gain from the sale of securities held in trust. These sales facilitated our strategy to reposition our assets to limit volatility risks. A higher effective income tax rate decreased earnings by $0.06 per share, and higher kilowatt hour excise and gross receipts taxes this year reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. 
As you can see, while weather certainly benefit our earnings for the third quarter of 2010, this positive was more than offset by reductions related to nonoperational items such as nuclear decommissioning trust and taxes. As I mentioned at the start, our strong third quarter results reflect the gains we've seen from our competitive retail sales efforts with our continued expansion in the non-franchise areas, as well as the shift of our customers from POLR to direct sales and aggregation. 
Finally, our available liquidity of $2.8 billion is approximately $500 million higher than this time last year. Taken together, our results continue to track our expectations. As a result, we are affirming our 2010 non-GAAP earnings guidance with $3.60 to $3.70 per share.
Now I'll turn it over to Tony."

I'd like to provide an update on the progress of our proposed merger with Allegheny Energy and some of the auction activity we've seen over the past few weeks. Because we expect our merger to close in the first half of 2011, we will not be providing earnings guidance in December, as has been our past practice. To help in your analysis, in the meantime, we have included a list of key earning drivers for 2011 beginning on Page 17 of today's consolidated report. And I will also discuss those as well.
We will have additional information at next week's EEI financial conference. Once the merger closes, we will schedule a meeting to discuss 2011, as well as more details on projected merger synergies and initial expectations for 2012. Now let's start with the merger update. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making towards completion of the merger. Since our last call, we reached a settlement agreement with 18 parties to our Pennsylvania proceeding. This agreement provides additional benefits related to jobs, competition, service reliability and renewable energy. We are pleased to have addressed all of the issues raised by these interveners. And as a result, have their support for our transaction. The settlement is subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Commission, which continues its review of the case.
Maryland begins its merger hearings next week, and West Virginia, the following week. While these are the only states where regulatory approval is required, Ohio has agreed, as a part of our ESP order, that it will not assert jurisdiction over the merger process. And we continue to provide information to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to keep them updated. 
On the federal side, we provided the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with additional information for their review and continue to provide information to the Department of Justice. We expect these reviews to be complete in sufficient time to meet the anticipated merger closing schedule. As you know, the merger has received overwhelming support of both company shareholders, and we believe our progress in securing the necessary approvals underscores the value this merger can deliver to our shareholders and other stakeholders. As we work through the merger approval process, teams have employees from both companies continue working to outline how our 2 organizations will come together. Through this integration process, we will identify best practices for the new organization and develop the implementation plans to capture the benefits of the merger. Some examples include consolidation of contractor services and material purchases, operating a single IT infrastructure and data center and other economy of scale, particularly in our generating fleet that could produce new revenue opportunities as well. The merger process remains on track, and we continue to expect to close in the first half of 2011.
As I mentioned, we received approval in August from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for our stipulated Electric Security Plan. The plan was supported by more than 20 different parties representing customers and communities in our service territories. We're pleased to have the ESP finalized and are working to implement its terms, including the competitive bidding process. Last week, our Ohio utilities conducted the first in a series of auctions to secure generation for the 2011 through 2014 timeframe. As you may know, the PUC release the results on Friday. FirstEnergy Solutions was 1 of the 4 successful bidders for a total of 20 out of 50 tranches across the 3 different auction products. At the S-1 10 one-year tranches, 7 two-year tranches and 3 three-year tranches. Overall, we're pleased with these results.
Another auction will be held in January, and the result of that auction will be blended with those from last week's auction to determine retail generation service prices for June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. From a competitive generation standpoint, we're on a very different situation today then we were in the spring of 2009 when our generation position was fully opened beginning June 1. We won 51% of the tranches in that auction, and today serve, directly or indirectly, an additional 26% of the auction load. Since then, we have continued executing our competitive strategy and lining up customers for our generating capacity. Currently, FirstEnergy Solutions has 1.2 million retail customers. Going into last week's procurement, we had more than 76% of our 2011 generation output committed to direct sales, government aggregation and POLR auctions. Also as Mark outlined, we continue to make progress securing customers in non-franchise areas, and importantly, moving customers from POLR service to direct sales. As a result, FirstEnergy Solutions is considerably less sensitive to the Ohio POLR procurement process and continues to participate in other auctions taking place in the region, further increasing opportunities to sell its power. Most importantly, with the Ohio transition completed, we have built a strong foundation for our competitive retail business. And this includes our focus on direct sales and government aggregation. 
Last week, we also completed the default service process to establish prices for Met-Ed and Penelec customers for the first 5 months of next year. Prices from the final bidding process that will be blended with the results of previous auctions and establish the default service price beginning January 1, 2011.
As I mentioned earlier, we will not be providing 2011 earnings guidance until after the merger with Allegheny Energy closes. However, I'd like to provide some thoughts on several key earnings drivers for next year. It may be helpful to refer to Pages 17 through 19 in the consolidated report as I go through these.
As I look at 2011, it's important to recognize that the company is still in the transition to competitive markets and building its retail platform. And while there are a lot of moving parts, there's a major change in our business next year as a result of the POLR obligation in Pennsylvania being replaced with the competitive market. So in order to get a baseline, we started by isolating the Pennsylvania POLR sales of about 29 million megawatt hours in 2010 and the PJM purchases made to support those sales of about 20 million megawatt hours, which will no longer be part of our cost structure starting in 2011. And then we looked at the drivers of 2011 performance without those sales and costs. As you can see, we expect our retail sales to improve as a result of the expected continued growth in this part of the business and somewhat higher pricing in 2011. This will be offset by expected higher RTO costs and higher retail expenses, which are primarily related to increases in our sales force and back office expenditures. Additionally, we expect higher purchase power costs in 2011, primarily for balancing and to cover a portion of the reduced generation from our own fleet. Fuel costs are expected to be slightly positive, again, due to the reduced generation even though we will experience some price adjustments. We also expect that Signal Peak may provide some uplift in 2011 to offset what otherwise would be additional costs. Our plans for next year, as I've indicated, assume that generation output will be about 70.2 million megawatt hours, which is down about 6% from our 2010 forecast of 74.6 million megawatt hours. This reduction is partly driven by the outage scheduled  at Davis-Besse, as well as changes in the in-service date at Fremont and the operations of our older coal-fire fleet, which we anticipate to be in a seasonal or idle status during the year. This drop in production essentially impacts each of the drivers I've mentioned. These are either positively, through lower fuel costs, or negatively, through lower sales. However, since we have the ability to increase production if economic conditions or additional sales warrant, we are positioned to take advantage of those opportunities should they arise. On the distribution side of our business, we're forecasting 2011 distribution deliveries at about 107 million-megawatt hours. This takes into account normal weather, but we've also provided a range that reflects different level of economic recovery. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which is significantly below the current year as we wind down our large construction projects at Sammis and Fremont. Because we've already incurred most of that capital cost and project extended completion is not expected to add significantly to the capital budget. The capital plan reflects about $100 million from mandatory transmission and energy efficiency project and costs related to the accelerated replacement of the Davis-Besse reactor head, which will add approximately $90 million to the budget. Based on our current estimates for 2011, we expect to deliver free cash flow of more than $500 million. 
As you know, our Board of Directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis. It is our expectation and goal to maintain the dividend at its current level. Following closing of the merger, we plan to develop a more formal dividend policy that will provide stability, sustainability and growth for shareholders in all market conditions. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI financial conference. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And as you know we elected to move the Davis-Besse head replacement forward. We think that was the prudent thing to do. So on a kind of a core basis, I hit somewhere between $1 billion and $1.2 billion.

This morning, we reported strong third quarter results that, on a non-GAAP basis, represented an increase over the third quarter of 2009. Like many of our peers in the region, unusually warm weather and the corresponding higher distribution deliveries had a positive impact on third quarter results. However, as we review the numbers, the biggest driver of our strong quarter was the success of our retail strategy as we continue to move competitive customers away from POLR and into direct sales and government aggregation channels. We are not just selling more megawatt hours but reducing shopping risk, as well as enhancing our flexibility to structure favorable contracts and our opportunity to maximize our margins.
As I walk through our results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community we issued this morning. Later, Tony will update you on the merger, the status of the recent POLR auction in Ohio and outline information on some of the factors that we expect to impact earnings in 2011. 
Excluding special items, normalized non-GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.28 per share compared to $1.11 per share in the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, this quarter's earnings were $0.59 per share compared to $0.70 per -- $0.77 per share last year. As detailed on Page 16 of the consolidated report, 4 special items decreased this quarter's GAAP earnings by a total of $0.69 per share. By comparison, special items reduced GAAP earnings by $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2009. The first of the 2010 special items was $0.60 per share impairment as a result of the operational changes we recently announced regarding several of our smaller coal-fired plants. These changes will provide us with operational flexibility and cost savings that we expect to bring long-term benefits.
The second special item was $0.04 per share charge related to merger transaction costs. As in prior quarter, these costs will continue to be expensed as incurred. Third was a $0.03 per share charge related to power contract mark-to-market adjustments of certain wholesale power contracts. And finally, $0.02 per share related to charges resulting from our new stipulated electric security plant in Ohio.
I'd like to quickly outline the key drivers of our third quarter non-GAAP results, starting with the positives. First, a 12% increase in overall distribution deliveries benefited earnings by $0.17 per share. Residential usage was at its highest level in nearly a decade and 19% above the third quarter of 2009, the quarter with record low usage dating back to 2002. This significant increase was largely related to warmer-than-normal summer temperatures across our service area and the resulting higher air-conditioning usage. Industrial deliveries were up 11%, primarily related to higher usage by steel and automotive manufacturers, many of which had idle facilities for some portion of the third quarter last year. With this result, our industrial customer sector has recorded year-to-date double-digit sales increases for the entire 9-month period of 2010. Commercial deliveries were 5% higher than the previous period.  Year-to-date, we remain slightly ahead of our 2010 forecast of 106 million megawatt hours. While these results are an encouraging sign that the economy continues to recover, we expect overall distribution deliveries to remain below 2007 and 2008 levels at least through next year. 
The second positive earnings driver this quarter was commodity margin, which increased earnings by $0.19 per share. A detailed summary of this item appears on the first 3 pages of the consolidated report, including additional information on megawatt hour volumes and prices. As I mentioned, our competitive sales strategy focuses on direct sales and government aggregation, and our efforts in these areas continue to drive our success. For the quarter, sales by our FirstEnergy Solutions subsidiary were 6.3 million megawatt hours above last year's period, a 45% increase. About 1/3 of our growth in the third quarter came from sales outside our utility service territories, and nearly half of our direct sales came from outside our Ohio franchise area. We are encouraged by these signs, their continued positive direction and the overall strong performance of our retail group. FES also has been successfully adding retail generation customers inside FirstEnergy's utility service territories, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in wholesale sales. Again, we want to put less emphasis on POLR sales and focus more on direct and government aggregation channels, where there is lower risk, flexibility to stagger contracts and greater potential to maximize our margins. We're continuing to expand in the new markets outside our traditional utility service territories and have acquired customers in Southern Ohio, as well as markets opening up in Pennsylvania. For the quarter, wholesale business was down 1 million megawatt hours or 26%. Generation output for the quarter was 19% above the prior year quarter or 3.4 million megawatt hours. The majority of this increase came from our fossil units. With increased generation output and higher sales levels, we also incurred higher fuel and purchased power expenses.
The third key driver to earnings this quarter was $0.12 per share shift in benefit related to lower operation and maintenance costs. This reflects changes in employee benefit costs, including additional cost recognized for incentive compensation and salary restoration in the third quarter of 2009, collectively resulting in a $0.10 per share increased earnings. It is important to note that while there was an earnings benefit related to timing differences for incentive compensation accruals this quarter compared with 2009, on a year-to-date basis, these costs are not significantly different. Similar to 2009, these accruals will be reversed if incentive targets are not met. Reduced operating expenses, primarily at our utilities, contributed an additional $0.02 per share to earnings in the third quarter of 2010.  Finally, net financing cost reductions increased earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Moving to the items that had a negative impact on the third quarter earnings comparison. Lower investment income from nuclear decommissioning trusts reduced earnings by $0.25 per share compared with the prior year quarter, when we realized the significant gain from the sale of securities held in trust. These sales facilitated our strategy to reposition our assets to limit volatility risk. A higher effective income tax rate decreased earnings by $0.06 per share, and higher kilowatt hour excise and gross receipts taxes this year reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. 
As you can see, while weather certainly benefit our earnings for the third quarter of 2010, this positive was more than offset by reductions related to nonoperational items such as nuclear decommissioning trust and taxes. As I mentioned at the start, our strong third quarter results reflect the gains we've seen from our competitive retail sales efforts with their continued expansion in the non-franchise areas, as well as the shift of their customers from POLR to direct sales and aggregation. 
Finally, our available liquidity of $2.8 billion is approximately $500 million higher than this time last year. Taken together, our results continue to track our expectations. As a result, we are affirming our 2010 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 per share.
Now I'll turn it over to Tony."

Because we expect o",1550,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to provide an update on the progress of our proposed merger with Allegheny Energy and some of the auction activity we've seen over the past few weeks. Because we expect our merger to close in the first half of 2011, we will not be providing earnings guidance in December as has been our past practice. To help in your analysis in the meantime, we have included a list of key earning drivers for 2011 beginning on Page 17 of today's consolidated report, and I will also discuss those as well. We will have additional information at next week's EEI financial conference. 
Once the merger closes, we will schedule a meeting to discuss 2011, as well as more details on projected merger synergies and initial expectations for 2012. 
Now let's start with our merger update. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making towards completion of the merger. Since our last call, we reached a settlement agreement with 18 parties to our Pennsylvania proceeding. This agreement provides additional benefits related to jobs, competition, service reliability and renewable energy. We are pleased to have addressed all of the issues raised by these interveners and, as a result, have their support for our transaction. The settlement is subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Commission, which continues its review of the case.
Maryland begins its merger hearings next week and West Virginia, the following week. While these are the only states where regulatory approval is required, Ohio has agreed, as a part of our ESP order, that it will not assert jurisdiction over the merger process. And we continue to provide information to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to keep them updated. 
On the federal side, we provided the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with additional information for their review and continue to provide information to the Department of Justice. We expect these reviews to be complete in sufficient time to meet the anticipated merger closing schedule. 
As you know, the merger has received overwhelming support of both companies' shareholders, and we believe our progress in securing the necessary approvals underscores the value this merger can deliver to our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
As we work through the merger approval process, teams of employees from both companies continue working to outline how our 2 organizations will come together. Through this integration process, we will identify best practices for the new organization and develop the implementation plans to capture the benefits of the merger. Some examples include consolidation of contractor services and material purchases, operating a single IT infrastructure and data center and other economies of scale, particularly in our generating fleet that could produce new revenue opportunities as well. The merger process remains on track, and we continue to expect to close in the first half of 2011.
As I mentioned, we received approval in August from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for our stipulated Electric Security Plan. The plan was supported by more than 20 different parties representing customers and communities in our service territory. We're pleased to have the ESP finalized and are working to implement its terms, including the competitive bidding process. Last week, our Ohio utilities conducted the first in a series of auctions to secure generation for the 2011 through 2014 time frame. As you may know, the PUCO released the results on Friday. FirstEnergy Solutions was 1 of 4 successful bidders for a total of 20 out of 50 tranches across the 3 different auction products. FES won 10 one-year tranches, 7 2-year tranches and 3 3-year tranches. Overall, we're pleased with these results. Another auction will be held in January, and the results of that auction will be blended with those from last week's auction to determine retail generation service prices for June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. 
From a competitive generation standpoint, we're on a very different situation today than we were in the spring of 2009, when our generation position was fully opened beginning June 1. We won 51% of the tranches in that auction and today serve, directly or indirectly, an additional 26% of the auction load. Since then, we have continued executing our competitive strategy and lining up customers for our generating capacity. Currently, FirstEnergy Solutions has 1.2 million retail customers. 
Going into last week's procurement, we had more than 76% of our 2011 generation output committed to direct sales, government aggregation and POLR auctions. Also, as Mark outlined, we continue to make progress securing customers in non-franchise areas and, importantly, moving customers from POLR service to direct sales. As a result, FirstEnergy Solutions is considerably less sensitive to the Ohio POLR procurement process and continues to participate in other auctions taking place in the region, further increasing opportunities to sell its power. Most importantly, with the Ohio transition completed, we have built a strong foundation for our competitive retail business, and this includes our focus on direct sales and government aggregation. 
Last week, we also completed the default service process to establish prices for Met-Ed and Penelec customers for the first 5 months of next year. Prices from the final bidding process will be blended with the results of previous auctions and establish the default service price beginning January 1, 2011.
As I mentioned earlier, we will not be providing 2011 earnings guidance until after the merger with Allegheny Energy closes. However, I'd like to provide some thoughts on several key earnings drivers for next year. It may be helpful to refer to Pages 17 through 19 in the consolidated report as I go through these.
As I look at 2011, it's important to recognize that the company is still in the transition to competitive markets and building its retail platform. And while there are a lot of moving parts, there is a major change in our business next year as a result of the POLR obligation in Pennsylvania being replaced with the competitive market. So in order to get a baseline, we started by isolating the Pennsylvania POLR sales of about 29 million megawatt hours in 2010 and the PJM purchases made to support those sales about 20 million megawatt hours, which will no longer be a part of our cost structure starting in 2011. Then we looked at the drivers of 2011 performance without those sales and costs. As you can see, we expect our retail sales to improve as a result of the expected continued growth in this part of our business and somewhat higher pricing in 2011. This will be offset by expected higher RTO costs and higher retail expenses, which are primarily related to increases in our sales force and back office expenditures. Additionally, we expect higher purchased power costs in 2011, primarily for balancing and to cover a portion of the reduced generation from our own fleet. Fuel costs are expected to be slightly positive, again, due to the reduced generation, even though we will experience some price adjustments. We also expect that Signal Peak may provide some uplift in 2011 to offset what otherwise would be additional costs. 
Our plans for next year, as I've indicated, assume that generation output will be about 70.2 million megawatt hours, which is down about 6% from our 2010 forecast of 74.6 million megawatt hours. This reduction is partly driven by the outage schedule  at Davis-Besse, as well as changes to the in-service date at Fremont and the operations of our older coal-fired fleet, which we anticipate to be in a seasonal or idle status during the year. This drop in production essentially impacts each of the drivers I've mentioned. These are either positively, through lower fuel costs, or negatively, through lower sales. However, since we have the ability to increase production if economic conditions or additional sales warrant, we are positioned to take advantage of those opportunities should they arise. 
On the distribution side of our business, we are forecasting 2011 distribution deliveries at about 107 million megawatt hours. This takes into account normal weather, but we've also provided a range that reflects different levels of economic recovery. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which is significantly below the current year as we wind down our large construction projects at Sammis and Fremont. Because we already have incurred most of the capital cost for the Fremont project, the extended completion is not expected to add significantly to the capital budget. The capital plan reflects about $100 million from mandatory transmission and energy efficiency projects and costs related to the accelerated replacement of the Davis-Besse reactor head, which will add approximately $90 million to the budget. Based on our current estimates for 2011, we expect to deliver free cash flow of more than $500 million. 
As you know, our Board of Directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis. It is our expectation and goal to maintain the dividend at its current level. Following closing of the merger, we plan to develop a more formal dividend policy that will provide stability, sustainability and growth for shareholders in all market conditions. 
I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI Financial Conference. Now we'll be happy to take your questions."

Tony hit on it primarily, but if you think about this year, we're going to be in the $500 million range. That's where we'd expect to be. If you look at some of those drivers from the earnings standpoint, those are noncash, the depreciation and the AFUDC. So I would say from a cash standpoint, earnings will go down $60 million to $70 million. We don't expect to have the interest rate swaps, and we have a little bit of gains in this year. So when you back that out and then you add back in the $300 million to $350 million reduced capital expenditures, you get in the same line as where we are this year."

And then you've got that second piece which are things that either RTEP or the energy efficiency type programs, which are mandated by various authorities. And then, of course, you've got Attachment O and recovery mechanisms for the energy efficiencies. So that's a piece we have less control over. And then, of course, the third piece is where we may have a particularly large project come into play, and as you know, we elected to move the Davis-Besse head replacement forward. We think that was a prudent thing to do. So on a kind of a core basis, it's somewhere between $1 billion and $1.2 billion, and then depending on what the states want to do, it depends on what we make do with the particular project. You could be kind of a little plus or minus around that. But certainly, going forward, I think $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion would certainly be at the high end, with the base period about $1 billion to $1.2 billion."

I mean, certainly, we had a very strong third quarter with the weather, but as I stated earlier, that was completely offset by some of the nonoperational comparisons, the big driver being the retail sales. But just like in the third quarter, we could have items. Just by way of example, we could have taxes reversed back around like they did in the third quarter. Another example would be the acceleration of Davis-Besse O&M, which was not included in prior estimates, and we're working through that with our engineers. So we think it's appropriate to stay within that earnings guidance range, and we still have 2.5 months left in the year. And so it's not that we didn't look at it, we're just comfortable with it being in that range."

This morning, we reported strong third quarter results that, on a non-GAAP basis, represented an increase over the third quarter of 2009.

This morning, we reported strong third quarter results that, on a non-GAAP basis, represented an increase over the third quarter of 2009. Like many of our peers in the region, unusually warm weather and the corresponding higher distribution deliveries had a positive impact on third quarter results. However, as we review the numbers, the biggest driver of our strong quarter was the success of our retail strategy as we continue to move competitive customers away from POLR and into direct sales and government aggregation channels. We are not just selling more megawatt hours but reducing shopping risk, as well as enhancing our flexibility to structure favorable contracts and our opportunity to maximize our margins.
As I walk through our results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community we issued this morning. Later, Tony will update you on the merger, the status of the recent POLR auction in Ohio and outline information on some of the factors that we expect to impact earnings in 2011. 
Excluding special items, normalized non-GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.28 per share compared to $1.11 per share in the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, this quarter's earnings were $0.59 per share compared to $0.70 per -- $0.77 per share last year. As detailed on Page 16 of the consolidated report, 4 special items decreased this quarter's GAAP earnings by a total of $0.69 per share. By comparison, special items reduced GAAP earnings by $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2009. The first of the 2010 special items was $0.60 per share impairment as a result of the operational changes we recently announced regarding several of our smaller coal-fired plants. These changes will provide us with operational flexibility and cost savings that we expect to bring long-term benefits.
The second special item was $0.04 per share charge related to merger transaction costs. As in prior quarters, these costs will continue to be expensed as incurred. Third was a $0.03 per share charge related to power contract mark-to-market adjustments of certain wholesale power contracts. And finally, $0.02 per share related to charges resulting from our new stipulated Electric Security Plan in Ohio.
I'd like to quickly outline the key drivers of our third quarter non-GAAP results, starting with the positives. First, a 12% increase in overall distribution deliveries benefited earnings by $0.17 per share. Residential usage was at its highest level in nearly a decade and 19% above the third quarter of 2009, a quarter with record low usage dating back to 2002. This significant increase was largely related to warmer-than-normal summer temperatures across our service area and the resulting higher air-conditioning usage. Industrial deliveries were up 11%, primarily related to higher usage by steel and automotive manufacturers, many of which had idle facilities for some portion of the third quarter last year. With this result, our industrial customer sector has recorded year-to-date double-digit sales increases for the entire 9-month period of 2010. Commercial deliveries were 5% higher than the previous period.  Year-to-date, we remain slightly ahead of our 2010 forecast of 106 million megawatt hours. While these results are an encouraging sign that the economy continues to recover, we expect overall distribution deliveries to remain below 2007 and 2008 levels at least through next year. 
The second positive earnings driver this quarter was commodity margin, which increased earnings by $0.19 per share. A detailed summary of this item appears on the first 3 pages of the consolidated report, including additional information on megawatt hour volumes and prices. As I mentioned, our competitive sales strategy focuses on direct sales and government aggregation, and our efforts in these areas continue to drive our success. For the quarter, sales by our FirstEnergy Solutions subsidiary were 6.3 million megawatt hours above last year's period, a 45% increase. About 1/3 of our growth in the third quarter came from sales outside our utility service territories, and nearly half of our direct sales came from outside our Ohio franchise area. We are encouraged by these signs, their continued positive direction and the overall strong performance of our retail group. FES also has been successfully adding retail generation customers inside FirstEnergy's utility service territories, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in wholesale sales. Again, we want to put less emphasis on POLR sales and focus more on direct and government aggregation channels where there is lower risk, flexibility to stagger contracts and greater potential to maximize our margins. We're continuing to expand into new markets outside our traditional utility service territories and have acquired customers in Southern Ohio, as well as markets opening up in Pennsylvania. For the quarter, wholesale business was down 1 million megawatt hours or 26%. Generation output for the quarter was 19% above the prior year quarter or 3.4 million megawatt hours. The majority of this increase came from our fossil units. With increased generation output and higher sales levels, we also incurred higher fuel and purchased power expenses.
The third key driver to earnings this quarter was $0.12 per share shift in benefit related to lower operation and maintenance costs. This reflects changes in employee benefit costs, including additional costs recognized for incentive compensation and salary restoration in the third quarter of 2009, collectively resulting in a $0.10 per share increase to earnings. It is important to note that while there was an earnings benefit related to timing differences for incentive compensation accruals this quarter compared with 2009, on a year-to-date basis, these costs are not significantly different. Similar to 2009, these accruals will be reversed if incentive targets are not met. Reduced operating expenses, primarily at our utilities, contributed an additional $0.02 per share to earnings in the third quarter of 2010.  Finally, net financing cost reductions increased earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Moving to the items that had a negative impact on the third quarter earnings comparison. Lower investment income from nuclear decommissioning trusts reduced earnings by $0.25 per share compared with the prior year quarter, when we realized a significant gain from the sale of securities held in trust. These sales facilitated our strategy to reposition our assets to limit volatility risk. A higher effective income tax rate decreased earnings by $0.06 per share, and higher kilowatt hour excise and gross receipts taxes this year reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. 
As you can see, while weather certainly benefit our earnings for the third quarter of 2010, this positive was more than offset by reductions related to nonoperational items such as nuclear decommissioning trust and taxes. As I mentioned at the start, our strong third quarter results reflect the gains we've seen from our competitive retail sales efforts with their continued expansion into non-franchise areas, as well as the shift of their customers from POLR to direct sales and aggregation. 
Finally, our available liquidity of $2.8 billion is approximately $500 million higher than this time last year. Taken together, our results continue to track our expectations. As a result, we are affirming our 2010 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 per share.
Now I'll turn it over to Tony."

I'd like to provide an update on the progress of our proposed merger with Allegheny Energy and some of the auction activity we've seen over the past few weeks. Because we expect our merger to close in the first half of 2011, we will not be providing earnings guidance in December as has been our past practice. To help in your analysis in the meantime, we have included a list of key earning drivers for 2011 beginning on Page 17 of today's consolidated report, and I will also discuss those as well. We will have additional information at next week's EEI financial conference. Once the merger closes, we will schedule a meeting to discuss 2011, as well as more details on projected merger synergies and initial expectations for 2012. 
Now let's start with a merger update. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making towards completion of the merger. Since our last call, we reached a settlement agreement with 18 parties to our Pennsylvania proceeding. This agreement provides additional benefits related to jobs, competition, service reliability and renewable energy. We are pleased to have addressed all of the issues raised by these interveners and, as a result, have their support for our transaction. The settlement is subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Commission, which continues its review of the case.
Maryland begins its merger hearings next week and West Virginia, the following week. While these are the only states where regulatory approval is required, Ohio has agreed, as a part of our ESP order, that it will not assert jurisdiction over the merger process. And we continue to provide information to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to keep them updated. 
On the federal side, we provided the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with additional information for their review and continue to provide information to the Department of Justice. We expect these reviews to be complete in sufficient time to meet the anticipated merger closing schedule. 
As you know, the merger has received overwhelming support of both companies' shareholders, and we believe our progress in securing the necessary approvals underscores the value this merger can deliver to our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
As we work through the merger approval process, teams of employees from both companies continue working to outline how our 2 organizations will come together. Through this integration process, we will identify best practices for the new organization and develop the implementation plans to capture the benefits of the merger. Some examples include consolidation of contractor services and material purchases, operating a single IT infrastructure and data center and other economies of scale, particularly in our generating fleet that could produce new revenue opportunities as well. The merger process remains on track, and we continue to expect to close in the first half of 2011.
As I mentioned, we received approval in August from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for our stipulated Electric Security Plan. The plan was supported by more than 20 different parties representing customers and communities in our service territory. We're pleased to have the ESP finalized and are working to implement its terms, including the competitive bidding process. Last week, our Ohio utilities conducted the first in a series of auctions to secure generation for the 2011 through 2014 time frame. As you may know, the PUCO released the results on Friday. FirstEnergy Solutions was 1 of 4 successful bidders for a total of 20 out of 50 tranches across the 3 different auction products. FES won 10 one-year tranches, 7 2-year tranches and 3 3-year tranches. Overall, we're pleased with these results. Another auction will be held in January, and the results of that auction will be blended with those from last week's auction to determine retail generation service prices for June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. 
From a competitive generation standpoint, we're on a very different situation today than we were in the spring of 2009 when our generation position was fully opened beginning June 1. We won 51% of the tranches in that auction and today serve, directly or indirectly, an additional 26% of the auction load. Since then, we have continued executing our competitive strategy and lining up customers for our generating capacity. Currently, FirstEnergy Solutions has 1.2 million retail customers. 
Going into last week's procurement, we had more than 76% of our 2011 generation output committed to direct sales, government aggregation and POLR auctions. Also, as Mark outlined, we continue to make progress securing customers in non-franchise areas and, importantly, moving customers from POLR service to direct sales. As a result, FirstEnergy Solutions is considerably less sensitive to the Ohio POLR procurement process and continues to participate in other auctions taking place in the region, further increasing opportunities to sell its power. Most importantly, with the Ohio transition completed, we have built a strong foundation for our competitive retail business, and this includes our focus on direct sales and government aggregation. 
Last week, we also completed the default service process to establish prices for Met-Ed and Penelec customers for the first 5 months of next year. Prices from the final bidding process will be blended with the results of previous auctions and establish the default service price beginning January 1, 2011.
As I mentioned earlier, we will not be providing 2011 earnings guidance until after the merger with Allegheny Energy closes. However, I'd like to provide some thoughts on several key earnings drivers for next year. It may be helpful to refer to Pages 17 through 19 in the consolidated report as I go through these.
As I look at 2011, it's important to recognize that the company is still in the transition to competitive markets and building its retail platform. And while there are a lot of moving parts, there is a major change in our business next year as a result of the POLR obligation in Pennsylvania being replaced with the competitive market. So in order to get a baseline, we started by isolating the Pennsylvania POLR sales of about 29 million megawatt hours in 2010 and the PJM purchases made to support those sales about 20 million megawatt hours, which will no longer be a part of our cost structure starting in 2011. Then we looked at the drivers of 2011 performance without those sales and costs. As you can see, we expect our retail sales to improve as a result of expected continued growth in this part of our business and somewhat higher pricing in 2011. This will be offset by expected higher RTO costs and higher retail expenses, which are primarily related to increases in our sales force and back office expenditures. Additionally, we expect higher purchased power costs in 2011, primarily for balancing and to cover a portion of the reduced generation from our own fleet. Fuel costs are expected to be slightly positive, again, due to the reduced generation, even though we will experience some price adjustments. We also expect that Signal Peak may provide some uplift in 2011 to offset what otherwise would be additional costs. 
Our plans for next year, as I've indicated, assume that generation output will be about 70.2 million megawatt hours, which is down about 6% from our 2010 forecast of 74.6 million megawatt hours. This reduction is partly driven by the outage schedule at Davis-Besse, as well as changes to the in-service date at Fremont and the operations of our older coal-fired fleet, which we anticipate to be in a seasonal or idle status during the year. This drop in production essentially impacts each of the drivers I've mentioned, either positively, through lower fuel costs, or negatively, through lower sales. However, since we have the ability to increase production if economic conditions or additional sales warrant, we are positioned to take advantage of those opportunities should they arise. 
On the distribution side of our business, we are forecasting 2011 distribution deliveries at about 107 million megawatt hours. This takes into account normal weather, but we've also provided a range that reflects different levels of economic recovery. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which is significantly below the current year as we wind down our large construction projects at Sammis and Fremont. Because we already have incurred most of the capital cost for the Fremont project, the extended completion is not expected to add significantly to the capital budget. The capital plan reflects about $100 million for mandatory transmission and energy efficiency projects and costs related to the accelerated replacement of the Davis-Besse reactor head, which will add approximately $90 million to the budget. Based on our current estimates for 2011, we expect to deliver free cash flow of more than $500 million. 
As you know, our board of directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis. It is our expectation and goal to maintain the dividend at its current level. Following closing of the merger, we plan to develop a more formal dividend policy that will provide stability, sustainability and growth for shareholders in all market conditions. 
I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI Financial Conference. Now we'll be happy to take your questions."

And then you've got that second piece, which are things that either RTEP or the energy efficiency type programs, which are mandated by various authorities. And then, of course, you've got Attachment O and recovery mechanisms for the energy efficiencies. So that's a piece we have less control over. And then, of course, the third piece is where we may have a particularly large project come into play, and as you know, we elected to move the Davis-Besse head replacement forward. We think that was a prudent thing to do. So on a kind of a core basis, it's somewhere between $1 billion and $1.2 billion, and then depending on what the states want to do, it depends on what we make do with a particular project. You could be kind of a little plus or minus around that. But certainly, going forward, I think $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion would certainly be at the high end, with the base period about $1 billion to $1.2 billion."

Another example would be the acceleration of Davis-Besse O&M, which was not included in prior estimates, and we're working through that with our engineers. So we think it's appropriate to stay within that earnings guidance range, and we still have 2.5 months left in the year. And so it's not that we didn't look at it.

Obviously, with respect to credit metrics, which have come into focus -- and you mentioned your regulated op cos are capitalized in agreement with your regulatory structure.

So what is the outlook at Solutions, when in terms of, like, metrics, and what is your commitment there? My sense is that you guys have been very firm about maintaining investment-grade metrics at Solutions, if not better, and I just wanted to kind of get reiteration of that view from you."
