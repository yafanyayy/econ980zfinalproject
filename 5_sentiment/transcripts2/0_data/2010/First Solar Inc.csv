Starting off here to talk about Q4, we had a strong finish to the year, and we achieved our 2009 guidance which we set over a year ago. So despite all the c",2182,"Great. Thank you, Larry. Thanks to everyone for joining us today for our Q4 call and 2009 summary. Starting off here to talk about Q4, we had a strong finish to the year, and we achieved our 2009 guidance which we set over a year ago. So despite all the challenges and changes in the market, we did very, very well. Q4 net sales were $641 million, up 33% quarter-over-quarter. We sold Sarnia and Blythe sites and draw $142 million in net income. For the year, a $2.1 billion in net sales, up 66% and Q4 diluted EPS was $1.65, bringing the 2009 EPS to $7.53, which was up 78% year-over-year.Strong cash position as well, we finished the year with $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and generated an additional $395 million free cash flow. We continue to execute well in operations and in Q4, produced 311 megawatts and finished the year with 1.1 gigawatts of production in 2009. We achieved a milestone of over 2 gigawatts cumulative production in sales, so great, great finish to the year. Our annualized capacity per line rose to 53.4 megawatts, and our efficiency was up to 11.1%. Module cost was down to $0.84, was impacted by $0.02 roughly due to the Ohio start up, and $0.02 due to SBC. So our core costs for the quarter-to-quarter was down $0.03 to $0.80 a watt.  Total annual costs were down 19% from $1.8 to $0.87. We also started to expand our capacity in Malaysia, plants five and six and adding eight additional lines. Now in terms of the Systems business and our market development, we sold projects totaling 100 megawatts and shows both the utility and investors have an appetite for solar projects and projects in sales. We continue to progress our Development business as well. We're fast-track for BLM at the Sunlight project which is 550 megawatt, and we'll start construction in Q4 of 2010. We added one dozen Edison Mission sites to First Solar's project development portfolio, roughly 20 to 150 megawatts sites on private lands, which diversifies our project base from BLM projects.We also start the construction of two new utility scale plants, 48 megawatt AC Copper Mountain, as the expansion of El Dorado for sulfur generation, 60 megawatt AC Sarnia, Ontario expansion. For Enbridge, North American partners making progress in developing sites as well. PNM 22 megawatt EPC agreement and our partner Juwi sold Blue Wing San Antonio project to Duke Energy as well. So great progress on the project side and our customer side.Turning now to 2010 industry outlook. Our market environment was significantly better than 2009, but uncertainties remain. Larry mentioned the German FIT change, and we think it will drive strong first half demand and some uncertainty in the second half. Italy 2011 FIT changes will benefit, we believe, the second half of 2010. France, Italy and Spain grow and supported by Radiance [ph] and attractive IRs will continue to drive our growth in the business. U.S. utilities are getting more focused on solar projects, and can be executed to comply with both the RPS standards and a lot of ownership interest in driving both the base assets and technology adoption.In Canada, the RESOP has driven attractive returns. We have a 200 megawatt pipeline, take content and development will help us drive the business. We anticipate Chinese FIT will likely be delayed somewhat, so from a business standpoint, we'll see how that turns out. As Larry mentioned, if FIT changes in the marketplace or some of the changes that are taking place, we'll discuss somewhat with the included insert in the back of the presentation for your review.We'll continue to position ourselves in North America and have a significant base in the development business with strong demand from our customers in the pipeline continuing to develop. We believe this will buffer our concerns about what's happening in Europe and the business as a whole. So in general, good outlook for 2010 and excellent performance in 2009.To take a look now at the industry and overall, our forecast for growth. First Solar's share doubled year-over-year to 18% to 19% approximately, based on our preliminary market estimate. So Germany in 2009, we think ended up between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatt, and that's in line with our estimates related to the first of the year. Industry demand grows in 2010 to 7.5 gigawatt and we anticipate that the German FIT changes will happen approximately mid-year, potentially third quarter, which is driving a strong first half and a potential pause in the second half. First Solar's plan was really buffered by the Systems business and building up the pipeline that we have. So our forecast is roughly for Germany to be flat in 2010 at approximately 3 gigawatt. Some other estimates are calling at First to be somewhat larger as it could be. The FIT changes, we'll have to see what they did in the marketplace, overall. So we think we're conservative on that plan. We'll continue to diversify from a lot of the European base and customers by developing in North America and China. So that growth, I think, we're well positioned for and will help us in the uncertainties that exists in Europe.Our forecast from '09 to '12 is a 35% CAGR. So expect the German markets to decline over time as the FIT changes will start to make the market itself less financially attractive, and economics there in terms of sunlight and other things making it less sustainable over time. The transition markets we're focused on are U.S., China, France and Italy will continue to grow and probably over time, overtake Germany as a market. Its economics will provide long-term growth for our business, especially as electricity prices start to grow.We're cautious somewhat on the FIT market, long-term and FIT will decline and drive those economics down. We're also focused on the growth potential that India provides, an announcement to over 20 gigawatt of renewables remandated by 2022. So we recognize the significant challenges there, but from a business standpoint, an excellent growth for the future.Turning now to our strategy, really fundamentally, our strategy is not changed from what was presented back in June of 2009. There's a slide that Mike used to present the business and our focus on migrating from existing subsidy business and market places to transition markets. Our goal and First Solar's goal overall remains to reach sustainable market economics, where we can compete with and be positioned versus fossil fuel in any electricity market. And it will grow the market in general, much more substantially than the subsidized markets that exist today. Our technology in driving the costs down will enable us to compete and we think, grow the market overall. The migration from these subsidy markets to transition markets, and most of the European markets are existing FIT subsidy markets today and are based on mandates. Some will move to transition markets based more on economics versus mandates, and several have the sun and electricity market that can be sustained based on economics, places like the United States, France, Italy, Spain and China.It's important to understand the transition and addresses our constraints to grow First Solar. We feel we're best positioned in the solar market and as a company, based on our integrated approach for the PPC project development and the ability to provide turnkey solutions to the utility customers. We think this will help us drive the technology adoption and the business growth in the future. One point for gigawatt is contracted with the PPA or RESOP pipeline, plus we have a number of unannounced projects under development.Driving costs down will help make solar affordable and we'll stay ahead of the FiT cuts. Work with utilities and regulators on infrastructures and policies and will continue to drive the business model closer to conventional types of markets where the economics improve over time, and the subsidy and market economics decline. So our focus is still to target sustainable markets and grow in transition areas for the future.Next phase now comparing those two markets, subsidized and transition market economics, the subsidies really are designed to create markets and they have. We can see that in Europe and especially in Germany and growing now Italy and France. The FiT decline over time to fossil fuel competitive levels may result in declining economics as we said. And some of these markets, do not have enough sun to make it a sustainable business in terms of economics. But the rate and timing of decline could cause a little bit of disruption in the market in Germany, specifically. So we're pursuing these transition markets and driving them to become sustainable, and be able to compete with fossil fuel peaking generation in areas like United States and China. Since we're close to the conventional generation, economics improved over time as PV system costs declined, energy costs rises with inflation. So we think through this, we also create opportunities for margin expansion. Overtime, the ability to gain share of that large fossil fuel peaking market. This will grow the overall pie for solar power, and create market opportunities for us to grow.We showed you in December the pipeline that we have for our Development business, so 1.4 gigawatt of contracted North American systems volume, 310 megawatt small to medium projects, 1,100 project in California including 300 megawatt of Sunlight project without PPA, pipeline spans from 2010 to 2014. And as I've said, this is a summary of what we presented during our Analyst Presentation in December. So a great pipeline and we continue to build on that pipeline for the future.We've taken a look at the U.S. utility contracts for PV and the solar thermal. First Solar had 16% share of the announced U.S. solar contracts. There is 8.6 gigawatt total announced, and although 71% is solar thermal, few of them have been built and the mix is shifting more to PV. And then in 2009, 65% of those that we're branded were PV. So First Solar has build a strong position in U.S. utilities market, and we have the integrated value chain of the project development, EPC, solid execution and the ability to drive lower and lower costs through our own panel production, but as well a balance of systems and our O&M contracts. So we feel really good about our position in the U.S. utility market and our growth for the future.We continue to drive copy smart and capacity growth, this pipeline we talked about, the 1.4 gigawatt pipeline is the leading position in the United States, and it led us to have the confidence to increase our capacity in Malaysia by adding plants five and six. Construction began with production ramping in the first half of 2011, that's 427 megawatts, bringing our total capacity to 1.7 gigawatt at Q4 run rate in 2011. Increased scale, low operating costs in tax tenants also helped us to drive profitability and the future expansion of our business. The two line plant partner with the EDFEN in France allows another 107 megawatt by Q1 of 2012 for a total of 1.8 gigawatt in capacity. All the work that we did to continue to drive our line run rate, increasing from Q4 of 53.4 to greater than 80 by 2014, as organic growth across 34 lines by 2012 approximately 2.7 gigawatt of production from the lines that we have in this business.So in summary, I'd like to say it was a really strong year despite all the volatility and challenges that we faced, strong module demand in the year and then specifically Q4. We completed the sale of both Blythe and Sarnia at 20. Louder revisions to the FiT that are being proposed, discussed now in the market that are going to drive some uncertainties, especially in the second half depending on what happens in the decisions for the future. So the first half is very strong demand. Orders look very strong. The second half we'll have to see. We believe Italy will start to accelerate in growth with a lot of the development that has taken place. And we believe that some of the challenges that may exist in Germany, we've more than offset by a lot of the pipeline at we mention during the presentation. So we feel really good about the outlook for growth in demand. Our Systems business in North America, the contracted pipeline is continuing to grow. Added 1.4 gigawatt now, we sold 100 megawatt AC systems in Q4 and as we discussed, approximately 50% to 55% of the announced utilities contracts we have in the PV market. Started construction of Malaysia to increase our capacity, and the site I mentioned as well in France. So we continue to look at additional capacity expansions from a business standpoint and see what we can do in the future. Nothing to announce at this time, but we are definitely considering those alternatives.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff to go through the financials. Jens?"

On today's call, we're reporting our 2009 financial results. These results confirm our guidance given back in October of 2008, despite one of the worst financial crisis in recent history, module oversupply and rapidly declining crystalline silicon prices, a global recession and a financial climate, had significantly impacted project financing and customer working capital.Annual net sales grew 66% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, operating margin was 32.9% and diluted EPS rose from $4.24 to $7.53. The 78% increase that includes the impact of the OptiSolar acquisition during 2009. We achieved the RONA of 25.5%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by approximately 12.4 percentage points.During the fourth quarter, we experienced strong module demand, aided by competitive pricing and rollback seasonal trends in advance of annual change in the feed-in-tariff in all core markets. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $641 million, an increase of $160 million compared to the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by higher module production volumes, system revenue recognition for the 20 megawatt AC Sarnia and 21 megawatt AC Blythe projects, as well as the slightly favorable euro exchange rate. These effects were partially offset by lower module ASPs.We produced 311 megawatts during the fourth quarter, up 6.4% compared to the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, we began the ramp of the new Perrysburg, Ohio line. The Ohio line expansion to full lines remains on plan to be at full capacity in the first quarter of 2010. Costs per watt produced for the fourth quarter was $0.84, down $0.01 and benefited from lower material costs, higher throughput and conversion efficiency, which was partially offset by $0.02 for the Ohio ramp, and $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Core manufacturing costs, excluding ramp penalty and stock-based compensation, declined 3.6% to $0.80 per watt quarter-over-quarter.Gross margin for the first quarter was 41.5%, down 9.4 percentage points over the prior quarter, in line with our previous guidance. About 5.9 percentage points of the decline was due to the significant increase in EPC/Development business which represented approximately 14% of our fourth quarter net sales. In addition, we amortized a portion of the project assets related to the OptiSolar acquisition, with the realization of Phase I of Sarnia. The ramp penalty associated with the Ohio ramps impacted gross margins unfavorably by another percentage point. Volume margins declined approximately 1% percentage points quarter-over-quarter due to less than favorable economics of the Blythe PPA.Operating expenses increased by $39.3 million sequentially to $121.5 million due to $22.9 million a one-time personal expenses, approximately $7 million of other non-recurring expenses primarily attributable to a dispute with the Dutch Bankruptcy Court, and $9.1 million of turnaround effect of one-time benefits recorded during the third quarter. On an annualized basis, operating expenses stayed approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. While operating income for the fourth quarter was $144.7 million or 22.6% of net sales, compared to $162.8 million or 33.9% during the prior quarter.  Slide 24 provides a reconciliation between the third and fourth quarter operating margins, reflecting the changes in gross margin and one-time operating expenses discussed earlier. Net income for the fourth quarter was $141.6 million or $1.65 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 5.8% and 6.7% for the fiscal year 2009.For the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $345 million, driven by operating cash flow of $414 million. We spent $69 million for capital equipment during the fourth quarter against depreciation of $37 million. For the full year, free cash flow reached $395 million after financing $280 million of capital expenditures. Cash and all other marketable securities increased by $284 million quarter-over-quarter to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, principally due to our free cash flow performance, partially offset by cash usage and other investment activities. Our debt to equity ratio remains very low at 7% providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry.To further exemplify of the degree of differentiation, Slide 28 compares First Solar's balance sheet to the aggregate of 12 fuel play competitors, showing a $939 million net cash position for First Solar and a cash deficit of $5 billion for the Pier Group based on the latest reported results and our estimates.With our fourth quarter net results and net sales breaking through the $2 billion trailing fourth quarter performance. First Solar achieved the last quantitative metric for an investment grade company. As the industry moves into the transitional markets, access to low-cost capital for large-scale project finance becomes an imperative. This is becoming an important competitive advantage. We expect the rating agencies will focus on the quality of each project, the underlying debt structures, service on warranty agreements and the balance sheets backing them. Strategic and equity investor consider the financial strengths of the system developer to ensure a multiyear project builds can be fulfilled. 25-year warranties are backed, and operations and maintenance contracts are supported. We believe we are well-positioned to lead the growth into transition in sustainable markets enabled by our proprietary technology, the superior business model and the strong balance sheet.This brings me to our guidance for 2010, which remains unchanged since our December meeting. Just to summarize, net sales are expected to range from $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. There's modular net sales of $2.1 billion and EPC project development sales of $600 million to $800 million. Gross margins of 38%, with modular gross margins of 48% to 50% and EPC project development gross margins of 5% to 6%. We expect plant start up cost of approximately $25 million, primarily from Malaysia plants five and six in the second half of 2010. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $95 million to $105 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold.GAAP operating margin is expected to be 23% to 24% with module operating margins of 30% to 33% and EPC operating margins of break even levels. We expect our 2009 tax rate to be around 15%. Year end 2010 fully-diluted share count guidance has an estimated 86 to 87 million shares. EPS remains at $1.6 and $0.05, $6.5 to $6.85% or. CapEx for the year is expected to be $500 million to $550 million. Operating cash flow, $730 million to $790 million Cap, free cash flow, $180 million to $290 million. At this, we expect our RONA performance of 16% to 18% it. And we expected it to scale our EPC and project development business to achieve our long-term goal of 20%.Slide 32 shows our quarterly profile of revenues by segment and the mixed impact on our consolidated margin percentage in our December guidance meeting. We feel urged to repeat the content of the slide due to numerous inconsistencies and reasonably published research report following our guidance meeting in December. Please note that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will have 100%. While reading the slide vertically, will likely lead to another late night of model revisions. The majority of our EPC and project development revenues are expected to be recognized in the second half of 2010. The first quarter is largely driven by module sales, module and consolidated revenues are expected to decline in the second quarter as more production capacity is being allocated to the systems business, driving revenue increases for both module and EPC project development in Q3 and Q4. Keep in mind that we will be allocating modules in advance of revenue recognition, causing a dip in the second quarter consolidated net sales. The margin profile follow that trend as module margins stay fairly flat with an expected slight decline in Q2 due to EPC inventory builds. However, the growing EPC revenue mix is expected to dilute our consolidated margin between the second and first quarter.Stated in our December meeting, we have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. These assumptions remain largely unchanged. Please refer to the back of this presentation for the slide outlining them. These assumption are however subject to change representing and opportunities and risks. We currently believe our guidance balances these factors. We see opportunities from the potential to increase a percent of cap business in 2010 which improves module ASPs. In addition, the expected 2011 change good drive increased the amount of the second half of 2010 and France recent change in feed-in tariff together with strong partnerships to promote further growth in that region.The recent dollar-euro volatility currently creates risk to our guidance. We are providing sensitivity that a $0.01 deviation from our assumed $1.40 per euro exchange rate impacts revenues for 2010 by approximately $10 million, and net income by $6 million. We continue to have uncertainty on the amount of general in feed-in tariff cuts by segment and the impact on module ASP. The potential demand on the overall implementation timing. Any deviation from our assumptions could cause our actual results to differ from our guidance.With this, we conclude our prepared remarks in open the call for questions. Operator?"

Actually quite a few PPAs have been executed in recent history, slightly above that MPR and PPA prices in these negotiations happen to be slightly higher and they seem to be passing through the CPUC. Obviously, a decline in natural gas prices and the related reduction in MPR could have an impact right on our long-term outlook with respect to the economics of the California market. We are seeing that as MTR goal slightly go down and will fluctuate. Our focus is essentially to ensure that we drive our cost reductions further down right, because somewhat regardless long-term impact or pricing in the MPR, we need to be competitive with fossil fuels, which is somewhat independent of the MPR.

The shorter essentially, the lead time as to the feed-in tariff aggression becoming active requires the much swifter reaction throughout the overall value shale as it relates to reorganizing and reallocating the economics. So one thing we will leave we have successfully done as we have acquired as you know a significant captive pipeline we're executing ourselves, that we believe allows us a good degree of mitigation with respect to these types of demand uncertainties. That's about that crystalline prices. Essentially, say stated I think in the December meeting, we assumed by year end 2010, a spot price of $40 per kilogram per poly come with essentially $0.75 manufacturing cost of crystalline competitors. And they would operate at roughly a 20% growth margin. So that's what we assume will for the piece of business where we're competing head to head with these companies."

As we mentioned, obviously, there is potential depending on what type of changes from market segment we get from the German feed-in tariff. you need a recalibration every distribution channels so this is particularly true. If you look at agricultural land and the possibility of singling free field installation with a much higher feed-in tariff migration. As you know, historically, we've operated in and around roughly a 50/50 split between rooftops and tree fields so we do have channel access to rooftops. If these cuts came through, obviously, some of our channel partners would have to get more aggressive in rooftop, which means overall competitive dynamics of the Schumer product into that segment would generally increase, given our cost leadership, we would leave compete quite favorably in that market. That market segment, as you know, with also that include probably the smaller commercial rooftops, which historically have not been yet been a target market for us. But I think as a comment and the comment was with respect to that they could be, again depending on the lead time you have with respect to the change of becoming active, there could be essentially some disruptiveness out of that. But we believe again like you said before if you look at our own pipeline and what we have built, I think we have a good degree of resilience against some of those uncertainties. As it relates to accessing in the first quarter, we reported to that we had one-time benefit in the.  As it relates to OpEx structure of about $9.3 million. Then in the fourth quarter essentially, between hiring rough and the associated expense is there, one of our senior executives parting with the company made up a majority of the one-time events as we had in the fourth quarter.

Obviously, we like to reinvest the majority of our cash flows into the build-out of manufacturing capacity as that continues to build the core of our business, that's what drives cost and LCOE down for the industry. As we look at some of the very large projects develop meant effort has some degree of cash consumption we utilize right now. We like to have a buffer and a strong balance sheet, even though obviously, we were unable to earn our RONA target out of this cash balance. The strength of the balance sheet as a whole allows us right to achieve significant benefits on the project financing side, just due to the overall aspect of credit quality within the company. I think time will tell and I think the growth rates of this industry will tell with respect to how these cash flows continue to trend. We believe we will operate in the free cash flow positive bases, and maybe a point in time in our future, I wouldn't say that in the next, next two or three years, but maybe in the other future, where we might return and start to return some of the cash generation back to our shareholders. With relate to the operating expenses, essentially, I think right now, there's nothing on the radar screen for us as it relates to a one-time item. So I think if you kind of take the Q4 run rate, adjusted for those onetime items and then keep in mind, Q1 usually a slight increase in your expenses due to pay roll taxes, et cetera, and also a merit increases usually take effect during the time period. So you should see a gradual increase. Then I think it's a fairly linear function growth across the quarters against the guidance."

Other impacts are if you look at Q4, the Q4 module margins were impacted as I mentioned in my remarks, unfavorably due to the economics in the Blythe project. You may recall the Blythe PPA signed very early and came to some degree with the acquisition of Turner renewables. Which probably to some degree was surprised I would say, 20 plus percent under the markets. So there's an impact out of that, just in the fourth quarter.

As the initial feedback we're getting out of the capital source appears to be favorable and open. So obviously, the rating on the project is subject to the quality of the off-taker with respect to the electricity into the counter party of the PPA is. It is very much subject to how you structure the capital structure of the project. And then what we have learned is also highly subject to the quality of essentially the provider of the system, and with respect to warranties, with respect execution, construction financing, as well as in the long-term loan and performance. All of these pieces factor in. As you know, you can just look at essentially some of the yield curves.

We sold Sarnia and Blythe sites and draw $142 million in net income. For the year, $2.1 billion in net sales, up 66% and Q4 diluted EPS was $1.65, bringing the 2009 EPS to $7.53, which was up 78% year-over-year.Strong cash position as well. We finished the year at $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and generated an additional $395 million free cash flow. We continue to execute well in operations and in Q4, produced 311 megawatts and finished the year with 1.1 gigawatts of production in 2009. We achieved a milestone of over 2 gigawatts cumulative production in sales, so great, great finish to the year. Our annualized capacity per line rose to 53.4 megawatts, and our efficiency was up to 11.1%. Module cost was down to $0.84, was impacted by $0.02 roughly due to the Ohio start up, and $0.02 due to SBC. So our core costs for the quarter-to-quarter was down $0.03 to $0.80 a watt.  Total annual costs were down 19% from $1.8 to $0.87. We also started to expand our capacity in Malaysia, plants five and six and adding eight additional lines. Now in terms of the Systems business and our market development, we sold projects totaling 100 megawatts and shows both the utility and investors have an appetite for solar projects and projects in sales. We continue to progress our Development business as well. We're fast-track for BLM at the Sunlight project which is 550 megawatt, and we'll start construction in Q4 of 2010. We added one dozen Edison Mission sites to First Solar's project development portfolio, roughly 20 to 150 megawatts sites on private lands, which diversifies our project base from BLM projects.We also start the construction of two new utility scale plants, 48 megawatt AC Copper Mountain, as the expansion of El Dorado for sulfur generation, 60 megawatt AC Sarnia, Ontario expansion. For Enbridge, North American partners making progress in developing sites as well. PNM 22 megawatt EPC agreement and our partner Juwi sold Blue Wing San Antonio project to Duke Energy as well. So great progress on the project side and our customer side.Turning now to 2010 industry outlook. Our market environment was significantly better than 2009, but uncertainties remain. Larry mentioned the German FIT change, and we think it will drive strong first half demand and some uncertainty in the second half. Italy 2011 FIT changes will benefit, we believe, the second half of 2010. France, Italy and Spain grow and supported by irradiance and attractive IRs will continue to drive our growth in the business. U.S. utilities are getting more focused on solar projects, and can be executed to comply with both the RPS standards and a lot of ownership interest in driving both the base assets and technology adoption.In Canada, the RESOP has driven attractive returns. We have a 200 megawatt pipeline, take content and development will help us drive the business. We anticipate Chinese FIT will likely be delayed somewhat, so from a business standpoint, we'll see how that turns out. As Larry mentioned, if FIT changes in the marketplace or some of the changes that are taking place, we'll discuss somewhat with the included insert in the back of the presentation for your review.We'll continue to position ourselves in North America and have a significant base in the development business with strong demand from our customers in the pipeline continuing to develop. We believe this will buffer our concerns about what's happening in Europe and the business as a whole. So in general, good outlook for 2010 and excellent performance in 2009.To take a look now at the industry and overall, our forecast for growth. First Solar's share doubled year-over-year to 18% to 19% approximately, based on our preliminary market estimate. So Germany in 2009, we think ended up between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatt, and that's in line with our estimates related to the first of the year. Industry demand grows in 2010 to 7.5 gigawatt and we anticipate that the German FIT changes will happen approximately mid-year, potentially third quarter, which is driving a strong first half and a potential pause in the second half. First Solar's plan was really buffered by the Systems business and building up the pipeline that we have. So our forecast is roughly for Germany to be flat in 2010 at approximately 3 gigawatt. Some other estimates are calling at First to be somewhat larger as it could be. The FIT changes, we'll have to see what they did in the marketplace, overall. So we think we're conservative on that plan. We'll continue to diversify from a lot of the European base and customers by developing in North America and China. So that growth, I think, we're well positioned for and will help us in the uncertainties that exists in Europe.Our forecast from '09 to '12 is a 35% CAGR. So expect the German markets to decline over time as the FIT changes will start to make the market itself less financially attractive, and economics there in terms of sunlight and other things making it less sustainable over time. The transition markets we're focused on are U.S., China, France and Italy will continue to grow and probably over time, overtake Germany as a market. These economics will provide long-term growth for our business, especially as electricity prices start to grow.We're cautious somewhat on the FIT market, long-term and FIT will decline and drive those economics down. We're also focused on the growth potential that India provides, an announcement that over 20 gigawatt of renewables will be mandated by 2022. So we recognize there’s significant challenges there, but from a business standpoint an excellent growth for the future.Turning now to our strategy, really fundamentally our strategy is not changed from what was presented back in June of 2009. This is a slide that Mike used to present the business and our focus on migrating from existing subsidy business and marketplaces to transition markets. Our goal, and First Solar's goal overall, remains to reach sustainable market economics where we can compete with and be positioned versus fossil fuel in the electricity market. And it will grow the market in general, much more substantially than the subsidized markets that exist today. Our technology in driving the costs down will enable us to compete and we think, grow the market overall. The migration from these subsidy markets to transition markets, and most of the European markets are existing FIT subsidy markets today and are based on mandates. Some will move to transition markets based more on economics versus mandates, and several have the sun and electricity market that can be sustained based on economics, places like the United States, France, Italy, Spain and China.It's important to understand the transition and addresses our constraints to grow First Solar. We feel we're best positioned in the solar market and as a company, based on our integrated approach for the PPC project development and the ability to provide turnkey solutions to the utility customers. We think this will help us drive the technology adoption and the business growth in the future. One point for gigawatt is contracted with the PPA or RESOP pipeline, plus we have a number of unannounced projects under development.Driving costs down will help make solar affordable and we'll stay ahead of the FIT cuts. Work with utilities and regulators on infrastructures and policies and will continue to drive the business model closer to conventional types of markets where the economics improve over time, and the subsidy and market economics decline. So our focus is still to target sustainable markets and grow in transition areas for the future.Next phase now comparing those two markets, subsidized and transition market economics, the subsidies really are designed to create markets and they have. We can see that in Europe and especially in Germany and growing now Italy and France. The FIT decline over time to fossil fuel competitive levels may result in declining economics as we said. And some of these markets, do not have enough sun to make it a sustainable business in terms of economics. But the rate and timing of decline could cause a little bit of disruption in the market in Germany, specifically. So we're pursuing these transition markets and driving them to become sustainable, and be able to compete with fossil fuel peaking generation in areas like United States and China. Since we're close to the conventional generation, economics improved over time as PV system costs declined, energy costs rises with inflation. So we think through this, we also create opportunities for margin expansion. Overtime, the ability to gain share of that large fossil fuel peaking market. This will grow the overall pie for solar power, and create market opportunities for us to grow.We showed you in December the pipeline that we have for our Development business, so 1.4 gigawatt of contracted North American systems volume, 310 megawatt small to medium projects, 1,100 project in California including 300 megawatt of Sunlight project without PPA, pipeline spans from 2010 to 2014. And as I've said, this is a summary of what we presented during our Analyst Presentation in December. So a great pipeline and we continue to build on that pipeline for the future.We've taken a look at the U.S. utility contracts for PV and the solar thermal. First Solar had 16% share of the announced U.S. solar contracts. There is 8.6 gigawatt total announced, and although 71% is solar thermal, few of them have been built and the mix is shifting more to PV. And then in 2009, 65% of those that we're branded were PV. So First Solar has build a strong position in U.S. utilities market, and we have the integrated value chain of the project development, EPC, solid execution and the ability to drive lower and lower costs through our own panel production, but as well a balance of systems and our O&M contracts. So we feel really good about our position in the U.S. utility market and our growth for the future.We continue to drive copy smart and capacity growth, this pipeline we talked about, the 1.4 gigawatt pipeline is the leading position in the United States, and it led us to have the confidence to increase our capacity in Malaysia by adding plants five and six. Construction began with production ramping in the first half of 2011, that's 427 megawatts, bringing our total capacity to 1.7 gigawatt at Q4 run rate in 2011. Increased scale, low operating costs in tax tenants also helped us to drive profitability and the future expansion of our business. The two line plant partner with the EDFEN in France allows another 107 megawatt by Q1 of 2012 for a total of 1.8 gigawatt in capacity. All the work that we did to continue to drive our line run rate, increasing from Q4 of 53.4 to greater than 80 by 2014, as organic growth across 34 lines by 2012 approximately 2.7 gigawatt of production from the lines that we have in this business.So in summary, I'd like to say it was a really strong year despite all the volatility and challenges that we faced, strong module demand in the year and then specifically Q4. We completed the sale of both Blythe and Sarnia at 20. Louder revisions to the FIT that are being proposed, discussed now in the market that are going to drive some uncertainties, especially in the second half depending on what happens in the decisions for the future. So the first half is very strong demand. Orders look very strong. The second half we'll have to see. We believe Italy will start to accelerate in growth with a lot of the development that has taken place. And we believe that some of the challenges that may exist in Germany, we've more than offset by a lot of the pipeline at we mention during the presentation. So we feel really good about the outlook for growth in demand. Our Systems business in North America, the contracted pipeline is continuing to grow. Added 1.4 gigawatt now, we sold 100 megawatt AC systems in Q4 and as we discussed, approximately 50% to 55% of the announced utilities contracts we have in the PV market. Started construction of Malaysia to increase our capacity, and the site I mentioned as well in France. So we continue to look at additional capacity expansions from a business standpoint and see what we can do in the future. Nothing to announce at this time, but we are definitely considering those alternatives.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff to go through the financials. Jens?"

On today's call, we're reporting our 2009 financial results. These results confirm our guidance given back in October of 2008, despite one of the worst financial crisis in recent history, module oversupply and rapidly declining crystalline silicon prices, a global recession and a financial climate, had significantly impacted project financing and customer working capital.Annual net sales grew 66% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, operating margin was 32.9% and diluted EPS rose from $4.24 to $7.53. The 78% increase that includes the impact of the OptiSolar acquisition during 2009. We achieved the RONA of 25.5%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by approximately 12.4 percentage points.During the fourth quarter, we experienced strong module demand, aided by competitive pricing and rollback seasonal trends in advance of annual change in the feed-in-tariff in all core markets. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $641 million, an increase of $160 million compared to the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by higher module production volumes, system revenue recognition for the 20 megawatt AC Sarnia and 21 megawatt AC Blythe projects, as well as the slightly favorable euro exchange rate. These effects were partially offset by lower module ASPs.We produced 311 megawatts during the fourth quarter, up 6.4% compared to the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, we began the ramp of the new Perrysburg, Ohio line. The Ohio line expansion to full lines remains on plan to be at full capacity in the first quarter of 2010. Costs per watt produced for the fourth quarter was $0.84, down $0.01 and benefited from lower material costs, higher throughput and conversion efficiency, which was partially offset by $0.02 for the Ohio ramp, and $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Core manufacturing costs, excluding ramp penalty and stock-based compensation, declined 3.6% to $0.80 per watt quarter-over-quarter.Gross margin for the first quarter was 41.5%, down 9.4 percentage points over the prior quarter, in line with our previous guidance. About 5.9 percentage points of the decline was due to the significant increase in EPC/Development business which represented approximately 14% of our fourth quarter net sales. In addition, we amortized a portion of the project assets related to the OptiSolar acquisition, with the realization of Phase I of Sarnia. The ramp penalty associated with the Ohio ramps impacted gross margins unfavorably by another percentage point. Volume margins declined approximately 1% percentage points quarter-over-quarter due to less than favorable economics of the Blythe PPA.Operating expenses increased by $39.3 million sequentially to $121.5 million due to $22.9 million a one-time personal expenses, approximately $7 million of other non-recurring expenses primarily attributable to a dispute with the Dutch Bankruptcy Court, and $9.1 million of turnaround effect of one-time benefits recorded during the third quarter. On an annualized basis, operating expenses stayed approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. While operating income for the fourth quarter was $144.7 million or 22.6% of net sales, compared to $162.8 million or 33.9% during the prior quarter.  Slide 24 provides a reconciliation between the third and fourth quarter operating margins, reflecting the changes in gross margin and one-time operating expenses discussed earlier. Net income for the fourth quarter was $141.6 million or $1.65 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 5.8% and 6.7% for the fiscal year 2009.For the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $345 million, driven by operating cash flow of $414 million. We spent $69 million for capital equipment during the fourth quarter against depreciation of $37 million. For the full year, free cash flow reached $395 million after financing $280 million of capital expenditures. Cash and all other marketable securities increased by $284 million quarter-over-quarter to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, principally due to our free cash flow performance, partially offset by cash usage and other investment activities. Our debt to equity ratio remains very low at 7% providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry.To further exemplify of the degree of differentiation, Slide 28 compares First Solar's balance sheet to the aggregate of 12 fuel play competitors, showing a $939 million net cash position for First Solar and a cash deficit of $5 billion for the Pier Group based on the latest reported results and our estimates.With our fourth quarter net results and net sales breaking through the $2 billion trailing fourth quarter performance. First Solar achieved the last quantitative metric for an investment grade company. As the industry moves into the transitional markets, access to low-cost capital for large-scale project finance becomes an imperative. This is becoming an important competitive advantage. We expect the rating agencies will focus on the quality of each project, the underlying debt structures, service on warranty agreements and the balance sheets backing them. Strategic and equity investor consider the financial strengths of the system developer to ensure a multiyear project builds can be fulfilled. 25-year warranties are backed, and operations and maintenance contracts are supported. We believe we are well-positioned to lead the growth into transition in sustainable markets enabled by our proprietary technology, the superior business model and the strong balance sheet.This brings me to our guidance for 2010, which remains unchanged since our December meeting. Just to summarize, net sales are expected to range from $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. There's modular net sales of $2.1 billion and EPC project development sales of $600 million to $800 million. Gross margins of 38%, with modular gross margins of 48% to 50% and EPC project development gross margins of 5% to 6%. We expect plant start up cost of approximately $25 million, primarily from Malaysia plants five and six in the second half of 2010. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $95 million to $105 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold.GAAP operating margin is expected to be 23% to 24% with module operating margins of 30% to 33% and EPC operating margins of break even levels. We expect our 2009 tax rate to be around 15%. Year end 2010 fully-diluted share count guidance has an estimated 86 to 87 million shares. EPS remains at $1.6 and $0.05, $6.5 to $6.85% or. CapEx for the year is expected to be $500 million to $550 million. Operating cash flow, $730 million to $790 million Cap, free cash flow, $180 million to $290 million. At this, we expect our RONA performance of 16% to 18% it. And we expected it to scale our EPC and project development business to achieve our long-term goal of 20%.Slide 32 shows our quarterly profile of revenues by segment and the mixed impact on our consolidated margin percentage in our December guidance meeting. We feel urged to repeat the content of the slide due to numerous inconsistencies and reasonably published research report following our guidance meeting in December. Please note that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will have 100%. While reading the slide vertically, will likely lead to another late night of model revisions. The majority of our EPC and project development revenues are expected to be recognized in the second half of 2010. The first quarter is largely driven by module sales. Module and consolidated revenues are expected to decline in the second quarter as more production capacity is being allocated to the systems business, driving revenue increases for both module and EPC project development in Q3 and Q4. Keep in mind that we will be allocating modules in advance of revenue recognition, causing a dip in second quarter consolidated net sales. The margin profile follows that trend as module margins stay fairly flat with an expected slight decline in Q2 due to EPC inventory builds. However, the growing EPC revenue mix is expected to dilute our consolidated margin between the second and first quarter.As stated in our December meeting, we have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. These assumptions remain largely unchanged. Please refer to the back of this presentation for the slide outlining them. These assumption are, however, subject to change, representing opportunities and risk. We currently believe our guidance balances these factors. We see opportunities from the potential to increase a percent of captive business in 2010, which improves module ASPs. In addition, the expected 2011 change and Italy’s feed-in could drive increased amount in the second half of 2010, and France recent change in feed-in tariff together with our strong partnership could promote further growth in that region.The recent dollar-euro volatility currently creates risk to our guidance. We are providing sensitivity that a $0.01 deviation from our assumed $1.40 per euro exchange rate impacts revenues for 2010 by approximately $10 million, and net income by $6 million. We continue to have uncertainty on the amount of German feed-in tariff cuts by segment and the impact on module ASP, the potential demand part and the overall implementation timing. Any deviation from our assumptions could cause our actual results to differ from our guidance.With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

Actually quite a few PPAs have been executed in recent history, slightly above that MPR and PPA prices in these negotiations happen to be slightly higher and they seem to be passing through the CPUC. Obviously, a decline in natural gas prices and the related reduction in MPR could have an impact right on our long-term outlook with respect to the economics of the California market. We are seeing that as MTR goal slightly go down and will fluctuate. Our focus is essentially to ensure that we drive our cost reductions further down right, because somewhat regardless long-term impact or pricing in the MPR, we need to be competitive with fossil fuels, which is somewhat independent of the MPR. Essentially, as you know, the MPR makes assumptions right on long-term gas prices. Those are still in the $650 to $750 range in those assumptions which I think overall, I think is in line with our long-term assumption in the market segment.

The shorter essentially, the lead time as to the feed-in tariff aggression becoming active requires the much swifter reaction throughout the overall value shale as it relates to reorganizing and reallocating the economics. So one thing we will leave we have successfully done as we have acquired as you know a significant captive pipeline we're executing ourselves, that we believe allows us a good degree of mitigation with respect to these types of demand uncertainties. That's about that crystalline prices. Essentially, say stated I think in the December meeting, we assumed by year end 2010, a spot price of $40 per kilogram per poly come with essentially $0.75 manufacturing cost of crystalline competitors. And they would operate at roughly a 20% growth margin. So that's what we assume will for the piece of business where we're competing head to head with these companies."

As we mentioned, obviously, there is potential depending on what type of changes from market segment we get from the German feed-in tariff. you need a recalibration every distribution channels so this is particularly true. If you look at agricultural land and the possibility of singling free field installation with a much higher feed-in tariff migration. As you know, historically, we've operated in and around roughly a 50/50 split between rooftops and tree fields so we do have channel access to rooftops. If these cuts came through, obviously, some of our channel partners would have to get more aggressive in rooftop, which means overall competitive dynamics of the Schumer product into that segment would generally increase, given our cost leadership, we would leave compete quite favorably in that market. That market segment, as you know, with also that include probably the smaller commercial rooftops, which historically have not been yet been a target market for us. But I think as a comment and the comment was with respect to that they could be, again depending on the lead time you have with respect to the change of becoming active, there could be essentially some disruptiveness out of that.

As it relates to accessing in the first quarter, we reported to that we had one-time benefit in the.  As it relates to OpEx structure of about $9.3 million. Then in the fourth quarter essentially, between hiring rough and the associated expense is there, one of our senior executives parting with the company made up a majority of the one-time events as we had in the fourth quarter. Also as I mentioned, the book of reserves saying is we got note is from the Dutch bankruptcy courts that they were in disagreement with essentially monetizing one of the bank guarantees that originated out of the bankruptcy of echoes screen earlier in 2009."

Obviously, we like to reinvest the majority of our cash flows into the build-out of manufacturing capacity as that continues to build the core of our business, that's what drives cost and LCOE down for the industry. As we look at some of the very large projects develop meant effort has some degree of cash consumption we utilize right now. We like to have a buffer and a strong balance sheet, even though obviously, we were unable to earn our RONA target out of this cash balance. The strength of the balance sheet as a whole allows us right to achieve significant benefits on the project financing side, just due to the overall aspect of credit quality within the company. I think time will tell and I think the growth rates of this industry will tell with respect to how these cash flows continue to trend. We believe we will operate in the free cash flow positive bases, and maybe a point in time in our future, I wouldn't say that in the next, next two or three years, but maybe in the other future, where we might return and start to return some of the cash generation back to our shareholders. With relate to the operating expenses, essentially, I think right now, there's nothing on the radar screen for us as it relates to a one-time item. So I think if you kind of take the Q4 run rate, adjusted for those onetime items and then keep in mind, Q1 usually a slight increase in your expenses due to pay roll taxes, et cetera, and also a merit increases usually take effect during the time period. So you should see a gradual increase. Then I think it's a fairly linear function growth across the quarters against the guidance."

Other impacts are if you look at Q4, the Q4 module margins were impacted as I mentioned in my remarks, unfavorably due to the economics in the Blythe project. You may recall the Blythe PPA signed very early and came to some degree with the acquisition of Turner renewables. Which probably to some degree was surprised I would say, 20 plus percent under the markets. So there's an impact out of that, just in the fourth quarter.

So obviously, the rating on the project is subject to the quality of the off-taker with respect to the electricity into the counter party of the PPA is. It is very much subject to how you structure the capital structure of the project. And then what we have learned is also highly subject to the quality of essentially the provider of the system, and with respect to warranties, with respect execution, construction financing, as well as in the long-term loan and performance.

Thanks to everyone for joining us today for our Q4 call and 2009 summary. Starting off here to talk about Q4, we had a strong finish to the year, and we achieved our 2009 guidance which we set over a year ago. So despite all the challenges and changes in the market, we did very, very well. Q4 net sales were $641 million, up 33% quarter-over-quarter. We sold Sarnia and Blythe sites and draw $142 million in net income. For the year, $2.1 billion in net sales, up 66% and Q4 diluted EPS was $1.65, bringing the 2009 EPS to $7.53, which was up 78% year-over-year.Strong cash position as well. We finished the year at $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and generated an additional $395 million free cash flow. We continue to execute well in operations and in Q4, produced 311 megawatts and finished the year with 1.1 gigawatts of production in 2009. We achieved a milestone of over 2 gigawatts cumulative production in sales, so great, great finish to the year. Our annualized capacity per line rose to 53.4 megawatts, and our efficiency was up to 11.1%. Module cost was down to $0.84, was impacted by $0.02 roughly due to the Ohio start up, and $0.02 due to SBC. So our core costs for the quarter-to-quarter was down $0.03 to $0.80 a watt.  Total annual costs were down 19% from $1.8 to $0.87. We also started to expand our capacity in Malaysia, plants five and six and adding eight additional lines. Now in terms of the Systems business and our market development, we sold projects totaling 100 megawatts and shows both the utility and investors have an appetite for solar projects and projects in sales. We continue to progress our Development business as well. We're fast-track for BLM at the Sunlight project which is 550 megawatt, and we'll start construction in Q4 of 2010. We added one dozen Edison Mission sites to First Solar's project development portfolio, roughly 20 to 150 megawatts sites on private lands, which diversifies our project base from BLM projects.We also start the construction of two new utility scale plants, 48 megawatt AC Copper Mountain, as the expansion of El Dorado for sulfur generation, 60 megawatt AC Sarnia, Ontario expansion. For Enbridge, North American partners making progress in developing sites as well. PNM 22 megawatt EPC agreement and our partner Juwi sold Blue Wing San Antonio project to Duke Energy as well. So great progress on the project side and our customer side.Turning now to 2010 industry outlook. Our market environment was significantly better than 2009, but uncertainties remain. Larry mentioned the German FIT change, and we think it will drive strong first half demand and some uncertainty in the second half. Italy 2011 FIT changes will benefit, we believe, the second half of 2010. France, Italy and Spain grow and supported by irradiance and attractive IRs will continue to drive our growth in the business. U.S. utilities are getting more focused on solar projects, and can be executed to comply with both the RPS standards and a lot of ownership interest in driving both the base assets and technology adoption.In Canada, the RESOP has driven attractive returns. We have a 200 megawatt pipeline, take content and development will help us drive the business. We anticipate Chinese FIT will likely be delayed somewhat, so from a business standpoint, we'll see how that turns out. As Larry mentioned, if FIT changes in the marketplace or some of the changes that are taking place, we'll discuss somewhat with the included insert in the back of the presentation for your review.We'll continue to position ourselves in North America and have a significant base in the development business with strong demand from our customers in the pipeline continuing to develop. We believe this will buffer our concerns about what's happening in Europe and the business as a whole. So in general, good outlook for 2010 and excellent performance in 2009.To take a look now at the industry and overall, our forecast for growth. First Solar's share doubled year-over-year to 18% to 19% approximately, based on our preliminary market estimate. So Germany in 2009, we think ended up between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatt, and that's in line with our estimates related to the first of the year. Industry demand grows in 2010 to 7.5 gigawatt and we anticipate that the German FIT changes will happen approximately mid-year, potentially third quarter, which is driving a strong first half and a potential pause in the second half. First Solar's plan was really buffered by the Systems business and building up the pipeline that we have. So our forecast is roughly for Germany to be flat in 2010 at approximately 3 gigawatt. Some other estimates are calling at First to be somewhat larger as it could be. The FIT changes, we'll have to see what they did in the marketplace, overall. So we think we're conservative on that plan. We'll continue to diversify from a lot of the European base and customers by developing in North America and China. So that growth, I think, we're well positioned for and will help us in the uncertainties that exists in Europe.Our forecast from '09 to '12 is a 35% CAGR. So expect the German markets to decline over time as the FIT changes will start to make the market itself less financially attractive, and economics there in terms of sunlight and other things making it less sustainable over time. The transition markets we're focused on are U.S., China, France and Italy will continue to grow and probably over time, overtake Germany as a market. These economics will provide long-term growth for our business, especially as electricity prices start to grow.We're cautious somewhat on the FIT market, long-term and FIT will decline and drive those economics down. We're also focused on the growth potential that India provides, an announcement that over 20 gigawatt of renewables will be mandated by 2022. So we recognize there’s significant challenges there, but from a business standpoint an excellent growth for the future.Turning now to our strategy, really fundamentally our strategy is not changed from what was presented back in June of 2009. This is a slide that Mike used to present the business and our focus on migrating from existing subsidy business and marketplaces to transition markets. Our goal, and First Solar's goal overall, remains to reach sustainable market economics where we can compete with and be positioned versus fossil fuel in the electricity market. And it will grow the market in general, much more substantially than the subsidized markets that exist today. Our technology in driving the costs down will enable us to compete and we think, grow the market overall. The migration from these subsidy markets to transition markets, and most of the European markets are existing FIT subsidy markets today and are based on mandates. Some will move to transition markets based more on economics versus mandates, and several have the sun and electricity market that can be sustained based on economics, places like the United States, France, Italy, Spain and China.It's important to understand the transition and addresses our constraints to grow First Solar. We feel we're best positioned in the solar market and as a company, based on our integrated approach for the PPC project development and the ability to provide turnkey solutions to the utility customers. We think this will help us drive the technology adoption and the business growth in the future. One point for gigawatt is contracted with the PPA or RESOP pipeline, plus we have a number of unannounced projects under development.Driving costs down will help make solar affordable and we'll stay ahead of the FIT cuts. Work with utilities and regulators on infrastructures and policies and will continue to drive the business model closer to conventional types of markets where the economics improve over time, and the subsidy and market economics decline. So our focus is still to target sustainable markets and grow in transition areas for the future.Next phase now comparing those two markets, subsidized and transition market economics, the subsidies really are designed to create markets and they have. We can see that in Europe and especially in Germany and growing now Italy and France. The FIT decline over time to fossil fuel competitive levels may result in declining economics as we said. And some of these markets, do not have enough sun to make it a sustainable business in terms of economics. But the rate and timing of decline could cause a little bit of disruption in the market in Germany, specifically. So we're pursuing these transition markets and driving them to become sustainable, and be able to compete with fossil fuel peaking generation in areas like United States and China. Since we're close to the conventional generation, economics improved over time as PV system costs declined, energy costs rises with inflation. So we think through this, we also create opportunities for margin expansion. Overtime, the ability to gain share of that large fossil fuel peaking market. This will grow the overall pie for solar power, and create market opportunities for us to grow.We showed you in December the pipeline that we have for our Development business, so 1.4 gigawatt of contracted North American systems volume, 310 megawatt small to medium projects, 1,100 project in California including 300 megawatt of Sunlight project without PPA, pipeline spans from 2010 to 2014. And as I've said, this is a summary of what we presented during our Analyst Presentation in December. So a great pipeline and we continue to build on that pipeline for the future.We've taken a look at the U.S. utility contracts for PV and the solar thermal. First Solar had 16% share of the announced U.S. solar contracts. There is 8.6 gigawatt total announced, and although 71% is solar thermal, few of them have been built and the mix is shifting more to PV. And then in 2009, 65% of those that we're branded were PV. So First Solar has build a strong position in U.S. utilities market, and we have the integrated value chain of the project development, EPC, solid execution and the ability to drive lower and lower costs through our own panel production, but as well a balance of systems and our O&M contracts. So we feel really good about our position in the U.S. utility market and our growth for the future.We continue to drive copy smart and capacity growth, this pipeline we talked about, the 1.4 gigawatt pipeline is the leading position in the United States, and it led us to have the confidence to increase our capacity in Malaysia by adding plants five and six. Construction began with production ramping in the first half of 2011, that's 427 megawatts, bringing our total capacity to 1.7 gigawatt at Q4 run rate in 2011. Increased scale, low operating costs in tax tenants also helped us to drive profitability and the future expansion of our business. The two line plant partner with the EDFEN in France allows another 107 megawatt by Q1 of 2012 for a total of 1.8 gigawatt in capacity. All the work that we did to continue to drive our line run rate, increasing from Q4 of 53.4 to greater than 80 by 2014, as organic growth across 34 lines by 2012 approximately 2.7 gigawatt of production from the lines that we have in this business.So in summary, I'd like to say it was a really strong year despite all the volatility and challenges that we faced, strong module demand in the year and then specifically Q4. We completed the sale of both Blythe and Sarnia at 20. Louder revisions to the FIT that are being proposed, discussed now in the market that are going to drive some uncertainties, especially in the second half depending on what happens in the decisions for the future. So the first half is very strong demand. Orders look very strong. The second half we'll have to see. We believe Italy will start to accelerate in growth with a lot of the development that has taken place. And we believe that some of the challenges that may exist in Germany, we've more than offset by a lot of the pipeline at we mention during the presentation. So we feel really good about the outlook for growth in demand. Our Systems business in North America, the contracted pipeline is continuing to grow. Added 1.4 gigawatt now, we sold 100 megawatt AC systems in Q4 and as we discussed, approximately 50% to 55% of the announced utilities contracts we have in the PV market. Started construction of Malaysia to increase our capacity, and the site I mentioned as well in France. So we continue to look at additional capacity expansions from a business standpoint and see what we can do in the future. Nothing to announce at this time, but we are definitely considering those alternatives.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff to go through the financials. Jens?"

On today's call, we're reporting our 2009 financial results. These results confirm our guidance given back in October of 2008, despite one of the worst financial crisis in recent history, module oversupply and rapidly declining crystalline silicon prices, a global recession and a financial climate, had significantly impacted project financing and customer working capital.Annual net sales grew 66% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, operating margin was 32.9% and diluted EPS rose from $4.24 to $7.53. The 78% increase that includes the impact of the OptiSolar acquisition during 2009. We achieved the RONA of 25.5%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by approximately 12.4 percentage points.During the fourth quarter, we experienced strong module demand, aided by competitive pricing and rollback seasonal trends in advance of annual change in the feed-in-tariff in all core markets. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $641 million, an increase of $160 million compared to the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by higher module production volumes, system revenue recognition for the 20 megawatt AC Sarnia and 21 megawatt AC Blythe projects, as well as the slightly favorable euro exchange rate. These effects were partially offset by lower module ASPs.We produced 311 megawatts during the fourth quarter, up 6.4% compared to the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, we began the ramp of the new Perrysburg, Ohio line. The Ohio line expansion to full lines remains on plan to be at full capacity in the first quarter of 2010. Costs per watt produced for the fourth quarter was $0.84, down $0.01 and benefited from lower material costs, higher throughput and conversion efficiency, which was partially offset by $0.02 for the Ohio ramp, and $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Core manufacturing costs, excluding ramp penalty and stock-based compensation, declined 3.6% to $0.80 per watt quarter-over-quarter.Gross margin for the first quarter was 41.5%, down 9.4 percentage points over the prior quarter, in line with our previous guidance. About 5.9 percentage points of the decline was due to the significant increase in EPC/Development business which represented approximately 14% of our fourth quarter net sales. In addition, we amortized a portion of the project assets related to the OptiSolar acquisition, with the realization of Phase I of Sarnia. The ramp penalty associated with the Ohio ramps impacted gross margins unfavorably by another percentage point. Volume margins declined approximately 1% percentage points quarter-over-quarter due to less than favorable economics of the Blythe PPA.Operating expenses increased by $39.3 million sequentially to $121.5 million due to $22.9 million a one-time personal expenses, approximately $7 million of other non-recurring expenses primarily attributable to a dispute with the Dutch Bankruptcy Court, and $9.1 million of turnaround effect of one-time benefits recorded during the third quarter. On an annualized basis, operating expenses stayed approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. While operating income for the fourth quarter was $144.7 million or 22.6% of net sales, compared to $162.8 million or 33.9% during the prior quarter.  Slide 24 provides a reconciliation between the third and fourth quarter operating margins, reflecting the changes in gross margin and one-time operating expenses discussed earlier. Net income for the fourth quarter was $141.6 million or $1.65 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 5.8% and 6.7% for the fiscal year 2009.For the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $345 million, driven by operating cash flow of $414 million. We spent $69 million for capital equipment during the fourth quarter against depreciation of $37 million. For the full year, free cash flow reached $395 million after financing $280 million of capital expenditures. Cash and all other marketable securities increased by $284 million quarter-over-quarter to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, principally due to our free cash flow performance, partially offset by cash usage and other investment activities. Our debt to equity ratio remains very low at 7% providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry.To further exemplify of the degree of differentiation, Slide 28 compares First Solar's balance sheet to the aggregate of 12 fuel play competitors, showing a $939 million net cash position for First Solar and a cash deficit of $5 billion for the Pier Group based on the latest reported results and our estimates.With our fourth quarter net results and net sales breaking through the $2 billion trailing fourth quarter performance. First Solar achieved the last quantitative metric for an investment grade company. As the industry moves into the transitional markets, access to low-cost capital for large-scale project finance becomes an imperative. This is becoming an important competitive advantage. We expect the rating agencies will focus on the quality of each project, the underlying debt structures, service on warranty agreements and the balance sheets backing them. Strategic and equity investor consider the financial strengths of the system developer to ensure a multiyear project builds can be fulfilled. 25-year warranties are backed, and operations and maintenance contracts are supported. We believe we are well-positioned to lead the growth into transition in sustainable markets enabled by our proprietary technology, the superior business model and the strong balance sheet.This brings me to our guidance for 2010, which remains unchanged since our December meeting. Just to summarize, net sales are expected to range from $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. There's modular net sales of $2.1 billion and EPC project development sales of $600 million to $800 million. Gross margins of 38%, with modular gross margins of 48% to 50% and EPC project development gross margins of 5% to 6%. We expect plant start up cost of approximately $25 million, primarily from Malaysia plants five and six in the second half of 2010. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $95 million to $105 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold.GAAP operating margin is expected to be 23% to 24% with module operating margins of 30% to 33% and EPC operating margins of break even levels. We expect our 2009 tax rate to be around 15%. Year end 2010 fully-diluted share count guidance has an estimated 86 to 87 million shares. EPS remains at $1.6 and $0.05, $6.5 to $6.85% or. CapEx for the year is expected to be $500 million to $550 million. Operating cash flow, $730 million to $790 million Cap, free cash flow, $180 million to $290 million. At this, we expect our RONA performance of 16% to 18% it. And we expected it to scale our EPC and project development business to achieve our long-term goal of 20%.Slide 32 shows our quarterly profile of revenues by segment and the mixed impact on our consolidated margin percentage in our December guidance meeting. We feel urged to repeat the content of the slide due to numerous inconsistencies and reasonably published research report following our guidance meeting in December. Please note that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will have 100%. While reading the slide vertically, will likely lead to another late night of model revisions. The majority of our EPC and project development revenues are expected to be recognized in the second half of 2010. The first quarter is largely driven by module sales. Module and consolidated revenues are expected to decline in the second quarter as more production capacity is being allocated to the systems business, driving revenue increases for both module and EPC project development in Q3 and Q4. Keep in mind that we will be allocating modules in advance of revenue recognition, causing a dip in second quarter consolidated net sales. The margin profile follows that trend as module margins stay fairly flat with an expected slight decline in Q2 due to EPC inventory builds. However, the growing EPC revenue mix is expected to dilute our consolidated margin between the second and first quarter.As stated in our December meeting, we have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. These assumptions remain largely unchanged. Please refer to the back of this presentation for the slide outlining them. These assumption are, however, subject to change, representing opportunities and risk. We currently believe our guidance balances these factors. We see opportunities from the potential to increase a percent of captive business in 2010, which improves module ASPs. In addition, the expected 2011 change and Italy’s feed-in could drive increased amount in the second half of 2010, and France's recent change in feed-in tariff together with our strong partnership could promote further growth in that region.The recent dollar-euro volatility currently creates risk to our guidance. We are providing sensitivity that a $0.01 deviation from our assumed $1.40 per euro exchange rate impacts revenues for 2010 by approximately $10 million, and net income by $6 million. We continue to have uncertainty on the amount of German feed-in tariff cuts by segment and the impact on module ASP, the potential demand part and the overall implementation timing. Any deviation from our assumptions could cause our actual results to differ from our guidance.With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

Obviously, a decline in natural gas prices and the related reduction in MPR could have an impact right on our long-term outlook with respect to the economics of the California market. We are seeing that as MTR goal slightly go down and will fluctuate. Our focus is essentially to ensure that we drive our cost reductions further down right, because somewhat regardless long-term impact or pricing in the MPR, we need to be competitive with fossil fuels, which is somewhat independent of the MPR. Essentially, as you know, the MPR makes assumptions right on long-term gas prices. Those are still in the $650 to $750 range in those assumptions which I think overall, I think is in line with our long-term assumption in the market segment.

The shorter essentially, the lead time as to the feed-in tariff aggression becoming active requires the much swifter reaction throughout the overall value shale as it relates to reorganizing and reallocating the economics. So one thing we will leave we have successfully done as we have acquired as you know a significant captive pipeline we're executing ourselves, that we believe allows us a good degree of mitigation with respect to these types of demand uncertainties. That's about that crystalline prices. Essentially, say stated I think in the December meeting, we assumed by year end 2010, a spot price of $40 per kilogram per poly come with essentially $0.75 manufacturing cost of crystalline competitors. And they would operate at roughly a 20% growth margin. So that's what we assume will for the piece of business where we're competing head to head with these companies."

If you look at agricultural land and the possibility of singling free field installation with a much higher feed-in tariff migration. As you know, historically, we've operated in and around roughly a 50/50 split between rooftops and tree fields so we do have channel access to rooftops. If these cuts came through, obviously, some of our channel partners would have to get more aggressive in rooftop, which means overall competitive dynamics of the Schumer product into that segment would generally increase, given our cost leadership, we would leave compete quite favorably in that market. That market segment, as you know, with also that include probably the smaller commercial rooftops, which historically have not been yet been a target market for us.

Q1 I assume is down quite a bit because of the one-time you just talk about the shape of the expense curve during 2010 please?"

Obvi",345,"So I would say generally since we are deploying return of that asset as a metric, we like it because it's a discipline opponents you even if the amount of cash euro holding on the balance sheet because of a cash balance factored into the calculation. Obviously, we like to reinvest the majority of our cash flows into the build-out of manufacturing capacity as that continues to build the core of our business, that's what drives cost and LCOE down for the industry. As we look at some of the very large projects develop meant effort has some degree of cash consumption we utilize right now. We like to have a buffer and a strong balance sheet, even though obviously, we were unable to earn our RONA target out of this cash balance. The strength of the balance sheet as a whole allows us right to achieve significant benefits on the project financing side, just due to the overall aspect of credit quality within the company. I think time will tell and I think the growth rates of this industry will tell with respect to how these cash flows continue to trend. We believe we will operate in the free cash flow positive bases, and maybe a point in time in our future, I wouldn't say that in the next, next two or three years, but maybe in the other future, where we might return and start to return some of the cash generation back to our shareholders. With relate to the operating expenses, essentially, I think right now, there's nothing on the radar screen for us as it relates to a one-time item. So I think if you kind of take the Q4 run rate, adjusted for those onetime items and then keep in mind, Q1 usually a slight increase in your expenses due to pay roll taxes, et cetera, and also a merit increases usually take effect during the time period. So you should see a gradual increase. Then I think it's a fairly linear function growth across the quarters against the guidance."

Other impacts are if you look at Q4, the Q4 module margins were impacted as I mentioned in my remarks, unfavorably due to the economics in the Blythe project. You may recall the Blythe PPA signed very early and came to some degree with the acquisition of Turner renewables. Which probably to some degree was surprised I would say, 20 plus percent under the markets. So there's an impact out of that, just in the fourth quarter.

And the essentially start to issue solar bonds either in a private placement or in a 144 type A mechanism. As the initial feedback we're getting out of the capital source appears to be favorable and open. So obviously, the rating on the project is subject to the quality of the off-taker with respect to the electricity into the counter party of the PPA is. It is very much subject to how you structure the capital structure of the project. And then what we have learned is also highly subject to the quality of essentially the provider of the system, and with respect to warranties, with respect execution, construction financing, as well as in the long-term loan and performance. All of these pieces factor in. As you know, you can just look at essentially some of the yield curves. There's obviously a significant separation between achieving investment grade ratings on these types of projects or for the Corporation. Were sitting essentially in a shock environment. So from that perspective, we are pursuing this. I think we haven't announced any ratings yet, but essentially, I think that's where we stand, that's how we look at it. So if you think about our overall roadmap as it relates to reducing LCOE capital costs that become significant part of the equation, and we believe we compete very favorably in that assessment."

Thanks to everyone for joining us today for our Q4 call and 2009 summary. Starting off here to talk about Q4, we had a strong finish to the year, and we achieved our 2009 guidance which we set over a year ago. So despite all the challenges and changes in the market, we did very, very well. Q4 net sales were $641 million, up 33% quarter-over-quarter. We sold Sarnia and Blythe sites and draw $142 million in net income. For the year, a $2.1 billion in net sales, up 66% and Q4 diluted EPS was $1.65, bringing the 2009 EPS to $7.53, which was up 78% year-over-year.Strong cash position as well, we finished the year with $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and generated an additional $395 million free cash flow. We continue to execute well in operations and in Q4, produced 311 megawatts and finished the year with 1.1 gigawatts of production in 2009. We achieved a milestone of over 2 gigawatts cumulative production in sales, so great, great finish to the year. Our annualized capacity per line rose to 53.4 megawatts, and our efficiency was up to 11.1%. Module cost was down to $0.84, was impacted by $0.02 roughly due to the Ohio start up, and $0.02 due to SBC. So our core costs for the quarter-to-quarter was down $0.03 to $0.80 a watt.  Total annual costs were down 19% from $1.8 to $0.87. We also started to expand our capacity in Malaysia, plants five and six and adding eight additional lines. Now in terms of the Systems business and our market development, we sold projects totaling 100 megawatts and shows both the utility and investors have an appetite for solar projects and projects in sales. We continue to progress our Development business as well. We're fast-track for BLM at the Sunlight project which is 550 megawatt, and we'll start construction in Q4 of 2010. We added one dozen Edison Mission sites to First Solar's project development portfolio, roughly 20 to 150 megawatts sites on private lands, which diversifies our project base from BLM projects.We also start the construction of two new utility scale plants, 48 megawatt AC Copper Mountain, as the expansion of El Dorado for sulfur generation, 60 megawatt AC Sarnia, Ontario expansion. For Enbridge, North American partners making progress in developing sites as well. PNM 22 megawatt EPC agreement and our partner Juwi sold Blue Wing San Antonio project to Duke Energy as well. So great progress on the project side and our customer side.Turning now to 2010 industry outlook. Our market environment was significantly better than 2009, but uncertainties remain. Larry mentioned the German FIT change, and we think it will drive strong first half demand and some uncertainty in the second half. Italy 2011 FIT changes will benefit, we believe, the second half of 2010. France, Italy and Spain grow and supported by Radiance [ph] and attractive IRs will continue to drive our growth in the business. U.S. utilities are getting more focused on solar projects, and can be executed to comply with both the RPS standards and a lot of ownership interest in driving both the base assets and technology adoption.In Canada, the RESOP has driven attractive returns. We have a 200 megawatt pipeline, take content and development will help us drive the business. We anticipate Chinese FIT will likely be delayed somewhat, so from a business standpoint, we'll see how that turns out. As Larry mentioned, if FIT changes in the marketplace or some of the changes that are taking place, we'll discuss somewhat with the included insert in the back of the presentation for your review.We'll continue to position ourselves in North America and have a significant base in the development business with strong demand from our customers in the pipeline continuing to develop. We believe this will buffer our concerns about what's happening in Europe and the business as a whole. So in general, good outlook for 2010 and excellent performance in 2009.To take a look now at the industry and overall, our forecast for growth. First Solar's share doubled year-over-year to 18% to 19% approximately, based on our preliminary market estimate. So Germany in 2009, we think ended up between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatt, and that's in line with our estimates related to the first of the year. Industry demand grows in 2010 to 7.5 gigawatt and we anticipate that the German FIT changes will happen approximately mid-year, potentially third quarter, which is driving a strong first half and a potential pause in the second half. First Solar's plan was really buffered by the Systems business and building up the pipeline that we have. So our forecast is roughly for Germany to be flat in 2010 at approximately 3 gigawatt. Some other estimates are calling at First to be somewhat larger as it could be. The FIT changes, we'll have to see what they did in the marketplace, overall. So we think we're conservative on that plan. We'll continue to diversify from a lot of the European base and customers by developing in North America and China. So that growth, I think, we're well positioned for and will help us in the uncertainties that exists in Europe.Our forecast from '09 to '12 is a 35% CAGR. So expect the German markets to decline over time as the FIT changes will start to make the market itself less financially attractive, and economics there in terms of sunlight and other things making it less sustainable over time. The transition markets we're focused on are U.S., China, France and Italy will continue to grow and probably over time, overtake Germany as a market. Its economics will provide long-term growth for our business, especially as electricity prices start to grow.We're cautious somewhat on the FIT market, long-term and FIT will decline and drive those economics down. We're also focused on the growth potential that India provides, an announcement to over 20 gigawatt of renewables remandated by 2022. So we recognize the significant challenges there, but from a business standpoint, an excellent growth for the future.Turning now to our strategy, really fundamentally, our strategy is not changed from what was presented back in June of 2009. There's a slide that Mike used to present the business and our focus on migrating from existing subsidy business and market places to transition markets. Our goal and First Solar's goal overall remains to reach sustainable market economics, where we can compete with and be positioned versus fossil fuel in any electricity market. And it will grow the market in general, much more substantially than the subsidized markets that exist today. Our technology in driving the costs down will enable us to compete and we think, grow the market overall. The migration from these subsidy markets to transition markets, and most of the European markets are existing FIT subsidy markets today and are based on mandates. Some will move to transition markets based more on economics versus mandates, and several have the sun and electricity market that can be sustained based on economics, places like the United States, France, Italy, Spain and China.It's important to understand the transition and addresses our constraints to grow First Solar. We feel we're best positioned in the solar market and as a company, based on our integrated approach for the PPC project development and the ability to provide turnkey solutions to the utility customers. We think this will help us drive the technology adoption and the business growth in the future. One point for gigawatt is contracted with the PPA or RESOP pipeline, plus we have a number of unannounced projects under development.Driving costs down will help make solar affordable and we'll stay ahead of the FiT cuts. Work with utilities and regulators on infrastructures and policies and will continue to drive the business model closer to conventional types of markets where the economics improve over time, and the subsidy and market economics decline. So our focus is still to target sustainable markets and grow in transition areas for the future.Next phase now comparing those two markets, subsidized and transition market economics, the subsidies really are designed to create markets and they have. We can see that in Europe and especially in Germany and growing now Italy and France. The FiT decline over time to fossil fuel competitive levels may result in declining economics as we said. And some of these markets, do not have enough sun to make it a sustainable business in terms of economics. But the rate and timing of decline could cause a little bit of disruption in the market in Germany, specifically. So we're pursuing these transition markets and driving them to become sustainable, and be able to compete with fossil fuel peaking generation in areas like United States and China. Since we're close to the conventional generation, economics improved over time as PV system costs declined, energy costs rises with inflation. So we think through this, we also create opportunities for margin expansion. Overtime, the ability to gain share of that large fossil fuel peaking market. This will grow the overall pie for solar power, and create market opportunities for us to grow.We showed you in December the pipeline that we have for our Development business, so 1.4 gigawatt of contracted North American systems volume, 310 megawatt small to medium projects, 1,100 project in California including 300 megawatt of Sunlight project without PPA, pipeline spans from 2010 to 2014. And as I've said, this is a summary of what we presented during our Analyst Presentation in December. So a great pipeline and we continue to build on that pipeline for the future.We've taken a look at the U.S. utility contracts for PV and the solar thermal. First Solar had 16% share of the announced U.S. solar contracts. There is 8.6 gigawatt total announced, and although 71% is solar thermal, few of them have been built and the mix is shifting more to PV. And then in 2009, 65% of those that we're branded were PV. So First Solar has build a strong position in U.S. utilities market, and we have the integrated value chain of the project development, EPC, solid execution and the ability to drive lower and lower costs through our own panel production, but as well a balance of systems and our O&M contracts. So we feel really good about our position in the U.S. utility market and our growth for the future.We continue to drive copy smart and capacity growth, this pipeline we talked about, the 1.4 gigawatt pipeline is the leading position in the United States, and it led us to have the confidence to increase our capacity in Malaysia by adding plants five and six. Construction began with production ramping in the first half of 2011, that's 427 megawatts, bringing our total capacity to 1.7 gigawatt at Q4 run rate in 2011. Increased scale, low operating costs in tax tenants also helped us to drive profitability and the future expansion of our business. The two line plant partner with the EDFEN in France allows another 107 megawatt by Q1 of 2012 for a total of 1.8 gigawatt in capacity. All the work that we did to continue to drive our line run rate, increasing from Q4 of 53.4 to greater than 80 by 2014, as organic growth across 34 lines by 2012 approximately 2.7 gigawatt of production from the lines that we have in this business.So in summary, I'd like to say it was a really strong year despite all the volatility and challenges that we faced. Strong module demand in the year, and specifically Q4, we completed the sale of both Blythe and Sarnia at 20. A lot of the revisions to the FiT that are being proposed, discussed now in the marketplace, are going to drive some uncertainties especially in the second half, depending on what happens in the decisions for the future. So the first half is very strong demand. Orders look very strong. The second half, we'll have to see. We believe Italy will start to accelerate in growth with a lot of the development that has taken place. And we believe that some of the challenges that may exist in Germany, we've more than offset by a lot of the pipeline that we mentioned during the presentation. So we feel really good about the outlook for growth and demand. Our Systems business in North America, the contracted pipeline is continuing to grow. Out of 1.4 gigawatt now, we sold 100-megawatt AC systems in Q4 and, as we discussed, approximately 50% to 55% of the announced utilities contracts we have in the PV [photovoltaic] market. Started construction of Malaysia to increase our capacity, and the site I mentioned as well in France. So we continue to look at additional capacity expansions from a business standpoint and see what we can do in the future. Nothing to announce at this time, but we are definitely considering those alternatives.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff to go through the financials. Jens?"

We achieved a RONA [return on net assets] of 25.5%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by approximately 12.4 percentage points.During the fourth quarter, we experienced strong module demand, aided by competitive pricing and robust seasonal trends in advance of annual change in the feed-in tariff in all core markets. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $641 million, an increase of $160 million compared to the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by high amounts of production volumes, system revenue recognition for the 20-megawatt AC Sarnia and 21-megawatt AC Blythe projects, as well as the slightly favorable euro exchange rate. These effects were partially offset by lower module ASPs.We produced 311 megawatts during the fourth quarter, up 6.4% compared to the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, we began the ramp of the new Perrysburg, Ohio line. The Ohio line expansion to full lines remains on plan to be at full capacity in the first quarter of 2010. Costs per watt produced for the fourth quarter was $0.84, down $0.01 and benefited from lower material costs, higher throughput and conversion efficiency, which was partially offset by $0.02 for the Ohio ramp and $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Core manufacturing costs, excluding ramp penalty and stock-based compensation, declined 3.6% to $0.80 per watt quarter-over-quarter.Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 41.5%, down 9.4 percentage points over the prior quarter, in line with our previous guidance. About 5.9 percentage points of the decline was due to the significant increase in EPC/Development business, which represented approximately 14% of our fourth quarter net sales. In addition, we amortized a portion of the project assets related to the OptiSolar acquisition, with the realization of Phase I of Sarnia. The ramp penalty associated with the Ohio ramps impacted gross margins unfavorably by another percentage point. Module margins declined approximately 1.6 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, due to less unfavorable economics of the Blythe PPA [power purchase agreement].Operating expenses increased by $39.3 million sequentially to $121.5 million, due to $22.9 million a one-time personal expenses. Approximately $7 million of other non-recurring expenses, primarily attributable to a dispute with the Dutch Bankruptcy Court and $9.1 million of turnaround effect of one-time benefits, recorded during the third quarter. On an annualized basis, operating expenses stayed approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. While operating income for the fourth quarter was $144.7 million or 22.6% of net sales compared to $162.8 million or 33.9% during the prior quarter.  Slide 24 provides the reconciliation between the third and fourth quarter operating margins, reflecting the changes in gross margin and one-time operating expenses discussed earlier. Net income for the fourth quarter was $141.6 million or $1.65 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 5.8% and 6.7% for the fiscal year 2009.For the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $345 million, driven by operating cash flow of $414 million. We spent $69 million for capital equipment during the fourth quarter against depreciation of $37 million. For the full year, free cash flow reached $395 million after financing $280 million of capital expenditures. Cash and all other marketable securities increased by $284 million quarter-over-quarter to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, principally due to our free cash flow performance, partially offset by cash usage and other investing activities. Our debt-to-equity ratio remains low at 7%, providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry.To further exemplify the degree of differentiation, Slide 28 compares First Solar's balance sheet to the aggregate of 12 fuel play competitors, showing a $939 million net cash position for First Solar and a cash deficit of $5 billion for the Pier Group based on the latest reported results and our estimates.With our fourth quarter net results and net sales breaking through the $2 billion trailing fourth quarter performance, First Solar achieved the last quantitative metric for an investment-grade company. As the industry moves into the transitional markets, access to low-cost capital for large-scale project finance becomes an imperative. This is becoming an important competitive advantage. We expect the rating agencies will focus on the quality of each project, down-the-line debt structures, service on warranty agreements and the balance sheet backing them. Strategic and equity investor consider the financial strengths of the system developer to ensure a multi-year project build can be fulfilled. 25-year warranties are backed, and operations and maintenance contracts are supported. We believe we are well-positioned to lead the growth into a transition in sustainable markets, enabled by our proprietary technology, the superior business model and the strong balance sheet.This brings me to our guidance for 2010, which remains unchanged since our December meeting. Just to summarize, net sales are expected to range from $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, with module net sales of $2.1 billion and EPC project development sales of $600 million to $800 million. Gross margins of 38%, with module gross margins of 48% to 50% and EPC project development gross margins of 5% to 6%. We expect plant start-up cost of approximately $25 million, primarily from Malaysia plants five and six in the second half of 2010. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $95 million to $105 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold.GAAP operating margin is expected to be 23% to 24%, with module operating margins of 30% to 33% and EPC operating margins of break-even levels. We expect our 2009 tax rate to be around 15%. Year-end 2010 fully-diluted share count guidance has an estimated 86 to 87 million shares. EPS remains at $6.05 to $6.85% per share. CapEx for the year is expected to be $500 million to $550 million; operating cash flow, $730 million to $790 million; free cash flow, $180 million to $290 million. At this, we expect our RONA performance of about 16% to 18%. And we expect to continue to scale our EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] and Project Development business to achieve our long-term goal of 20%.Slide 32 shows our quarterly profile of revenues by segment and the mix impact on our consolidated margin presented in our December's guidance meeting. We feel urged to repeat the content of the slide due to numerous inconsistencies in recently-published research report following our guidance meeting in December. Please note that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will add to 100%. While reading the slide vertically will likely lead to another late night of model revisions. The majority of our EPC and project development revenues are expected to be recognized in the second half of 2010. The first quarter is largely driven by module sales. Module and consolidated revenues are expected to decline in the second quarter, as more production capacity is being allocated to the Systems business, driving revenue increases for both module and EPC project development in Q3 and Q4. Keep in mind that we will be allocating modules in advance of revenue recognition, causing a dip in the second quarter consolidated net sales. The margin profile, follow that trend as module margins stayed fairly flat with an expected slight decline in Q2 due to EPC inventory builds. However, the growing EPC revenue mix is expected to dilute our consolidated margin between the second and first quarter.Stated in our December meeting, we have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. These assumptions remain largely unchanged. Please refer to the back of this presentation for the slide outlining them. These assumption are however subject to change representing opportunities and risks. We currently believe our guidance balances these factors. We see opportunities from the potential to increase a percent of cap to business in 2010, which improves module ASPs. In addition, the expected 2011 change in Italy's feed-in tariff could drive increased demand in the second half of 2010. And France's recent change in feed-in tariff, together with its strong partnership, could promote further growth in that region.The recent dollar-euro volatility currently creates risk to our guidance. We are providing sensitivity that a $0.01 deviation from our assumed $1.40 per euro exchange rate impacts revenues for 2010 by approximately $10 million and net income by $6 million. We continue to have uncertainty on the amount of German feed-in tariff cuts by segment and the impact on module ASP, the potential demand path and the overall implementation timing. Any deviation from our assumptions could cause our actual results to differ from our guidance.With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

Actually quite a few PPAs have been executed in recent history, slightly above that MPR and PPA prices. And these negotiations happen slightly higher and they seem to be passing through the CPUC. Obviously, a decline in natural gas prices and the related reduction in MPR could have an impact right on our long-term outlook, with respect to the economics of the California market. We have seen as MPR go up, we've seen it slightly go down, it will fluctuate. Our focus is essentially to ensure that we drive our cost reductions further down, right, because somewhat regardless long-term of the impact or of the pricing in the MPR, we need to be competitive with fossil fuels, which is somewhat independent of the MPR. Essentially, as you know, the MPR makes assumptions, right, on long-term gas prices.

As we mentioned, obviously, there is potential depending on what type of changes by market segment we get around the German feed-in tariff that you need a recalibration of your distribution channels. So this is particularly true. If you look at some of the proposals that have been made around agricultural land and the possibility of singling a free-field installation out with a much higher feed-in tariff digression. As you know, historically, we've operated in and around roughly a 50/50 split between rooftops and free fields, so we do have channel access to rooftops. If these cuts came through, obviously, some of our channel partners would have to get more aggressive in rooftop, which means the overall competitive dynamics [indiscernible] pushing more product into that segment would generally increase. Given our cost leadership, we believe we would compete quite favorably in that market. That market segment, as you know, would also then include probably the smaller commercial rooftops, which historically have not been yet a target market for us. But I think, as a comment, and the comment with respect to that, there could be, again, depending on how much lead time you have with respect to the change of becoming active, there could be essentially some disruptiveness out of that.

Then in the fourth quarter, essentially, between hiring Rob and the associated expenses there, and one of our senior executives parting with the company made up the majority of the one-time events that we had in the fourth quarter.

Obviously, we like to reinvest the majority of our cash flows into the buildout of manufacturing capacity, as that continues to build the core of our business. That's what drives cost and LCOE [Levelized Cost of Electricity] down for the industry. As we look at some of the very large-scale projects, the development effort has set some degree of cash consumption where it's utilized right now. We like to have a buffer and a strong balance sheet even though, obviously, we were unable to earn anywhere near our RONA target out of this cash balance. As the strength of the balance sheet as a whole allows us, right, to achieve significant benefits on the project financing side just due to the overall aspect of credit quality within the company, I think time will tell and I think the growth rates of this industry will tell with respect to how these cash flows continue to trend. We believe we will operate in the free cash flow positive bases. And maybe a point in time, in our future, I wouldn't say that in the next, next two or three years, but maybe in the outer future, where we might return and start to return some of the cash generation back to our shareholders. With relate to the operating expenses, essentially, I think right now, there's nothing on the radar screen for us as it relates to one-time items. So I think if you kind of take the Q4 run rate, adjusted for all those one-time items, and then keep in mind Q1 usually has a slight increase in your expenses due to payroll taxes, et cetera, and also a merit increases usually take effect during that time period, so you should see a gradual increase.

I would say our overall cost reduction roadmap, I don't want you to think that there's vast acceleration in those right now as we look at 2010. As you know, the roadmap assumes kind of roughly 10% year-over-year decline. We've historically been able to outperform this, so we believe that's still not a bad gauge to apply. Other impacts are, if you look at Q4, the Q4 module margins were impacted as I mentioned in my remarks, unfavorably due to the economics in the Blythe project. You may recall the Blythe PPA signed very early. That came to some degree with the acquisition of Turner renewables, which probably to some degree was priced, I would say, 20-plus percent under the market then. So that's an impact out of that, just in the fourth quarter. So if you look at 2010, it's a combination of our cost reduction, but also an increase in what we reconsider captive demand and our own or customers' development pipeline to change into different geographical regions all attribute to that margin outlook."

There are no similar circumstances in the current portfolio. As you think about through the quarterly trends, this is obviously highly subject to on the development business. And as we see with respect whether you achieve milestone payment terms versus completed contract payments. To give you an idea, obviously, Blythe and Sarnia were completed contract, both from a revenue point of view as well as from a cash collection point of view. In our mind, if the question is, do you get positive arbitrage? So for example, can you negotiate milestone payments without impacting the overall cost of capital and the capital structure in the projects. So that's obviously what we try to defer and we try to get the market toward that efficiency. That doesn't work in every case, especially on some of the smaller projects. We'll work to essentially finance the construction through our balance sheet, which allows us in cases then to achieve a higher price, better profitability and higher cash collection in a timely offset way."

I think if you look at some of the larger projects we've got in our pipeline, I think in order to finance them successfully, our biggest task is as we look at 2010, '11 and beyond, is to effectively get the projects rated so that we can access the institutional market, especially on the debt side. And essentially start to issue solar bonds, either in a private placement or unlike a 144 type A mechanism. As the initial feedback we're getting out of the capital source appears to be favorable and open. So obviously, the rating on the project is subject to the quality of the offtaker with respect to electricity, and then through the counterparty on the PPAs. It is very much subject to how you structure the capital structure of the project. And then, what we have learned is also highly subject to the quality of essentially the provider of the system and with respect to warranties, with respect execution, construction financing, as well as in the long-term O&M performance. All of these pieces factor in. As you know, you can just look at essentially some of the yield curves. There's obviously a significant separation between achieving investment-grade ratings on these types of projects or for the corporation versus sitting essentially in a junk-bound environment. So from that perspective, we're pursuing this. I think we haven't announced any ratings yet, but essentially, I think that's where we stand, that's how we look at it. So if you think about our overall roadmap as it relates to reducing LCOE capital costs that become a significant part of the equation, then we believe we compete very favorably in that assessment [ph]."

I want to turn the attention to our Q1 performance summary on Page 6 with another strong quarter. With net sales of $568 million which is 36% growth year-over-year, our net income was $172 million or 30.3% of net revenue and our diluted EPS was $2 a share.
We turn on net assets. RONA was 23.2% on a four-quarter rolling basis which is well above our target of 20%. Cash and marketable securities were $1 billion, a $200 million increase year-over-year. 
On the operations and production side, Q1 production was 322 megawatts. That's a 47% increase year-over-year. We reached an annual capacity per line of 55.7 megawatts. It increases our current and announced capacity to 2.1 gigawatt by the end of 2012.
Conversion efficiency was 11.1%. That's 2/10 of improvement year-over-year. And our cost per watt was $0.81 a watt which is down 13% year-over-year. We're on track with our Malaysian plants, five and six expansions with production that began in the first half of 2011.
Finally, today, we're announcing that our Board of Directors has approved an additional four-line factory, and we expect to be operational by Q4 2011. This new plant will add over 220 megawatts, and we'll announce its location once we've completed all the necessary permitting and negotiated a final agreement.
Our Systems business will continue to grow, and we see a strong demand for the business. During the quarter, we sold the 30-megawatts Cimarron, New Mexico facility to Southern Company and Turner Enterprises; the 22-megawatt Badajoz, Spain project, the Voigt & Collegen. This project was jointly developed by First Solar in cooperation with Blythe Strum [ph] and Assyce Fotovoltaica who acted as the EPC contractor.
Our contracted project development pipeline increased from 1.4 to 1.7 gigawatts as we signed a 300-megawatt PPA with PG&E for Desert Sunlight, bringing the total site capacity to 550 megawatts.
Construction is in progress from the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain project, the 60-megawatt Sarnia project and the 30-megawatts Cimarron site with substantial completion expected by year end. We continue to work with the Chinese government on Ordos Phase 1, the 30-megawatt project. 
And today, we're pleased to announce an agreement to acquire NextLight Renewable Power LLC. It have a 1.3 gigawatt project development pipeline, including 570 megawatt of PPAs with very experienced and talented team. NextLight adds to our North American pipeline and expands our strategy to drive growth and technology adoption of solar power. Their experienced development team combined with our former OPTis and the Edison Mission people, allows us to provide North American utility customers with the complete solution to the renewable energy needs, which is both low-cost and predictable performance. It's put First Solar on a unique position to the right system solutions tailored at customer requirements of providing services from development, EPC, operations and maintenance, and project finance. Our focus will be to continue to focus on the growth of the solar power market through these enabling capabilities.
We add a 1.1 gigawatt pipeline which includes 570 megawatt of PPAs. Once closed, the transaction will bring our total contracted pipeline to 2.2 gigawatts. The preliminary financial impact is in earnings reduction of $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share in 2010.
We will finalize the financial impact of the acquisition once the transaction closes. This agreement is contingent on the CPUC approval of one project under development as well as Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance. Subject to these approvals, we expect to close in early Q3 of 2010.
Here's a summary of pipeline of 2.2 gigawatts. And this is where our North American Canadian pipeline contracted business and it enclosed the addition of the 300 megawatts that I've mentioned on Sunlight, PPA and also the NextLight acquisition. So we've got a lot of good new business opportunity with the addition of NextLight.
I want to focus now on the market and how we see it in 2010. We're getting an improved clarity around the 2010 and 2011 bit changes and their magnitude impact and the implementation and timing as things change including the growth corridors that are being defined. We expect the final decisions to be made by early June of this year.
First Solar is well positioned to manage the potential impact and uncertainty in the second half, and we expect to remain capacity constrained throughout the year. Our priority will be to service customer demand while utilizing our captive pipeline as a buffer to potential demand fluctuations. As a result, some of our projects have shifted to 2011 so that we can provide more modules to our customers.
Our captive pipeline can provide for take off of approximately 20% to 25% of our total second half production. The European market is expected to grow approximately 25% year-over-year, including 60% growth outside of Germany. We continue to work with our partners to expand the market throughout Europe. 
In North America, utilities continue to show a high interest in utility scale PV. Since the fourth quarter of 2009, we estimate that the volume of U.S. utility total PPAs has increased approximately 1 gigawatt. China has continued to delay announcement of its fifth program. A new project development may continue through a less transparent concessionary bidding process.
First Solar continues to work with provincial and federal agencies on the Ordos project for the first 30-megawatt phase of our 2 gigawatt cooperation agreement. We have submitted the Ordos pre-feasibility study and have been developing local partner relationships.
Industry demand and estimates for us, you can see highlighted on the next page. This is a chart that summarizes the industry view of the global PV market, size and growth from 2009 through to 2012. Although there's a range of estimates, continued strong growth is expected as the market diversifies. After significant growth in 2009, industry demand is expected to increase at 30% compound in annual growth rate to approximately 7 gigawatts in 2009 to over 15 gigawatt in 2012. We at First Solar aspired to be a clear global market leader, and we are targeting to grow share from approximately 15% in 2009 to 30% in the long term.
Looking at our production capacity growth, Slide 12 shows our current capacity plan including the announcement today. Our 8-line expansion of KLM, Malaysia is underway and on scheduled for shipment in the first half of 2011. We have completed negotiations on our two-line factory in Blanquefort, France and are on the permitting and design phase. Shipments are anticipated in the first quarter of 2012.
Our expansion in Malaysia and France and the new plants that we'll add will give us 14 new production lines, 780 megawatts of increased capacity at the current run rate, which is 58% increase from our current production equates to 2.1 gigawatt of capacity in 2012 based on the run rates we mentioned earlier.
So to summarize, we had another strong quarter. In Q1, we have a very, very good results. Our captive pipeline enables us to accelerate technology adoption and buffer demand uncertainty. The pricing environment has continued to improve, and strong global demand appears to be absorbed in the industry supply. With the acquisition of NextLight, we've grown our contracted pipeline to 2.2 gigawatts, providing long-term visibility to growth and significant business in the future. We're continuing to invest in both that growth as well as our capacity to fuel of that growth. 
And I'd like to turn it over to Jens to cover the financials."

During the first quarter, we experienced strong macro demand ahead of the expected mid-year feed-in tariff change in Germany, continued growth in France and Italy, and sales for our development business.Net sales for",1187,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the first quarter, we experienced strong macro demand ahead of the expected mid-year feed-in tariff change in Germany, continued growth in France and Italy, and sales for our development business.
Net sales for the first quarter were $568 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year and a sequential decline of $73 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential decrease was driven by a shift from turnkey system sales to module sales as the first quarter benefited from the revenue recognition for signing of Phase I and the Blythe project. This was partially offset by higher average selling prices and revenue recognition from the sale of the Badajoz project.
The 22-megawatt AC project was developed at First Solar in Europe in cooperation with Blythestrum [ph] and Assyce Fotovoltaica, who acted as the EPC contractor. The project was sold to Voigt & Collegen and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year. The blended exchange rate in Q1 was flat quarter-over-quarter at $1.39 to the euro. We produced 322 megawatts during the first quarter, up 3.6% compared to the prior quarter. During the first quarter, we completed the ramp of line four in  Perrysburg, Ohio. 
Turning to cost per watt. Cost per watt produced for the first quarter was $0.81, down $0.03 benefiting from the completion of the Ohio ramp and throughput improvements partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead cost. Core manufacturing cost per watt was flat at $0.80 per watt quarter-over-quarter. 
Q1 gross margin was 49.7%, up 8.2 percentage points over the prior quarter. Module revenues increased to 93% in the first quarter compared to 86% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Module ASPs increased quarter-over-quarter based on strong market demand and mix. The completion of the Ohio ramp also strengthened gross margin.
Gross profit increased sequentially by $15.8 million despite the sequential decline in net sales. Module gross margins were 52% during the first quarter of 2010. Operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter excluding the impact of the one-time items reported in the first quarter of 2009.
Operating income for the first quarter was $191.1 million or 33.7% of net sales compared to $144.7 million or 22.6% during the prior quarter due to the higher gross profit and lower operating expenses. Net income was $172.3 million or $2 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 11.8% for the first quarter.
Following very strong cash innovation in the fourth quarter of 2009, the first quarter free cashflow consumed $118 million of cash with operating cash flows of $31 million. We spent $106 million for capital expenditures against depreciation of $37 million. First quarter cashflow followed the same seasonal pattern as in prior years and is impacted by accounts receivable linearity, annual bonus payouts and end-of-life recycling funding.  The accounts receivable and inventory grew on higher volumes at more construction in profits in our Systems business. 
Cash and all other marketable securities decreased by $94 million quarter-over-quarter to $1 billion and 20 million. Our debt-to-equity ratio remains low at 6% providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We allocated Module from the Systems business to the Module business due to a strong module demand discussed earlier. The low end of our guidance maintains resilience to competitive pricing based on $40 per kilogram polycrystalline cost and, $0.75 per watt conversion cost by the fourth quarter for our non-captive demand. We have reduced our spot foreign exchange rate assumption from $1.40 to $1.30 per euro. For the remainder of the year, approximately 43% of our net sales and 52% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate $1.39.
Guidance includes approximately $12 million of operating expenses. For the next slide acquisition, the impacting earnings per share by $0.09 to $0.10 subject to final purchase price accounting. Capital spending includes KLM Plants 5 and 6 and the additionally announced new full-line plant.
In our guidance, we're increasing our earnings per share expectation while reducing net sales due to the mixed shift from systems to module sales and less pass-through revenues. In addition, guidance includes the impact of the NextLight acquisition.
Net sales are forecasted to range from $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion with modular net sales increasing to $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Gross margin guidance of 41% to 43% is up from prior guidance due to the increased module segment mix and the better-pricing environment, partially offset by the lower foreign exchange assumption. Module gross margins are expected between 49% and 51% for 2010.
We expect plant start-up cost of $27 million, primarily from the Malaysia Plants 5 and 6, as well as the newly announced plant in the second half of 2010. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $90 million to $100 million with approximately 20% being allocated to cost of goods sold.
GAAP operating margin is expected to be 25% to 27% with marginal operating margins of 31% to 33%. We expect our 2010 tax rates to be 12% to 14%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of $86 million to $87 million.
Earnings per diluted share are estimated to range from $6.80 to $7.30. The increase from prior guidance is primarily driven by higher average selling prices partially offset by the weaker euro.
CapEx for the year is expected to be $625 million to $650 million. This is up from our prior guidance due to spending for the new full-line plant. Operating cashflow is projected to be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. RONA guidance has increased to 18% to 19%, but remains below our 20% target for the year. 
Slide 25 reconciles for your convenience the prior EPS to the current EPS guidance and the primary drivers of change.
Going to the following slides. Slide 26 shows the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition by segment and the resulting mix impact on our consolidated gross margin. Please note, as in prior presentations, that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will add up to 100%.
The majority of our EPC and project development revenues remain in the second half of 2010. However, the reduction in EPC net sales for 2010 comes from the third and fourth quarter. Note that those module segment and consolidated net sales are expected to decline slightly in Q2 consistent with our prior guidance as we will be allocating modules to the systems business in advance of revenue recognition.
The margin profile follows the segment mix. The growing EPC mix is expected to dilute our consolidated gross margins slightly due to and more significantly in the second half of the year, consistent with the prior guidance provided.
Module margin remains relatively flat throughout the year and are up from prior guidance even after absorbing the foreign exchange impact changing from $1.40 per euro to $1.30 per euro.

You may recall, I think we stated that on prior calls, that we look at the captive demands coming off our Systems business to some degree as a buffer, against any form of demand fluctuation given some of the changes in the fees and tariff. Right now, from what we can see, is a very strong demand on the Module side, and we have enough flexibility in the pipeline in order to serve that module demand ahead of realizing those systems.

And I think that all of our customers, and we are surprised at how strong the demand is. And so I think it's a combination of the delay and a lot of effort on our part and our customer's part to go make things happen in 2010. And I think also a clear understanding to what's happening with the FiT changes and maybe not being as difficult or concerning as they might have been early in the year or into Q4, so that would be 2010. So what we're trying to do is balance our customer needs with what we can do in terms of meeting customer commitments on the capacity that we're building, but also allowed to flock some of that demand and make sure that all of our customers have panels to both products. So I think in 2011, once the actual decision is made, which we anticipate by early June on the FiT changes in Germany, everyone will have a clearer picture of what the market outlook is. But right now, we anticipate, as we said that, growth rate in the total business, including growth of the 60% outside of Germany that we mentioned on the market page.

I think in terms of, because as we've mentioned, throughout the year we're going to be sold out in terms of our capacity. So every -- Bruce gets a lot of input from the rest of us as to how much more we can make and produce. You're smiling at me, but we want -- that's why we're making investments in our capacity in the future. But also has created an opportunity for I think a strategy for us going forward to develop how our channels to market are constructed in one other opportunities there could be on -- think of it as a panel and distribution side. So I think, the cost to serve that market can be different, which can have an impact on economics versus putting a hundreds of megawatts into one side and shipping containers there and all the productivity that we've put into the BoS cost reduction and other things, it's a different equation and in different customer base. So I think that we can do a better job of developing that for growth in the future. And I think when you're just talking about a distribution sale, it obviously is where more of the competition can occur because it's not certified, it's not something that's gone through in permitting environmental requirements and standards and so on. So the distribution market is where you'd see more of the competition."

I want to turn the attention to our Q1 performance summary on Page 6 with another strong quarter. With net sales of $568 million which is 36% growth year-over-year, our net income was $172 million or 30.3% of net revenue and our diluted EPS was $2 a share.
We turn on net assets. RONA was 23.2% on a four-quarter rolling basis which is well above our target of 20%. Cash and marketable securities were $1 billion, a $200 million increase year-over-year. 
On the operations and production side, Q1 production was 322 megawatts. That's a 47% increase year-over-year. We reached an annual capacity per line of 55.7 megawatts. It increases our current and announced capacity to 2.1 gigawatt by the end of 2012.
Conversion efficiency was 11.1%. That's 2/10 of improvement year-over-year. And our cost per watt was $0.81 a watt which is down 13% year-over-year. We're on track with our Malaysian plants, five and six expansions with production that began in the first half of 2011.
Finally, today, we're announcing that our Board of Directors has approved an additional four-line factory, and we expect to be operational by Q4 2011. This new plant will add over 220 megawatts, and we'll announce its location once we've completed all the necessary permitting and negotiated a final agreement.
Our Systems business will continue to grow, and we see a strong demand for the business. During the quarter, we sold the 30-megawatts Cimarron, New Mexico facility to Southern Company and Turner Enterprises; the 22-megawatt Badajoz, Spain project, the Voigt & Collegen. This project was jointly developed by First Solar in cooperation with Blythe Strum [ph] and Assyce Fotovoltaica who acted as the EPC contractor.
Our contracted project development pipeline increased from 1.4 to 1.7 gigawatts as we signed a 300-megawatt PPA with PG&E for Desert Sunlight, bringing the total site capacity to 550 megawatts.
Construction is in progress from the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain project, the 60-megawatt Sarnia project and the 30-megawatts Cimarron site with substantial completion expected by year end. We continue to work with the Chinese government on Ordos Phase 1, the 30-megawatt project. 
And today, we're pleased to announce an agreement to acquire NextLight Renewable Power LLC. It have a 1.3 gigawatt project development pipeline, including 570 megawatt of PPAs with very experienced and talented team. NextLight adds to our North American pipeline and expands our strategy to drive growth and technology adoption of solar power. Their experienced development team combined with our former OPTis and the Edison Mission people, allows us to provide North American utility customers with the complete solution to the renewable energy needs, which is both low-cost and predictable performance. It's put First Solar on a unique position to the right system solutions tailored at customer requirements of providing services from development, EPC, operations and maintenance, and project finance. Our focus will be to continue to focus on the growth of the solar power market through these enabling capabilities.
We add a 1.1 gigawatt pipeline which includes 570 megawatt of PPAs. Once closed, the transaction will bring our total contracted pipeline to 2.2 gigawatts. The preliminary financial impact is in earnings reduction of $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share in 2010.
We will finalize the financial impact of the acquisition once the transaction closes. This agreement is contingent on the CPUC approval of one project under development as well as Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance. Subject to these approvals, we expect to close in early Q3 of 2010.
Here's a summary of pipeline of 2.2 gigawatts. And this is where our North American Canadian pipeline contracted business and it enclosed the addition of the 300 megawatts that I've mentioned on Sunlight, PPA and also the NextLight acquisition. So we've got a lot of good new business opportunity with the addition of NextLight.
I want to focus now on the market and how we see it in 2010. We're getting an improved clarity around the 2010 and 2011 bit changes and their magnitude impact and the implementation and timing as things change including the growth corridors that are being defined. We expect the final decisions to be made by early June of this year.
First Solar is well positioned to manage the potential impact and uncertainty in the second half, and we expect to remain capacity constrained throughout the year. Our priority will be to service customer demand while utilizing our captive pipeline as a buffer to potential demand fluctuations. As a result, some of our projects have shifted to 2011 so that we can provide more modules to our customers.
Our captive pipeline can provide for take off of approximately 20% to 25% of our total second half production. The European market is expected to grow approximately 25% year-over-year, including 60% growth outside of Germany. We continue to work with our partners to expand the market throughout Europe. 
In North America, utilities continue to show a high interest in utility scale PV. Since the fourth quarter of 2009, we estimate that the volume of U.S. utility total PPAs has increased approximately 1 gigawatt. China has continued to delay announcement of its fifth program. A new project development may continue through a less transparent concessionary bidding process.
First Solar continues to work with provincial and federal agencies on the Ordos project for the first 30-megawatt phase of our 2 gigawatt cooperation agreement. We have submitted the Ordos pre-feasibility study and have been developing local partner relationships.
Industry demand and estimates for us, you can see highlighted on the next page. This is a chart that summarizes the industry view of the global PV market, size and growth from 2009 through to 2012. Although there's a range of estimates, continued strong growth is expected as the market diversifies. After significant growth in 2009, industry demand is expected to increase at 30% compound in annual growth rate to approximately 7 gigawatts in 2009 to over 15 gigawatt in 2012. We at First Solar aspired to be a clear global market leader, and we are targeting to grow share from approximately 15% in 2009 to 30% in the long term.
Looking at our production capacity growth, Slide 12 shows our current capacity plan including the announcement today. Our 8-line expansion of KLM, Malaysia is underway and on scheduled for shipment in the first half of 2011. We have completed negotiations on our two-line factory in Blanquefort, France and are on the permitting and design phase. Shipments are anticipated in the first quarter of 2012.
Our expansion in Malaysia and France and the new plants that we'll add will give us 14 new production lines, 780 megawatts of increased capacity at the current run rate, which is 58% increase from our current production equates to 2.1 gigawatt of capacity in 2012 based on the run rates we mentioned earlier.
So to summarize, we had another strong quarter. In Q1, we have a very, very good results. Our captive pipeline enables us to accelerate technology adoption and buffer demand uncertainty. The pricing environment has continued to improve, and strong global demand appears to be absorbed in the industry supply. With the acquisition of NextLight, we've grown our contracted pipeline to 2.2 gigawatts, providing long-term visibility to growth and significant business in the future. We're continuing to invest in both that growth as well as our capacity to fuel of that growth. 
And I'd like to turn it over to Jens to cover the financials.

During the first quarter, we experienced strong macro demand ahead of the expected mid-year feed-in tariff change in Germany, continued growth in France and Italy, and sales for our development business.Net sales for",1187,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the first quarter, we experienced strong macro demand ahead of the expected mid-year feed-in tariff change in Germany, continued growth in France and Italy, and sales for our development business.
Net sales for the first quarter were $568 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year and a sequential decline of $73 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential decrease was driven by a shift from turnkey system sales to module sales as the first quarter benefited from the revenue recognition for signing of Phase I and the Blythe project. This was partially offset by higher average selling prices and revenue recognition from the sale of the Badajoz project.
The 22-megawatt AC project was developed at First Solar in Europe in cooperation with Blythestrum [ph] and Assyce Fotovoltaica, who acted as the EPC contractor. The project was sold to Voigt & Collegen and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year. The blended exchange rate in Q1 was flat quarter-over-quarter at $1.39 to the euro. We produced 322 megawatts during the first quarter, up 3.6% compared to the prior quarter. During the first quarter, we completed the ramp of line four in  Perrysburg, Ohio. 
Turning to cost per watt. Cost per watt produced for the first quarter was $0.81, down $0.03 benefiting from the completion of the Ohio ramp and throughput improvements partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead cost. Core manufacturing cost per watt was flat at $0.80 per watt quarter-over-quarter. 
Q1 gross margin was 49.7%, up 8.2 percentage points over the prior quarter. Module revenues increased to 93% in the first quarter compared to 86% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Module ASPs increased quarter-over-quarter based on strong market demand and mix. The completion of the Ohio ramp also strengthened gross margin.
Gross profit increased sequentially by $15.8 million despite the sequential decline in net sales. Module gross margins were 52% during the first quarter of 2010. Operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter excluding the impact of the one-time items reported in the first quarter of 2009.
Operating income for the first quarter was $191.1 million or 33.7% of net sales compared to $144.7 million or 22.6% during the prior quarter due to the higher gross profit and lower operating expenses. Net income was $172.3 million or $2 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 11.8% for the first quarter.
Following very strong cash innovation in the fourth quarter of 2009, the first quarter free cashflow consumed $118 million of cash with operating cash flows of $31 million. We spent $106 million for capital expenditures against depreciation of $37 million. First quarter cashflow followed the same seasonal pattern as in prior years and is impacted by accounts receivable linearity, annual bonus payouts and end-of-life recycling funding.  The accounts receivable and inventory grew on higher volumes at more construction in profits in our Systems business. 
Cash and all other marketable securities decreased by $94 million quarter-over-quarter to $1 billion and 20 million. Our debt-to-equity ratio remains low at 6% providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We allocated Module from the Systems business to the Module business due to a strong module demand discussed earlier. The low end of our guidance maintains resilience to competitive pricing based on $40 per kilogram polycrystalline cost and, $0.75 per watt conversion cost by the fourth quarter for our non-captive demand. We have reduced our spot foreign exchange rate assumption from $1.40 to $1.30 per euro. For the remainder of the year, approximately 43% of our net sales and 52% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate $1.39.
Guidance includes approximately $12 million of operating expenses. For the next slide acquisition, the impacting earnings per share by $0.09 to $0.10 subject to final purchase price accounting. Capital spending includes KLM Plants 5 and 6 and the additionally announced new full-line plant.
In our guidance, we're increasing our earnings per share expectation while reducing net sales due to the mixed shift from systems to module sales and less pass-through revenues. In addition, guidance includes the impact of the NextLight acquisition.
Net sales are forecasted to range from $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion with modular net sales increasing to $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Gross margin guidance of 41% to 43% is up from prior guidance due to the increased module segment mix and the better-pricing environment, partially offset by the lower foreign exchange assumption. Module gross margins are expected between 49% and 51% for 2010.
We expect plant start-up cost of $27 million, primarily from the Malaysia Plants 5 and 6, as well as the newly announced plant in the second half of 2010. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $90 million to $100 million with approximately 20% being allocated to cost of goods sold.
GAAP operating margin is expected to be 25% to 27% with marginal operating margins of 31% to 33%. We expect our 2010 tax rates to be 12% to 14%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of $86 million to $87 million.
Earnings per diluted share are estimated to range from $6.80 to $7.30. The increase from prior guidance is primarily driven by higher average selling prices partially offset by the weaker euro.
CapEx for the year is expected to be $625 million to $650 million. This is up from our prior guidance due to spending for the new full-line plant. Operating cashflow is projected to be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. RONA guidance has increased to 18% to 19%, but remains below our 20% target for the year. 
Slide 25 reconciles for your convenience the prior EPS to the current EPS guidance and the primary drivers of change.
Going to the following slides. Slide 26 shows the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition by segment and the resulting mix impact on our consolidated gross margin. Please note, as in prior presentations, that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will add up to 100%.
The majority of our EPC and project development revenues remain in the second half of 2010. However, the reduction in EPC net sales for 2010 comes from the third and fourth quarter. Note that those module segment and consolidated net sales are expected to decline slightly in Q2 consistent with our prior guidance as we will be allocating modules to the systems business in advance of revenue recognition.
The margin profile follows the segment mix. The growing EPC mix is expected to dilute our consolidated gross margins slightly due to and more significantly in the second half of the year, consistent with the prior guidance provided.
Module margin remains relatively flat throughout the year and are up from prior guidance even after absorbing the foreign exchange impact changing from $1.40 per euro to $1.30 per euro. 
With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and can open the call for questions. Operator?

And I think that all of our customers, and we are surprised at how strong the demand is. And so I think it's a combination of the delay and a lot of effort on our part and our customer's part to go make things happen in 2010. And I think also a clear understanding to what's happening with the FiT changes and maybe not being as difficult or concerning as they might have been early in the year or into Q4, so that would be 2010. So what we're trying to do is balance our customer needs with what we can do in terms of meeting customer commitments on the capacity that we're building, but also allowed to flock some of that demand and make sure that all of our customers have panels to both products. So I think in 2011, once the actual decision is made, which we anticipate by early June on the FiT changes in Germany, everyone will have a clearer picture of what the market outlook is. But right now, we anticipate, as we said that, growth rate in the total business, including growth of the 60% outside of Germany that we mentioned on the market page. So as we said, we're working with our customers to really grow the business and market outside of Germany, but also maintain and grow our position in all of the market aspects in Germany as well. But a lot of good growth opportunity still exist throughout the world.

I think the growth rate that we'd talked about in that range of the 25% to 30% compounded between now and 2014 is directionally what we think. We know that pending legislation and changes can affect that line. And so we've focused on that, whether it's through government relation effort or development pipeline. So I think that we have a pretty good view on what the market will be and we'll continue to grow in that range. And we want to make sure that we can help drive to make it grow faster by some of the investments that we're making and development in that pipeline. So on the question of our customers or viewing us as competitors, I think that we continue to work with our customers and they get a clear understanding of our investment and effort. Remember, our strategy is to expand the market in new regions of the world and invest to drive the technology adoptions.

So I think, the cost to serve that market can be different, which can have an impact on economics versus putting a hundreds of megawatts into one side and shipping containers there and all the productivity that we've put into the BoS cost reduction and other things, it's a different equation and in different customer base. So I think that we can do a better job of developing that for growth in the future. And I think when you're just talking about a distribution sale, it obviously is where more of the competition can occur because it's not certified, it's not something that's gone through in permitting environmental requirements and standards and so on. So the distribution market is where you'd see more of the competition.

I think at this point in time, I think we got to see through, I think there's some possible around as it relates to the installation activity that we're seeing. As I mentioned earlier, if you look at the amount we're seeing right now in the rest of Europe even if as we go on to 2011, we look at our own captive demand in the underlying economics of it, I think we're to the best extent we can gage it right now we're buffer there. As you expect to NextLight, PPAs, I'm mean generally again, as we're talking about pricing, we're going to market and other development assets we're renegotiating power purchase agreements as part of our business. So I don't think it's necessarily meaningful or attractive for us to probably broadcast right under terms and conditions we're signing this contract. However, we also know there's a market price reference in place that has regulates I think pricing of these PPA's under the comps of leased costs that's fit leverage which provides certain variance distribution to market price reference.

I want to turn the attention to our Q1 performance summary on Page 6 with another strong quarter. With net sales of $568 million which is 36% growth year-over-year, our net income was $172 million or 30.3% of net revenue and our diluted EPS was $2 a share.
We turn on net assets. RONA was 23.2% on a four-quarter rolling basis which is well above our target of 20%. Cash and marketable securities were $1 billion, a $200 million increase year-over-year. 
On the operations and production side, Q1 production was 322 megawatts. That's a 47% increase year-over-year. We reached an annual capacity per line of 55.7 megawatts. It increases our current and announced capacity to 2.1 gigawatt by the end of 2012.
Conversion efficiency was 11.1%. That's 2/10 of improvement year-over-year. And our cost per watt was $0.81 a watt which is down 13% year-over-year. We're on track with our Malaysian plants, five and six expansions with production that began in the first half of 2011.
Finally, today, we're announcing that our Board of Directors has approved an additional four-line factory, and we expect to be operational by Q4 2011. This new plant will add over 220 megawatts, and we'll announce its location once we've completed all the necessary permitting and negotiated a final agreement.
Our Systems business will continue to grow, and we see a strong demand for the business. During the quarter, we sold the 30-megawatts Cimarron, New Mexico facility to Southern Company and Turner Enterprises; the 22-megawatt Badajoz, Spain project, the Voigt & Collegen. This project was jointly developed by First Solar in cooperation with Blitzstrom and Assyce Fotovoltaica who acted as the EPC contractor.
Our contracted project development pipeline increased from 1.4 to 1.7 gigawatts as we signed a 300-megawatt PPA with PG&E for Desert Sunlight, bringing the total site capacity to 550 megawatts.
Construction is in progress from the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain project, the 60-megawatt Sarnia project and the 30-megawatts Cimarron site with substantial completion expected by year end. We continue to work with the Chinese government on Ordos Phase 1, the 30-megawatt project. 
And today, we're pleased to announce an agreement to acquire NextLight Renewable Power LLC. It have a 1.3 gigawatt project development pipeline, including 570 megawatt of PPAs with very experienced and talented team. NextLight adds to our North American pipeline and expands our strategy to drive growth and technology adoption of solar power. Their experienced development team combined with our former OPTis and the Edison Mission people, allows us to provide North American utility customers with the complete solution to the renewable energy needs, which is both low-cost and predictable performance. It's put First Solar on a unique position to the right system solutions tailored at customer requirements of providing services from development, EPC, operations and maintenance, and project finance. Our focus will be to continue to focus on the growth of the solar power market through these enabling capabilities.
We add a 1.1 gigawatt pipeline which includes 570 megawatt of PPAs. Once closed, the transaction will bring our total contracted pipeline to 2.2 gigawatts. The preliminary financial impact is in earnings reduction of $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share in 2010.
We will finalize the financial impact of the acquisition once the transaction closes. This agreement is contingent on the CPUC approval of one project under development as well as Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance. Subject to these approvals, we expect to close in early Q3 of 2010.
Here's a summary of pipeline of 2.2 gigawatts. And this is where our North American Canadian pipeline contracted business and it enclosed the addition of the 300 megawatts that I've mentioned on Sunlight, PPA and also the NextLight acquisition. So we've got a lot of good new business opportunity with the addition of NextLight.
I want to focus now on the market and how we see it in 2010. We're getting an improved clarity around the 2010 and 2011 bit changes and their magnitude impact and the implementation and timing as things change including the growth corridors that are being defined. We expect the final decisions to be made by early June of this year.
First Solar is well positioned to manage the potential impact and uncertainty in the second half, and we expect to remain capacity constrained throughout the year. Our priority will be to service customer demand while utilizing our captive pipeline as a buffer to potential demand fluctuations. As a result, some of our projects have shifted to 2011 so that we can provide more modules to our customers.
Our captive pipeline can provide for take off of approximately 20% to 25% of our total second half production. The European market is expected to grow approximately 25% year-over-year, including 60% growth outside of Germany. We continue to work with our partners to expand the market throughout Europe. 
In North America, utilities continue to show a high interest in utility scale PV. Since the fourth quarter of 2009, we estimate that the volume of U.S. utility total PPAs has increased approximately 1 gigawatt. China has continued to delay announcement of its fifth program. A new project development may continue through a less transparent concessionary bidding process.
First Solar continues to work with provincial and federal agencies on the Ordos project for the first 30-megawatt phase of our 2 gigawatt cooperation agreement. We have submitted the Ordos pre-feasibility study and have been developing local partner relationships.
Industry demand and estimates for us, you can see highlighted on the next page. This is a chart that summarizes the industry view of the global PV market, size and growth from 2009 through to 2012. Although there's a range of estimates, continued strong growth is expected as the market diversifies. After significant growth in 2009, industry demand is expected to increase at 30% compound in annual growth rate to approximately 7 gigawatts in 2009 to over 15 gigawatt in 2012. We at First Solar aspired to be a clear global market leader, and we are targeting to grow share from approximately 15% in 2009 to 30% in the long term.
Looking at our production capacity growth, Slide 12 shows our current capacity plan including the announcement today. Our 8-line expansion of KLM, Malaysia is underway and on scheduled for shipment in the first half of 2011. We have completed negotiations on our two-line factory in Blanquefort, France and are on the permitting and design phase. Shipments are anticipated in the first quarter of 2012.
Our expansion in Malaysia and France and the new plants that we'll add will give us 14 new production lines, 780 megawatts of increased capacity at the current run rate, which is 58% increase from our current production equates to 2.1 gigawatt of capacity in 2012 based on the run rates we mentioned earlier.
So to summarize, we had another strong quarter. In Q1, we have a very, very good results. Our captive pipeline enables us to accelerate technology adoption and buffer demand uncertainty. The pricing environment has continued to improve, and strong global demand appears to be absorbed in the industry supply. With the acquisition of NextLight, we've grown our contracted pipeline to 2.2 gigawatts, providing long-term visibility to growth and significant business in the future. We're continuing to invest in both that growth as well as our capacity to fuel of that growth. 
And I'd like to turn it over to Jens to cover the financials."

During the first quarter, we experienced strong macro demand ahead of the expected mid-year feed-in tariff change in Germany, continued growth in France and Italy, and sales for our development business.Net sales for",1183,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the first quarter, we experienced strong macro demand ahead of the expected mid-year feed-in tariff change in Germany, continued growth in France and Italy, and sales for our development business.
Net sales for the first quarter were $568 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year and a sequential decline of $73 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential decrease was driven by a shift from turnkey system sales to module sales as the first quarter benefited from the revenue recognition for signing of Phase I and the Blythe project. This was partially offset by higher average selling prices and revenue recognition from the sale of the Badajoz project.
The 22-megawatt AC project was developed at First Solar in Europe in cooperation with Blitzstrom and Assyce Fotovoltaica, who acted as the EPC contractor. The project was sold to Voigt & Collegen and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year. The blended exchange rate in Q1 was flat quarter-over-quarter at $1.39 to the euro. We produced 322 megawatts during the first quarter, up 3.6% compared to the prior quarter. During the first quarter, we completed the ramp of line four in  Perrysburg, Ohio. 
Turning to cost per watt. Cost per watt produced for the first quarter was $0.81, down $0.03 benefiting from the completion of the Ohio ramp and throughput improvements, partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead cost. Core manufacturing cost per watt was flat at $0.80 per watt quarter-over-quarter. 
Q1 gross margin was 49.7%, up 8.2 percentage points over the prior quarter. Module revenues increased to 93% in the first quarter compared to 86% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Module ASPs increased quarter-over-quarter based on strong market demand and mix. The completion of the Ohio ramp also strengthened gross margin.
Gross profit increased sequentially by $15.8 million despite the sequential decline in net sales. Module gross margins were 52% during the first quarter of 2010. Operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter excluding the impact of the one-time items reported in the first quarter of 2009.
Operating income for the first quarter was $191.1 million or 33.7% of net sales compared to $144.7 million or 22.6% during the prior quarter due to the higher gross profit and lower operating expenses. Net income was $172.3 million or $2 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 11.8% for the first quarter.
Following very strong cash innovation in the fourth quarter of 2009, the first quarter free cash flow consumed $118 million of cash with operating cash flows of $31 million. We spent $106 million for capital expenditures against depreciation of $37 million. First quarter cash flow followed the same seasonal pattern as in prior years and is impacted by accounts receivable linearity, annual bonus payouts and end-of-life recycling funding.  The accounts receivable and inventory grew on higher volumes at more construction in profits in our Systems business. 
Cash and all other marketable securities decreased by $94 million quarter-over-quarter to $1,020,000,000. Our debt-to-equity ratio remains low at 6% providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We allocated Module from the Systems business to the Module business due to a strong module demand discussed earlier. The low end of our guidance maintains resilience to competitive pricing based on $40 per kilogram polycrystalline cost and, $0.75 per watt conversion cost by the fourth quarter for our non-captive demand. We have reduced our spot foreign exchange rate assumption from $1.40 to $1.30 per euro. For the remainder of the year, approximately 43% of our net sales and 52% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate $1.39.
Guidance includes approximately $12 million of operating expenses. For the NextLight acquisition, impacting earnings per share by $0.09 to $0.10 subject to final purchase price accounting. Capital spending includes KLM Plants 5 and 6 and the additionally announced new four-line plant.
In our guidance, we're increasing our earnings per share expectation while reducing net sales due to the mixed shift from systems to module sales and less pass-through revenues. In addition, guidance includes the impact of the NextLight acquisition.
Net sales are forecasted to range from $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion with modular net sales increasing to $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Gross margin guidance of 41% to 43% is up from prior guidance due to the increased module segment mix and the better-pricing environment, partially offset by the lower foreign exchange assumption. Module gross margins are expected between 49% and 51% for 2010.
We expect plant start-up cost of $27 million, primarily from the Malaysia Plants 5 and 6, as well as the newly announced plant in the second half of 2010. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $90 million to $100 million with approximately 20% being allocated to cost of goods sold.
GAAP operating margin is expected to be 25% to 27% with marginal operating margins of 31% to 33%. We expect our 2010 tax rates to be 12% to 14%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of $86 million to $87 million.
Earnings per diluted share are estimated to range from $6.80 to $7.30. The increase from prior guidance is primarily driven by higher average selling prices partially offset by the weaker euro.
CapEx for the year is expected to be $625 million to $650 million. This is up from our prior guidance due to spending for the new full-line plant. Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. RONA guidance has increased to 18% to 19%, but remains below our 20% target for the year. 
Slide 25 reconciles for your convenience the prior EPS to the current EPS guidance and the primary drivers of change.
Going to the following slides. Slide 26 shows the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition by segment and the resulting mix impact on our consolidated gross margin. Please note, as in prior presentations, that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will add up to 100%.
The majority of our EPC and project development revenues remain in the second half of 2010. However, the reduction in EPC net sales for 2010 comes from the third and fourth quarter. Note that those module segment and consolidated net sales are expected to decline slightly in Q2 consistent with our prior guidance as we will be allocating modules to the systems business in advance of revenue recognition.
The margin profile follows the segment mix. The growing EPC mix is expected to dilute our consolidated gross margins slightly due to and more significantly in the second half of the year, consistent with the prior guidance provided.
Module margin remains relatively flat throughout the year and are up from prior guidance even after absorbing the foreign exchange impact changing from $1.40 per euro to $1.30 per euro.

And I think also a clear understanding to what's happening with the FiT changes and maybe not being as difficult or concerning as they might have been early in the year or into Q4, so that would be 2010. So what we're trying to do is balance our customer needs with what we can do in terms of meeting customer commitments on the capacity that we're building, but also allowed to flock some of that demand and make sure that all of our customers have panels to both products. So I think in 2011, once the actual decision is made, which we anticipate by early June on the FiT changes in Germany, everyone will have a clearer picture of what the market outlook is. But right now, we anticipate, as we said that, growth rate in the total business, including growth of the 60% outside of Germany that we mentioned on the market page. So as we said, we're working with our customers to really grow the business and market outside of Germany, but also maintain and grow our position in all of the market aspects in Germany as well. But a lot of good growth opportunity still exist throughout the world."

So I think that we can do a better job of developing that for growth in the future. And I think when you're just talking about a distribution sale, it obviously is where more of the competition can occur because it's not certified, it's not something that's gone through in permitting environmental requirements and standards and so on.

I think we did also talk about the transition opportunities that exist outside of North America and that would be in China, India, Australia and other areas, including outside of Germany and throughout Europe. So a lot of growth opportunity on the subsidy side as well. So we are also as part of our strategy development, working through how we would participate in some of these markets, how we can work with IPP customers who are involved in those regions and we see those areas of the world as significant opportunities of the future."

So that's in fact is what we're all thinking. So there you get a more into the public debt market. As it relates to the equity fees, we generally like to place the equity with a single party, having multiple parties in the equity can be complicated as it relates to sharing the infrastructure and the available financing. So while we're using this strategy, you see that we're using generally the strategy of taking some of the smaller projects, right our mid-sized projects I should say as we have them in the U.S. and Canada.

Our net income",2054,"Thanks, Larry, and thanks, everybody, for joining our second quarter earnings call today. I want to quickly turn to the performance summary. We had a really strong quarter with net sales of $588 million, which was 12% growth year-over-year. Our net income was $159 million or 27.1% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share was $1.84. 
The return on net assets was 21.1% on a fourth quarter rolling basis, and marketable securities were $960 million, which is $232 million increase year-over-year. Our production in the quarter was 344-megawatt, up 19% versus prior year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. The annual capacity per line increased to 59-megawatt, which equates to adding two new production lines to our existing and planned capacity. This improvement increases our current and announced capacity to 2.2 gigawatt by 2012.
Our conversion efficiency was 11.2%, which is an improvement of $0.03 year-over-year. The cost per watt was $0.76, which is down 13% year-over-year and down $0.05 from the first quarter of 2010. We're on track with our expansion to the Malaysian facility and the addition of Plants 5 and 6. Shipments will begin in the first half of 2011. We also recently announced the addition of a new four-line plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, where shipments will begin in the fourth quarter of 2011.
On July 1, we launched our Series 3 module, which is an extension of our industry-leading design. The Series 3 product is our low-voltage platform that further improves efficiency, lowers module and balanced systems costs and provides field energy yield advantages, relative to polycrystalline or crystalline silicon. I'll discuss this further during this presentation today.
Finally, in Q2, a reflected cost, associated with a module replacement program. During the period from June of 2008 to June of 2009, a manufacturing excursion occurred affecting less than 4% of the total product manufacture within the period. The excursion could result in possible premature power loss in affected modules. The root cause was identified and subsequently mitigated in June of 2009. Ongoing testing confirms the corrective actions are effective. We have been working directly with impacted customers to replace the affected modules, and these efforts are well underway and, in some cases, complete. Some of these efforts go beyond our normal warranty coverage.
We accrued the estimated full cost of these additional efforts in our Q2 results, and Jens will discuss the financial impact in more detail.
I now would like to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made on our Utility Systems business and the project that we have underway. So first turning to Page 7, the picture on Slide 7 demonstrates the progress we've made on expanding the 20-megawatt site to 80 megawatts for Enbridge in Ontario, Canada. The construction is on schedule and highlights the progress our EPC team has made in cycle time and Balance of Systems cost. The 60-megawatt expansion is expected to be completed at a velocity that's 2x the rate of the first phase built less than a year ago. Half the site is now producing power and another quarter will be connected very soon.
Turning now to Copper Mountain. Slide 8 shows 48-megawatt expansion of our original 10-megawatt installations at the El Dorado site for Sempra Generation. El Dorado is the first site we constructed in North America in late 2008. The expansion also highlights the progress made in design and execution of Utility-scale solar plants.
Cimarron project in New Mexico for Southern Company is our first large-scale installation of the Series 3 product. The construction is underway and progressing well. Our mention of Series 3 and the installation at Cimarron Park. Now you can see on Page 10, the Series 3 provides higher efficiencies with initial product launch having 2/10 improvement over the existing Series 2 product. The higher efficiency also lowers cost per watt. Series 3 retains the band gap and temperature coefficient strength of Series 2 and continues the energy yield advantages over crystalline silicon. 
The low-voltage enables up to 50% more modules per string, which further reduces the Balance of Systems costs. In addition, it has new locking connectors, which provides faster installation and improved connection reliability. Series 3 retains the same form factor, module construction and semiconductor processes as Series 2. This will be our new technology platform for the future energy improvements that we make.
Agua Caliente is the first project we expect to realize from the NextLight acquisition. The CPUC has approved the 290-megawatt project, and the major permits are in place. We plan to begin construction in 2010 and start installation of modules in 2011. In addition, yesterday, the first NextLight Silver State project of 50-megawatt received Public Utility Commission of Nevada approval of the PPA with NV Energy. Work is ongoing to obtain BLM approval to a final environmental impact study in 2010.
The NextLight acquisition was closed on July 12 and increases our North American contract pipeline to 2.2 gigawatt. We've already benefited from the experienced team at NextLight and expect to begin to realize the value of the 570-megawatt PPA pipeline starting in 2011. The purchase price at closing is about $297 million in cash, and we expect to incur $12 million of additional operating costs in the second half of 2010. As previously announced, the acquisition is expected to reduce 2010 earnings by $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share.
With the completion of the NextLight acquisition, we also announced the formation of a Utility Systems business. This signifies the importance of this segment to our future growth and our objective of expanding global demand for solar power.
On Slide 13, we've outlined our mission for the Utility Systems business. I’ve asked Jens Meyerhoff to lead this business. Many of you know Jens is our CFO, but in addition, he's been a significant contributor to the development of our business strategy and to the acquisition of the development businesses which constitute what we now call Utility Systems. He is uniquely qualified to lead this business, and I’m really excited about the contributions that both he and the team will make to the continuing success of First Solar.
With our goal of providing solutions at the lowest cost for our Utility customers and to ultimately provide an asset which competes with fossil fuel sources, we have to consider all aspects of the value chain. We want to minimize LCOE, while at the same time, maximize the return for our project owners, and First Solar is uniquely positioned to provide both through driving performance and execution from the module to the Balance of Systems, project development and financing. All four of these elements must be optimized to achieve our goal of future cost parity.
I'd like to give you an update of the market and what's happened and changes that we've seen since last quarter. First of all, in Germany. The German government, as you know, decided on the new 2010 and 2011 FiT disgression, implementation timing and growth corridors [ph] (25:25). We expect the German market to remain strong for the remainder of 2010. We implemented some price adjustments in the second half to ensure sell-through at the new FiT and to position us for 2011 and beyond project sales.
The 2010 German market demand is expected to be in the range from six to eight gigawatts.
We expect to remain capacity-constrained in the second half of 2010 and have allocated modules from our Systems business to serve our module customer demand. Our 2.2 gigawatt of captive projects acts as a buffer against potential demand fluctuations in the European market. We continue to work with our partners to expand the business in Europe. In Q2, we've made a lot of progress to that end, diversifying our country mix as Germany's portion of our net sales declined from approximately 71% to 50% year-over-year and the United States became our #2 market, followed closely by France and Italy.
As it relates to Italy, Spain and France, Italy has decided on a 2011 FiT reduction. The level of digression and implementation over several quarters is expected to continue to enable investor returns and encourage demand growth in the second half of 2010 and into 2011. The Spanish government is developing a new energy bill that will reset PV FiTs at lower levels. The mw cap level is expected to remain unchanged. The bill is expected to be published in the third quarter of Q4 and for implementation then.
Due to stronger French PV systems demand than anticipated, the government has begun to consider a FiT digression sooner than planned and a planned 2012 reduction. It's too early, really, to access the magnitude or timing of changes, but a change is possible in the second half of 2010. First Solar continues to believe that good solar ratings in Italy, France and Spain and the support for the policy of the European Union’s 20% goal in renewables by 2020 will continue to drive robust demand for PV.
In North America, California SB 722 mandating 33% renewables by 2020 is making progress in the legislature with a possible vote in late August. Utilities are continuing to show high interest in the Utility-scale PV, driven by RPS goals and improving solar economics. First Solar is well positioned to grow rapidly in the United States market. We plan to increase our Systems project construction from 175-megawatt DC in 2010 to between 500- and 700-megawatt in 2011.
China has begun the 280-megawatt concessionary bidding process. The bidding is expected to be completed in August and to be the basis for FiT program economics. First Solar is reviewing concessionary bid documents to formulate its strategy for responding. First Solar is continuing to work with provincial and federal agencies on the Ordos project, the development for the first 30-megawatt phase of our two-gigawatt Cooperation Framework Agreement. We anticipate formal approval of the Ordos pre-feasibility study soon.
Due to delays in receiving any energy price either via Chinese FiT or a bilateral negotiation, construction is not expected to begin until the first phase, until the beginning of 2011.
Slide 16 updates analysts’ consensus view of the global PV market size between 2009 and 2012. Very strong growth in Germany driven by the FiT reduction has increased the 2010 estimates for the total global demand from 10 gigawatt to 12 gigawatt with a more modest growth rate in 2011 to 14 gigawatt total. Industry demand is expected to increase at a rate of 30% compounded growth -- rate from seven gigawatt in 2009 to over 16 gigawatt in 2012.
We illustrate here on Slide 17 that we are increasing annual capacity through improving line run rates and adding new factories. Q2 annualized line run rate rose 14% year-over-year to 59 megawatt as we continue to make good progress towards our goal of exceeding 80 megawatt per line by 2014. We're in the process, as we've mentioned, of significant capacity expansions that will add 14 new production lines or about 826 megawatt at current run rates in the coming years.
Slide 18 summarizes the second quarter module manufacturing cost per watt of $0.76 and continues to trend towards our goal in 2014 of between $0.52 and $0.63 a watt. We now are at less than half of our costs in 2005. Our module cost per watt is less than total best-of-breed polysilicon processing cost, which excludes raw material.
In summary, we had a really solid Q2. We had a lot of activity as you can tell, and we drove the Module cost down to a record low number and production up through a lot of good work in the operations side and throughput gains. We launched the Series 3 new product for low-voltage and improved efficiency. And as we said and mentioned, our demand will exceed our supply in 2010. Our second half pricing is expected to help drive sell-through and to position us for continued growth in 2011 and beyond. The global market is very strong in 2010, and we expect it to continue into 2011. We’re very well positioned through our acquisition of the North American pipeline and the establishment of our Utility-scale business to grow in North America and expand the business overall. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff to give a summary of the financial status."
4593731,109611539,70569,"First Solar, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the second quarter, we continued to experience strong module demand ahead of the July 1 German feed-in tariff change, continued growth in France and Italy, as well as growing sales through our project development",1322,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the second quarter, we continued to experience strong module demand ahead of the July 1 German feed-in tariff change, continued growth in France and Italy, as well as growing sales through our project development and EPC business. Net sales for the second quarter were $588 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and a sequential increase of $20 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
The sequential increase of 3.5% was mainly driven by a higher percentage of system revenue recognition for the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain and 30-megawatt Cimarron project, partially offset by a decrease in module ASPs due to a lower blended foreign exchange rate and the mix implications. 
Please note that we did not recognize any revenues for the Sarnia 50 project during the second quarter, due to the completed contract nature of this project. EPC system net sales increased from 7% of total net sales in the first quarter to 15% in the second quarter. The blended exchange rate in Q2 was down $0.03 quarter-over-quarter to $1.36 per euro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hedging programs. We produced 344 megawatts during the second quarter, up 7% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was a result of the fixed percent improvement in line, production to 59-megawatt per line annually and to more production days in the second quarter. Most of this increase will shift into construction in progress and inventory for the projects currently under construction and not yet recognized in our net sales.
Module cost per watt produced for the second quarter was $0.76, down $0.05, benefiting from higher throughput rates, improvement in conversion efficiency, lower material costs and the decline in the euro, partially offset by stock-based compensation comps. Core manufacturing cost per watt declined by $0.06 quarter-over-quarter to $0.74 per watt. We'd like to remind you that our long-term cost-reduction roadmap assumes annual cost declines of approximately 10% and that we expect more modest cost per watt declines in the second half of 2010.
Q2 gross margin was 48.3%, down by 1.4 percentage points over the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of increased EPC system mix impacting margins by approximately 2.3 percentage points, lower module ASPs and the accrued module replacement costs described earlier by Rob. These factors were mostly offset by the reduction in module manufacturing costs.
During the second quarter, we accrued $17.8 million in cost of sales for expected module replacement cost in our cost of goods sold. In addition, we accrued $5.6 million of operating expenses, associated with this process excursion, bringing our total accrued expenses to $27.4 million at the end of the second quarter. Module gross margins were 52.2% during the second quarter of 2010, essentially flat compared to the first quarter.
Operating expenses were up $12.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to increased stock-based compensation expenses, higher plant start-up costs and the aforementioned $5.6 million of one-time expenses. Our operating income for the second quarter was $180.5 million or 30.7% of net sales compared to $191 million or 33.7%, primarily due to the higher operating expenses, slightly offset by a higher gross profit.
Net income was $159 million or $1.84 per fully diluted share. The effective tax rate was 11.9% for the second quarter. In the second quarter, free cash flow consumed $57 million of cash with operating cash flow for $76 million due to approximately $170 million in project assets and unbilled accounts receivable that we expect to collect in the second half of 2010. We spent $134 million in capital expenditures against depreciation of $36 million.
Cash and all other marketable securities decreased by $59 million quarter-over-quarter to $960 million. That decreased by $24 million to $139 million. Our debt-to-equity ratio remains low at 5%, providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Please note that our cash balances subsequently [ph] (37:31) declined to $667 million with the close of our NextLight acquisition.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions on the line of our guidance. We have allocated further modules from the EPC and Systems business to the Module business due to strong module demand discussed earlier, causing a reduction in our net sales outlook for 2010. Third quarter pricing is set to reflect the 2010 feed-in tariff changes in Germany, while fourth quarter pricing has been set to position our channel partners for sales for 2011 in anticipation of further feed-in tariff declines. We have reduced our euro spot exchange rate assumptions from $1.30 to $1.20 per euro, reducing foreign exchange exposure to our 2010 outlook. For the remainder of the year, approximately 53% of our net sales and 64% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate of $1.33. 
For the third quarter, 71% of our net income is hedged at a rate of $1.32. As of today, the $0.01 change in the dollar to euro exchange rate impacts revenues by about $3 million and net income by about $2 million, providing approximately $0.20 of EPS buffer at today's foreign exchange rate. The impact of the NextLight acquisition remains unchanged at $0.09 to $0.10 EPS reduction, subject to final purchase accounting in the third quarter. We plan to begin shipments for KLM 5 and 6 in the first half of 2011. Capital spending includes KLM Plants 5 and 6, our Frankfurt (Oder) Plant 2 and our French facility.
Based on these assumptions, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance, while reducing net sales due to mix shift from Systems to Module sales and less pass-through revenues. Net sales are forecasted to range from $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Gross margin guidance of 44% to 45% is up from prior guidance due to increased Module segment mix and a better pricing environment, partially offset by the more conservative foreign exchange assumption. 2010 module gross margins are expected between 49% and 51%.
We expect plant start-up costs of $20 million, primarily from Malaysia Plants 5 and 6 in the second half of 2010, down from $27 million in our previous guidance. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $90 million to $100 million with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold in line with prior guidance. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 27% to 29% with module operating margins at 32% to 34%, up from prior guidance due to the more favorable pricing environment, partially offset by the weaker euro. We expect our 2010 tax rate to be 12% to 13%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of 86 million to 87 million shares.
Earnings per diluted share are increased to an estimated range of $7 to $7.40 for the year 2010. CapEx for the year is expected to be $575 million to $625 million. Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, down from prior guidance due to investments in the development of the NextLight project assets. RONA guidance is 18% to 19%, slightly below our 20% target as we continue to scale up our Utility Systems business.
Finally, Slide 31 shows the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition by segment and the resulting mix impact on our consolidated gross margin. Please note that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will add up to 100%. The majority of our EPC and project development revenues remain in the second half of 2010. However, the further reduction in EPC sales for 2010 comes from the fourth quarter. The margin profile follows the segment mix. The growing EPC mix is expected to dilute our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter. Module margins declined in Q3 and Q4 due to the revised foreign exchange rate assumption and the anticipated pricing assumptions built into our guidance.

We have been able to be effective from the early days with the first El Dorado facility a couple of years ago. The increase in our installation rates, the lower costs, the improved engineering designs, have all allowed us to drive down the cost. And then, of course, the scale going from just a few megawatts a couple of years ago to the 175 or so this year that we're looking at and the 400 to 700 next year that we're looking at, also contribute to driving the cost down. We do expect to be able to hit our roadmap for costs over time, and the challenge will continue to be to address the effects of inflation over time. In terms of the materials costs, yes, we've made steady progress. I think that our supply-chain folks have done an excellent job, actually, going out into the marketplace, making good use of the scale at which we are procuring materials today and finding the good quality suppliers that are able to  satisfy our needs over the long term. And that has proved beneficial throughout this year, and we're going to continue to work on it."

I want to quickly turn to the performance summary. We had a really strong quarter with net sales of $588 million, which was 12% growth year-over-year. Our net income",2055,"Thanks, Larry, and thanks, everybody, for joining our second quarter earnings call today. I want to quickly turn to the performance summary. We had a really strong quarter with net sales of $588 million, which was 12% growth year-over-year. Our net income was $159 million or 27.1% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share was $1.84. 
The return on net assets was 21.1% on a fourth quarter rolling basis, and marketable securities were $960 million, which is $232 million increase year-over-year. Our production in the quarter was 344-megawatt, up 19% versus prior year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. The annual capacity per line increased to 59-megawatt, which equates to adding two new production lines to our existing and planned capacity. This improvement increases our current and announced capacity to 2.2 gigawatt by 2012.
Our conversion efficiency was 11.2%, which is an improvement of $0.03 year-over-year. The cost per watt was $0.76, which is down 13% year-over-year and down $0.05 from the first quarter of 2010. We're on track with our expansion to the Malaysian facility and the addition of Plants 5 and 6. Shipments will begin in the first half of 2011. We also recently announced the addition of a new four-line plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, where shipments will begin in the fourth quarter of 2011.
On July 1, we launched our Series 3 Module, which is an extension of our industry-leading design. The Series 3 product is our low-voltage platform that further improves efficiency, lowers Module and balanced systems costs and provides field energy yield advantages, relative to polycrystalline or crystalline silicon. I'll discuss this further during this presentation today.
Finally, in Q2, a reflected cost, associated with a Module replacement program. During the period from June of 2008 to June of 2009, a manufacturing excursion occurred affecting less than 4% of the total product manufacture within the period. The excursion could result in possible premature power loss in affected Modules. The root cause was identified and subsequently mitigated in June of 2009. Ongoing testing confirms the corrective actions are effective. We have been working directly with impacted customers to replace the affected Modules, and these efforts are well underway and, in some cases, complete. Some of these efforts go beyond our normal warranty coverage.
We accrued the estimated full cost of these additional efforts in our Q2 results, and Jens will discuss the financial impact in more detail.
I now would like to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made on our Utility Systems business and the projects that we have underway. So first turning to Page 7, the picture on Slide 7 demonstrates the progress we've made on expanding the 20-megawatt site to 80 megawatts for Enbridge in Ontario, Canada. The construction is on schedule and highlights the progress our EPC team has made in cycle time and Balance of Systems cost. The 60-megawatt expansion is expected to be completed at a velocity that's 2x the rate of the first phase built less than a year ago. Half the site is now producing power and another quarter will be connected very soon.
Turning now to Copper Mountain. Slide 8 shows 48-megawatt expansion of our original 10-megawatt installations at the El Dorado site for Sempra Generation. El Dorado is the first site we constructed in North America in late 2008. The expansion also highlights the progress made in design and execution of Utility-scale solar plants.
Cimarron project in New Mexico for Southern Company is our first large-scale installation of the Series 3 product. The construction is underway and progressing well. Our mention of Series 3 and the installation at Cimarron Park. Now you can see on Page 10, the Series 3 provides higher efficiencies with initial product launch having 2/10 improvement over the existing Series 2 product. The higher efficiency also lowers cost per watt. Series 3 retains the band gap and temperature coefficient strength of Series 2 and continues the energy yield advantages over crystalline silicon. 
The low voltage enables up to 50% more Modules per string, which further reduces the Balance of Systems costs. In addition, it has new locking connectors, which provides faster installation and improved connection reliability. Series 3 retains the same form factor, Module construction and semiconductor processes as Series 2. This will be our new technology platform for the future energy improvements that we make.
Agua Caliente is the first project we expect to realize from the NextLight acquisition. The CPUC has approved the 290-megawatt project, and the major permits are in place. We plan to begin construction in 2010 and start installation of Modules in 2011. In addition, yesterday, the first NextLight Silver State project of 50-megawatt received Public Utility Commission of Nevada approval of the PPA with NV Energy. Work is ongoing to obtain BLM approval to a final environmental impact study in 2010.
The NextLight acquisition was closed on July 12 and increases our North American contract pipeline to 2.2 gigawatt. We've already benefited from the experienced team at NextLight and expect to begin to realize the value of the 570-megawatt PPA pipeline starting in 2011. The purchase price at closing is about $297 million in cash, and we expect to incur $12 million of additional operating costs in the second half of 2010. As previously announced, the acquisition is expected to reduce 2010 earnings by $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share.
With the completion of the NextLight acquisition, we also announced the formation of a Utility Systems business. This signifies the importance of this segment to our future growth and our objective of expanding global demand for solar power.
On Slide 13, we've outlined our mission for the Utility Systems business. I’ve asked Jens Meyerhoff to lead this business. Many of you know Jens is our CFO, but in addition, he's been a significant contributor to the development of our business strategy and to the acquisition of the development businesses which constitute what we now call Utility Systems. He is uniquely qualified to lead this business, and I’m really excited about the contributions that both he and the team will make to the continuing success of First Solar.
With our goal of providing solutions at the lowest cost for our Utility customers and to ultimately provide an asset which competes with fossil fuel sources, we have to consider all aspects of the value chain. We want to minimize LCOE, while at the same time, maximize the return for our project owners, and First Solar is uniquely positioned to provide both through driving performance and execution from the Module to the Balance of Systems, project development and financing. All four of these elements must be optimized to achieve our goal of future cost parity.
I'd like to give you an update of the market and what's happened and changes that we've seen since last quarter. First of all, in Germany. The German government, as you know, decided on the new 2010 and 2011 FiT disgression, implementation timing and growth corridors [ph] (25:25). We expect the German market to remain strong for the remainder of 2010. We implemented some price adjustments in the second half to ensure sell-through at the new FiT and to position us for 2011 and beyond project sales.
The 2010 German market demand is expected to be in the range from six to eight gigawatts.
We expect to remain capacity-constrained in the second half of 2010 and have allocated Modules from our Systems business to serve our Module customer demand. Our 2.2 gigawatt of captive projects acts as a buffer against potential demand fluctuations in the European market. We continue to work with our partners to expand the business in Europe. In Q2, we've made a lot of progress to that end, diversifying our country mix as Germany's portion of our net sales declined from approximately 71% to 50% year-over-year and the United States became our #2 market, followed closely by France and Italy.
As it relates to Italy, Spain and France, Italy has decided on a 2011 FiT reduction. The level of digression and implementation over several quarters is expected to continue to enable investor returns and encourage demand growth in the second half of 2010 and into 2011. The Spanish government is developing a new energy bill that will reset PV FiTs at lower levels. The mw cap level is expected to remain unchanged. The bill is expected to be published in the third quarter of Q4 and for implementation then.
Due to stronger French PV systems demand than anticipated, the government has begun to consider a FiT digression sooner than planned and a planned 2012 reduction. It's too early, really, to access the magnitude or timing of changes, but a change is possible in the second half of 2010. First Solar continues to believe that good solar ratings in Italy, France and Spain and the support for the policy of the European Union’s 20% goal in renewables by 2020 will continue to drive robust demand for PV.
In North America, California SB 722 mandating 33% renewables by 2020 is making progress in the legislature with a possible vote in late August. Utilities are continuing to show high interest in the Utility-scale PV, driven by RPS goals and improving solar economics. First Solar is well positioned to grow rapidly in the United States market. We plan to increase our Systems project construction from 175-megawatt DC in 2010 to between 500- and 700-megawatt in 2011.
China has begun the 280-megawatt concessionary bidding process. The bidding is expected to be completed in August and to be the basis for FiT program economics. First Solar is reviewing concessionary bid documents to formulate its strategy for responding. First Solar is continuing to work with provincial and federal agencies on the Ordos project, the development for the first 30-megawatt phase of our two-gigawatt Cooperation Framework Agreement. We anticipate formal approval of the Ordos pre-feasibility study soon.
Due to delays in receiving any energy price either via Chinese FiT or a bilateral negotiation, construction is not expected to begin until the first phase, until the beginning of 2011.
Slide 16 updates analysts’ consensus view of the global PV market size between 2009 and 2012. Very strong growth in Germany driven by the FiT reduction has increased the 2010 estimates for the total global demand from 10 gigawatt to 12 gigawatt with a more modest growth rate in 2011 to 14 gigawatt total. Industry demand is expected to increase at a rate of 30% compounded growth -- rate from seven gigawatt in 2009 to over 16 gigawatt in 2012.
We illustrate here on Slide 17 that we are increasing annual capacity through improving line run rates and adding new factories. Q2 annualized line run rate rose 14% year-over-year to 59 megawatt as we continue to make good progress towards our goal of exceeding 80 megawatt per line by 2014. We're in the process, as we've mentioned, of significant capacity expansions that will add 14 new production lines or about 826 megawatt at current run rates in the coming years.
Slide 18 summarizes the second quarter Module manufacturing cost per watt of $0.76 and continues to trend towards our goal in 2014 of between $0.52 and $0.63 a watt. We now are at less than half of our costs in 2005. Our Module cost per watt is less than total best-of-breed polysilicon processing cost, which excludes raw material.
In summary, we had a really solid Q2. We had a lot of activity as you can tell, and we drove the Module cost down to a record low number and production up through a lot of good work in the operations side and throughput gains. We launched the Series 3 new product for low-voltage and improved efficiency. And as we said and mentioned, our demand will exceed our supply in 2010. Our second half pricing is expected to help drive sell-through and to position us for continued growth in 2011 and beyond. The global market is very strong in 2010, and we expect it to continue into 2011. We’re very well positioned through our acquisition of the North American pipeline and the establishment of our Utility-scale business to grow in North America and expand the business overall. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff to give a summary of the financial status."
4593731,109611539,71370,"First Solar, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the second quarter, we continued to experience strong Module demand ahead of the July 1 German feed-in tariff change, continued growth in France and Italy, as well as growing sales through our project development",1316,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the second quarter, we continued to experience strong Module demand ahead of the July 1 German feed-in tariff change, continued growth in France and Italy, as well as growing sales through our project development and EPC business. Net sales for the second quarter were $588 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and a sequential increase of $20 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
The sequential increase of 3.5% was mainly driven by a higher percentage of system revenue recognition for the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain and 30-megawatt Cimarron project, partially offset by a decrease in Module ASPs due to a lower blended foreign exchange rate and the mix implications. 
Please note that we did not recognize any revenues for the Sarnia 50 project during the second quarter, due to the completed contract nature of this project. EPC system net sales increased from 7% of total net sales in the first quarter to 15% in the second quarter. The blended exchange rate in Q2 was down $0.03 quarter-over-quarter to $1.36 per euro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hedging programs. We produced 344 megawatts during the second quarter, up 7% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was a result of the fixed percent improvement in line, production to 59-megawatt per line annually and to more production days in the second quarter. Most of this increase will shift into construction in progress and inventory for the projects currently under construction and not yet recognized in our net sales.
Module cost per watt produced for the second quarter was $0.76, down $0.05, benefiting from higher throughput rates, improvement in conversion efficiency, lower material costs and the decline in the euro, partially offset by stock-based compensation comps. Core manufacturing cost per watt declined by $0.06 quarter-over-quarter to $0.74 per watt. We'd like to remind you that our long-term cost-reduction roadmap assumes annual cost declines of approximately 10% and that we expect more modest cost per watt declines in the second half of 2010.
Q2 gross margin was 48.3%, down by 1.4 percentage points over the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of increased EPC system mix impacting margins by approximately 2.3 percentage points, lower Module ASPs and the accrued Module replacement costs described earlier by Rob. These factors were mostly offset by the reduction in Module manufacturing costs.
During the second quarter, we accrued $17.8 million in cost of sales for expected Module replacement cost in our cost of goods sold. In addition, we accrued $5.6 million of operating expenses, associated with this process excursion, bringing our total accrued expenses to $27.4 million at the end of the second quarter. Module gross margins were 52.2% during the second quarter of 2010, essentially flat compared to the first quarter.
Operating expenses were up $12.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to increased stock-based compensation expenses, higher plant start-up costs and the aforementioned $5.6 million of one-time expenses. Our operating income for the second quarter was $180.5 million or 30.7% of net sales compared to $191 million or 33.7%, primarily due to the higher operating expenses, slightly offset by a higher gross profit.
Net income was $159 million or $1.84 per fully diluted share. The effective tax rate was 11.9% for the second quarter. In the second quarter, free cash flow consumed $57 million of cash with operating cash flow for $76 million due to approximately $170 million in project assets and unbilled accounts receivable that we expect to collect in the second half of 2010. We spent $134 million in capital expenditures against depreciation of $36 million.
Cash and all other marketable securities decreased by $59 million quarter-over-quarter to $960 million. Debt decreased by $24 million to $139 million. Our debt-to-equity ratio remains low at 5%, providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Please note that our cash balances subsequently declined to $667 million with the close of our NextLight acquisition.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We have allocated further Modules from the EPC and Systems business to the Module business due to strong Module demand discussed earlier, causing a reduction in our net sales outlook for 2010. Third quarter pricing is set to reflect the 2010 feed-in tariff changes in Germany, while fourth quarter pricing has been set to position our channel partners for sales for 2011 in anticipation of further feed-in tariff declines. We have reduced our euro spot exchange rate assumptions from $1.30 to $1.20 per euro, reducing foreign exchange exposure to our 2010 outlook. For the remainder of the year, approximately 53% of our net sales and 64% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate of $1.33. 
For the third quarter, 71% of our net income is hedged at a rate of $1.32. As of today, the $0.01 change in the dollar to euro exchange rate impacts revenues by about $3 million and net income by about $2 million, providing approximately $0.20 of EPS buffer at today's foreign exchange rate. The impact of the NextLight acquisition remains unchanged at $0.09 to $0.10 EPS reduction, subject to final purchase accounting in the third quarter. We plan to begin shipments for KLM 5 and 6 in the first half of 2011. Capital spending includes KLM Plants 5 and 6, our Frankfurt-Oder Plant 2 and our French facility.
Based on these assumptions, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance, while reducing net sales due to mix shift from Systems to Module sales and less pass-through revenues. Net sales are forecasted to range from $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Gross margin guidance of 44% to 45% is up from prior guidance due to increased Module segment mix and a better pricing environment, partially offset by the more conservative foreign exchange assumption. 2010 Module gross margins are expected between 49% and 51%.
We expect plant start-up costs of $20 million, primarily from Malaysia Plants 5 and 6 in the second half of 2010, down from $27 million in our previous guidance. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $90 million to $100 million with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold in line with prior guidance. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 27% to 29% with Module operating margins at 32% to 34%, up from prior guidance due to the more favorable pricing environment, partially offset by the weaker euro. We expect our 2010 tax rate to be 12% to 13%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of 86 million to 87 million shares.
Earnings per diluted share are increased to an estimated range of $7 to $7.40 for the year 2010. CapEx for the year is expected to be $575 million to $625 million. Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, down from prior guidance due to investments in the development of the NextLight project assets. RONA guidance is 18% to 19%, slightly below our 20% target as we continue to scale up our Utility Systems business.
Finally, Slide 31 shows the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition by segment and the resulting mix impact on our consolidated gross margin. Please note that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will add up to 100%. The majority of our EPC and project development revenues remain in the second half of 2010. However, the further reduction in EPC sales for 2010 comes from the fourth quarter. The margin profile follows the segment mix. The growing EPC mix is expected to dilute our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter. Module margins declined in Q3 and Q4 due to the revised foreign exchange rate assumption and the anticipated pricing assumptions built into our guidance.

At the same point in time, we're in active discussion around DOE application, which we're in for this project, right, which guides the overall debt side of the financing.

At the same point in time, I'd like to reiterate that it's probably not the most useful exercise to track each and every milestone on the permitting side on these projects.

So I think if you look at it, so mathematically, as you know, the EPC business has been an enabler, right, that in any scenario results to an operating income of breakeven. So what you see underlying in this guidance, if you compare our Module guidance to the prior quarter, the Module margin guidance is flat. One reason for that is that the EPC margin mathematically increases through the reduction of revenues on the EPC side; however, still requiring a certain contribution margin in order to cover all the fixed costs. So this is purely a mathematical impact out of this enabler concept. It is not really an implication of a change in profitability in the EPC business. As a matter of fact, to some degree, the Module business is indirectly, right, subsidizing the lack of scale in the EPC business because it utilizes the EPC business at the channel."

I think that as it relates to the bills that are on the table and considered today, we do our best through government relations to position the industry and ourselves for growth. I think that development is clearly a local effort and one that requires local knowledge and relationships. So it still is driven quite a bit both locally and from a state standpoint with the RPS objectives. We continue to -- we find our definition of what we believe will be a sustainable market, our focus and strategy as we've put together and presented it before is to maximize our penetration in the markets that are subsidized and focus on markets that are in transition that we believe will be sustainable over time. So that relates to a certain amount of available solar resource combined with what we believe about the future costs of energy in given regions. So the southern United States is definitely the Southwest. France, as you know, has a lot of good insulation and good support from a feed-in tariff standpoint, especially in the South, as does Italy and Spain. India, we've had a number of visits and conversations with how do we grow that market and work with partners there to do so? And we mentioned what we're doing in China, as well as some efforts underway in Australia. So those are all markets that I would highlight that are in transition. And we've made a significant investment in monetary terms as well as now people on the Utility Systems business to grow and more rapidly grow the market overall. So those are the areas that we focused on and we will do development in areas of the world that we believe, over time, will be sustainable and as we define them beyond what I just described, we'll let you know."

I want to quickly turn to the performance summary. We had a really strong quarter with net sales of $588 million, which was 12% growth year-over-year. Our net income",2054,"Thanks, Larry, and thanks, everybody, for joining our second quarter earnings call today. I want to quickly turn to the performance summary. We had a really strong quarter with net sales of $588 million, which was 12% growth year-over-year. Our net income was $159 million or 27.1% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share was $1.84. 
The return on net assets was 21.1% on a fourth quarter rolling basis, and marketable securities were $960 million, which is $232 million increase year-over-year. Our production in the quarter was 344-megawatt, up 19% versus prior year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. The annual capacity per line increased to 59-megawatt, which equates to adding two new production lines to our existing and planned capacity. This improvement increases our current and announced capacity to 2.2 gigawatt by 2012.
Our conversion efficiency was 11.2%, which is an improvement of $0.03 year-over-year. The cost per watt was $0.76, which is down 13% year-over-year and down $0.05 from the first quarter of 2010. We're on track with our expansion to the Malaysian facility and the addition of Plants 5 and 6. Shipments will begin in the first half of 2011. We also recently announced the addition of a new four-line plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, where shipments will begin in the fourth quarter of 2011.
On July 1, we launched our Series 3 module, which is an extension of our industry-leading design. The Series 3 product is our low-voltage platform that further improves efficiency, lowers module and balanced systems costs and provides field energy yield advantages, relative to polycrystalline or crystalline silicon. I'll discuss this further during this presentation today.
Finally, in Q2, a reflected cost, associated with a module replacement program. During the period from June of 2008 to June of 2009, a manufacturing excursion occurred affecting less than 4% of the total product manufacture within the period. The excursion could result in possible premature power loss in affected modules. The root cause was identified and subsequently mitigated in June of 2009. Ongoing testing confirms the corrective actions are effective. We have been working directly with impacted customers to replace the affected modules, and these efforts are well underway and, in some cases, complete. Some of these efforts go beyond our normal warranty coverage.
We accrued the estimated full cost of these additional efforts in our Q2 results, and Jens will discuss the financial impact in more detail.
I now would like to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made on our Utility Systems business and the project that we have underway. So first turning to Page 7, the picture on Slide 7 demonstrates the progress we've made on expanding the 20-megawatt site to 80 megawatts for Enbridge in Ontario, Canada. The construction is on schedule and highlights the progress our EPC team has made in cycle time and Balance of Systems cost. The 60-megawatt expansion is expected to be completed at a velocity that's 2x the rate of the first phase built less than a year ago. Half the site is now producing power and another quarter will be connected very soon.
Turning now to Copper Mountain. Slide 8 shows 48-megawatt expansion of our original 10-megawatt installations at the El Dorado site for Sempra Generation. El Dorado is the first site we constructed in North America in late 2008. The expansion also highlights the progress made in design and execution of Utility-scale solar plants.
Cimarron project in New Mexico for Southern Company is our first large-scale installation of the Series 3 product. The construction is underway and progressing well. Our mention of Series 3 and the installation at Cimarron Park. Now you can see on Page 10, the Series 3 provides higher efficiencies with initial product launch having 2/10 improvement over the existing Series 2 product. The higher efficiency also lowers cost per watt. Series 3 retains the band gap and temperature coefficient strength of Series 2 and continues the energy yield advantages over crystalline silicon. 
The low-voltage enables up to 50% more modules per string, which further reduces the Balance of Systems costs. In addition, it has new locking connectors, which provides faster installation and improved connection reliability. Series 3 retains the same form factor, module construction and semiconductor processes as Series 2. This will be our new technology platform for the future energy improvements that we make.
Agua Caliente is the first project we expect to realize from the NextLight acquisition. The CPUC has approved the 290-megawatt project, and the major permits are in place. We plan to begin construction in 2010 and start installation of modules in 2011. In addition, yesterday, the first NextLight Silver State project of 50-megawatt received Public Utility Commission of Nevada approval of the PPA with NV Energy. Work is ongoing to obtain BLM approval to a final environmental impact study in 2010.
The NextLight acquisition was closed on July 12 and increases our North American contract pipeline to 2.2 gigawatt. We've already benefited from the experienced team at NextLight and expect to begin to realize the value of the 570-megawatt PPA pipeline starting in 2011. The purchase price at closing is about $297 million in cash, and we expect to incur $12 million of additional operating costs in the second half of 2010. As previously announced, the acquisition is expected to reduce 2010 earnings by $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share.
With the completion of the NextLight acquisition, we also announced the formation of a Utility Systems business. This signifies the importance of this segment to our future growth and our objective of expanding global demand for solar power.
On Slide 13, we've outlined our mission for the Utility Systems business. I’ve asked Jens Meyerhoff to lead this business. Many of you know Jens is our CFO, but in addition, he's been a significant contributor to the development of our business strategy and to the acquisition of the development businesses which constitute what we now call Utility Systems. He is uniquely qualified to lead this business, and I’m really excited about the contributions that both he and the team will make to the continuing success of First Solar.
With our goal of providing solutions at the lowest cost for our Utility customers and to ultimately provide an asset which competes with fossil fuel sources, we have to consider all aspects of the value chain. We want to minimize LCOE, while at the same time, maximize the return for our project owners, and First Solar is uniquely positioned to provide both through driving performance and execution from the module to the Balance of Systems, project development and financing. All four of these elements must be optimized to achieve our goal of future cost parity.
I'd like to give you an update of the market and what's happened and changes that we've seen since last quarter. First of all, in Germany. The German government, as you know, decided on the new 2010 and 2011 FiT digression, implementation timing and growth corridors [ph] (25:25). We expect the German market to remain strong for the remainder of 2010. We implemented some price adjustments in the second half to ensure sell-through at the new FiT and to position us for 2011 and beyond project sales.
The 2010 German market demand is expected to be in the range from six to eight gigawatts.
We expect to remain capacity-constrained in the second half of 2010 and have allocated modules from our Systems business to serve our module customer demand. Our 2.2 gigawatt of captive projects acts as a buffer against potential demand fluctuations in the European market. We continue to work with our partners to expand the business in Europe. In Q2, we've made a lot of progress to that end, diversifying our country mix as Germany's portion of our net sales declined from approximately 71% to 50% year-over-year and the United States became our #2 market, followed closely by France and Italy.
As it relates to Italy, Spain and France, Italy has decided on a 2011 FiT reduction. The level of digression and implementation over several quarters is expected to continue to enable investor returns and encourage demand growth in the second half of 2010 and into 2011. The Spanish government is developing a new energy bill that will reset PV FiTs at lower levels. The mw cap level is expected to remain unchanged. The bill is expected to be published in the third quarter of Q4 and for implementation then.
Due to stronger French PV systems demand than anticipated, the government has begun to consider a FiT digression sooner than planned and a planned 2012 reduction. It's too early, really, to access the magnitude or timing of changes, but a change is possible in the second half of 2010. First Solar continues to believe that good solar ratings in Italy, France and Spain and the support for the policy of the European Union’s 20% goal in renewables by 2020 will continue to drive robust demand for PV.
In North America, California SB 722 mandating 33% renewables by 2020 is making progress in the legislature with a possible vote in late August. Utilities are continuing to show high interest in the Utility-scale PV, driven by RPS goals and improving solar economics. First Solar is well positioned to grow rapidly in the United States market. We plan to increase our Systems project construction from 175-megawatt DC in 2010 to between 500- and 700-megawatt in 2011.
China has begun the 280-megawatt concessionary bidding process. The bidding is expected to be completed in August and to be the basis for FiT program economics. First Solar is reviewing concessionary bid documents to formulate its strategy for responding. First Solar is continuing to work with provincial and federal agencies on the Ordos project, the development for the first 30-megawatt phase of our two-gigawatt Cooperation Framework Agreement. We anticipate formal approval of the Ordos pre-feasibility study soon.
Due to delays in receiving any energy price either via Chinese FiT or a bilateral negotiation, construction is not expected to begin until the first phase, until the beginning of 2011.
Slide 16 updates analysts’ consensus view of the global PV market size between 2009 and 2012. Very strong growth in Germany driven by the FiT reduction has increased the 2010 estimates for the total global demand from 10 gigawatt to 12 gigawatt with a more modest growth rate in 2011 to 14 gigawatt total. Industry demand is expected to increase at a rate of 30% compounded growth -- rate from seven gigawatt in 2009 to over 16 gigawatt in 2012.
We illustrate here on Slide 17 that we are increasing annual capacity through improving line run rates and adding new factories. Q2 annualized line run rate rose 14% year-over-year to 59 megawatt as we continue to make good progress towards our goal of exceeding 80 megawatt per line by 2014. We're in the process, as we've mentioned, of significant capacity expansions that will add 14 new production lines or about 826 megawatt at current run rates in the coming years.
Slide 18 summarizes the second quarter module manufacturing cost per watt of $0.76 and continues to trend towards our goal in 2014 of between $0.52 and $0.63 a watt. We now are at less than half of our costs in 2005. Our module cost per watt is less than total best-of-breed polysilicon processing cost, which excludes raw material.
In summary, we had a really solid Q2. We had a lot of activity as you can tell, and we drove the Module cost down to a record low number and production up through a lot of good work in the operations side and throughput gains. We launched the Series 3 new product for low-voltage and improved efficiency. And as we said and mentioned, our demand will exceed our supply in 2010. Our second half pricing is expected to help drive sell-through and to position us for continued growth in 2011 and beyond. The global market is very strong in 2010, and we expect it to continue into 2011. We’re very well positioned through our acquisition of the North American pipeline and the establishment of our Utility-scale business to grow in North America and expand the business overall. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff to give a summary of the financial status."
4593731,109611539,71661,"First Solar, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the second quarter, we continued to experience strong module demand ahead of the July 1 German feed-in tariff change, continued growth in France and Italy, as well as growing sales through our project development",1322,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the second quarter, we continued to experience strong module demand ahead of the July 1 German feed-in tariff change, continued growth in France and Italy, as well as growing sales through our project development and EPC business. Net sales for the second quarter were $588 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and a sequential increase of $20 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. 
The sequential increase of 3.5% was mainly driven by a higher percentage of system revenue recognition for the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain and 30-megawatt Cimarron project, partially offset by a decrease in module ASPs due to a lower blended foreign exchange rate and the mix implications. 
Please note that we did not recognize any revenues for the Sarnia 50 project during the second quarter, due to the completed contract nature of this project. EPC system net sales increased from 7% of total net sales in the first quarter to 15% in the second quarter. The blended exchange rate in Q2 was down $0.03 quarter-over-quarter to $1.36 per euro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hedging programs. We produced 344 megawatts during the second quarter, up 7% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was a result of the fixed percent improvement in line, production to 59-megawatt per line annually and to more production days in the second quarter. Most of this increase will shift into construction in progress and inventory for the projects currently under construction and not yet recognized in our net sales.
Module cost per watt produced for the second quarter was $0.76, down $0.05, benefiting from higher throughput rates, improvement in conversion efficiency, lower material costs and the decline in the euro, partially offset by stock-based compensation comps. Core manufacturing cost per watt declined by $0.06 quarter-over-quarter to $0.74 per watt. We'd like to remind you that our long-term cost-reduction roadmap assumes annual cost declines of approximately 10% and that we expect more modest cost per watt declines in the second half of 2010.
Q2 gross margin was 48.3%, down by 1.4 percentage points over the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of increased EPC system mix impacting margins by approximately 2.3 percentage points, lower module ASPs and the accrued module replacement costs described earlier by Rob. These factors were mostly offset by the reduction in module manufacturing costs.
During the second quarter, we accrued $17.8 million in cost of sales for expected module replacement cost in our cost of goods sold. In addition, we accrued $5.6 million of operating expenses, associated with this process excursion, bringing our total accrued expenses to $27.4 million at the end of the second quarter. Module gross margins were 52.2% during the second quarter of 2010, essentially flat compared to the first quarter.
Operating expenses were up $12.8 million quarter-over-quarter due to increased stock-based compensation expenses, higher plant start-up costs and the aforementioned $5.6 million of one-time expenses. Our operating income for the second quarter was $180.5 million or 30.7% of net sales compared to $191 million or 33.7%, primarily due to the higher operating expenses, slightly offset by a higher gross profit.
Net income was $159 million or $1.84 per fully diluted share. The effective tax rate was 11.9% for the second quarter. In the second quarter, free cash flow consumed $57 million of cash with operating cash flow for $76 million due to approximately $170 million in project assets and unbilled accounts receivable that we expect to collect in the second half of 2010. We spent $134 million in capital expenditures against depreciation of $36 million.
Cash and all other marketable securities decreased by $59 million quarter-over-quarter to $960 million. That decreased by $24 million to $139 million. Our debt-to-equity ratio remains low at 5%, providing us with the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Please note that our cash balances subsequently [ph] (37:31) declined to $667 million with the close of our NextLight acquisition.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions on the line of our guidance. We have allocated further modules from the EPC and Systems business to the Module business due to strong module demand discussed earlier, causing a reduction in our net sales outlook for 2010. Third quarter pricing is set to reflect the 2010 feed-in tariff changes in Germany, while fourth quarter pricing has been set to position our channel partners for sales for 2011 in anticipation of further feed-in tariff declines. We have reduced our euro spot exchange rate assumptions from $1.30 to $1.20 per euro, reducing foreign exchange exposure to our 2010 outlook. For the remainder of the year, approximately 53% of our net sales and 64% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate of $1.33. 
For the third quarter, 71% of our net income is hedged at a rate of $1.32. As of today, the $0.01 change in the dollar to euro exchange rate impacts revenues by about $3 million and net income by about $2 million, providing approximately $0.20 of EPS buffer at today's foreign exchange rate. The impact of the NextLight acquisition remains unchanged at $0.09 to $0.10 EPS reduction, subject to final purchase accounting in the third quarter. We plan to begin shipments for KLM 5 and 6 in the first half of 2011. Capital spending includes KLM Plants 5 and 6, our Frankfurt (Oder) Plant 2 and our French facility.
Based on these assumptions, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance, while reducing net sales due to mix shift from Systems to Module sales and less pass-through revenues. Net sales are forecasted to range from $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Gross margin guidance of 44% to 45% is up from prior guidance due to increased Module segment mix and a better pricing environment, partially offset by the more conservative foreign exchange assumption. 2010 module gross margins are expected between 49% and 51%.
We expect plant start-up costs of $20 million, primarily from Malaysia Plants 5 and 6 in the second half of 2010, down from $27 million in our previous guidance. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $90 million to $100 million with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold in line with prior guidance. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 27% to 29% with module operating margins at 32% to 34%, up from prior guidance due to the more favorable pricing environment, partially offset by the weaker euro. We expect our 2010 tax rate to be 12% to 13%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of 86 million to 87 million shares.
Earnings per diluted share are increased to an estimated range of $7 to $7.40 for the year 2010. CapEx for the year is expected to be $575 million to $625 million. Operating cash flow is projected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, down from prior guidance due to investments in the development of the NextLight project assets. RONA guidance is 18% to 19%, slightly below our 20% target as we continue to scale up our Utility Systems business.
Finally, Slide 31 shows the expected quarterly profile of revenue recognition by segment and the resulting mix impact on our consolidated gross margin. Please note that as you read horizontally across each line, the quarters will add up to 100%. The majority of our EPC and project development revenues remain in the second half of 2010. However, the further reduction in EPC sales for 2010 comes from the fourth quarter. The margin profile follows the segment mix. The growing EPC mix is expected to dilute our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter. Module margins declined in Q3 and Q4 due to the revised foreign exchange rate assumption and the anticipated pricing assumptions built into our guidance.

And then, of course, the scale, going from just a few megawatts a couple of years ago to the 175 or so this year that we're looking at and the 400 to 700 next year that we're looking at, also contribute to driving the costs down. We do expect to be able to hit our roadmap for costs over time, and the challenge will continue to be to address the effects of inflation over time. In terms of the materials cost, yes, we've made steady progress. I think that our supply chain folks have done an excellent job, actually, going out into the marketplace, making good use of the scale at which we are procuring materials today and finding the good quality suppliers that are able to  satisfy our needs over the long term. And that has proved beneficial throughout this year, and we're going to continue to work on it."

Our focus and strategy as we've put together and presented before is to maximize our penetration in the markets that are subsidized and focus on markets that are in transition that we believe will be sustainable over time. So that relates to a certain amount of available solar resource combined with what we believe about the future costs of energy in given regions. So the South, Southern United States, it's definitely the Southwest. France, as you know, has a lot of good installation and good support from a [indiscernible] (1:06:21) standpoint, especially in the South, as does Italy and Spain. India, we've had a number of visits and conversations with, how do we grow that market and work with partners there to do so?

Thanks, Larry, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. We had strong quarter with net sales of $798 million, which is a 66% increase over Q3 of 2009. The quarter includes revenue recognition of the 60 megawatt Sarnia project. The net income was $177 m",2613,"Great. Thanks, Larry, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. We had strong quarter with net sales of $798 million, which is a 66% increase over Q3 of 2009. The quarter includes revenue recognition of the 60 megawatt Sarnia project. The net income was $177 million or 22.2% of net sales, and our diluted EPS was $2.04 a share. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.17 due to a $14.7 million charge onetime tax expense to repatriate $300 million in foreign earnings. Jens will describe the transaction during the financial portion of today's presentation.
The return on net assets was 20.4% on a four quarter rolling basis, representing an EBA of 8% or 300 basis points above our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $997 million is an increase by $37 million sequentially. We drew down $100 million of our revolver and paid for the NextLight acquisition in the quarter. 
Our production was 350 megawatts, up 20% versus prior year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Also, our manufacturing team recently achieved a significant milestone by producing a cumulative three gigawatts of PV panels. The annual capacity per line increased to 59.6 megawatts. Our conversion efficiency was 11.3%, which is 3/10 of a percentage point improvement year-over-year. Our manufacturing cost per watt was $0.77, which is down $0.08 or 10% year-over-year and up $0.01 over Q2 of this year. 
During the quarter, we started to qualify process changes to increase our Module conversion efficiency that impacted our cost per watt by reducing yield and equipment uptime. We recently announced plans for two new four line manufacturing locations with 477 megawatts of the annual run rate capacity in 2012. The specific location of the U.S. from Vietnam facilities will be finalized and announced at a later date. Both of these sites are planned to have enough land to accommodate additional production capacity that we can build out in the future depending on market demand.
Moving on to Page 7. In terms of the market, we've made progress in several areas. We completed the Sarnia 60 megawatt expansion in the quarter and construction on both the 30 megawatt Cimarron and 48 megawatt Copper Mountain facility is progressing very well. The 290 megawatt Agua Caliente project is fully permitted and initial construction has begun. And the PNM resources received PUC approval for 22 megawatt of projects in New Mexico for which First Solar is the EPC contractor and the Module supplier. Initial construction is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2011.
We also achieved a number of milestones in developing our project portfolio. The CPUC approved SCE's [Southern California Edison] request for the 250 megawatt Sunlight and 300 megawatt Stateline power purchase agreements, and as well, PG&E received approval for their 300 megawatt Sunlight PPA. 
The 230 megawatt AV Solar Ranch project received approval of its final environmental impact report and conditional use permit from L.A. County in September. However, an appeal of this permit approval was filed with the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. We hope to resolve the appeal without any substantive delay to the project but do not yet know if it will result in a delay.
At Silver State North 50 megawatt project received its right of away grant from the Bureau of Land Management to proceed with construction. This grant is subject to a 30-day appeal period. 
In Europe, we constructed 380 megawatts of new Module volumes for 2011 under our existing framework agreements with seven of our customers. When combined with our North American projects, this gives us good visibility to 2011 in demand and our production is well contracted. A majority of our pricing is set for 2011 at levels to drive sell-through.
First Solar's Australia Solar Flagship submission with Tru Energy for 180 megawatt AC plant in Victoria was selected by the Victorian Government, who is also committed $100 million of complementary state funding. The project still needs to receive a federal government award to proceed. But if successful, we could start supplying Modules to Australia in 2012. 
We made progress on Phase I of our 30 megawatt Ordos project in China. We received approval of the pre-feasibility study from the National Energy Administration, and we continue our economic discussions with the government of inner Mongolia.
On Page 8, you can see progress made on three of our North American projects. The Sarnia 60 (sic) [80] megawatt expansion was completed in August and is now the world's largest operating solar PV system at 80 megawatts. The link you see in the slide will take you to a short video which provides a better view of the scope of the project. In addition to pictures you see here at the El Dorado and Cimarron project, showed that we are approaching completion and a substantial portion of these sites are already producing power.
On Page 9, we've updated the analyst's consensus of the global PV market through 2012. The growth in Germany driven by the FiT reduction has increased expectations for 2010 to 13.5 gigawatt, with a modest growth rate of approximately 11% in 2011 to  15 gigawatt. 
The market is forecasted to continued diversification in 2011 and the German market is expected to decline from 7.2 gigawatt in 2010 to 5.9 gigawatt in 2011. Recent enthusiasm about the 2011 European demand should be tempered by a few risk factors, which I will discuss in just a moment. The overall industry is expected to grow at a 33% compound annual growth rate from seven gigawatts in 2009 to 17 gigawatts in 2012. The market will also continue to diversify globally.
On Page 10, First Solar continues to execute on our strategy for growing the market and geographic expansion. In the third quarter, the German portion of our net sales declined from approximately 77% to 29% year-over-year and from 50% in Q2 of this year.  North America became the largest contributor to net sales primarily due to the completion of the Sarnia project. We expect the German portion of our revenue to decline from about 45% in 2010 to between 25% and 30% in 2011. We continue to work with our partners and through the execution of our captive pipeline to grow the markets in the U.S., France, Italy, Australia and the rest of the world. Based on consensus expectations for the market, First Solar expects to have a greater percentage of our sales in non-German, European and North American countries than the industry in 2011.
Let's spend a couple of moments now talking about the specific markets and how they relate to First Solar's growth strategy. The European markets are finishing strong in 2010, and we are essentially sold out to the remainder of the year. Germany, France, Italy, Spain and other European countries continue to reduce FiTs toward great parity which is driving the demand growth that we see. There is a potential for a softer market in Germany in 2011 as the industry adjusts to the lower feed-in tariff and there is a possibility of further government action at the EEG and power grid is under review in 2011. The Italian market should have strong growth in 2011 given the implementation of the new feed-in tariffs there. France and Spain FiT reviews could impact 2011 economics and market opportunity.
So given all those things, we've taken a number of steps to mitigate these uncertainties. Number one, we've implemented price adjustments in Europe that we believe positions us positively for 2011. Number two, we're incenting our partners to continue to diversify across Europe and other transition markets to grow the industry. Three, as we have in 2010, we plan to use our two gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. And four, we continued to invest to drive the lowest LCOE [Levelized Cost of Electricity] and maximum energy yield. The North American market driven by renewable portfolio standards, the ITC in cash grant, DOE loan guarantees and attractive ROE economics for supporting strong growth that could double the market to two gigawatts in 2011.  Utilities are beginning to adopt solar PV technology and realize large-scale PV power plants. We've been working with the industry to promote extension of the ITC cash grant and DOE loan program beyond expiration to support project economics. 
The California market has been driven by the 20% RPS by 2010 mandate, which fully supports our existing two gigawatt of contracted pipeline. Future incremental growth is likely to be driven by the 33% by 2020 renewables target. Currently, there is an uncertainty around the sustainability of the 33% goal, given a November state ballot initiative, but there is also the opportunity to convert it from regulation to law.
To expand U.S. market beyond California, we have been working to drive policy in other states and expand our channels to market. Meanwhile, the number of utilities pursuing development and project ownership is continuing to grow. We continue to develop our pipeline of projects and secure the necessary permits. To mitigate the inherent risk of project development, we are managing the pipeline as a portfolio where some are realized, get revised, have delays or canceled and new ones are added. In 2011, we plan to start building plants over 200 megawatt in size.
We are also focused on investing to reduce system LCOE and maximize plant performance and reliability. The goal being to achieve parity with combined cycle gas peaking generation. This will expand our market opportunity and lessen the dependency on policies and subsidies. 
The Chinese government views the development of a low carbon economy with a focus on renewable energy generation and energy efficiency as a top priority. In addition, the electricity demand expected to double between 2010 and 2020. If Chinese are committed to a goal to build a multi-gigawatt per year solar market and at least 20 gigawatt by the year 2020. Although the market has long-term potential, the systems providers needs sustainable economics to drive growth. China recently completed a 280 megawatt concessionary bidding process that provided very low prices and IRRs.
As we discussed last quarter, due to these delays in receiving the energy price on Phase 1 of the Ordos project, construction is not expected to begin until early 2011. First Solar is committed to building a long-term presence, and we are building relationships at the regional and provincial level. We recently received the pre-feasibility study approval from the national government for the Ordos Phase 1 30 megawatt project and opened our office in Beijing. We're also working on several other potential projects across China. We are hopeful that China can be a very large, sustainable market that First Solar can participate in.
In India, India has the potential to become a very large market. It is rapidly growing economy, and the electricity deficit is expected to drive strong demand for new generation for many years. India has an excellent solar resource and PV technology is a great fit for the country. Federal and state government programs are driving an acceleration in PV deployment, with the national solar mission objective of 22 gigawatt by the year 2022. We are investing resources in time to help the Indian market realized its full potential and are working with partners to deploy several projects in 2011.
Finally, Australia has excellent solar resource, site availability and policy support to drive project development. The Federal Government Solar Flagship Program and state feed-in tariffs are promoting market growth. We are participating in both of these programs.
Although the solar markets and government policies continued to evolve, First Solar's growth strategy remains the same. We are focused on our mission, which is to enable a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity by driving the LCOE of solar power to parity with fossil fuel peaking and ensuring that system owners achieve an acceptable ROE. Our goal continues to be $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour to compete with peaking assets by combined cycle gas generation. Our decisions are guided by the goal of earning a RONA that exceeds our weighted average cost to capital by at least 5%. We intend to lead the industry from the existing subsidized markets through transition markets to large sustainable markets based on economics and minimal subsidies. 
Our strategy in existing feed-in tariff's subsidized market is to price for the long term to grow penetration, enable throughput and to scale production costs. Our marketing and pricing strategy is not to be opportunistic for the short-term margin gain. For instance, the majority of our 2011 production is now sold and price set under our existing framework contracts for North American PPAs.
We have been working to develop transition markets that have good gradients and/or a strong potential to achieve price parity over time. Some of these markets include the U.S., France and Italy. In transition markets, our approach is to drive down LCOE by pricing in anticipation of cost declines, add solutions that drive technology adoption and energy yield and add capacity that develops markets or lowers costs. We are investing a significant portion of our revenues in R&D, process development and CapEx. Over the long term, we believe several of the transition markets can become sustainable economically, with solar PV at price parity. To lead in sustainable markets, we are focused on reducing system solution, LCOE costs to the level of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour with minimal subsidies and integrating into the grid.
We expect to add further production capacity and build integrated solutions to access the large peak electricity market. To support our growth strategy, we illustrate on Slide 13 that we are in the process of significant capacity expansions that will add 22 new production lines or 1.3 gigawatt of new capacity by 2012 at our current run rates. This is planned to nearly double our current annual capacity by 2012 to 2.7 gigawatt. This new capacity will enable First Solar to meet increasingly diversified global demand for our modules while balancing our global supply base as we extend our cost leadership. We are confident in our ability to scale, and we have a strong track record of execution.
Our expansion of the Malaysian facility is going well. Malaysia Plant 5 is expected to ramp in the first quarter and Plant 6 is planned to ramp in the second quarter of 2011. The Frankfurt-Oder plant expansion is on schedule and production is planned for the fourth quarter of 2011. For the Blanquefort French plant construction, it's planned to begin in the current quarter, and we recently began hiring site management. The new U.S. and Vietnam factories are expected to ramp production during 2012, adding 477 megawatts of annual capacity at today's line run rate.
In summary, we delivered a solid Q3 results with record revenues and operating income. The solar market is finishing strong in 2010 and First Solar has made significant progress in diversifying geographically and focusing and developing the markets that are in transition. We continue to execute our mission and growth strategy. The operations team is executing very well on the expansions in Malaysia, Germany and France. We announced more expansion in the U.S. and Vietnam that we expect to almost double capacity by the end of 2012 to support our growth. We made significant progress in our Systems business and project construction, signed a 380 megawatt of incremental European contracted volumes for the year 2011, and First Solar's 2011 demand is strong and well contracted with the majority of pricing being already set.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff who will discuss the third quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2010. Jens?"
4593731,114667325,83072,"First Solar, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the third quarter, we experienced strong demand led by growing sales in our Systems business and by continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the third quarter was $797.9 million, a sequential incr",1272,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the third quarter, we experienced strong demand led by growing sales in our Systems business and by continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the third quarter was $797.9 million, a sequential increase of $210 million or 36% compared to the second quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily driven by the completion of and revenue recognition for the 60 megawatt AC Sarnia Phase 2 Project and by a continued percentage of completion recognition for the Copper Mountain and Cimarron project, partially offset by a decrease in Module average sales prices. 
EPC revenue mix increased from 15% of total net sales in the second quarter to 28% in the third quarter. The blended effective exchange rate in the third quarter declined 3.7% sequentially to $1.31 per euro but remained above the average spot rate during the quarter as we continued the consistent execution of our hedging program.
We produced 350 megawatts during the third quarter, up 2% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven in part by the 1% improvement in the annual line run rate to 59.6 megawatt. We recognized revenue for more megawatts that produced during the third quarter as we met the revenue recognition criteria for the Sarnia Phase 2. 
Module cost per watt produced for the third quarter was $0.77, up 1% sequentially. During the third quarter, we started the qualification of certain trough exchanges that tended to result in future conversion efficiency, improvement in throughput gains, which impacted line on rates and cost per watt unfavorably. As a result, core manufacturing cost per watt increased by $0.01 quarter-over-quarter to $0.75 per watt.
Third quarter gross margin was 40.3%, down eight percentage points from the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of increased EPC system mix, impacting margins by approximately the full eight percentage points alone but also by FX and lower Module ASPs and higher cost per watt, which were offset by higher conversion efficiency in nonrecurring Q2 manufacturing expenses. Module gross margins were 49.1% during the third quarter of 2010 and negatively impacted by FX declining average sales prices mix and the increase in cost per watt.
Operating expenses were up $6.6 million quarter-over-quarter due to expenses related to the restructuring of certain office leases, the write down of project assets and our SAP implementation. Operating income for the third quarter was $211.6 million compared to $180.5 million in the second quarter due to the increase in total net sales. Operating margin for the quarter was 26.5% compared to 30.7% in the prior quarter due to the mixed impact of higher EPC system revenues. Net income was $176.9 million or $2.04 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 16.9% for the third quarter.
In the third quarter, we recorded a onetime income tax provision of $14.7 million, which negatively impacted our fully diluted earnings per share by $0.17. This was caused by our decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries in advance of the change in the U.S. tax law that would limit our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit in the future. Excluding that impact, EPS for the quarter would have been $2.21.
In the third quarter, we generated $230 million of free cash flows with operating cash flows of $248 million due to the receipt of payment for Sarnia Phase 2. During the third quarter, operating cash flows were negatively impacted by $102 million due to the U.S. GAAP requirement to present that amount as a reduction of cash flows from operating activities for the excess tax benefits resulting from our decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings, with an offset to cash providers for financing activities for the same amount. We spent $138 million for capital expenditures against depreciation of $37 million.
Cash and all other marketable securities increased by $37 million quarter-over-quarter to $997 million despite the cash payment of $296.7 million for the NextLight acquisition. Debt increase by $112 million to $250 million as we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility. As reported previously, First Solar increased its facility from $300 million to $600 million this month while also increasing its term from three to five years. Our debt to equity ratio remains low at 8%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We have increased our euro spot exchange rate assumption from $1.20 to $1.35 per euro. For the fourth quarter, approximately 77% of our expected net sales and 92% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate of $1.33. As of today, the $0.01 change in the euro spot rate impacts revenue by about $1 million and net income by about $500,000. The impact of the NextLight acquisition to full year 2010 guidance remains unchanged at $0.09 to $0.10 per share diluted. 
We plan to begin shipments from KLM 5 in the first quarter and KLM 6 in the second quarter of 2011. Capital spending, includes KLM Plants 5 and 6, Frankfurt-Oder Plant 2 and Blanquefort, France. First quarter pricing is set to reflect the reduced the feed-in tariff in Germany. Additionally, we have adjusted effectively, effective December of 2010, our pricing to position our channel partners for sell-through in 2011, an anticipation of the feed-in tariff decline from Germany and other European markets. 
I would like to briefly comment on our pricing strategy. Our pricing philosophy is guided by our mission to reduce the levelized cost of electricity to sustainable levels to drive sell-through and most importantly, to provide a predictable outlook and execution capability to our channel partners. This means that we do not adjust prices based on short-term market signals since the segments we serve have longer development cycle during which economic for projects are being established. We do not subscribe to near-term price hikes that increase subsidy burdens to ratepayers but instead focus on our mission to make solar PV affordable and subsidy independent.
Based on these assumptions and principles, we expect net sales to range from $2.58 billion to $2.61 billion; gross margins of 45% to 46%, up from prior guidance due to favorable foreign exchange trends and mix. 2010 Module gross margins are expected between 50% and 51% for the year. We expect plant startup costs of $18 million to $19 million primarily from Malaysia Plants 5 and 6, down from previously guided $20 million. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $95 million to $100 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold in line with prior guidance. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 28% to 29%, with Module operating margins of 34% to 35%, up from prior guidance. We expect our 2010 tax rate to be 13%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of 86 to 87 million shares. Earnings for fully diluted shares are increased to an estimated range of $7.50 to $7.65. This range includes the $0.17 onetime impact in the third quarter due to the income tax provision I described earlier.
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be $550 million to $600 million. Operating cash flow is predicted to be in the range of $595 million to $620 million, slightly higher than prior guidance but also incorporates the $100 million and $102 million reduction due to our repatriation decision discussed earlier. RONA guidance is at 19% at the high end of our prior guidance. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

We had strong quarter with net sales of $798 million, which is a 66% increase over Q3 of 2009. The quarter includes revenue recognition of the 60 megawatt Sarnia project. The net income was $177 million or 22.2% of net sales, and our diluted EPS was $2.04 a share. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.17 due to a $14.7 million charge onetime tax expense to repatriate $300 million in foreign earnings. Jens will describe the transaction during the financial portion of today's presentation.
The return on net assets was 20.4% on a four quarter rolling basis, representing an EBA of 8% or 300 basis points above our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $997 million is an increase by $37 million sequentially. We drew down $100 million of our revolver and paid for the NextLight acquisition in the quarter. 
Our production was 350 megawatts, up 20% versus prior year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Also, our manufacturing team recently achieved a significant milestone by producing a cumulative three gigawatts of PV panels. The annual capacity per line increased to 59.6 megawatts. Our conversion efficiency was 11.3%, which is 3/10 of a percentage point improvement year-over-year. Our manufacturing cost per watt was $0.77, which is down $0.08 or 10% year-over-year and up $0.01 over Q2 of this year. 
During the quarter, we started to qualify process changes to increase our Module conversion efficiency that impacted our cost per watt by reducing yield and equipment uptime. We recently announced plans for two new four line manufacturing locations with 477 megawatts of the annual run rate capacity in 2012. The specific location of the U.S. from Vietnam facilities will be finalized and announced at a later date. Both of these sites are planned to have enough land to accommodate additional production capacity that we can build out in the future depending on market demand.
Moving on to Page 7. In terms of the market, we've made progress in several areas. We completed the Sarnia 60 megawatt expansion in the quarter and construction on both the 30 megawatt Cimarron and 48 megawatt Copper Mountain facility is progressing very well. The 290 megawatt Agua Caliente project is fully permitted and initial construction has begun. And the PNM resources received PUC approval for 22 megawatt of projects in New Mexico for which First Solar is the EPC contractor and the Module supplier. Initial construction is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2011.
We also achieved a number of milestones in developing our project portfolio. The CPUC approved SCE's [Southern California Edison] request for the 250 megawatt Sunlight and 300 megawatt Stateline power purchase agreements, and as well, PG&E received approval for their 300 megawatt Sunlight PPA. 
The 230 megawatt AV Solar Ranch project received approval of its final environmental impact report and conditional use permit from L.A. County in September. However, an appeal of this permit approval was filed with the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. We hope to resolve the appeal without any substantive delay to the project but do not yet know if it will result in a delay.
At Silver State North 50 megawatt project received its right of away grant from the Bureau of Land Management to proceed with construction. This grant is subject to a 30-day appeal period. 
In Europe, we constructed 380 megawatts of new Module volumes for 2011 under our existing framework agreements with seven of our customers. When combined with our North American projects, this gives us good visibility to 2011 in demand and our production is well contracted. A majority of our pricing is set for 2011 at levels to drive sell-through.
First Solar's Australia Solar Flagship submission with Tru Energy for 180 megawatt AC plant in Victoria was selected by the Victorian Government, who is also committed $100 million of complementary state funding. The project still needs to receive a federal government award to proceed. But if successful, we could start supplying Modules to Australia in 2012. 
We made progress on Phase I of our 30 megawatt Ordos project in China. We received approval of the pre-feasibility study from the National Energy Administration, and we continue our economic discussions with the government of inner Mongolia.
On Page 8, you can see progress made on three of our North American projects. The Sarnia 60 (sic) [80] megawatt expansion was completed in August and is now the world's largest operating solar PV system at 80 megawatts. The link you see in the slide will take you to a short video which provides a better view of the scope of the project. In addition to pictures you see here at the El Dorado and Cimarron project, showed that we are approaching completion and a substantial portion of these sites are already producing power.
On Page 9, we've updated the analyst's consensus of the global PV market through 2012. The growth in Germany driven by the FiT reduction has increased expectations for 2010 to 13.5 gigawatt, with a modest growth rate of approximately 11% in 2011 to  15 gigawatt. 
The market is forecasted to continued diversification in 2011 and the German market is expected to decline from 7.2 gigawatt in 2010 to 5.9 gigawatt in 2011. Recent enthusiasm about the 2011 European demand should be tempered by a few risk factors, which I will discuss in just a moment. The overall industry is expected to grow at a 33% compound annual growth rate from seven gigawatts in 2009 to 17 gigawatts in 2012. The market will also continue to diversify globally.
On Page 10, First Solar continues to execute on our strategy for growing the market and geographic expansion. In the third quarter, the German portion of our net sales declined from approximately 77% to 29% year-over-year and from 50% in Q2 of this year.  North America became the largest contributor to net sales primarily due to the completion of the Sarnia project. We expect the German portion of our revenue to decline from about 45% in 2010 to between 25% and 30% in 2011. We continue to work with our partners and through the execution of our captive pipeline to grow the markets in the U.S., France, Italy, Australia and the rest of the world. Based on consensus expectations for the market, First Solar expects to have a greater percentage of our sales in non-German, European and North American countries than the industry in 2011.
Let's spend a couple of moments now talking about the specific markets and how they relate to First Solar's growth strategy. The European markets are finishing strong in 2010, and we are essentially sold out to the remainder of the year. Germany, France, Italy, Spain and other European countries continue to reduce FiTs toward great parity which is driving the demand growth that we see. There is a potential for a softer market in Germany in 2011 as the industry adjusts to the lower feed-in tariff and there is a possibility of further government action at the EEG and power grid is under review in 2011. The Italian market should have strong growth in 2011 given the implementation of the new feed-in tariffs there. France and Spain FiT reviews could impact 2011 economics and market opportunity.
So given all those things, we've taken a number of steps to mitigate these uncertainties. Number one, we've implemented price adjustments in Europe that we believe positions us positively for 2011. Number two, we're incenting our partners to continue to diversify across Europe and other transition markets to grow the industry. Three, as we have in 2010, we plan to use our two gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. And four, we continued to invest to drive the lowest LCOE [Levelized Cost of Electricity] and maximum energy yield. The North American market driven by renewable portfolio standards, the ITC in cash grant, DOE loan guarantees and attractive ROE economics for supporting strong growth that could double the market to two gigawatts in 2011.  Utilities are beginning to adopt solar PV technology and realize large-scale PV power plants. We've been working with the industry to promote extension of the ITC cash grant and DOE loan program beyond expiration to support project economics. 
The California market has been driven by the 20% RPS by 2010 mandate, which fully supports our existing two gigawatt of contracted pipeline. Future incremental growth is likely to be driven by the 33% by 2020 renewables target. Currently, there is an uncertainty around the sustainability of the 33% goal, given a November state ballot initiative, but there is also the opportunity to convert it from regulation to law.
To expand U.S. market beyond California, we have been working to drive policy in other states and expand our channels to market. Meanwhile, the number of utilities pursuing development and project ownership is continuing to grow. We continue to develop our pipeline of projects and secure the necessary permits. To mitigate the inherent risk of project development, we are managing the pipeline as a portfolio where some are realized, get revised, have delays or canceled and new ones are added. In 2011, we plan to start building plants over 200 megawatt in size.
We are also focused on investing to reduce system LCOE and maximize plant performance and reliability. The goal being to achieve parity with combined cycle gas peaking generation. This will expand our market opportunity and lessen the dependency on policies and subsidies. 
The Chinese government views the development of a low carbon economy with a focus on renewable energy generation and energy efficiency as a top priority. In addition, the electricity demand expected to double between 2010 and 2020. If Chinese are committed to a goal to build a multi-gigawatt per year solar market and at least 20 gigawatt by the year 2020. Although the market has long-term potential, the systems providers needs sustainable economics to drive growth. China recently completed a 280 megawatt concessionary bidding process that provided very low prices and IRRs.
As we discussed last quarter, due to these delays in receiving the energy price on Phase 1 of the Ordos project, construction is not expected to begin until early 2011. First Solar is committed to building a long-term presence, and we are building relationships at the regional and provincial level. We recently received the pre-feasibility study approval from the national government for the Ordos Phase 1 30 megawatt project and opened our office in Beijing. We're also working on several other potential projects across China. We are hopeful that China can be a very large, sustainable market that First Solar can participate in.
In India, India has the potential to become a very large market. It is rapidly growing economy, and the electricity deficit is expected to drive strong demand for new generation for many years. India has an excellent solar resource and PV technology is a great fit for the country. Federal and state government programs are driving an acceleration in PV deployment, with the national solar mission objective of 22 gigawatt by the year 2022. We are investing resources in time to help the Indian market realized its full potential and are working with partners to deploy several projects in 2011.
Finally, Australia has excellent solar resource, site availability and policy support to drive project development. The Federal Government Solar Flagship Program and state feed-in tariffs are promoting market growth. We are participating in both of these programs.
Although the solar markets and government policies continued to evolve, First Solar's growth strategy remains the same. We are focused on our mission, which is to enable a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity by driving the LCOE of solar power to parity with fossil fuel peaking and ensuring that system owners achieve an acceptable ROE. Our goal continues to be $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour to compete with peaking assets by combined cycle gas generation. Our decisions are guided by the goal of earning a RONA that exceeds our weighted average cost to capital by at least 5%. We intend to lead the industry from the existing subsidized markets through transition markets to large sustainable markets based on economics and minimal subsidies. 
Our strategy in existing feed-in tariff's subsidized market is to price for the long term to grow penetration, enable throughput and to scale production costs. Our marketing and pricing strategy is not to be opportunistic for the short-term margin gain. For instance, the majority of our 2011 production is now sold and price set under our existing framework contracts for North American PPAs.
We have been working to develop transition markets that have good gradients and/or a strong potential to achieve price parity over time. Some of these markets include the U.S., France and Italy. In transition markets, our approach is to drive down LCOE by pricing in anticipation of cost declines, add solutions that drive technology adoption and energy yield and add capacity that develops markets or lowers costs. We are investing a significant portion of our revenues in R&D, process development and CapEx. Over the long term, we believe several of the transition markets can become sustainable economically, with solar PV at price parity. To lead in sustainable markets, we are focused on reducing system solution, LCOE costs to the level of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour with minimal subsidies and integrating into the grid.
We expect to add further production capacity and build integrated solutions to access the large peak electricity market. To support our growth strategy, we illustrate on Slide 13 that we are in the process of significant capacity expansions that will add 22 new production lines or 1.3 gigawatt of new capacity by 2012 at our current run rates. This is planned to nearly double our current annual capacity by 2012 to 2.7 gigawatt. This new capacity will enable First Solar to meet increasingly diversified global demand for our modules while balancing our global supply base as we extend our cost leadership. We are confident in our ability to scale, and we have a strong track record of execution.
Our expansion of the Malaysian facility is going well. Malaysia Plant 5 is expected to ramp in the first quarter and Plant 6 is planned to ramp in the second quarter of 2011. The Frankfurt-Oder plant expansion is on schedule and production is planned for the fourth quarter of 2011. For the Blanquefort French plant construction, it's planned to begin in the current quarter, and we recently began hiring site management. The new U.S. and Vietnam factories are expected to ramp production during 2012, adding 477 megawatts of annual capacity at today's line run rate.
In summary, we delivered a solid Q3 results with record revenues and operating income. The solar market is finishing strong in 2010 and First Solar has made significant progress in diversifying geographically and focusing and developing the markets that are in transition. We continue to execute our mission and growth strategy. The operations team is executing very well on the expansions in Malaysia, Germany and France. We announced more expansion in the U.S. and Vietnam that we expect to almost double capacity by the end of 2012 to support our growth. We made significant progress in our Systems business and project construction, signed a 380 megawatt of incremental European contracted volumes for the year 2011, and First Solar's 2011 demand is strong and well contracted with the majority of pricing being already set.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff who will discuss the third quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2010. Jens?

4593731,114667325,83088,"First Solar, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the third quarter, we experienced strong demand led by growing sales in our Systems business and by continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the third quarter was $797.9 million, a sequential incr",1272,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the third quarter, we experienced strong demand led by growing sales in our Systems business and by continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the third quarter was $797.9 million, a sequential increase of $210 million or 36% compared to the second quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily driven by the completion of and revenue recognition for the 60 megawatt AC Sarnia Phase 2 Project and by a continued percentage of completion recognition for the Copper Mountain and Cimarron project, partially offset by a decrease in Module average sales prices. 
EPC revenue mix increased from 15% of total net sales in the second quarter to 28% in the third quarter. The blended effective exchange rate in the third quarter declined 3.7% sequentially to $1.31 per euro but remained above the average spot rate during the quarter as we continued the consistent execution of our hedging program.
We produced 350 megawatts during the third quarter, up 2% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven in part by the 1% improvement in the annual line run rate to 59.6 megawatt. We recognized revenue for more megawatts that produced during the third quarter as we met the revenue recognition criteria for the Sarnia Phase 2. 
Module cost per watt produced for the third quarter was $0.77, up 1% sequentially. During the third quarter, we started the qualification of certain trough exchanges that tended to result in future conversion efficiency, improvement in throughput gains, which impacted line on rates and cost per watt unfavorably. As a result, core manufacturing cost per watt increased by $0.01 quarter-over-quarter to $0.75 per watt.
Third quarter gross margin was 40.3%, down eight percentage points from the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of increased EPC system mix, impacting margins by approximately the full eight percentage points alone but also by FX and lower Module ASPs and higher cost per watt, which were offset by higher conversion efficiency in nonrecurring Q2 manufacturing expenses. Module gross margins were 49.1% during the third quarter of 2010 and negatively impacted by FX declining average sales prices mix and the increase in cost per watt.
Operating expenses were up $6.6 million quarter-over-quarter due to expenses related to the restructuring of certain office leases, the write down of project assets and our SAP implementation. Operating income for the third quarter was $211.6 million compared to $180.5 million in the second quarter due to the increase in total net sales. Operating margin for the quarter was 26.5% compared to 30.7% in the prior quarter due to the mixed impact of higher EPC system revenues. Net income was $176.9 million or $2.04 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 16.9% for the third quarter.
In the third quarter, we recorded a onetime income tax provision of $14.7 million, which negatively impacted our fully diluted earnings per share by $0.17. This was caused by our decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries in advance of the change in the U.S. tax law that would limit our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit in the future. Excluding that impact, EPS for the quarter would have been $2.21.
In the third quarter, we generated $230 million of free cash flows with operating cash flows of $248 million due to the receipt of payment for Sarnia Phase 2. During the third quarter, operating cash flows were negatively impacted by $102 million due to the U.S. GAAP requirement to present that amount as a reduction of cash flows from operating activities for the excess tax benefits resulting from our decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings, with an offset to cash providers for financing activities for the same amount. We spent $138 million for capital expenditures against depreciation of $37 million.
Cash and all other marketable securities increased by $37 million quarter-over-quarter to $997 million despite the cash payment of $296.7 million for the NextLight acquisition. Debt increase by $112 million to $250 million as we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility. As reported previously, First Solar increased its facility from $300 million to $600 million this month while also increasing its term from three to five years. Our debt to equity ratio remains low at 8%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We have increased our euro spot exchange rate assumption from $1.20 to $1.35 per euro. For the fourth quarter, approximately 77% of our expected net sales and 92% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate of $1.33. As of today, the $0.01 change in the euro spot rate impacts revenue by about $1 million and net income by about $500,000. The impact of the NextLight acquisition to full year 2010 guidance remains unchanged at $0.09 to $0.10 per share diluted. 
We plan to begin shipments from KLM 5 in the first quarter and KLM 6 in the second quarter of 2011. Capital spending, includes KLM Plants 5 and 6, Frankfurt-Oder Plant 2 and Blanquefort, France. First quarter pricing is set to reflect the reduced the feed-in tariff in Germany. Additionally, we have adjusted effectively, effective December of 2010, our pricing to position our channel partners for sell-through in 2011, an anticipation of the feed-in tariff decline from Germany and other European markets. 
I would like to briefly comment on our pricing strategy. Our pricing philosophy is guided by our mission to reduce the levelized cost of electricity to sustainable levels to drive sell-through and most importantly, to provide a predictable outlook and execution capability to our channel partners. This means that we do not adjust prices based on short-term market signals since the segments we serve have longer development cycle during which economic for projects are being established. We do not subscribe to near-term price hikes that increase subsidy burdens to ratepayers but instead focus on our mission to make solar PV affordable and subsidy independent.
Based on these assumptions and principles, we expect net sales to range from $2.58 billion to $2.61 billion; gross margins of 45% to 46%, up from prior guidance due to favorable foreign exchange trends and mix. 2010 Module gross margins are expected between 50% and 51% for the year. We expect plant startup costs of $18 million to $19 million primarily from Malaysia Plants 5 and 6, down from previously guided $20 million. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $95 million to $100 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold in line with prior guidance. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 28% to 29%, with Module operating margins of 34% to 35%, up from prior guidance. We expect our 2010 tax rate to be 13%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of 86 to 87 million shares. Earnings for fully diluted shares are increased to an estimated range of $7.50 to $7.65. This range includes the $0.17 onetime impact in the third quarter due to the income tax provision I described earlier.
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be $550 million to $600 million. Operating cash flow is predicted to be in the range of $595 million to $620 million, slightly higher than prior guidance but also incorporates the $100 million and $102 million reduction due to our repatriation decision discussed earlier. RONA guidance is at 19% at the high end of our prior guidance. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?

As you think about the economics and as you think about that a large portion of the portfolio that we are realizing or intend to realize in 2010 came through acquisitions, I'd like to remind you under our framework these acquisitions were made. These acquisitions were made by valuing the acquired assets against our RONA requirements and RONA thresholds, so which means that the project portfolio in aggregate, out of these acquisitions, meets or exceeds that return requirement. Now what it means on an individual project basis as you may have project in the portfolios that could exceed those requirements, and you could have some of them that possibly could slightly fall short, so you've got to look at the entire mix of project in aggregate. But yes, they would need that.

The repatriation actually was not more driven by the change in tax loss rather than by bringing the money back in the future time that will create adverse impact with respect to cost of such repatriation. If you look at the two separately, they're really not necessarily being seen together.

We had strong quarter with net sales of $798 million, which is a 66% increase over Q3 of 2009. The quarter includes revenue recognition of the 60 megawatt Sarnia project. The net income was $177 million or 22.2% of net sales, and our diluted EPS was $2.04 a share. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.17 due to a $14.7 million charge onetime tax expense to repatriate $300 million in foreign earnings. Jens will describe the transaction during the financial portion of today's presentation.
The return on net assets was 20.4% on a four-quarter rolling basis, representing an EBA of 8% or 300 basis points above our target. Our cash and marketable securities balance of $997 million is an increase by $37 million sequentially. We drew down $100 million of our revolver and paid for the NextLight acquisition in the quarter. 
Our production was 350 megawatts, up 20% versus prior year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Also, our manufacturing team recently achieved a significant milestone by producing a cumulative three gigawatts of PV panels. The annual capacity per line increased to 59.6 megawatts. Our conversion efficiency was 11.3%, which is 3/10 of a percentage point improvement year-over-year. Our manufacturing cost per watt was $0.77, which is down $0.08 or 10% year-over-year and up $0.01 over Q2 of this year. 
During the quarter, we started to qualify process changes to increase our Module conversion efficiency that impacted our cost per watt by reducing yield and equipment uptime. We recently announced plans for two new four line manufacturing locations with 477 megawatts of annual run rate capacity in 2012. The specific location of the U.S. and Vietnam facilities will be finalized and announced at a later date. Both of these sites are planned to have enough land to accommodate additional production capacity that we can build out in the future depending on market demand.
Moving on to Page 7. In terms of the market, we've made progress in several areas. We completed the Sarnia 60 megawatt expansion in the quarter and construction on both the 30 megawatt Cimarron and 48 megawatt Copper Mountain facilities is progressing very well. The 290 megawatt Agua Caliente project is fully permitted and initial construction has begun. And the PNM resources received PUC approval for 22 megawatt of projects in New Mexico for which First Solar is the EPC contractor and the Module supplier. Initial construction is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2011.
We also achieved a number of milestones in developing our project portfolio. The CPUC approved SCE's [Southern California Edison] request for the 250 megawatt Sunlight and 300 megawatt Stateline power purchase agreements, and as well, PG&E received approval for their 300 megawatt Sunlight PPA. 
The 230 megawatt AV Solar Ranch project received approval of its final environmental impact report and conditional use permit from L.A. County in September. However, an appeal of this permit approval was filed with the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. We hope to resolve the appeal without any substantive delay to the project but do not yet know if it will result in a delay.
At Silver State North 50 megawatt project received its right of away grant from the Bureau of Land Management to proceed with construction. This grant is subject to a 30-day appeal period. 
In Europe, we constructed 380 megawatts of new Module volumes for 2011 under our existing framework agreements with seven of our customers. When combined with our North American projects, this gives us good visibility to 2011 in demand and our production is well contracted. A majority of our pricing is set for 2011 at levels to drive sell-through.
First Solar's Australia Solar Flagship submission with TRUenergy for 180 megawatt AC plant in Victoria was selected by the Victorian Government, who has also committed $100 million of complementary state funding. The project still needs to receive a federal government award to proceed. But if successful, we could start supplying Modules to Australia in 2012. 
We made progress on Phase I of our 30 megawatt Ordos project in China. We received approval of the pre-feasibility study from the National Energy Administration, and we continue our economic discussions with the government of Inner Mongolia.
On Page 8, you can see progress made on three of our North American projects. The Sarnia 60 (sic) [80] megawatt expansion was completed in August and is now the world's largest operating solar PV system at 80 megawatts. The link you see in the slide will take you to a short video, which provides a better view of the scope of the project. In addition to pictures you see here at the El Dorado and Cimarron project, show that we are approaching completion and a substantial portion of these sites are already producing power.
On Page 9, we've updated the analyst's consensus of the global PV market through 2012. The growth in Germany driven by the FiT reduction has increased expectations for 2010 to 13.5 gigawatt, with a modest growth rate of approximately 11% in 2011 to 15 gigawatt. 
The market is forecasted to continued diversification in 2011 and the German market is expected to decline from 7.2 gigawatt in 2010 to 5.9 gigawatt in 2011. Recent enthusiasm about the 2011 European demand should be tempered by a few risk factors, which I will discuss in just a moment. The overall industry is expected to grow at a 33% compound annual growth rate from seven gigawatts in 2009 to 17 gigawatts in 2012. The market will also continue to diversify globally.
On Page 10, First Solar continues to execute on our strategy for growing the market and geographic expansion. In the third quarter, the German portion of our net sales declined from approximately 77% to 29% year-over-year and from 50% in Q2 of this year. North America became the largest contributor to net sales primarily due to the completion of the Sarnia project. We expect the German portion of our revenue to decline from about 45% in 2010 to between 25% and 30% in 2011. We continue to work with our partners and through the execution of our captive pipeline to grow the markets in the U.S., France, Italy, Australia and the rest of the world. Based on consensus expectations for the market, First Solar expects to have a greater percentage of our sales in non-German, European and North American countries than the industry in 2011.
Let's spend a couple of moments now talking about the specific markets and how they relate to First Solar's growth strategy. The European markets are finishing strong in 2010, and we are essentially sold out to the remainder of the year. Germany, France, Italy, Spain and other European countries continue to reduce FiTs toward great parity, which is driving the demand growth that we see. There is a potential for a softer market in Germany in 2011 as the industry adjusts to the lower feed-in tariff and there is a possibility of further government action as the EEG and power grid is under review in 2011. The Italian market should have strong growth in 2011 given the implementation of the new feed-in tariffs there. France and Spain FiT reviews could impact 2011 economics and market opportunity.
So given all those things, we've taken a number of steps to mitigate these uncertainties. Number one, we've implemented price adjustments in Europe that we believe positions us positively for 2011. Number two, we're incenting our partners to continue to diversify across Europe and other transition markets to grow the industry. Three, as we have in 2010, we plan to use our two gigawatt North American pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in Europe. And four, we continued to invest to drive the lowest LCOE [Levelized Cost of Electricity] and maximum energy yield. The North American market driven by renewable portfolio standards, the ITC in cash grant, DOE loan guarantees and attractive ROE economics for supporting strong growth that could double the market to two gigawatts in 2011. Utilities are beginning to adopt solar PV technology and realize large-scale PV power plants. We've been working with the industry to promote the extension of the ITC cash grant and DOE loan program beyond expiration to support project economics. 
The California market has been driven by the 20% RPS by 2010 mandate, which fully supports our existing two gigawatt of contracted pipeline. Future incremental growth is likely to be driven by the 33% by 2020 renewables target. Currently, there is an uncertainty around the sustainability of the 33% goal, given a November state ballot initiative, but there is also the opportunity to convert it from regulation to law.
To expand the U.S. market beyond California, we have been working to drive policy in other states and expand our channels to market. Meanwhile, the number of utilities pursuing development and project ownership is continuing to grow. We continue to develop our pipeline of projects and secure the necessary permits. To mitigate the inherent risk of project development, we are managing the pipeline as a portfolio where some are realized, get revised, have delays or are canceled and new ones are added. In 2011, we plan to start building plants over 200 megawatt in size.
We are also focused on investing to reduce system LCOE and maximize plant performance and reliability. The goal being to achieve parity with combined cycle gas peaking generation. This will expand our market opportunity and lessen the dependency on policies and subsidies. 
The Chinese government views the development of a low carbon economy with a focus on renewable energy generation and energy efficiency as a top priority. In addition, the electricity demand expected to double between 2010 and 2020. The Chinese are committed to a goal to build a multi-gigawatt per year solar market and at least 20 gigawatt by the year 2020. Although the market has long-term potential, the systems providers need sustainable economics to drive growth. China recently completed a 280 megawatt concessionary bidding process that provided very low prices and IRRs.
As we discussed last quarter, due to these delays in receiving the energy price on Phase 1 of the Ordos project, construction is not expected to begin until early 2011. First Solar is committed to building a long-term presence, and we are building relationships at the regional and provincial level. We recently received the pre-feasibility study approval from the national government for the Ordos Phase 1 30 megawatt project and opened our office in Beijing. We're also working on several other potential projects across China. We are hopeful that China can be a very large, sustainable market that First Solar can participate in.
In India, India has the potential to become a very large market. It is rapidly growing economy, and the electricity deficit is expected to drive strong demand for new generation for many years. India has an excellent solar resource and PV technology is a great fit for the country. Federal and state government programs are driving an acceleration in PV deployment, with the national solar mission objective of 22 gigawatt by the year 2022. We are investing resources and time to help the Indian market realized its full potential and are working with partners to deploy several projects in 2011.
Finally, Australia has excellent solar resource, site availability and policy support to drive project development. The Federal Government Solar Flagship Program and state feed-in tariffs are promoting market growth. We are participating in both of these programs.
Although the solar markets and government policies continued to evolve, First Solar's growth strategy remains the same. We are focused on our mission, which is to enable a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity by driving the LCOE of solar power to parity with fossil fuel peaking and ensuring that system owners achieve an acceptable ROE. Our goal continues to be $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour to compete with peaking assets by combined cycle gas generation. Our decisions are guided by the goal of earning a RONA that exceeds our weighted average cost to capital by at least 5%. We intend to lead the industry from the existing subsidized markets through transition markets to large sustainable markets based on economics and minimal subsidies. 
Our strategy in existing feed-in tariff's subsidized market is to price for the long term to grow penetration, enable throughput and to scale production costs. Our marketing and pricing strategy is not to be opportunistic for the short-term margin gain. For instance, the majority of our 2011 production is now sold and price set under our existing framework contracts for North American PPAs.
We have been working to develop transition markets that have good irradiance and/or a strong potential to achieve price parity over time. Some of these markets include the U.S., France and Italy. In transition markets, our approach is to drive down LCOE by pricing in anticipation of cost declines, add solutions that drive technology adoption and energy yield and add capacity that develops markets or lowers costs. We are investing a significant portion of our revenues in R&D, process development and CapEx. Over the long term, we believe several of the transition markets can become sustainable economically, with solar PV at price parity. To lead in sustainable markets, we are focused on reducing system solution, LCOE costs to the level of $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt hour with minimal subsidies and integrating into the grid.
We expect to add further production capacity and build integrated solutions to access the large peak electricity market. To support our growth strategy, we illustrate on Slide 13 that we are in the process of significant capacity expansions that will add 22 new production lines or 1.3 gigawatt of new capacity by 2012 at our current run rates. This is planned to nearly double our current annual capacity by 2012 to 2.7 gigawatt. This new capacity will enable First Solar to meet increasingly diversified global demand for our modules while balancing our global supply base as we extend our cost leadership. We are confident in our ability to scale, and we have a strong track record of execution.
Our expansion of the Malaysian facility is going well. Malaysia Plant 5 is expected to ramp in the first quarter and Plant 6 is planned to ramp in the second quarter of 2011. The Frankfurt-Oder plant expansion is on schedule and production is planned for the fourth quarter of 2011. For the Blanquefort, France plant construction, it's planned to begin in the current quarter, and we recently began hiring site management. The new U.S. and Vietnam factories are expected to ramp production during 2012, adding 477 megawatts of annual capacity at today's line run rate.
In summary, we delivered a solid Q3 results with record revenues and operating income. The solar market is finishing strong in 2010 and First Solar has made significant progress in diversifying geographically and focusing in developing the markets that are in transition. We continue to execute our mission and growth strategy. The operations team is executing very well on the expansions in Malaysia, Germany and France. We announced more expansion in the U.S. and Vietnam that we expect to almost double capacity by the end of 2012 to support our growth. We made significant progress in our Systems business and project construction, signed a 380 megawatt of incremental European contracted volumes for the year 2011, and First Solar's 2011 demand is strong and well contracted with the majority of pricing being already set.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jens Meyerhoff who will discuss the third quarter financial performance and updated guidance for 2010. Jens?"
4593731,114667325,83138,"First Solar, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","First Solar, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the third quarter, we experienced strong demand led by growing sales in our Systems business and by continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the third quarter was $797.9 million, a sequential incr",1272,"Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon. During the third quarter, we experienced strong demand led by growing sales in our Systems business and by continued strength in our Module business. Net sales for the third quarter was $797.9 million, a sequential increase of $210 million or 36% compared to the second quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily driven by the completion of and revenue recognition for the 60 megawatt AC Sarnia Phase 2 Project and by a continued percentage of completion recognition for the Copper Mountain and Cimarron project, partially offset by a decrease in Module average sales prices. 
EPC revenue mix increased from 15% of total net sales in the second quarter to 28% in the third quarter. The blended effective exchange rate in the third quarter declined 3.7% sequentially to $1.31 per euro but remained above the average spot rate during the quarter as we continued the consistent execution of our hedging program.
We produced 350 megawatts during the third quarter, up 2% compared to the prior quarter. The increase was driven in part by the 1% improvement in the annual line run rate to 59.6 megawatt. We recognized revenue for more megawatts that produced during the third quarter as we met the revenue recognition criteria for the Sarnia Phase 2. 
Module cost per watt produced for the third quarter was $0.77, up 1% sequentially. During the third quarter, we started the qualification of certain trough exchanges that tended to result in future conversion efficiency, improvement in throughput gains, which impacted line on rates and cost per watt unfavorably. As a result, core manufacturing cost per watt increased by $0.01 quarter-over-quarter to $0.75 per watt.
Third quarter gross margin was 40.3%, down eight percentage points from the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of increased EPC system mix, impacting margins by approximately the full eight percentage points alone but also by FX and lower Module ASPs and higher cost per watt, which were offset by higher conversion efficiency in nonrecurring Q2 manufacturing expenses. Module gross margins were 49.1% during the third quarter of 2010 and negatively impacted by FX declining average sales prices mix and the increase in cost per watt.
Operating expenses were up $6.6 million quarter-over-quarter due to expenses related to the restructuring of certain office leases, the write down of project assets and our SAP implementation. Operating income for the third quarter was $211.6 million compared to $180.5 million in the second quarter due to the increase in total net sales. Operating margin for the quarter was 26.5% compared to 30.7% in the prior quarter due to the mixed impact of higher EPC system revenues. Net income was $176.9 million or $2.04 per share on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 16.9% for the third quarter.
In the third quarter, we recorded a onetime income tax provision of $14.7 million, which negatively impacted our fully diluted earnings per share by $0.17. This was caused by our decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries in advance of the change in the U.S. tax law that would limit our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credits in the future. Excluding that impact, EPS for the quarter would have been $2.21.
In the third quarter, we generated $230 million of free cash flows with operating cash flows of $248 million due to the receipt of payment for Sarnia Phase 2. During the third quarter, operating cash flows were negatively impacted by $102 million due to the U.S. GAAP requirement to present that amount as a reduction of cash flows from operating activities for the extra tax benefits resulting from our decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings, with an offset to cash providers for financing activities for the same amount. We spent $138 million for capital expenditures against depreciation of $37 million.
Cash and all other marketable securities increased by $37 million quarter-over-quarter to $997 million despite the cash payment of $296.7 million for the NextLight acquisition. Debt increased by $112 million to $250 million as we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility. As reported previously, First Solar increased its facility from $300 million to $600 million this month while also increasing its term from three to five years. Our debt to equity ratio remains low at 8%.
This brings me to our updated guidance for 2010. We have made several key assumptions underlying our guidance. We have increased our euro spot exchange rate assumption from $1.20 to $1.35 per euro. For the fourth quarter, approximately 77% of our expected net sales and 92% of our expected net income exposed to the euro are hedged at an average rate of $1.33. As of today, the $0.01 change in the euro spot rate impacts revenue by about $1 million and net income by about $500,000. The impact of the NextLight acquisition to full year 2010 guidance remains unchanged at $0.09 to $0.10 per share diluted. 
We plan to begin shipments from KLM 5 in the first quarter and KLM 6 in the second quarter of 2011. Capital spending includes KLM Plants 5 and 6, Frankfurt-Oder Plant 2 and Blanquefort, France. Fourth quarter pricing is set to reflect the reduced the feed-in tariff in Germany. Additionally, we have adjusted effectively, effective December of 2010, our pricing to position our channel partners for sell-through in 2011, in anticipation of the feed-in tariff decline from Germany and other European markets. 
I would like to briefly comment on our pricing strategy. Our pricing philosophy is guided by our mission to reduce the levelized cost of electricity to sustainable levels to drive sell-through and most importantly, to provide a predictable outlook and execution capability to our channel partners. This means that we do not adjust prices based on short-term market signals since the segments we serve have longer development cycles during which economic for projects are being established. We do not subscribe to near-term price hikes that increase subsidy burdens to ratepayers but instead focus on our mission to make solar PV affordable and subsidy independent.
Based on these assumptions and principles, we expect net sales to range from $2.58 billion to $2.61 billion; gross margins of 45% to 46%, up from prior guidance due to favorable foreign exchange trends and mix. 2010 Module gross margins are expected between 50% and 51% for the year. We expect plant startup costs of $18 million to $19 million primarily from Malaysia Plants 5 and 6, down from previously guided $20 million. Stock-based compensation is estimated at $95 million to $100 million, with approximately 20% allocated to cost of goods sold in line with prior guidance. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 28% to 29%, with Module operating margins of 34% to 35%, up from prior guidance. We expect our 2010 tax rate to be 13%. We estimate year-end 2010 fully diluted share count of 86 to 87 million shares. Earnings for fully diluted shares are increased to an estimated range of $7.50 to $7.65. This range includes the $0.17 onetime impact in the third quarter due to the income tax provision I described earlier.
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be $550 million to $600 million. Operating cash flow is predicted to be in the range of $595 million to $620 million, slightly higher than prior guidance but also incorporates the $100 million and $102 million reduction due to our repatriation decision discussed earlier. RONA guidance is at 19% at the high end of our prior guidance. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

The shortest cycle would be Germany at eight to 12 kind of months. And as you move out of Germany, it can take as long as 48 months or more depending on where you're doing it. So really, we don't pay attention to the near-term or week-to-week type of pricing.
